His office said he was improving and was back on his feet although his recovery was still at an early stage. <br><br>Britain imposed a lockdown three weeks ago in a bid to curb the spread of the virus and the government has come under increasing pressure to detail how long the strict measures on movements would last, with people forced to stay at home and many businesses unable to operate. <br><br>Ministers have said Britain needed to pass the peak of the outbreak before changes could be made, and Hancock said although the number of hospital admissions had started to flatten out, there was not enough evidence yet to have confidence they were past the worst. <br><br>\u201cOur judgement is we\u2019re not there yet. We haven\u2019t seen a flattening enough to be able to say that we\u2019ve reached the peak,\u201d he told BBC radio. <br><br>Some scientists have suggested the peak might still be some weeks off but Hancock said \u201cnobody knows\u201d when it would be. <br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of suggestions. Their job is to make their best estimate and advise us and we have a whole load of different pieces of advice from different scientists,\u201d he said. <br><br>The death rate is also expected to increase over the next few days, health officials have cautioned, but they say they are hopeful that the lockdown will mean that the overall number of deaths will be below 20,000. <br><br>Initially Johnson took a more modest response to the outbreak than other European leaders but changed tack when projections suggested a quarter of a million people could die in the United Kingdom. <br><br>The government has come under fire for its initial response and a lack of preparedness, and there was criticism on Saturday from doctors and nurses who said they were having to treat patients without proper personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves. <br><br>Among those to have died after testing positive for COVID-19 are 19 health care workers including 11 doctors. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e917c4b8f08db3109f20a5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T08:15:35.026Z\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hello all.

Saudi Arabia has extended its curfew \u201cuntil further notice\u201d, the state new agency said early on Sunday morning. King Salman has previously ordered a curfew that took effect on 23 March, from 7pm to 6 am for 21 days, to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Last week Saudi Arabia placed its capital Riyadh and other big cities under a 24-hour curfew, locking down much of the population to stem the spread of the new coronavirus. A decision is expected soon on whether the annual Haj pilgrimage to Mecca will be cancelled. Thanks Molly. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and I\u2019ll be blogging for a short time before we close this blog and start a new one. More than 1,000 Australians are starting to arrive back home today after being left stranded in various parts of South America. Here are some of them getting off a plane at Melbourne airport as they begin two weeks quarantine. I\u2019m going to be handing over to my colleagues in Australia, but here\u2019s a summary of key events before I go. Thank you all for joining me over the past few hours. I hope that you are well and able to stay safe, wherever you are in the world. The global death toll has reached 108,281, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. For the first time in history, all 50 US states are now under disaster declarations, after Wyoming became the final state to announce. Pope Francis has urged people not to \u201cyield to fear\u201d at his Easter address. The event was scaled back due to coronavirus, with just two dozen attendees, a smaller choir, and no processions or baptisms. British prime minister Boris Johnson has said he owes his life to the NHS. He has been in hospital since Sunday night, and had spent three nights in intensive care. British opposition parties and senior Conservatives have united in calling on the British government to reopen Parliament. Seven African states have called on authorities to explain allegations of mistreatment of Africans in Guangzhou city. Many report having been evicted, tested for coronavirus several times without being given results and being shunned and discriminated against in public. The Kremlin have warned that Moscow\u2019s hospitals are under strain after a \u201chuge influx\u201d of coronavirus cases. The World Health Organization have warned that Belarus must take further action to combat coronavirus, as they enter a new phase of infection. Belarus are still hosting football games, and their President, Alexander Lukashenko, has downplayed restrictive measures. In recent weeks, he has said that drinking vodka and bathing in saunas could help fight the virus. Every night in New York, residents clap for essential workers at 7pm. Journalist Sophie Friedman shared this wonderful video of her neighbour in East Village, who stands on the roof every evening to play the bagpipes as part of the daily display of gratitude. This video is a lovely moment of light in these difficult times - I hope it makes you smile, as it did for me. \u201cThe highlight of the day for me and my neighbors in the East Village is the 7pm clap for essential workers. Several dozen of us go up onto our rooftops and just go wild: shaking tambourines, clapping, whooping, and banging on pots and pants, waving to each other, thanking essential workers for putting themselves on the line,\u201d said Friedman. \u201cMy neighbor directly across the street comes up to his roof right at 6:59 and then starts playing his bagpipes. This encouraged someone on my side of the street to start playing drums in tune with the bagpiper. This is the only time of the day most of us go outside and see other people, and the rooftop clapping has engendered a real sense of camaraderie.\u201d New York is the worst hit state in the US, which now has both the highest death toll and the highest number of cases of coronavirus in the world. The chair of the Parliamentary group on immigration detention in the UK has called for all detainees to be temporarily released after a rise in Covid-19 cases in removal centres. Alison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central and chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on immigration detention, asked the Home Secretary to immediately release all detainees due to the ongoing pandemic. It comes after a case of Covid-19 was confirmed at Brook House Immigration Removal Centre (IRC) close to Gatwick airport on April 7, Ms Thewliss said in a letter. This was the second case brought to the attention of the APPG following the first confirmed case at Yarl\u2019s Wood IRC on March 22. However, a High Court case brought by charity Detention Action last month heard there may be at least two further cases. SNP MP Ms Thewliss called the newest case \u201centirely avoidable\u201d and expressed her concern, particularly for detainees with pre-existing conditions. In a letter to the Home Secretary, Ms Thewliss wrote: \u201cThe confirmation of a new coronavirus case at Brook House demonstrates the danger detainees are continuing to be put in. \u201cNow more than ever, protection must be prioritised over immigration targets. IRCs are high risk for clusters of Covid-19 with staff providing a conduit for infection to and from the community.\u201d \u201cThe continued spread of the virus clearly highlights the very real risk of uncontrolled outbreaks at IRCs.\u201d The U.S. Air Force Air Thunderbirds conducted a flyover in celebration of frontline workers, flying past all the major hospitals throughout the Las Vegas valley. Brig. Gen. Robert Novotny said: \u201cWe were looking at how we could continue to fly and also give back to the community with a salute to the real heroes out there on the front lines who are keeping us safe from the virus.\u201d JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, one of the US\u2019 largest mortgage lenders, is raising borrowing standards this week for most new home loans, as it tries to mitigate lending risk caused by coronavirus. From Tuesday, customers applying for a new mortgage will need a credit score of at least 700, and will be required to make a down payment equal to 20% of the home\u2019s value. \u201cDue to the economic uncertainty, we are making temporary changes that will allow us to more closely focus on serving our existing customers,\u201d Amy Bonitatibus, chief marketing officer for JPMorgan Chase\u2019s home lending business, told Reuters. The changes will enable JPMorgan to reduce its exposure to borrowers who unexpectedly lose their job, suffer a decline in wages, or whose homes lose value. The bank said the change will also free up staff to handle a surge in mortgage refinance requests, which are taking longer to process due to staff working from home and non-essential businesses being closed.

Department store chain Macy\u2019s has hired investment bank Lazard Ltd to explore new options for improving its finances, as sales plunge due to coronavirus. Macy\u2019s has asked its advisers to help manage its liabilities and explore options that could include new financing, sources told Reuters news agency, adding that no debt restructuring is imminent. A spokeswoman for Macy\u2019s said in a statement that the company is \u201cexploring numerous options to strengthen our capital structure,\u201d adding that it maintains relationships with a range of advisers. British prime minister Boris Johnson has thanked NHS staff at St Thomas\u2019 Hospital in central London for saving his life while he underwent treatment in intensive care for coronavirus, PA news agency are reporting. Issuing a short statement as he continues his recovery, Johnson said: \u201cI can\u2019t thank them enough. I owe them my life.\u201d Johnson is spending his seventh night in hospital after being admitted last Sunday. He has spent three nights in intensive care and received non-intrusive oxygen supplies. You can read more about the British prime minister\u2019s time in hospital here: Brazil\u2019s deficit is fast approaching 500 billion reais ($96 billion), 7% of gross domestic product, compared to 61 billion reais, or 0.9% of GDP last year. This figure does not include the state aid proposal of up to 222 billion reais to tackle coronavirus, the economy ministry said on Saturday. \u201cIt is important that any new fiscal impact be discussed carefully to avoid an excessive growth of the primary deficit and public debt of the public sector beyond what is strictly necessary to reduce the economic and social impacts of the coronavirus crisis,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. Brazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro has balked at social distancing measures imposed by state governors and even his own health officials. He wants to see the economy re-started, arguing that extended shutdowns pose a greater risk than a disease he calls a \u201clittle cold.\u201d A British critical care nurse has warned that frontline health staff are \u201cdehydrated\u201d because they are skipping drinks in order not to waste personal protective equipment (PPE). The nurse, who asked to remain anonymous, said staff felt they were being \u201clied to\u201d about masks, and the situation was being handled \u201chorrendously\u201d. The health worker, from the North of England, hit back at suggestions staff were wasting equipment and said those working on her ward were afraid to take off their masks to drink, as this means they have to be thrown away, raising the risk of dehydration. She told the PA news agency: \u201cWe are being lied to about what masks we do and don\u2019t have, and they\u2019re hiding ones we are running out of.\u201d She said: \u201cWe can\u2019t eat or drink enough because we can\u2019t have water or snacks in the area and can\u2019t take masks off. \u201cAnd we\u2019re too scared to drink too much when we\u2019re out because if we need to go to the toilet then it means taking it all off again and wasting it, so we are all horribly dehydrated.\u201d The Government is facing a backlash after Health Secretary Matt Hancock called PPE a \u201cprecious resource\u201d and said it was important that healthcare workers use the \u201cright amount\u201d. Pope Francis urged people to \u201cnot yield to fear\u201d and focused on a \u201cmessage of hope\u201d as he led an Easter eve mass in an empty St Peter\u2019s Basilica tonight, reported Reuters, amid the coronavirus pandemic. The vigil, which normally takes place in a church packed with about 10,000 people, was attended by only about two dozen, including a few altar servers and a smaller-than-usual choir. Because of the coronavirus outbreak, it was scaled back to eliminate several traditional features, such as the baptism of adult converts and a long procession up the main aisle of the church. Senior health officials in the UK are facing demands to reveal how much has been spent on millions of inaccurate coronavirus antibody tests, after it emerged that payments had been guaranteed even if the kits failed to work. Read the full story here: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s election rival Benny Gantz has asked for additional time to try to form a government with the long-time leader, to end more than a year of political deadlock. A 28-day mandate to put together a governing coalition, following an inconclusive March 2 election, expires on April 14. Gantz, an ex-armed forces chief who heads the centrist Blue and White party, asked President Reuven Rivlin for a 14-day extension to the mandate. Gantz had run on a promise not to serve in a government with Netanyahu, citing the prime minister\u2019s indictment on corruption charges. Netanyahu denies those charges. But in a reversal that dismayed many of his supporters, Gantz said the coronavirus crisis had made a national emergency government with Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing Likud party an imperative. \u201cThe political, health and social crisis have brought me to the decision that even at a heavy political and personal price, I will do all I can to establish a government with the Likud,\u201d Gantz wrote in a letter to the president, published by his party. Rivlin gave no immediate word on whether he would grant more time to Gantz, who in his letter said the two political rivals appeared close to a final agreement. Opposition parties across the UK, alongside senior Conservatives, have united to demand that parliament be recalled. In a letter to the Leader of the Commons, newly elected Labour leader Keir Starmer demanded urgent talks with the Speaker, saying there was no substitute for parliamentary scrutiny\u201d particularly \u201cat this time of national crisis\u201d. You can read the full report from my colleagues here: Illinois has reported 81 new coronavirus deaths, bringing the state\u2019s total to 677. Lily Kuo speaks to residents in Wuhan, where coronavirus originated, as they celebrate the end of lockdown after being confined to their homes for three months. \u201cThe high-profile re-opening of Wuhan is meant to send a signal that China is getting back to business and work can be resumed. But despite the government efforts, people will be still very cautious,\u201d said Ho-Fung Hung, a lecturer in political economy at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cPeople can\u2019t easily forget the government\u2019s early missteps in causing the crisis, particularly for those who lost their loved ones or have their health severely impaired.\u201d Seven African countries have demanded that China address their concerns that Africans living in Guangzhou city are being mistreated and harassed. The countries claim that the African residents have been targeted out of fear that coronavirus could spread through imported cases. In recent days Africans in the city have reported being ejected from their apartments by their landlords, being tested for coronavirus several times without being given results and being shunned and discriminated against in public. Such complaints have been made in local media, and on social media. In a statement on Saturday, Ghana\u2019s minister of foreign affairs Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey said she had summoned the Chinese ambassador to express her disappointment and demand action to address the \u201cinhumane treatment.\u201d \u201cI regret and highly condemn this...ill-treament and racial discrimination,\u201d the minister said. She said she had summoned Ambassador Shi Ting Wang to \u201cregister my disappointment and call for his government to immediately address the situation and bring their officials to order.\u201d There was no immediate response from the Chinese Embassy in Ghana to a request for comment from news agency Reuters on this. In a tweeted statement on Saturday, the Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe dismissed the accusation of Chinese deliberately targeting Africans and suggested reports of racial discrimination and harassment were being sensationalised. \u201cIt is harmful to sensationalise isolated incidents,\u201d the statement said. \u201cChina treats all individuals in the country, Chinese and foreign alike, as equals.\u201d 550 crew members from the USS Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive for Covid-19, the US Navy have said in a statement. The ship gained international attention after its captain, Brett Crozier, was condemned and sacked by Donald Trump after he wrote a letter warning of the health risks posed to his crew as coronavirus spread on board. In case you missed it, this is a great interactive piece looking at the fall in air pollution in big cities around the world. A British nurse has died whilst self isolating at home, the NHS has confirmed. Julie Omar was a highly experienced trauma and orthopaedics nurse who had most recently been working as a sister on Ward 14 at Redditch\u2019s Alexandra Hospital, the Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said. In a message to colleagues, Trust chief executive Matthew Hopkins said the 52-year-old would be known to many staff at its Worcester site from her time with the trauma team there. Mr Hopkins\u2019 message read: \u201cIt is with great sorrow that I have to share with you the sad news that a much-loved member of our nursing team - Julie Omar - has died. \u201cJulie, who was just 52, had been self-isolating at home after developing symptoms of Covid-19, but sadly her condition deteriorated and she died at home yesterday (Friday) morning. \u201cShe leaves a husband and a grown-up daughter. \u201cWe have been asked by her family not to share any more details at this stage and we will of course respect those wishes.\u201d This photograph shows a deserted Rome. The area around the Coliseum, normally a tourist hotspot bursting with people, is almost empty. The husband of Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has shared a photograph of her attempting to cut her own hair. A very human insight into life in the highest echelons of Scottish politics! Polish politician Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski was apparently allowed to visit the grave of his mother despite the cemetery being closed to the public, Polish news organisation Fakt24 are reporting. Despite the government banning the visiting of graves, and signs on the cemetery announcing its closure, photographs appear to show that Kaczy\u0144ski travelled in a limousine with his entourage to visit the grave in Pow\u0105zki Cemetery in Warsaw yesterday. The linked article is in Polish, but the page should have an option to translate into English. Queen Elizabeth has told Britons that \u201ccoronavirus will not overcome\u201d the nation, in her Easter audio address. The 93-year-old monarch, who is the symbolic head of the Church of England, also stated that \u201cEaster isn\u2019t cancelled\u201d in her first ever address to mark the Christian holy day. She has said that the \u201cnew hope and fresh purpose\u201d of Easter is more applicable now than ever. You can read more here: Thanks to all those getting in touch.

I\u2019m keen to share some powerful photojournalism from around the world with you. The latest figures for France have just been released by the health ministry. They are as follows: There are now 93,790 confirmed cases of coronavirus in France. The number of deaths in hospital increased on Saturday to 8,943, up by 353 from the day before. The total number of coronavirus deaths now stands at 13,832. The number of people in intensive care fell to 6,883, from 7,004. Earlier we were told that the number of patients in intensive care had risen by 255 to 6,883, but have just received a correction from the Ministry to say they gave the incorrect figure - it fell to 6,883. Sorry for any confusion! New Jersey governor Murphy has signed an executive order directing public and private transport to cut their capacity to 50%, to reduce the spread of coronavirus. I\u2019ll update you as I find out more about what this means. A World Health Organization official has urged Belarus to impose new measures to contain coronavirus, as the country enters \u201ca new phase\u201d of the virus. President Alexander Lukashenko has been downplaying the need for restrictive measures, like social distancing, to stem the spread of the virus. In recent weeks, he has said that drinking vodka, driving tractors and bathing in a sauna could help fight it, and has been shown playing ice hockey matches and embracing other players. The country has continued to stage professional football games. Patrick O\u2019Connor, who led a WHO delegation in a visit to Belarus this week, said the country had implemented containment measures to detect patients with COVID-19 but that the virus had begun spreading through communities in the capital Minsk and in other parts of the country. Belarus has so far recorded 2,226 cases and 23 coronavirus-related deaths. \u201cBelarus is entering a new phase in the evolution of the outbreak,\u201d he told a news conference in Minsk. \u201cWe are seeing community transmission occurring... This situation is concerning and warrants new measures to be put into place.\u201d He said the WHO recommended that Belarus \u201cintroduce community-wide measures to increase physical distancing\u201d, and continue with isolation measures, testing and tracing the contacts of coronavirus patients. There are now 58,151 cases in New Jersey, governor Murphy has said, an increase of 3,599 from the day before. The death toll has increased by 251 from a day earlier, taking the total number of deaths to 2,183. Governor Murphy said there are currently 7,618 people in hospital, 1,746 in intensive care and 1,650 on ventilators. The death toll in Turkey has reached 1,101. The number of casualties of coronavirus rose by 95 on Saturday, with 5,138 new cases confirmed, the Health Minister has said. The Kremlin said that the \u201chuge influx\u201d of coronavirus patients was beginning to put a strain on Moscow\u2019s hospitals. Moscow and other regions have been in lockdown for almost two weeks, but the hospitals in the capital are still being stretched. The situation in both Moscow and St. Petersburg, but mostly in Moscow, is quite tense because the number of sick people is growing,\u201d Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview on state television, Russian news agencies reported. \u201cThere is a huge influx of patients. We are seeing hospitals in Moscow working extremely intensely, in heroic, emergency mode.\u201d A reporter with news agency Reuters said that they saw dozens of ambulances queuing outside a hospital dealing with coronavirus. One driver said he had been waiting for 15 hours to drop off a patient with suspected coronavirus. Russia has reported 13,584 cases of the virus, and the authorities said on Saturday that 12 new coronavirus-related deaths in the last day had pushed the casualty toll to 106. Here\u2019s a summary of the key points from today\u2019s press conference with New York governor Andrew Cuomo: The state recorded a further 783 deaths from coronavirus on Friday, taking the total death toll to 8,627. Hospitalisations and intensive care admissions in the state are continuing to decline. Cuomo said he knows that everyone wants to get out of the house, but \u201cthe worst thing that can happen is we make a misstep and we let our emotions get ahead of our logic\u201d and cause a second wave of coronavirus infections. Cuomo said that not going to Church and not celebrating Easter \u201cis different and hard\u201d but that it is the same message whether you do it from home or on television, and that that message is \u201cmore profound\u201d than ever. Earlier, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said public schools will remain closed for the rest of the year. Cuomo said he understands this position, but says there has been no decision on the reopening of schools in the wider state. No decision has been made on when businesses will reopen in the wider state, despite de Blasio saying they might open in May in New York City. The number in the deaths in the US has overtaken Italy, according to figures from Reuters, surpassing 19,600 on Saturday. Italy has the second highest number of deaths, and Spain third. It\u2019s important to note the US has five times the population of Italy and nearly seven times the population of Spain. The US has seen its highest death tolls to date in the epidemic, with roughly 2,000 deaths a day reported for the last four days in a row. Here is the latest update on coronavirus in Italy, from my colleague Lorenzo Tondo in Palermo, who has been at the government\u2019s press briefing. Italy registered 619 more deaths from Covid-19 on Saturday \u2013 49 more than Friday. In total, 18,849 people have now died with the coronavirus here. The Civil Protection said 100.269 are currently infected with a daily increase of 1996 cases - 11 more than yesterday (+1,4%). Some 2.079 have recovered in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number to 32.534. The Civil Protection said the overall total of cases in Italy, including the deceased, the currently infected and those who have recovered, is now 152.271, up 4,694 on Saturday (+3,2% compared to Friday). On Friday, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the third extension of Italy\u2019s lockdown until 3 May, as the country is struggling to pull its economy through the coronavirus crisis. On Thursday, a messy compromise to unlock \u20ac500bn (\u00a3438bn) of EU support for countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic has been struck after Conte warned that the existence of the bloc was at stake. Italy\u2019s PM said described the compromise reached by the Eurogroup as \u201ca step forward, but not sufficient\u201d. Conte said his government had not given up on its drive for the European Union to issue Eurobonds to finance a common response to the economic crisis caused by outbreak. The Italian interior ministry issued a warning, on Saturday, about the risk that extremist groups may take advantage of the coronavirus emergency to carry out acts of revolt in the country. In a directive sent to the prefects, the interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, asked the police to intensify the checks, due to \u201cserious tensions\u2019\u2019 and the risk of \u2018\u2019riots by groups of extremists\u2019\u2019. Since the beginning of the crisis, numerous warnings have been issued by the authorities concerning the risk that criminal groups could take advantage of the crisis. Here\u2019s a summary of today\u2019s UK daily briefing on coronavirus, from the home secretary, Priti Patel, as it comes to a close. I\u2019ll update with any final points if necessary: 78,991 people have tested positive for Covid-19 across the UK, excluding Northern Ireland. 20,101 patients are in hospital in Great Britain who have tested positive. 9,875 people have now died, an increase of 917 on yesterday\u2019s figures. Patel launched a campaign to help victims of domestic abuse during lockdown, to signpost help and provide and extra \u00a32m for online support services and helplines. Patel said she was \u201csorry\u201d if health workers felt there had been failings in getting personal protective equipment to the frontline. There has been a stabilisation in the number of new cases, \u201cby and large\u201d this has levelled off, according to NHS England medical irector, Stephen Powis. Powis said coronavirus measures were a marathon not a sprint, when asked when they would be lifted. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chief\u2019s Council, said enforcement data from 37 forces reveal 1,084 fines have been issued in England and Wales up to 8 April. The council will publish enforcement data every fortnight throughout the crisis. Hewitt said initial figures from across UK police forces show a 21% fall in overall crime across the last four weeks, when compared with the same period last year. Patel warned people not to blow the police enforcement of coronavirus rules out of proportion based on a few social media posts. The home secretary said that the majority of police officers were following the guidance \u201creally well\u201d but would be \u201cunafraid to act\u201d if people put lives at risk by not doing the right thing. Hospitalisations and intensive care admissions in New York are continuing to decline, governor Andrew Cuomo has just said. There were 783 deaths recorded from coronavirus in New York on Friday, bringing the total in the state to 8,627. You can watch his press conference live here: I\u2019ll post a summary of what has been said after the press conference is over. The number of cases of coronavirus in Canada has risen to 22,559, up from 21,243 on 10 April, according to public health agency data. So far, there have been 600 deaths, an increase of 69 from Friday\u2019s figure. The British home secretary is currently giving the daily coronavirus briefing for the UK. You can watch that live here: Alternatively, you can follow live updates from my colleague Lucy Campbell here: I\u2019ll be posting a summary on this blog when it finishes. Hi everyone, I\u2019m Molly Blackall, taking over the blog for the next few hours. If you spot anything I miss, or want to get in touch, you can drop me a message on Twitter @mollyblackall. I won\u2019t be able to reply to everything, but will endeavour to read each one. Thanks in advance! The Netherlands has called for proposals to develop smartphone apps or software that could be used to help combat the coronavirus outbreak. In a statement, the health ministry announced it was looking for proposals on how to conduct \u201ccontract tracing\u201d of people who may have been exposed to the virus, while maintaining individual privacy. Finnish health authorities have reported that another 136 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the past day after approximately 3,100 were tested. More than 44,300 overall have been tested for the virus in the Nordic country, with 1,816 confirmed cases. In relation to the Finnish population of 5.5m people, the rate of cases is 53 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, the Finnish institute for health and welfare said. Forty-nine people have died from the disease and personal data has been published about 35 of those people. It said: The median age of the deceased is 81 years. There are two dead between the ages of 40 and 59, there are 11 between the ages of 60 and 79, and there are 22 over the age of 80. Of the dead, 69 per cent are men and 31 per cent are women. I am now handing the blog over to Mattha Busby. Thanks everyone for your comments, and thoughts today. The number of coronavirus cases detected in the US rose past half a million over the Easter weekend with 18,700 deaths, as president Donald Trump said the decision on when it was safe to reopen the country would be the biggest he had ever had to make. Public health experts said the death toll could spike to 200,000 over the summer if unprecedented stay-at-home orders, which have closed businesses and kept most Americans indoors, are lifted after 30 days. Trump, seeking re-election in November, has said he wants life to return to normal as soon as possible and that the sweeping restrictions on movement aimed at curbing the spread of the Covid-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus carry their own economic and public health cost. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to make a decision, and I ... hope to God that it\u2019s the right decision,\u201d he told reporters on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make.\u201d I am now moving to my last 30-minutes on the blog before I enjoy some state-mandated exercise outside. A big thanks to everyone who has sent me emails today. Your insight is always really useful and makes this job a lot easier. If you want to share any news tips with me, then please do via any of the channels below. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The Spanish government has defended its decision to allow some non-essential workers to return to their jobs in factories and construction sites this coming week despite warnings that any relaxation of confinement measures could lead to a rise in contagion. The World Health Organization has said there could be a \u201cdeadly resurgence\u201d of the coronavirus if countermeasures are lifted too soon, while one of the Spanish government\u2019s own experts has said he thought it would have been \u201csensible\u201d to keep non-essential workers at home for longer. Speaking on Saturday afternoon, the country\u2019s health minister, Salvador Illa, said Spain remained in strict lockdown and that people were only allowed out to go to work or to buy food or medicines. \u201cWe still have very, very drastic restrictions in place,\u201d he added. Illa said that the ban on non-essential workers leaving their homes to work had only ever been a temporary measure intended to reduce the pressure on Spain\u2019s overstretched intensive care units. The minister insisted that all decisions were \u201ctaken on the basis of consensus\u201d and said the government followed the recommendations of experts. Illa also said the current lockdown could go on for a few more weeks at least. \u201cAs the prime minister has already said, it\u2019s very probable that these measures will be in force beyond 26 April,\u201d he said. \u201cSpain is not de-escalating; we remain in lockdown.\u201d He said the government was following the disease\u2019s movement on a daily basis and adapting its response accordingly. \u201cWe are maintaining the current measures - and haven\u2019t ruled anything out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe information we have at the moment confirms a slowing down of the disease and the growth in new cases is much lower than it was last week, or two weeks ago, or a month ago. \u201cBut today we still have 4,830 new cases and that means we need to stay in lockdown. We know this is a big sacrifice for everyone, but it\u2019s one that has to be made. If the epidemic carries on going in the same direction, we may be able to alter the response, but it will always be done prudently, cautiously, and on the basis of the scientific evidence we have.\u201d The Spanish government has advised people to maintain careful social distancing as some of those who cannot work from home begin to resume their jobs. It has also said face-masks will be handed out at metro and rail stations. In Egypt, police used tear gas to disperse a group of villagers who tried to stop the burial of a physician who died from the Covid-19. The villagers feared the burial would spread contagion. Residents of the village of Shubra el-Bahou in the Nile Delta blocked the road to the cemetery to prevent the physician\u2019s burial, according to Egyptian officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to brief reporters. The physician died at a quarantined hospital in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia and her body was being transferred to her husband\u2019s village for burial. The officials said police fired tear gas after the villagers halted the ambulance carrying the body. There were no reports of any serious injuries. Ahmed el-Sayed, a village resident, said the police intervened after security and health officials failed to persuade the villagers to open the road. Egypt has reported 135 fatalities among about 1,800 confirmed cases. Iran has started reopening government offices after a brief nationwide lockdown to help contain the worst coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 4,300 people in the country. Authorities had ordered most government agencies and all non-essential businesses to remain closed for a week after the Nowruz holiday ended on 4 April. Government offices outside Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran, reopened Saturday with a third of all employees working from home, state media reported. Women who have young children were given priority in deciding who works remotely. Businesses in Tehran will be allowed to reopen next Saturday, provided they register with authorities and follow guidelines on social distancing set out by the health ministry. The health ministry meanwhile reported another 125 deaths, bringing the overall toll to 4,357. Iran has reported more than 70,000 confirmed cases, and authorities said more than 40,000 have recovered. For weeks, Iran declined to impose the kind of large-scale lockdowns adopted by other Middle Eastern countries, even as the number of confirmed cases and fatalities steadily climbed. Authorities have defended their response, saying they had to consider the economic impact of any quarantine measures, since the country is under severe US sanctions. The US has offered humanitarian aid to help Iran combat the outbreak but Iran\u2019s leaders have rejected it, instead demanding that the sanctions be lifted. European countries are trying to keep people from traveling as the weather heats up for Easter. In Asia, South Korea announced plans to strap tracking wristbands on people who defy quarantine orders. The Japanese government appealed to the public nationwide to avoid bars, clubs and restaurants, broadening a measure announced earlier for seven urban areas, including Tokyo. In Europe, Italian authorities stepped up checks, particularly around the northern Lombardy region, which has borne the brunt of the Covid-19 outbreak. Roadblocks were set up on main thoroughfares in and out of Milan and along highway exits to discourage people from going on holiday trips. \u201cDon\u2019t do silly things,\u201d said Domenico Arcuri, Italy\u2019s special commissioner for the virus emergency. \u201cDon\u2019t go out, continue to behave responsibly as you have done until today, use your head and your sense of responsibility.\u201d He added: \u201cThe virus has not been defeated, but we are on the right path. We see the indicators but not the end of the tunnel. In fact, the end of the tunnel is still far away.\u201d In Spain, which recorded its smallest day-to-day increase in deaths in nearly three weeks, of 510, police set up thousands of roadblocks around the country. In Britain, police were urged to keep a close watch on gatherings in parks and at the seaside on what was set to be the hottest day of the year. Police seized a motorcycle from a rider making a non-essential journey in central England. The New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, said on Saturday public schools will remain closed for the rest of the school year as the city battles the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. \u201cHaving to tell you that we cannot bring our schools back for the remainder of this school year is painful, but I can also tell you it is the right thing to do,\u201d he told a news conference. De Blasio had ordered public schools shut beginning March 16 to curb the spread of the disease, with an initial goal of reopening by 20 April. But the mayor said it soon became clear that date goal was unrealistic as the city emerged as a major US coronavirus hotspot. Singapore\u2019s health ministry has confirmed 191 new coronavirus cases, taking the total infections to 2,299. Elsewhere, the New York City mayor, Bill De Blasio, said public schools would remain closed for the remainder of the year. The Chinese customs agency has announced it will be doing quality control on certain medical items for export, including ventilators, hospital gowns and N95 respirators. The new policy follows complaints from some countries over the quality of the medical equipment that China has been sending out. It was announced by China\u2019s General Administration of Customs on Friday. Up until now, the agency has been solely responsible for checking numbers, intellectual property issues, and documents. From now on, they will also check the quality of consignments. There were immediate delays to exports, according to the New York Times, as manufacturers tried to understand how to comply. In Australia earlier this month, border forces began intercepting deliveries of some faulty Chinese equipment. Meanwhile, authorities in Spain, Turkey and the Netherlands said that some of the Chinese equipment they were receiving was below standard or defective. Traffic fatalities were down nearly 40% in France from last year thanks to nationwide coronavirus lockdown measures that have kept millions of cars, pedestrians and cyclists off the roads. France\u2019s 67 million citizens have been ordered to stay indoors since 17 March, with most people only permitted to leave the house for essentials outings. Cross-country travel is also restricted as the country seeks to halt the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 13,000 out of at least 124,000 infected. Interesting article today on the Guardian about how from Berlin to Bogot\u00e1, there are new footpaths and bike lanes as world cities turn their streets over to walkers and cyclists. The death toll from coronavirus in the UK rose by 917 to 9,875 people as of 4pm GMT on 10 April, health officials said on Saturday. \u2022 There are now more than 500,000 cases of coronavirus in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University. It also becomes the first country in the world to register more than 2,000 deaths from the virus in a single day, bringing its total death toll to more than 18,000. \u2022 Unclaimed victims are being buried in unmarked mass graves on Hart Island in New York, officials confirm. Authorities have used the site for more than 150 years to bury unclaimed bodies, unidentified people and residents whose families could not afford a private burial. \u2022 Some 103,000 people have died worldwide from the coronavirus in 193 countries and territories, according to an AFP tally at 1100 GMT Saturday based on official sources. There have been more than 1,700,770 reported infections. \u2022 Italy has had the highest death toll with 18,849, followed by the US, Spain with 16,353, France with 13,197 and Britain with 8,958. Spain has registered a fall in its daily death toll for a third consecutive day with 510 people dying in the last 24 hours. \u2022 The World Health Organization warns that prematurely lifting lockdown restrictions could spark a dangerous resurgence of the disease. Turkey ordered citizens to stay home for 48 hours across 31 cities including Istanbul and Ankara, starting midnight Friday. \u2022 Yemen has reported its first case, in a southern government-controlled province, raising fears of an outbreak in the war-torn country. \u2022 Google and Apple announce they have teamed up for a joint initiative to develop a coronavirus smartphone \u201ccontact tracing\u201d tool that could potentially alert people when they have crossed paths with an infected person. In England a further 823 people have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the death toll to 8,937. The patients were aged between 11 and 102 years old and 33 of the 823 patients (aged between 29 and 94 years old) had no known underlying health condition. Read more updates on the UK live blog. I am back from my lunch break. Please do keep getting in touch with news tips, information and insight from where you are. I cannot promise to reply to you all but it\u2019s always useful to see what issues you feel need raising. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Authorities across Europe are attempting to prevent people from travelling during the sunny Easter weather. Italian authorities have stepped up checks, particularly around the northern Lombardy region, which has borne the brunt of the outbreak, Reuters reported. Roadblocks were set up on main thoroughfares in and out of Milan and along highway exits to discourage people from going on holiday trips. Domenico Arcuri, Italy\u2019s special commissioner for the virus emergency, said: Don\u2019t do silly things.

In Spain, which recorded its smallest day-to-day increase in deaths in nearly three weeks, police set up thousands of roadblocks around the country. Some countries are already planning small first steps out of the shutdown and Austria aims to reopen small shops on Tuesday. Spain is preparing to start rolling back the strictest of its measures on Monday, when authorities will allow workers in some nonessential industries to return to factories and construction sites after a nearly complete two-week stoppage. Health minister Salvador Illa said the government will distribute reusable masks at subway stations and other public transportation hubs. \u201cWe think that with these measures we will prevent a jump in infections,\u201d he said. China is cracking down on publication of academic research about the origins of the novel coronavirus, in what is likely to be part of a wider attempt to control the narrative surrounding the pandemic, documents published online by Chinese universities appear to show. Two websites for leading Chinese universities appear to have recently published and then removed pages that reference a new policy requiring academic papers dealing with Covid-19 to undergo extra vetting before they are submitted for publication. Prof Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London, said the Chinese government had had a heavy focus on how the evolution and management of the virus is perceived since the early days of the outbreak. In terms of priority, controlling the narrative is more important than the public health or the economic fallout. It doesn\u2019t mean the economy and public health aren\u2019t important. But the narrative is paramount. New York City 911 emergency operators are picking up new calls every 15 seconds as the service is placed under unprecedented strain. The system in the US city is so overwhelmed, the Associated Press reported, and the city has started sending text and tweet alerts urging people to only call 911 for life-threatening emergencies. The Fire Department said it has averaged more than 5,500 ambulance requests each day, about 40% higher than usual, eclipsing the total call volume on September 11 2001. \u201cWhen you hang up with one call, another one needs to be attended to immediately,\u201d 911 operator Monique Brown said, \u201cthere\u2019s no time for a minutes rest.\u201d \u201cWe just pick up call after call after call,\u201d said paramedic Ravi Kailayanathan. Thanks Sarah. Boris Johnson\u2019s fiance, environmental campaigner and former Tory press officer Carrie Symonds, sent him letters and baby scans to lift his spirits during his time in intensive care, a Downing Street source has confirmed. He received daily updates, including images of their unborn child, as he struggled with coronavirus at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in central London. Symonds, who is due to give birth in two months, and has also been ill with coronavirus-like symptoms in recent weeks, has not been tested. The two have reportedly not seen each other since he was admitted to hospital. I am passing the live blog over to my colleague Mattha Busby now who will be running it for a short while so I can take a lunch break. Thanks everyone. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, is making \u201cvery good progress\u201d in his recovery from Covid-19, his office said on Saturday. Johnson was moved out of intensive care after three nights on Thursday, and Downing Street said on Friday he had managed to start walking, although his recovery was at an early stage. \u201cThe prime minister continues to make very good progress,\u201d a Downing Street spokeswoman said. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Netherlands rose by 1,316 on Saturday to 24,413, health authorities said, with 132 new deaths. The country\u2019s cumulative death toll is 2,643, the Netherlands\u2019 National Institute for Health (RIVM) said in its daily update. US becomes first country to report 2,000 deaths in a day The US recorded more than 2,000 coronavirus deaths, the first country to see such a high number in a single day. Figures from Johns Hopkins University show 2,108 people died in the past 24 hours, with more than half a million confirmed infections. America could soon surpass Italy as the country with the most coronavirus deaths worldwide. The news came as White House experts said the spread of the virus was starting to level off. Dr Deborah Birx said there were good signs the outbreak was stabilising but cautioned: \u201cAs encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak.\u201d The pandemic peak still to come in Britain Britain has not yet reached the Covid-19 peak, which would allow for an easing of lockdown restrictions, said the health secretary, Matt Hancock. The death toll in British hospitals has reached almost 9,000, with 980 more deaths reported on Friday. The figure exceeded the deadliest day so far in Italy, the country worst hit by the virus. Hancock said the Easter weekend would be a \u201ctest of the nation\u2019s resolve\u201d. He issued another warning to the public to stay at home amid the coronavirus crisis. Death toll in Spain falls for third day Spain\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll fell for the third consecutive day on Saturday after 510 fatalities were reported in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said in a statement. It marked the smallest overnight increase since 23 March. Total fatalities from the virus rose to 16,353, from 15,843 on Friday, the ministry said, while the number of confirmed cases climbed to 161,852 from 157,022. South Korea plans tracking wristbands South Korea has announced plans to strap tracking wristbands on people who ignore quarantine orders. Officials said stricter controls were required to enforce self-isolation rules. Some of the 57,000 people who are under orders to stay home have apparently slipped out by leaving behind their smartphones, which are used to monitor movement. India extends lockdown The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has decided to extend a nationwide lockdown to tackle the spread of the coronavirus, the Delhi chief minister said on Saturday. He did not say how long the extension would be. Earlier in the day, Modi held a video conference call with several state ministers. The Delhi chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, said Modi had \u201ctaken a correct decision to extend the lockdown\u201d, without sharing further details. Iran death toll rises to more than 4,000 Iran\u2019s total death toll from the coronavirus outbreak rose to 4,357 on Saturday, with 125 people having lost their lives in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said. The total number of people diagnosed with the disease rose by 1,837 in the past 24 hours to a total of 70,029, ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpur said, with 3,987 of those infected in critical condition. Iran is the country most affected by the pandemic in the Middle East. Thanks everyone, it\u2019s been a busy few hours of news updates and I will be posting a summary shortly. I really appreciate all your messages, especially the ones thanking The Guardian for providing you with information. Please do share any news tips. They are always welcome, and apologies if I cannot reply to you all. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com On Cyprus coronavirus may have offered a ray of light in reunification efforts for the war-divided country. Officials say the president on the island\u2019s internationally recognised Greek south, Nicos Anastasiades, agreed to send vital medicines and other materials to the breakaway Turkish-run north after holding talks with the state\u2019s leader, Mustafa Ak\u0131nc\u0131. In a statement, government spokesman Kyriakos Kousios said the two men underlined the need to reinforce the bi-communal technical health committee on which experts from both sides sit in an effort to contain the spread of the highly contagious virus. The move was immediately welcomed by those who support the reunification of Cyprus, split since 1974 when a coup aimed at union with Greece, and orchestrated in Athens, prompted Turkey to invade and seize the island\u2019s northern third. Anastasiades has enforced a stringent lockdown in the south including a night curfew. On Friday the Greek Cypriot health ministry announced that the overnight tally of confirmed coronavirus cases had risen by 31, bringing the total number to 595. To date there have been nine Covid-19 related deaths in the south. Similar measures have been taken in the north where Ak\u0131nc\u0131, a moderate, was cited as saying on Thursday that the outbreak was \u201creaching a plateau but it\u2019s not over yet and we mustn\u2019t relax the measures we have taken\u201d. Three people have died from Covid-19 in the north which on Friday identified three new cases of the virus bringing the total to 99. A dispatch below from Lorenzo Tondo in Palermo As prime minister Giuseppe Conte announced the third extension of Italy\u2019s lockdown until 3 May, the Italian interior ministry issued a warning, on Saturday, about the risk that extremist groups may take advantage of the coronavirus emergency to carry out acts of revolt in the country. In a directive sent to the prefects, the interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, asked the police to intensify the checks, due to \u201cserious tensions\u2019\u2019 and the risk of \u201criots by groups of extremists\u2019\u2019. Since the beginning of the crisis, numerous warnings have been issued by the authorities concerning the risk that criminal groups could take advantage of the crisis. As Italy struggles to pull its economy through the coronavirus crisis, the Mafia is gaining local support by distributing free food to poor families in quarantine who have run out of cash, authorities have warned. In recent weeks, videos have surfaced of known Mafia gangs delivering essential goods to Italians hit hard by the coronavirus emergency in the districts of Palermo and Naples. The ramifications of the lockdown in Italy are affecting the estimated 3.3 million people in Italy who work off the books. Of those, more than 1 million live in the south, according to the most recent figures from CGIA Mestre, a Venice-based small business association. There have been reports of small shop owners being pressured to give food for free, while police are patrolling supermarkets in some areas to stop thefts. Videos of people in Sicily protesting against the government\u2019s stalled response, or people beating their fists outside banks in Bari for a \u20ac50 (\u00a344) loan are going viral and throwing fuel on the crisis; a fire the mafia is more than willing to stoke. The Swiss death toll from the coronavirus has reached 831, the country\u2019s public health ministry has said, rising from 805 people on Friday. The number of positive tests also increased to 24,900 from 24,308 on Friday, it said. An inmate was found dead on Saturday after a riot and a blaze swept through a Russian prison under a coronavirus lockdown in eastern Siberia, authorities said. Trouble erupted at penal colony No 15 in Angarsk on Thursday with authorities blaming prisoners, while human rights activists said inmates self-harmed en masse to protest systematic mistreatment. On Friday, the work yard of the colony was engulfed in flames as riot police cordoned off roads leading to the prison, turning away independent observers. The fire was extinguished by Saturday morning. \u201cWhen they cleared the debris, they found the body of an inmate,\u201d said Irkutsk region rights ombudsman Viktor Ignatenko, quoted by Interfax news agency. \u201cIt was a violent death.\u201d The regional penal service issued a statement late on Friday saying the situation was under control and investigators were on site after \u201cinmates set several buildings in the work yard on fire\u201d. Armenia has extended the state of emergency by another 30 days. It declared the measures last month to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has so far infected nearly 1,000 people. Armenia has closed educational institutions, halted all public transportation and barred foreigners from entering. The former Soviet country, which has population of 3 million, has also said it will postpone a referendum on changes to the constitutional court until after the emergency. The decision to extend the state of emergency, announced by Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, is expected to be formally approved by parliament next week. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has decided to extend a nationwide lockdown to tackle the spread of the coronavirus, the Delhi state\u2019s chief minister said on Saturday, without saying how long the extension would be. Modi earlier in the day held a video conference call with several state ministers. Delhi chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, said Modi had \u201ctaken a correct decision to extend the lockdown\u201d, without sharing further details. \u201cIf it is stopped now, all gains would be lost. To consolidate, it is imp (important) to extend it,\u201d Kejriwal said on Twitter. India\u2019s 21-day lockdown ends on Tuesday but several states had urged Modi to extend it further, even as concerns have risen that the shutdown has put millions of poor people out of work and forced an exodus of migrant workers from cities to villages. Thanks everyone who has been sending over emails with news tips and thoughts. It\u2019s very much appreciated. I\u2019ve also had a few cat pictures sent my way (also much appreciated). Please do continue to get in touch as I bring you the latest developments of the day. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The coronavirus pandemic has crippled major retailers and small shops worldwide, but it may also be making a dent in illicit business. In Chicago, one of the most violent places in the US, drug arrests in the weeks since the city shut down are down by 42% compared with the same period last year. Some criminal lawyers say part of the reason is that dealers have no choice but to wait out the economic slump. \u201cThe feedback I\u2019m getting is that they aren\u2019t able to move, to sell anything anywhere,\u201d said Joseph Lopez, a lawyer in Chicago who represents drug dealers. Overall, Chicago\u2019s crime has declined by 10% since the pandemic struck, a trend that is playing out globally. Fewer people are being killed and fewer robberies are taking place. Still, law enforcement officials worry about a surge of unreported domestic violence, and also what will happen when restrictions are lifted or go on too long. More than half of a group of severely ill coronavirus patients improved after receiving one of the experimental antiviral drug that Donald Trump offered to ship over for Boris Johnson. However, the experimental tests on Remdesivir, published by the New England Journal of Medicine on Friday, were carried out on a sample of just 53 patients, with no control group. The results are the first for Remdesivir used on Covid-19 patients. The Gilead Sciences drug has shown promise against other coronaviruses in the past, and in lab tests against the one causing the current pandemic. No drugs are currently approved for treating the disease. At least five large studies are testing Remdesivir, and the company also has given it to more than 1,700 patients on a case-by-case emergency basis. Friday\u2019s results were on 53 of those patients, aged 23 to 82 and hospitalised in the United States, Europe, Canada and Japan. Thirty-four of them were sick enough to require breathing machines. All were given the drug through an IV for 10 days or as long as they tolerated it. The number of cases of Covid-19 has passed 70,000 in Iran with 1,837 new infections confirmed in the last 24 hours. A health ministry spokesman said the total number of infections now stands at 70,029. One hundred and twenty five new deaths have also been reported in the Middle East\u2019s worst affected country, pushing the total to 4,357. Kiyanoosh Jahanpour said 3,987 patients were in critical condition; 251,703 suspected patients have so far been tested in Iran since the outbreak began. France has decided to allow people outside to adopt a pet from animal shelters, despite strict home confinement measures. The interior ministry announced on Saturday that \u201ctolerance will be granted\u201d for the mercy missions from Thursday after a call from the Animal Protection Society (SPA). The society shut its 62 centres to the public in line with official decrees to limit contact three weeks ago. But on Monday the SPA urged a re-think and warned of overcrowding with thousands of animals waiting for a new home. The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was looking into reports of some Covid-19 patients testing positive again after initially testing negative for the disease while being considered for discharge. South Korean officials on Friday reported 91 patients thought to be clear of the coronavirus had tested positive again. Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a briefing that the virus may have been \u201creactivated\u201d rather than the patients being re-infected. The Geneva-based WHO, asked about the report from Seoul, told Reuters in a brief statement: \u201cWe are aware of these reports of individuals who have tested negative for Covid-19 using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing and then after some days testing positive again. \u201cWe are closely liaising with our clinical experts and working hard to get more information on those individual cases. It is important to make sure that when samples are collected for testing on suspected patients, procedures are followed properly.\u201d In the UK, the health secretary Matt Hancock has said that 19 NHS workers have died during the coronavirus outbreak. Rehana Azam, GMB National Secretary for Public Services, said: This is beyond heartbreaking. Each of these frontline workers\u2019 sacrifice to our NHS family must never be forgotten. Now this dark truth has been dragged out, we also need to know the number of other frontline workers, including in our care homes, who have died in the call of duty. This shows why the Government\u2019s broken promises on proper protective equipment matter - it has exposed workers to increased risk. We urgently need to see Ministers fulfil their obligations to provide PPE to the frontline. Personal protective equipment is not just a precious resource - it is an absolute necessity to protect lives. GMB is deeply concerned about any inference that NHS workers are responsible for the failures of Government to properly protect our protectors.\u201d The latest figures from Spain\u2019s health ministry show that 510 people died between Friday and Saturday, the lowest single-day death toll since 23 March. To date, the country has recorded a total of 161,852 cases of the coronavirus and 16,353 deaths. The growth rate in new cases stands at around 3% - down from a daily average of 12% at the end of March and 20% in mid-March. The statistics suggest the lockdown measures are continuing to pay off and that the country is in the so-called \u201cstabilisation phase\u201d. Spain\u2019s lockdown, which has been in place since a state of emergency was declared on 14 March, was once again extended this week and will remain in effect until at least 26 April. The prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, says another extension seems inevitable. \u201cI\u2019m sure that in two weeks\u2019 time I\u2019ll have to extend the state of emergency again,\u201d he told parliament on Thursday. Despite the continuing general lockdown, from Monday or Tuesday next week, some non-essential workers will be allowed to begin returning to jobs in factories and construction sites and face masks will be handed out at metro and train stations. The ban on non-essential workers travelling to do their jobs was a two-week measure intended to ease pressure on the country\u2019s overstretched intensive care units, and it elapsed on 9 April. Spain\u2019s health minister, Salvador Illa, has stressed that the nationwide lockdown remains in place and reminded people that the country would be \u201cin a phase of very tough measures\u201d until further notice. \u201cBusinesses that have been authorised to restart their activities may do so [from next week],\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cIt means that Spaniards will be allowed on to the streets to go to work and to get basic items such as food and medicine, but for no other reasons.\u201d According to media reports, at least one member of the government\u2019s expert panel on the coronavirus has questioned the decision, saying he believes it would have been \u201csensible\u201d to keep the ban on all non-essential work in force for longer. Spain\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll fell for the third day in a row on Saturday after 510 fatalities were reported in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said in a statement, marking the smallest overnight increase since 23 March. Total fatalities from the virus rose to 16,353, from 15,843 on Friday, the ministry said, while the number of confirmed cases climbed to 161,852 from 157,022. Mali\u2019s president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, has announced a coronavirus aid package for poor people and hard-hit firms, as cases continue to rise in the war-torn west African state. The president warned on Friday that the country\u2019s already war-battered economy was facing a shock, and declared a package worth some 500bn CFA francs ($832m). \u201cThe government of Mali ... is willing to make the greatest sacrifice to lessen the negative impact of the pandemic on our economy and society,\u201d Keita said in a televised address. Mali is one of the poorest countries in the world and has been struggling since 2012 to quell a jihadist insurgency that has killed thousands of soldiers and civilians. The conflict \u2013 which has left swathes of the country outside state control \u2013 has aggravated fears that Mali is ill prepared to tackle a large coronavirus outbreak. Africans in southern China\u2019s largest city say they have become targets of suspicion and subjected to forced evictions, arbitrary quarantines and mass coronavirus testing as the country steps up its fight against imported infections. China says it has largely curbed its Covid-19 outbreak but a recent cluster of cases linked to the Nigerian community in Guangzhou sparked the alleged discrimination by locals and virus prevention officials. Local authorities in the industrial centre of 15 million said at least eight people diagnosed with the illness had spent time in the city\u2019s Yuexiu district, known as \u201cLittle Africa\u201d. Five were Nigerian nationals who faced widespread anger after reports surfaced that they had broken a mandatory quarantine and been to eight restaurants and other public places instead of staying home. As a result, nearly 2,000 people they came into contact with had to be tested for Covid-19 or undergo quarantine, state media said. Guangzhou had confirmed 114 imported coronavirus cases as of Thursday - 16 of which were Africans. The rest were returning Chinese nationals. It has led to Africans becoming targets of suspicion, distrust and racism in China. Several Africans told AFP they had been forcibly evicted from their homes and turned away by hotels. \u201cI\u2019ve been sleeping under the bridge for four days with no food to eat... I cannot buy food anywhere, no shops or restaurants will serve me,\u201d said Tony Mathias, an exchange student from Uganda who was forced from his apartment on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re like beggars on the street,\u201d the 24-year-old said. Police in Guangzhou declined to comment when contacted by AFP. In the UK, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has posted revised \u2013 and significantly lower \u2013 forecasts for the number of deaths in the UK related to Covid-19. These new forecasts are the result of more data, with the numbers moving from 66,000 cumulative deaths to 37,000. The revised estimates fall within the range of the previous forecasts. IHME said it saw fluctuations in its earlier estimates of US deaths, which have been revised to reflect increasing sources of data and the effects of physical distancing measures. The new forecasts included four additional days\u2019 worth of reported daily deaths for the UK (6, 7, 8, 9 April). The slower increase in daily deaths reported has led IHME to project a peak of 1,674 daily deaths (estimate range of 651 to 4,143) and 37,494 cumulative deaths (estimate range of 26,149 to 62,519) through the first wave of the pandemic. The Philippines reported 26 new coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday, taking the total to 247. It also confirmed 233 new infections bringing its total to 4,428. Seventeen more patients have recovered, the health ministry said in a bulletin, bringing the number of recoveries to 157. Elsewhere, Malaysian health authorities reported 184 additional confirmed cases on Saturday, raising the cumulative tally to 4,530, the highest number for any country in southeast Asia. The latest data includes three new deaths, raising the total fatalities from the outbreak to 73. The ministry said 44% of all confirmed cases had recovered. An interesting article today, asking are state responses to the virus shifting the balance of power between China and the west? World-renowned British primatologist Jane Goodall says the coronavirus pandemic was caused by humanity\u2019s disregard for nature and disrespect for animals. Goodall, who is best known for trailblazing research in Africa that revealed the true nature of chimpanzees, pleaded for the world to learn from past mistakes to prevent future disasters. During a conference call ahead of the release of the new National Geographic documentary Jane Goodall: The Hope, the 82-year-old said everyone can make a difference : It is our disregard for nature and our disrespect of the animals we should share the planet with that has caused this pandemic, that was predicted long ago. Because as we destroy, let\u2019s say the forest, the different species of animals in the forest are forced into a proximity and therefore diseases are being passed from one animal to another, and that second animal is then most likely to infect humans as it is forced into closer contact with humans. Turkey hospital sees hope as 93-year-old patient discharged Cheered by her doctors, Alye Gunduz was discharged from an Istanbul hospital after recovering from the coronavirus following 10 days of treatment. Her recovery from the disease offered some hope to health workers at Istanbul\u2019s Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty hospital as they battle the outbreak, which risks hitting Turkey hard. \u201cIt is promising because patients at this age and with chronic diseases are most of the time unable to recover because they are at highest risk,\u201d chief physician Zekayi Kutlubay told AFP. \u201cA 93-year-old woman walking out of intensive care safe and sound is inspiring for us as well as for other coronavirus patients at her age.\u201d South Korea announced plans on Saturday to strap tracking wristbands on people who defy quarantine orders, while Christians across the globe were urged to stay home over the Easter weekend as the coronavirus death toll passed 100,000. South Korean officials said stricter controls were required because some of the 57,000 people who are under orders to stay home have slipped out by leaving behind smartphones with tracking apps. Plans for broader use of wristbands were scaled back after objections by human rights and legal activists. Meanwhile, US health authorities reported more outbreaks in New York City and the surrounding region, an area with some 20 million people that accounts for more than half of the 500,000 American cases. Other hot spots are in Detroit, Louisiana and the capital, Washington. Worldwide, confirmed infections rose to 1.7 million, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. In China, where the pandemic began in December, the government reported three deaths and 46 additional cases in the 24 hours to midnight on Friday. The number of new daily cases has declined dramatically, allowing the ruling Communist Party to reopen factories and stores. China has reported 3,339 deaths and 81,953 confirmed infections, though critics say the real totals might be higher. A German science writer has expressed disbelief that despite great wealth and technological capabilities, the US has \u201csleepwalked\u201d into the coronavirus disaster. Kai Kupferschmidt said: \u201cNo matter how long I live, I don\u2019t think I will ever get over how the US, with all its wealth and technological capability and academic prowess, sleepwalked into the disaster that is unfolding.\u201d His comment came as the United States passed 100,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus, and was facing a critical lack of ventilators, face masks and testing. Now it is more than 500,000. The global coronavirus death toll topped 100,000 as Easter weekend celebrations around the world kicked off in near-empty churches, with billions of people stuck indoors in an effort to halt the pandemic. Extraordinary measures from New York to Naples to New Delhi have seen businesses and schools closed, and the IMF has warned that the world now faces the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. More than 102,000 people have died of Covid-19 with 1.7 million infections detected globally, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker, with nearly 70% of the fatalities in Europe. The United States, now the centre of the pandemic, became the first country to record more than 2,000 virus deaths in one day and is closing in on Italy\u2019s 18,849 fatalities - currently the highest national figure. With more than half a million reported infections, the United States already has more coronavirus cases than anywhere else in the world. Thanks to everyone emailing in today, great to hear what is happening where you are and get any news tips. Also \u2013 for those asking about my cat. Here is a photo of the overlord himself, who watches me as I blog. A little joy during a strange time. As ever please continue to get in touch ... Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Indonesia confirmed 330 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, taking its tally to 3,842, health ministry official Achmad Yurianto said. It also confirmed 21 virus-related deaths, taking the total to 327, Yurianto told a televised news conference. In the UK, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was \u201cinsulting\u201d to suggest health careworkers were \u201cwasting\u201d personal protective equipment. His comments come after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, reminded NHS workers not to \u201coveruse\u201d PPE and to follow the guidelines for its correct use. Starmer tweeted: \u201cIt is quite frankly insulting to imply frontline staff are wasting PPE. \u201cThere are horrific stories of NHS staff and care workers not having the equipment they need to keep them safe. \u201cThe government must act to ensure supplies are delivered.\u201d Taiwan has accused the World Health Organization (WHO) of playing word games in a dispute over details it sought in an email querying if the new coronavirus could be transmitted between people. Taiwan is not a WHO member, because of objections from China, which claims the island as its own and deems it to have no right to membership of international bodies. Such an approach, Taiwan says, deprived it of timely information to fight the virus, and it accused the WHO of having ignored its communications early in the pandemic, which has infected 1.6 million people and killed 100,000 worldwide. Last month, Taiwan said it had received no reply from the WHO to a 31 December query for information on the outbreak in China\u2019s central city of Wuhan, including whether it could be transmitted between people. The WHO has said the email it received made no mention of human-to-human transmission. In Taipei on Saturday, the health minister, Chen Shih-chung, quoted the text of the email written in English that the government sent to the WHO. Most of Thailand\u2019s provinces have banned sales of alcohol, heeding a central government call to discourage festive celebrations for the Thai New Year as the country seeks to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Thailand is among Southeast Asian countries that are cancelling or scaling back traditionally boisterous Buddhist New Year celebrations amid the global pandemic. The Thai New Year or water splashing Songkran celebrations are usually held April 13-15, but this year the government has postponed the holidays that would normally be taken then. A 10-day ban on the sale of wine, beer and spirits in the capital Bangkok went into effect on Friday. Some 47 of Thailand\u2019s 77 provinces have implemented bans to April 15 or until the end of the month, the interior ministry said in a statement. The US has become the first country in the world to record more than 2,000 coronavirus deaths in a single day. Figures from Johns Hopkins University show 2,108 people died in the past 24 hours with more than half a million confirmed infections. America could soon surpass Italy as the country with the most coronavirus deaths worldwide. It comes as White House experts said the spread of the virus is starting to level off. Dr Deborah Birx said there were good signs the outbreak was stabilising, but cautioned: \u201cAs encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak.\u201d President Hassan Rouhani urged Iranians to respect health protocols as \u201clow-risk\u201d economic activities resumed in most of the country on Saturday, state news agency IRNA reported. So-called low-risk businesses will resume across the country from Saturday with the exception of the capital Tehran, where they will restart from April 18. Iran is the Middle Eastern country worst-affected by the new coronavirus. \u201cEasing restrictions does not mean ignoring health protocols ... social distancing and other health protocols should be respected seriously by people,\u201d Rouhani was quoted as saying. Britain has not yet reached the Covid-19 peak which would allow for an easing of tight restrictions of movement, health minister Matt Hancock said on Saturday. The death toll in British hospitals has reached almost 9,000, with 980 more deaths reported on Friday, a figure which exceeded the deadliest day so far in Italy, the country worst hit by the virus. Among those who have been infected is prime minister Boris Johnson, who is recovering in hospital after spending three nights in intensive care. His office said he was improving and was back on his feet although his recovery was still at an early stage. Britain imposed a lockdown three weeks ago in a bid to curb the spread of the virus and the government has come under increasing pressure to detail how long the strict measures on movements would last, with people forced to stay at home and many businesses unable to operate. Ministers have said Britain needed to pass the peak of the outbreak before changes could be made, and Hancock said although the number of hospital admissions had started to flatten out, there was not enough evidence yet to have confidence they were past the worst. \u201cOur judgement is we\u2019re not there yet. We haven\u2019t seen a flattening enough to be able to say that we\u2019ve reached the peak,\u201d he told BBC radio. Some scientists have suggested the peak might still be some weeks off but Hancock said \u201cnobody knows\u201d when it would be. \u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of suggestions. Their job is to make their best estimate and advise us and we have a whole load of different pieces of advice from different scientists,\u201d he said. The death rate is also expected to increase over the next few days, health officials have cautioned, but they say they are hopeful that the lockdown will mean that the overall number of deaths will be below 20,000. Initially Johnson took a more modest response to the outbreak than other European leaders but changed tack when projections suggested a quarter of a million people could die in the United Kingdom. The government has come under fire for its initial response and a lack of preparedness, and there was criticism on Saturday from doctors and nurses who said they were having to treat patients without proper personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves. Among those to have died after testing positive for COVID-19 are 19 health care workers including 11 doctors. Hello all. I am updating the Guardian live feed this morning, from my home office (with my cat sitting beside me). Please do get in touch if you want to share any information with me via any of the channels below. The information and news tips I get sent are always incredibly useful and it is great to hear from people about what they feel needs reporting. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Iran\u2019s president Rouhani has urged people to respect health protocols as coronavirus restrictions ease. More to follow on this... The Afghan interior ministry has pledged tighter control on movement as the number of Covid-19 infections reached 555, triggered by a surge in cases in Kandahar and Kabul. Three deaths and 34 new infections have been reported in the last 24 hours, pushing the death toll to 18. A health ministry spokesman said 4,090 suspected patients have so far been tested in Afghanistan since the outbreak began. The ministry warned that number of new infections continue to rise across the war-torn country and asked citizens to come to hospitals if they have any symptoms. Eight of new positive cases confirmed were in the country\u2019s capital, Kabul, bringing the total number of infections to 119. Kabul is second worst affected city after Herat, which has 273 cases and four deaths. After a surge in number of cases in Kabul, the city went into full lockdown on Wednesday, and police will impose more restrictions on residents to curb unnecessary movements, officials said. Health workers and food suppliers, media workers, security officials and telecom services employees are exempt. The interior minister warned that if people in Kabul continue defying the order, police will use force against them. \u201cIf we see any sort of violation, we will act seriously\u201d. Afghanistan has so far recorded 37 recoveries from the virus. In the UK, the heath secretary, Matt Hancock, said it was still too early to determine whether the peak of coronavirus infections in the UK had been reached. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe good news is we have seen the number of hospital admissions starting \u2013 starting, I stress \u2013 to flatten out. \u201cYou can see (from the government\u2019s charts) that instead of going up exponentially, as they would have done if we had not taken the measures, that they are starting to come down and flatten. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen that enough to have confidence to make changes. The answer to your question, about have we reached the peak, is nobody knows.\u201d Asked about the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, saying the UK was two weeks away from the peak, Hancock added: \u201cOur judgment is that we are not there yet and that we haven\u2019t seen a flattening enough to be able to say that we have reached the peak.\u201d Publicly-funded US broadcaster Voice of America has rubbished criticism from the White House that it is promoting Chinese \u201cforeign propaganda\u201d on the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement on Friday, Donald Trump\u2019s administration claimed VOA pushed Beijing\u2019s message by tweeting a video of celebrations at the end of Wuhan\u2019s quarantine measures, and noting the US had surpassed China\u2019s death toll. \u201cVOA too often speaks for America\u2019s adversaries \u2013 not its citizens,\u201d the White House claimed, adding: \u201cJournalists should report the facts, but VOA has instead amplified Beijing\u2019s propaganda.\u201d At least 18,000 Americans have died from Covid-19, compared with about 3,000 Chinese nationals, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. VOA director Amanda Bennet pushed back at the criticism, while not mentioning the Trump administration, noting that the broadcaster had reported on China\u2019s efforts to initially hide the coronavirus outbreak. Congo has been battling an Ebola outbreak that has killed thousands of people for more than 18 months, and now it must also face the coronavirus pandemic. Ebola has left those living in the country\u2019s east weary and fearful, and, just as they were preparing to declare an end to the outbreak, a new case popped up. Now, they will now have to manage both threats at once. The new virus has overwhelmed some of the worlds best hospital systems in Europe and ripped through communities in New York. In Congo, it could spread unchecked in a country that has endured decades of conflict. It\u2019s also unclear how forthcoming international support will be at a time when the whole world is battling coronavirus. It all feels like one big storm, said Martine Milonde, a Congolese community mobiliser who works with the aid group World Vision in Beni, which has been the center of the Ebola outbreak. Truly, this is a crisis within a crisis within a crisis. The community suffers from insecurity, and suffered under Ebola, and now may have to face Covid-19. Hello. I am taking over the Guardian\u2019s global live feed, bringing you all the latest information on coronavirus. Please feel free to share any information with me via any of the means below. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Also, feel it\u2019s worth sharing the Guardian\u2019s UK front page today, which looks at the lives lost so far. Here is our at-a-glance guide to the most recent developments. I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague in London, Sarah Marsh. The Philippines has temporarily banned health workers from leaving for overseas jobs in an attempt to strengthen its own health systems. On Friday the death toll from the coronavirus in the country reached 221, while confirmed cases totalled 4,195. The ruling preventing doctors, nurses and others from taking work abroad has prompted an online petition from nurses and as well as criticism from medical groups. \u201cIf the government wants to keep our health workers within our country, then we must offer competitive salaries and benefits so they will choose to stay, instead of being forced to,\u201d Leah Paquiz of the nursing advocacy group Ang Nars told the Rappler website. Here is a summary of the latest developments: Cases of coronavirus in the US have now topped 500,000, while 18,693 deaths have been recorded. Donald Trump, who is agitating for a reopening of the economy, said: \u201cThe facts are going to determine what I do.\u201d More than 100 Australian and New Zealand passengers from the Antarctic cruise ship the Greg Mortimer have disembarked in Uruguay. Six Americans, five British citizens and passengers from other countries, as well 83 crew members, remain on board. South Korea has announced plans to strap tracking wristbands on people who ignore quarantine orders, with officials warning that stricter controls were required to enforce self-isolation rules. The head of the World Bank said he is confident that progress is being made towards debt relief for the world\u2019s poorest countries. The UK\u2019s health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the Easter weekend will be a \u201ctest of the nation\u2019s resolve\u201d and issued another warning to the public to stay at home amid the coronavirus crisis. Singapore has suspended the use of video-conferencing tool Zoom by teachers after \u201cvery serious incidents\u201d in the first week of a coronavirus lockdown that has seen schools move to home-based learning. Thailand recorded 45 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, bringing the total in the country to 2,518. The death toll also rose from 33 to 35. Earlier this week, officials defended the country\u2019s approach to testing and surveillance, saying that health teams were focused on targeted testing, rather than rolling out mass tests. Some have questioned if the country\u2019s low case numbers are due to a lack of testing. Between January and April, 71,860 samples have been tested. South Korea has announced plans to strap tracking wristbands on people who ignore quarantine orders, with officials warning that stricter controls were required to enforce self-isolation rules. Some of the 57,000 people who are under orders to stay home have apparently slipped out by leaving behind their smartphones, which are currently used to monitor movement. A South Korean health official, Yoon Tae-ho, acknowledged privacy concerns but said the wristbands were necessary because the number of people under self-quarantine has soared over recent weeks. Since April 1, the country has required new arrivals from abroad to isolate for 14-day. Lee Beom-seok, an official from the ministry of the interior and safety, said the government could not force people to wear the wristbands, but that citizens would be asked to sign consent forms. Those who agree to do so could be considered for lighter punishment. People can face up to a year in prison or fined as much as $8,200 for breaking quarantine orders in the country. South Koreas Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said at least 886 of the countrys 10,480 coronavirus infections have been traced to international arrivals. Here\u2019s a bit of positive news from Turkey, where doctors are celebrating the recovery of a 93-year-old woman, Alye Gunduz, who was discharged from an Istanbul hospital following 10 days of treatment. \u201cIt is promising because patients at this age and with chronic diseases are most of the time unable to recover because they are at highest risk from Covid-19,\u201d chief physician Zekayi Kutlubay told AFP. Turkey has registered more than 47,000 Covid-19 cases - ranking it among the 10 most infected countries in the world. It has recorded over a thousand deaths. \u201cA 93-year-old woman walking out of intensive care sound and safe is inspiring for us as well as for other coronavirus patients at her age,\u201d said Kutlubay. We are all finding new ways to adapt to life under lockdown. In Myanmar\u2019s commercial capital, Yangon - where residents have been asked to stay at home this week for the Thingyan holiday - delivery pulleys are proving useful. The World Bank president David Malpass has said he is confident that progress is being made, following his call for debt relief for the world\u2019s poorest countries. The call for a temporary pause in payments, made jointly with the International Monetary Fund, will be discussed next week by finance officials of both the G7 and G20 economies, he said. It has been proposed that China and other big creditors should suspend debt payments from International Development Association (IDA) countries beginning May 1, freeing up resources for them to fight against the pandemic. The IDA countries are home to a quarter of the world\u2019s population and two-thirds of the world\u2019s population living in extreme poverty. The issue is particularly critical for G20 member China, which has sharply increased lending to developing countries over the past two decades. China\u2019s government, banks and companies lent some $143 billion to Africa between 2000-2017, much of it for large-scale infrastructure projects, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. By some estimates, Chinese lending now dwarfs World Bank loans in Africa. The UK\u2019s health secretary Matt Hancock, has said the Easter weekend will be a \u201ctest of the nation\u2019s resolve\u201d and issued another warning to the public to \u201cstay at home\u201d amid the coronavirus crisis. The Met Office said London could see highs of 25C or 26C, while much of England and Wales was expected to record temperatures of 18C to 24C. Speaking at the daily press conference about the importance of keeping to the lockdown rules, Hancock said: This is a national effort, and every single person in this country can play their part in this plan. This Easter will be another test of the nation\u2019s resolve. It\u2019s a time of year when people normally come together. But however warm the weather, however tempting your local beach or park, we need everyone to stay at home. Because in hospitals across the country, NHS staff are battling day and night to keep desperately sick people breathing, and they need you to stay at home.\u201d Singapore has suspended the use of video-conferencing tool Zoom by teachers after \u201cvery serious incidents\u201d in the first week of a coronavirus lockdown that has seen schools move to home-based learning, Reuters has reported. One incident involved obscene images appearing on screens and strange men making lewd comments during the streaming of a geography lesson with teenage girls, media reports said. Zoom Video Communications has faced safety and privacy concerns over its conferencing app, use of which has surged in offices and schools worldwide after they shut to try and curb virus infection Taiwan and Germany have already curbed use of Zoom, while Google banned the desktop version from corporate laptops this week. It was confirmed earlier that cases of coronavirus in the US have now topped 500,000, while 18,693 deaths have been reported. Despite such rises in case numbers, there are some signs that the stay-at-home measures in the US are having an impact. On Friday, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, expressed cautious optimism that the state\u2019s infection rate was slowing. The World Health Organisation and Anthony Fauci, America\u2019s top infectious disease expert, have both warned that such progress could be reversed if lockdown measures are eased. President Donald Trump, however, is eager to lift restrictions. Here is some detail from a recent report by the Guardian\u2019s senior reporter Peter Beaumont and Madrid correspondent Sam Jones: Trump, seemingly concerned by deflating approval ratings and exploding unemployment figures, had told reporters that he hoped to open up the economy \u201cvery, very, very, very soon\u201d. On Friday, the president struck a more emollient tone, saying he would announce next week a council of business and medical leaders to help him with the \u201cbiggest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make\u201d on when to reopen America for business. Trump added: \u201cI want to get it open as soon as possible. This country was meant to be open and vibrant and great ... The facts are going to determine what I do. But we do want to get the country open.\u201d Reporter Uki Go\u00f1i in Buenos Aires has some more detail on the stricken Greg Mortimer cruise ship. More than 100 Australian and New Zealand passengers from the Antarctic cruise ship Greg Mortimer have started disembarking at the port of Montevideo in Uruguay to board a medically-equipped Airbus to Melbourne early on Saturday morning. It is not known if the Greg Mortimer, with its remaining European and American passengers and its crew of 85, will be allowed to remain docked at the port, or if the ship will be asked to sail out again 20 kilometres offshore from the coast of Montevideo where it has been anchored for the past two weeks. The ship has been at sea since March 15 when it set off from Argentina\u2019s southern port of Ushuaia on an ill-fated Antarctic cruise, spending the last three weeks with all passengers quarantined in their cabins. At least 128 passengers and crew, out of a total 217 on board, have tested positive for the virus. New Zealand has confirmed two new deaths related to Covid-19, doubling the country\u2019s death toll to four. A Christchurch man in his 70s and a Wellington man in his 80s both died on Good Friday after being admitted to hospital with the disease, Australian Associated Press has reported. Both had underlying health conditions, as did the previous two Kiwis to die after contracting coronavirus. Worryingly, the Christchurch man is the second to die from a cluster linked to the Rosewood rest home. Director of Public Health Caroline McElnay said she \u201ccannot rule out further serious illnesses or deaths\u201d from that cluster. So far, 30 people have tested positive to coronavirus at Rosewood. Health officials also announced 29 new cases of the disease on Saturday, a sign the country is moving closer to controling of the disease. There were also 49 recoveries on Good Friday. The total number of cases is now 1312. The number of coronavirus cases in the US has now surpassed 500,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University global dashboard. Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno has announced the creation of a humanitarian assistance account that will be funded with contributions from companies and citizens to address the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The account will be funded, in part, by a contribution of five percent of profits from companies that earned more than a million dollars. The money will serve to finance smaller companies that require capital. The other funds will come from a progressive contribution based on workers\u2019 monthly income for nine months. The contribution will be for those who earn more than $500 per month. Ecuador reported more than 2,196 new infections in one day on Friday, raising the total number to 7,161. Some 297 have died and another 311 were likely killed by the virus, according to official data. Moreno said in a televised address: The pandemic hit us at a critical moment, when we were trying to get ahead after a very tough economic crisis...It hit us without a cent in the state\u2019s accounts.\u201d The government has said deaths could reach 3,500 due to the outbreak in the province of Guayas, where the epicenter of the country\u2019s outbreak is located, which accounts for 70% of infections. The 112 Australians and New Zealanders stuck on board a coronavirus-stricken Antarctic cruise ship have finally disembarked in Uruguay, Associated Press has reported. The ship has been anchored off the coast of South America for the last 14 days. At least six Americans, five British citizens and passengers from other countries, as well 83 crew members, remain on the the Greg Mortimer, a ship operated by Australias Aurora Expeditions. Arrangements for their evacuation are still being made. Uruquay had originally refused to let passengers off the cruise ship, after authorities said that 128 of the 217 people on board had tested positive for the new coronavirus. They later sent medical teams to the ship to ensure people\u2019s health and monitored the situation via WhatsApp. Most of the crew and passengers have mild symptoms and are stable, Karina Rando, director general of Uruguay\u2019s Public Health Ministry, told The Associated Press. We are at a moment in the epidemic that allows us to evacuate. We have intensive care beds, doctors are available and we are not putting the care of our population at risk... We have the logistical and professional capacity to serve these people.\u201d The evacuated passengers will be repatriated using a humanitarian corridor with biosecurity measures unprecedented for the South American country. They will be driven in four buses to Montevideo\u2019s Carrasco airport, escorted by police and medical personnel. At the runway, the passengers and their luggage will be disinfected prior to boarding. A refitted airplane operated by charter airline Hi Fly will take them to Melbourne, Australia, where the passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, the company said. The flight is expected to leave Uruguay at around 2 a.m. Saturday local time. China reported 46 new coronavirus cases on Friday, of which 42 were imported from abroad. A further three deaths have also been reported. Hubei province - home to the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began - reported no new cases on Friday. This week, the city of 11 million people opened its doors again after 76 days sealed off from the world. Hello this is Rebecca Ratcliffe at the helm of our global coronavirus liveblog. As the global deaths from the virus passed the grim milestone of 100,000, the World Health Organization has warned that a premature lifting of restrictions on peoples\u2019 movements by countries fighting the pandemic could spark a \u201cdeadly resurgence\u201d. In the US, where president Donald Trump is agitating for a reopening of the economy, the country\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, cautioned against easing lockdown measures. Both Italy and Spain have extended their restrictions. Meanwhile, Turkey has put in place a two-day lockdown in 31 provinces. Here are some of the key developments from the last few hours: Nearly 1,000 more people are confirmed dead in France. The French death toll passes 13,000, the health ministry director J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon said. A further 554 deaths were confirmed in French hospitals and 433 in care and retirement homes. Italy extends lockdown. Restrictions will remain in place in Italy for another three weeks, the country\u2019s prime minister has said, although a few types of shop will be allowed to reopen from next Tuesday. Giuseppe Conte said: \u201cThis is a difficult but necessary decision for which I take all political responsibility.\u201d Trump promises to listen to expert advice on reopening the economy. The US president says he is creating a second task force that will include a council tasked with deciding when to ease restrictions. But Donald Trump, who has repeatedly pushed the idea, insists he is not determined to reopen the economy if he is advised that to do so would endanger public health. Turkey puts in place a two-day lockdown in 31 provinces. The measures cover Istanbul, Ankara and other major cities, its interior ministry says, adding that the curbs will begin at midnight and end at the same time on Sunday. The country\u2019s known death toll stands at 1,006 people. The UK is urged to investigate if and why black, Asian and minority ethnic people are more vulnerable. The head of the British Medical Association made the call after it emerged that the first 10 doctors in the UK named as having died from the virus were all BAME. Liverpool legend, Kenny Dalglish, tests positive. The 69-year-old was in hospital for treatment on a separate infection.

And a group of Australian civil society organisations has called on the Australian government to use its influence at the G20 and IMF to push for the permanent cancellation of all debt due from vulnerable countries in 2020, without interest accrual, charges or penalties. Dr Luke Fletcher, executive director of Jubilee Australia, said Australia, as a G20 nation, a member of the Paris Club of creditor nations, and an influential voice at the IMF and World Bank, should use its influence to push for the debt cancellation at the IMF and World Bank spring meetings this week. \u201cMany of our Pacific neighbours, who are already bearing the brunt of the impacts of climate change, are at risk of debt distress and will also be particularly vulnerable to the Covid-19 crisis,\u201d Fletcher said.

Australian prime minister Scott Morrison told a virtual G20 summit last week that Australia\u2019s \u201cPacific family\u201d must be a focus of international support, and said the government was \u201creconfiguring our development assistance to ensure critical health services can continue to function and to help our Pacific neighbours and Timor-Leste to manage the immediate economic impacts of the pandemic\u201d.

As the country remains in lockdown, our social services are stretched beyond their limits. Draconian funding cuts and the subsequent closure of refuges have left thousands of men, women and children at the mercy of abusive partners. Many people will suffer in silence, trapped in situations that restrict their ability to contact an organisation that can help them.</p> <p>With an increase in the number of incidents expected over the coming months, it\u2019s critical that the government confirm a date for the second reading of the domestic abuse bill. The importance of this bill cannot be overestimated, as it provides additional protection to victims. And the government needs to ringfence the funding it has promised to ensure a safer future for these often unseen victims.<br><strong>Stuart Carruthers</strong><br>Lewes, East Sussex<br></p> <p>Alan Mitcham is right to point out that the rapid spread of the coronavirus is due to mass international travel, primarily by plane (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/letters-time-to-thank-our-local-heroes\" title=\"\">Letters</a>). Air travel, disproportionately undertaken by the rich, has enormous costs that are paid for by us all, instead of by the participants. It turns epidemics into pandemics and is enormously damaging to the climate. After this crisis is over, we must not return to business as usual. In the next crisis, all planes must be grounded immediately.

As the country remains in lockdown, our social services are stretched beyond their limits. Draconian funding cuts and the subsequent closure of refuges have left thousands of men, women and children at the mercy of abusive partners. Many people will suffer in silence, trapped in situations that restrict their ability to contact an organisation that can help them. With an increase in the number of incidents expected over the coming months, it\u2019s critical that the government confirm a date for the second reading of the domestic abuse bill. The importance of this bill cannot be overestimated, as it provides additional protection to victims. And the government needs to ringfence the funding it has promised to ensure a safer future for these often unseen victims. Stuart Carruthers Lewes, East Sussex Alan Mitcham is right to point out that the rapid spread of the coronavirus is due to mass international travel, primarily by plane (Letters). Air travel, disproportionately undertaken by the rich, has enormous costs that are paid for by us all, instead of by the participants. It turns epidemics into pandemics and is enormously damaging to the climate. After this crisis is over, we must not return to business as usual. In the next crisis, all planes must be grounded immediately. In the meantime, aviation must be taxed far more.

      "bodyText": "The pope and other Christian leaders are preparing to give their annual Easter addresses over the internet as churches stand empty and countries around the world continue to extend lockdowns to stop the spread of coronavirus. Pope Francis will break with centuries of tradition and livestream his Easter Sunday mass to allow the world\u2019s 1.3 billion Catholics to celebrate their holiest holiday. Fear and confusion in the face of a disease whose official death toll has soared past 100,000, with nearly 1,800,000 confirmed cases, are reshaping society and transforming the way religion is observed. Billions of people around the world are in lockdown and many countries, from Argentina to Saudi Arabia, have ramped up restrictions as the disease spreads. Indonesia has imposed curbs on public transport ahead of the annual exodus to home villages that marks the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. Restrictions around the world also pose a problem for enforcement as governments plead with people to stay indoors over the holiday weekend in many countries. The pope\u2019s virtual prayers are just the most vivid example of religious improvisation in the age of social distancing and confinement. The faithful have already followed his advice and found creative solutions. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will hail the courage of people working on the front line in response to the coronavirus outbreak as he leads Britain\u2019s first national digital Easter Sunday service from his kitchen. Welby will also call for \u201ca resurrection of our common life\u201d in the video from his flat at Lambeth Palace in London. \u201cAfter so much suffering, so much heroism from key workers and the NHS, we cannot be content to go back to what was before as if all is normal,\u201d he will say in the sermon recorded on his iPad. \u201cThere needs to be a resurrection of our common life.\u201d The Queen also issued an Easter message, saying the celebration would be \u201cdifferent\u201d but insisted Easter was not cancelled and that the story of resurrection gave hope that the world can overcome the virus and resume normal life again. The archbishop of Panama took to the air and blessed his central American nation from a helicopter. The faithful in Spain blasted religious music from their balconies during Holy Week. The Catholic Church in the Philippines has urged the faithful not to kiss the cross. Its Orthodox counterpart in Greece is planning to hold mass behind closed doors for its Easter on 19 April. Jewish worshippers across the world did their best by using Zoom or other video conferencing apps to \u201cseder-in-place\u201d when the eight-day Passover holiday started on Wednesday evening. Even such hallowed traditions as the pope\u2019s Easter Day address to the faithful on St Peter\u2019s Square will be replaced by prayers that Francis will livestream. His Easter Sunday mass and \u201cUrbi et Orbi\u201d blessing drew 70,000 to Saint Peter\u2019s Square last year. The Vatican\u2019s entrance is now sealed off by armed police wearing face masks and rubber gloves. \u201cEaster offers a message of hope in people\u2019s darkest hour,\u201d the 83-year-old pontiff said at a late-night vigil mass on Saturday in an empty St Peter\u2019s Basilica. The public was barred because of the pandemic, and around the world Catholics followed his service and other masses on television or online. \u201cDo not be afraid, do not yield to fear. This is the message of hope,\u201d said the pope. The Vatican was only one of thousands of cities across the world in lockdown over the weekend with restirctions intensifying in many parts of the globe. Here are the main developments: Mainland China has reported 99 new cases on Saturday, of which all but two were imported. The country\u2019s national health commission said no one had died from the virus on Saturday. Of the 97 imported cases recorded, 43 were in the city of Shanghai.

China might use the economic fallout of the virus to increase its debt stranglehold on developing nations, experts at Harvard have warned. It comes amid growing calls for creditor nations to forgive debts to enable countries to rebuild after the virus. Elderly people may have to be kept isolated until the end of the year to protect them from the coronavirus, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen has said. \u201cWithout a vaccine, we have to limit as much as possible contact with the elderly,\u201d she told the Germany daily Bild.",

      "body": "<p>Rishi Sunak avoided calling the Bank of England last week to beg for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/bank-of-england-to-finance-uk-government-covid-19-crisis-spending\" title=\"\">an extension of the Treasury\u2019s overdraft facility</a> to meet his Covid-19 spending commitments.</p> <p>The chancellor was saved that job by Andrew Bailey, the central bank\u2019s governor, who saw the red flashing signs on the side of the Treasury\u2019s headquarters from his Threadneedle Street offices almost three miles away. In a joint statement, the Treasury and the Bank said they had agreed to extend the use of the <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2020/april/hmt-and-boe-announce-temporary-extension-to-ways-and-means-facility\" title=\"\">\u201cways and means\u201d facility</a> as a temporary measure during the disruption caused by Covid-19.</p> <p>At the moment the Treasury has a standing facility of \u00a3400m that can be drawn on instantly and without discussion. What the total will be in a year\u2019s time is not known, but analysts who have attempted to estimate the UK\u2019s likely spending shortfall have settled on \u00a3200bn, give or take \u00a350bn.</p> <p>Bailey has strenuously denied that the central bank is now the Treasury\u2019s slave after adding the overdraft facility to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/bank-of-englands-qe-programme-is-bigger-than-the-city-expected\" title=\"\">a \u00a3200bn quantitative easing boost announced last month</a>, insisting that temporary means temporary. He is certainly right to say that there is a precedent for the Bank providing instant cash. Back in 2008 it extended almost \u00a320bn to the then Labour chancellor, Alistair Darling, via the ways and means facility as he battled to save the financial services industry from going bust.</p> <p>An extra \u00a3200bn of debts \u2013 no matter how they are apportioned by the Bank \u2013 would frighten most people, and there are some officials in the Treasury who are struggling to come to terms with the scale of the UK\u2019s expected 2020 borrowing. Sunak, though, is understood to be reconciled to running up the largest debt mountain in peacetime.</p> <p>Yet Bailey and Sunak cannot argue that such a large debt can in any way be considered temporary. Whether the loan sits inside the ways and means facility or is more obviously added to the Bank\u2019s quantitative-easing lending scheme, which has accumulated \u00a3435bn of government debt, it will be too large to pay down in a matter of months, years, or even decades.</p> <p>In 2005 the national debt stood at \u00a3500bn. By 2010 it was \u00a31 trillion and it now stands at just over \u00a31.8tn. The economy has grown in that time, but not by much. From a debt-to-GDP ratio in 2005 below 40%, the ratio is now around 86%.</p> <p>So the question must then be: does the UK face another long period of austerity, as it did after the first and second world wars and following the 2008 financial crisis, or does something else happen to the loans made by the Bank of England, and government debt more generally?</p> <p>Sunak was keen to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/budget-2020-documents/budget-2020\" title=\"\">point out in his March budget</a> that the ups and downs of Britain\u2019s debts have made little difference to the tumbling cost of financing them. In the year after the second world war finished, debt payments accounted for more than 14% of government spending. Last year that figure was below 4%.</p> <p>Everyone with money, it seems, wants to play safe by lending their savings to governments with a strong record of paying the interest on their debts. </p> <p>In this environment, when large numbers of investors are content with receiving interest of less than 1%, the Bank and the government can work together to finance huge debts without diverting funds from the public purse.</p> <p>Temporary debts can become permanent, and a new era of monetary financing \u2013 where the Bank prints new money for the government to spend \u2013 dawns. The sooner we admit this and plot a course of action, the better.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6251ad42c4f9e3513b4f7053c2081176b671255d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6251ad42c4f9e3513b4f7053c2081176b671255d/820_871_4152_2491/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Austerity is out of the question: the wealthiest must help to pay</h2> <p>The coronavirus pandemic is a humbling, once-in-a-century phenomenon that has drawn historical comparisons with societies under the siege of war. It could also be an event that triggers an economic levelling on a global scale too, just as developed nations experienced a radical reduction in inequality after the second world war.</p> <p>For now, it is a case of watching the damage being wrought. The long-term scarring to national economies is already in evidence, with more than 16 million unemployed in the US, 1.2 million applications for universal credit in the UK and Germany widely forecast to be entering a deep recession.</p> <p>But then will come the healing. The repairs to developed economies, which are already building up ballooning deficits, will be costly. Trillions of dollars will have been spent by governments on furlough schemes, emergency lending programmes and extra health funding. The bill will have to be met.</p> <p>The options to pay for this will fall between well-drawn policy lines: austerity, or higher taxes. The political calculus in many countries \u2013 the UK included \u2013 will probably be that more austerity is unsustainable because no electorate will tolerate it. Which leaves the spotlight on taxes \u2013 and the rich.</p> <p>The reaction of the world\u2019s most notable billionaires has so far been commendable: $100m from the world\u2019s richest man, Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos, to American food banks; $1bn from Twitter founder Jack Dorsey towards battling the pandemic; and $100m from Bill and Melinda Gates towards vaccines.</p> <p>The world\u2019s 2,153 billionaires hold <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/worlds-billionaires-have-more-wealth-46-billion-people\" title=\"\">more wealth than 4.6 billion of their fellows on Earth</a>, according to Oxfam. If that imbalance seemed intolerable before, it cannot be borne now. With a global economy on its knees, meaningful redistribution is going to be on the agenda.</p> <h2>Corporate Britain now showing No 10 why businesses matter</h2> <p>When the coronavirus crisis finally abates, will any prime-ministerial hopeful ever again utter the phrase \u201cFuck business\u201d?</p> <p>Those were the words that Boris Johnson allegedly used in 2018 as a retort to the alarm among business leaders about how the Brexit process was unfolding. Johnson\u2019s government subsequently showed that it would not rush to the aid of companies in distress, letting the likes of Thomas Cook and Flybe go to the wall.</p> <p>Now, though, the business community is helping to keep the country on its feet through unprecedented turmoil. Of course there are exceptions \u2013 firms that have dragged their feet protecting staff, or banks proving slow to lend to those in need. But for the most part, UK plc has shown its best side.</p> <p>Manufacturers such as Airbus and Rolls-Royce are deploying their collective power to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/05/ventilator-crisis-lands-britains-manufacturers-with-greatest-test\" title=\"\">churn out medical ventilators</a>; they would have made greater progress by now if the government had not been slow to give the order. Fashion firms including Burberry are making protective gear for the NHS amid severe shortages. Restaurants such as Leon and Honest Burger are dishing out free meals to NHS staff. Chemicals firm Ineos may not be everyone\u2019s idea of a cuddly corporate, but it has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/uk-chemicals-firm-plans-to-build-two-hand-sanitiser-factories-in-10-days\" title=\"\">built factories to manufacture hand sanitiser</a>. The supermarkets are keeping the nation fed.</p> <p>Of course, business is simultaneously being helped by the government in ways always previously thought impossible \u2013 with tax holidays, grants, the picking-up of staff wages and myriad other offers. The fact that some initiatives are working too slowly is largely down to the speed with which they were developed.</p> <p>Politicians, of course, must never shy away from taking on corporate interests. But when all of this is over, the government may want to reassess its side of the social contract with business.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rishi Sunak avoided calling the Bank of England last week to beg for an extension of the Treasury\u2019s overdraft facility to meet his Covid-19 spending commitments. The chancellor was saved that job by Andrew Bailey, the central bank\u2019s governor, who saw the red flashing signs on the side of the Treasury\u2019s headquarters from his Threadneedle Street offices almost three miles away. In a joint statement, the Treasury and the Bank said they had agreed to extend the use of the \u201cways and means\u201d facility as a temporary measure during the disruption caused by Covid-19. At the moment the Treasury has a standing facility of \u00a3400m that can be drawn on instantly and without discussion. What the total will be in a year\u2019s time is not known, but analysts who have attempted to estimate the UK\u2019s likely spending shortfall have settled on \u00a3200bn, give or take \u00a350bn. Bailey has strenuously denied that the central bank is now the Treasury\u2019s slave after adding the overdraft facility to a \u00a3200bn quantitative easing boost announced last month, insisting that temporary means temporary. He is certainly right to say that there is a precedent for the Bank providing instant cash. Back in 2008 it extended almost \u00a320bn to the then Labour chancellor, Alistair Darling, via the ways and means facility as he battled to save the financial services industry from going bust. An extra \u00a3200bn of debts \u2013 no matter how they are apportioned by the Bank \u2013 would frighten most people, and there are some officials in the Treasury who are struggling to come to terms with the scale of the UK\u2019s expected 2020 borrowing. Sunak, though, is understood to be reconciled to running up the largest debt mountain in peacetime. Yet Bailey and Sunak cannot argue that such a large debt can in any way be considered temporary. Whether the loan sits inside the ways and means facility or is more obviously added to the Bank\u2019s quantitative-easing lending scheme, which has accumulated \u00a3435bn of government debt, it will be too large to pay down in a matter of months, years, or even decades. In 2005 the national debt stood at \u00a3500bn. By 2010 it was \u00a31 trillion and it now stands at just over \u00a31.8tn. The economy has grown in that time, but not by much. From a debt-to-GDP ratio in 2005 below 40%, the ratio is now around 86%. So the question must then be: does the UK face another long period of austerity, as it did after the first and second world wars and following the 2008 financial crisis, or does something else happen to the loans made by the Bank of England, and government debt more generally? Sunak was keen to point out in his March budget that the ups and downs of Britain\u2019s debts have made little difference to the tumbling cost of financing them. In the year after the second world war finished, debt payments accounted for more than 14% of government spending. Last year that figure was below 4%. Everyone with money, it seems, wants to play safe by lending their savings to governments with a strong record of paying the interest on their debts. In this environment, when large numbers of investors are content with receiving interest of less than 1%, the Bank and the government can work together to finance huge debts without diverting funds from the public purse. Temporary debts can become permanent, and a new era of monetary financing \u2013 where the Bank prints new money for the government to spend \u2013 dawns. The sooner we admit this and plot a course of action, the better. Austerity is out of the question: the wealthiest must help to pay The coronavirus pandemic is a humbling, once-in-a-century phenomenon that has drawn historical comparisons with societies under the siege of war. It could also be an event that triggers an economic levelling on a global scale too, just as developed nations experienced a radical reduction in inequality after the second world war. For now, it is a case of watching the damage being wrought. The long-term scarring to national economies is already in evidence, with more than 16 million unemployed in the US, 1.2 million applications for universal credit in the UK and Germany widely forecast to be entering a deep recession. But then will come the healing. The repairs to developed economies, which are already building up ballooning deficits, will be costly. Trillions of dollars will have been spent by governments on furlough schemes, emergency lending programmes and extra health funding. The bill will have to be met. The options to pay for this will fall between well-drawn policy lines: austerity, or higher taxes. The political calculus in many countries \u2013 the UK included \u2013 will probably be that more austerity is unsustainable because no electorate will tolerate it. Which leaves the spotlight on taxes \u2013 and the rich. The reaction of the world\u2019s most notable billionaires has so far been commendable: $100m from the world\u2019s richest man, Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos, to American food banks; $1bn from Twitter founder Jack Dorsey towards battling the pandemic; and $100m from Bill and Melinda Gates towards vaccines. The world\u2019s 2,153 billionaires hold more wealth than 4.6 billion of their fellows on Earth, according to Oxfam. If that imbalance seemed intolerable before, it cannot be borne now. With a global economy on its knees, meaningful redistribution is going to be on the agenda. Corporate Britain now showing No 10 why businesses matter When the coronavirus crisis finally abates, will any prime-ministerial hopeful ever again utter the phrase \u201cFuck business\u201d? Those were the words that Boris Johnson allegedly used in 2018 as a retort to the alarm among business leaders about how the Brexit process was unfolding. Johnson\u2019s government subsequently showed that it would not rush to the aid of companies in distress, letting the likes of Thomas Cook and Flybe go to the wall. Now, though, the business community is helping to keep the country on its feet through unprecedented turmoil. Of course there are exceptions \u2013 firms that have dragged their feet protecting staff, or banks proving slow to lend to those in need. But for the most part, UK plc has shown its best side. Manufacturers such as Airbus and Rolls-Royce are deploying their collective power to churn out medical ventilators; they would have made greater progress by now if the government had not been slow to give the order. Fashion firms including Burberry are making protective gear for the NHS amid severe shortages. Restaurants such as Leon and Honest Burger are dishing out free meals to NHS staff. Chemicals firm Ineos may not be everyone\u2019s idea of a cuddly corporate, but it has built factories to manufacture hand sanitiser. The supermarkets are keeping the nation fed. Of course, business is simultaneously being helped by the government in ways always previously thought impossible \u2013 with tax holidays, grants, the picking-up of staff wages and myriad other offers. The fact that some initiatives are working too slowly is largely down to the speed with which they were developed. Politicians, of course, must never shy away from taking on corporate interests. But when all of this is over, the government may want to reassess its side of the social contract with business.",

But later, eyeing my last half bag of flour, there was a voice in my head whispering: \u201cWell, what have you got to lose?\u201d Our debt to nurses In the past weeks, 5,500 student nurses from 35 universities have stepped forward to work full time in NHS hospitals. A letter signed by 81 MPs last week called for their student loans to be cancelled as a signal of gratitude. One of the travesties of the one-size-fits-all loan system has been the way it has been applied to the nursing profession, discouraging thousands of potential candidates. From September, with the government reinstating the maintenance grant scheme it should never have scrapped in 2016, student nurses will be able to claim \u00a35,000 toward living costs, but will still have to use \u00a327,000 of student financing for three years\u2019 tuition fees. The letter argues that the government should guarantee that no nurse should be charged for the training that will benefit us all. Surely an idea we could all applaud.",

I was cleared from that, but I am supposed to be wearing a mask. I asked my manager if I could wear a mask and was told I couldn\u2019t use a mask,\u201d said Rogers.</p> <p>She isn\u2019t provided any paid sick time off, health insurance benefits, or given additional hazard pay while working during the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cIf we get sick, who is going to run the store?

Rana noted the only thing Uber has offered drivers still on the road is giving a month off their car insurance payment through Uber.</p> <p>\u201cWe are taking chances. We\u2019re risking our life out here, so they could at least do something to protect us, give us some type of credit, step up and do something for drivers still on the road,\u201d said Rana. \u201cEarnings are way, way down, but I\u2019m still trying.

He doesn\u2019t even have basic hand sanitizer and claims Shipt, a delivery service owned by Target, doesn\u2019t provide any sort of training or support for shoppers through the pandemic, aside from sending them guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4bcaf3d1f34941e9d67d9f4d967cb746289c2d2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bcaf3d1f34941e9d67d9f4d967cb746289c2d2b/1095_0_1154_1156/1000.jpg\" alt=\"We\u2019re left out here to fend for ourselves, address issues and the customer\u2019s orders as best as we can,\u201d said Willy Solis, a Shipt worker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re left out here to fend for ourselves, address issues and the customer\u2019s orders as best as we can,\u2019 said Willy Solis, a Shipt worker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Willy Solis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said Shipt\u2019s support services are virtually non-existent at the moment because they\u2019ve been so overrun with demand.</p> <p>\u201cWe have zero phone support.

We\u2019re left out here to fend for ourselves, address issues and the customer\u2019s orders as best as we can,\u201d said Solis.</p> <p>Tips have been decreasing, said Solis, thanks to frustrated customers, and there have been issues with tipping on the app. Shipt workers rely significantly on tips to subsidize their pay.</p> <p>The money he makes is \u201cnot enough to compensate for the risk we\u2019re taking and the level of support we have to expel\u201d, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re begging for support right now. Without being able to complete orders, it\u2019s causing a situation financially where we\u2019re being decimated and it\u2019s becoming worthless for us to do this job,\u201d added Solis.</p> <p>A Shipt spokesperson attributed delays to the increase of demand during the pandemic, and said the company is hiring more support agents and developing a way to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) for shoppers. \u201cFrom the beginning, we\u2019ve encouraged shoppers only to schedule themselves when they feel safe, and we have provided our shoppers with healthy hygiene habits recommended by the CDC,\u201d said the spokesperson.</p> <h2>Jerome Westpoint: sanitation worker for over 40 years in Atlanta, Georgia</h2> <p>Waste collection is consistently <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/27/the-10-most-dangerous-jobs-in-america-according-to-bls-data.html\">ranked one of the most dangerous jobs</a> in the United States, and the coronavirus pandemic has only made matters worse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ab1333f2db3439df4e396cefc07eaee649d34178\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab1333f2db3439df4e396cefc07eaee649d34178/0_400_1200_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jerome Westpoint is a sanitation worker who says he and his colleagues are still waiting on orders to receive face masks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jerome Westpoint is a sanitation worker who says he and his colleagues are still waiting on orders to receive face masks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Teamsters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m in the industrial side of the business,\u201d said Westpoint. \u201cYou do come into contact with hazardous material, sometimes you know it, sometimes you don\u2019t because everyone doesn\u2019t tell you what they\u2019re putting in those containers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou always have those fears because we pick up at hospitals, grocery stores, places like that, and you\u2019re going house to house. We don\u2019t know what is inside those containers. All we know is there is waste in there, but we don\u2019t know if people in these homes are infected with coronavirus and we don\u2019t know how they\u2019re disposing of their waste.\u201d</p> <p>He said workers are still waiting on orders to receive face masks to wear during work hours and it took several weeks for management to impose limitations on waste pickup, such as not picking up waste outside of containers.</p> <h2>Mariah Mitchell: Lyft driver for three years in Seattle, Washington</h2> <p>Every week, Mitchell, a single mother of three, pays $265 weekly to rent a car through Lyft, which has continued to bill full payments through the coronavirus pandemic despite declines in rides. She now receives a priority day once a week where Lyft directs rides to her, equating to about 20 rides for Mitchell. The rest of the week, rides are sparse, but Mitchell is still expected to continue making her car lease payments in addition to living expenses.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no rides. You\u2019re lucky to get one,\u201d said Mitchell. The only day she\u2019s making money is on the one priority day per week she receives from Lyft, and she noted even those have decreased in pay. \u201cBefore the pandemic, I could do 20 rides and make about $10 a ride.

      "bodyText": "Roughly 16 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the wake of immediate layoffs and furloughs due to shutdowns to try to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, triggering a generational economic crisis for millions of Americans. Essential workers still on the job continue to get paid, but the stress of working as the coronavirus spreads throughout the United States is taking a heavy toll on those working in grocery stores, transportation, food service, sanitation and other areas as they risk exposure to the virus for themselves and their families. The Guardian spoke to several workers who are on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic about their recent experiences. Gail Rogers: McDonald\u2019s cashier for six years in Tampa, Florida McDonald\u2019s lobbied against paid sick leave inclusion for many of its workers in federal coronavirus relief legislation, as workers at McDonald\u2019s franchises, about 517,000 of them, receive no paid sick leave. Gail Rogers, a 60-year-old cashier and kiosk operator, is one of those workers. \u201cTwo weeks ago I had to go to the hospital because I woke up very ill. I was tested for different viruses, including the coronavirus, and then I had to go home to be quarantined. I called the hospital the next day and they let me know my test came back negative. I was cleared from that, but I am supposed to be wearing a mask. I asked my manager if I could wear a mask and was told I couldn\u2019t use a mask,\u201d said Rogers. She isn\u2019t provided any paid sick time off, health insurance benefits, or given additional hazard pay while working during the pandemic. \u201cIf we get sick, who is going to run the store? We don\u2019t want to be in a workplace where we feel they\u2019re not supporting us or they can\u2019t pay us sick leave or give us health insurance if anything critical comes up,\u201d Rogers added. McDonald\u2019s did not respond to a request for comment. Matt Monaghan: public transit bus operator for 24 years in Staten Island, New York New York is the current center of the coronavirus pandemic in the US, with more than 4,000 dead. Through the pandemic, public transit bus drivers have continued to operate regular schedules, though bus driver unions are working to develop reduced schedules with the city to protect drivers and the public from exposure to the virus. \u201cI myself have anxiety, when people are on the bus, of catching this thing. We have families to go home to and we don\u2019t want to bring it home to our families. It\u2019s tough times right now but we\u2019re doing the job and moving the city,\u201d said Monaghan. \u201cI carry my own Lysol on the bus, I disinfect what I can so I know it\u2019s done right, because I\u2019m afraid of getting this thing.\u201d Monaghan noted several bus operators have been or are currently hospitalized with coronavirus, and is hoping the bus schedules are reduced so operators can take time off to stay home. Virender Rana: Uber driver for six years in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Since the coronavirus pandemic began, Rana hasn\u2019t taken a day off in an attempt to try to make up for the earnings he\u2019s losing from the drastic decline in riders. Usually he makes $100 to $300 a day, now he\u2019s making around $50 a day for a 10- to 12-hour shift \u2013 less than minimum wage. \u201cI have no money to pay the bills. As far as the maintenance, I have a couple issues with my car, but I can\u2019t fix it at this moment because I don\u2019t have any savings,\u201d Rana said. He\u2019s unable to make his credit card payments, and won\u2019t be able to cover his upcoming car payment. Rana noted the only thing Uber has offered drivers still on the road is giving a month off their car insurance payment through Uber. \u201cWe are taking chances. We\u2019re risking our life out here, so they could at least do something to protect us, give us some type of credit, step up and do something for drivers still on the road,\u201d said Rana. \u201cEarnings are way, way down, but I\u2019m still trying. There\u2019s no appreciation, no comment from Uber, no thank you to drivers still providing services for this company. It seems they don\u2019t care if you live or you die.\u201d A spokesperson for Uber referred to a blogpost issued by the company to outline the company\u2019s pandemic support initiatives. Willy Solis: Shipt shopper since October 2019 in Dallas, Texas Solis is immunocompromised, but he\u2019s working through the coronavirus pandemic because he needs the income. He doesn\u2019t even have basic hand sanitizer and claims Shipt, a delivery service owned by Target, doesn\u2019t provide any sort of training or support for shoppers through the pandemic, aside from sending them guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He said Shipt\u2019s support services are virtually non-existent at the moment because they\u2019ve been so overrun with demand. \u201cWe have zero phone support. You call the support number, it hangs up on you. Chat is taking hours. The other option is email, and Shipt is saying it\u2019s taking them 10 days or longer to respond. We\u2019re left out here to fend for ourselves, address issues and the customer\u2019s orders as best as we can,\u201d said Solis. Tips have been decreasing, said Solis, thanks to frustrated customers, and there have been issues with tipping on the app. Shipt workers rely significantly on tips to subsidize their pay. The money he makes is \u201cnot enough to compensate for the risk we\u2019re taking and the level of support we have to expel\u201d, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re begging for support right now. Without being able to complete orders, it\u2019s causing a situation financially where we\u2019re being decimated and it\u2019s becoming worthless for us to do this job,\u201d added Solis. A Shipt spokesperson attributed delays to the increase of demand during the pandemic, and said the company is hiring more support agents and developing a way to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) for shoppers. \u201cFrom the beginning, we\u2019ve encouraged shoppers only to schedule themselves when they feel safe, and we have provided our shoppers with healthy hygiene habits recommended by the CDC,\u201d said the spokesperson. Jerome Westpoint: sanitation worker for over 40 years in Atlanta, Georgia Waste collection is consistently ranked one of the most dangerous jobs in the United States, and the coronavirus pandemic has only made matters worse. \u201cI\u2019m in the industrial side of the business,\u201d said Westpoint. \u201cYou do come into contact with hazardous material, sometimes you know it, sometimes you don\u2019t because everyone doesn\u2019t tell you what they\u2019re putting in those containers.\u201d \u201cYou always have those fears because we pick up at hospitals, grocery stores, places like that, and you\u2019re going house to house. We don\u2019t know what is inside those containers. All we know is there is waste in there, but we don\u2019t know if people in these homes are infected with coronavirus and we don\u2019t know how they\u2019re disposing of their waste.\u201d He said workers are still waiting on orders to receive face masks to wear during work hours and it took several weeks for management to impose limitations on waste pickup, such as not picking up waste outside of containers. Mariah Mitchell: Lyft driver for three years in Seattle, Washington Every week, Mitchell, a single mother of three, pays $265 weekly to rent a car through Lyft, which has continued to bill full payments through the coronavirus pandemic despite declines in rides. She now receives a priority day once a week where Lyft directs rides to her, equating to about 20 rides for Mitchell. The rest of the week, rides are sparse, but Mitchell is still expected to continue making her car lease payments in addition to living expenses. \u201cThere are no rides. You\u2019re lucky to get one,\u201d said Mitchell. The only day she\u2019s making money is on the one priority day per week she receives from Lyft, and she noted even those have decreased in pay. \u201cBefore the pandemic, I could do 20 rides and make about $10 a ride. Now the rides are about $6 per ride. It should have gone up, not down, because we\u2019re taking a risk.\u201d She\u2019s been unable to file for unemployment benefits yet, and Mitchell is concerned that she\u2019ll receive little to no benefits due to the income she is still able to make. Mitchell also explained Lyft is not providing any PPE, and it\u2019s been unavailable in the stores, making it impossible to sanitize her vehicle in between rides. A Lyft spokesperson said in an email the company is working on finding new ways for drivers to earn income, such as delivery partnerships. Joshua Spence: office janitor in Lubbock, Texas Through the coronavirus pandemic, Joshua Spence\u2019s work schedule as an office janitor hasn\u2019t changed, nor has his low pay at $8.63 an hour. He spends the majority of his time at work directed to do menial cleaning jobs as the majority of the offices are not being used, but several office workers have continued to come in through the pandemic. \u201cWe have people who shouldn\u2019t be here coming on to campus to work in their offices so they can get out of the house, violating the stay-at-home order, and I don\u2019t know where they\u2019ve been, what they\u2019ve done, or how seriously they are taking this to begin with, yet I have to be here every workday to clean everything over and over again,\u201d said Spence. \u201cEvery time folks go out unnecessarily we cleaning staff have to work extra hard and hope their carelessness won\u2019t hurt us.\u201d Eric Anderson: grocery store clerk, Mulberry, Florida Eric Anderson, 63, works at a grocery store to supplement his social security retirement income.

But it comes down to how long the PM is going to be out of action \u2013 and when the decision about the next phase [of the Covid-19 response] is going to come down the track.\u201d</p> <p>That nervousness is fuelled not just by Johnson\u2019s absence. It has been aggravated by a crunch of gears, as Downing Street, initially determined to centralise power, has been forced to delegate responsibility at a time of national crisis. And with every passing hour, the elastic connecting Johnson with the actions of his ministers is being stretched.</p> <p>According to officials, the weeks ahead will be about tweaking the dials of the response to the crisis \u2013 dozens of individual decisions that will ultimately dictate everyday life in Britain. And some of those decisions are already looming.</p> <p>In the short term at least, several sources said the machinery of government is working well enough. Even critics of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-raab\">Dominic Raab</a>, the foreign secretary leading the cabinet in Johnson\u2019s absence, have commended his performance. At the daily 9.15am meeting, now largely a video conference with cabinet ministers hosted from the cabinet room, Raab has reassured the doubters by asking the right questions. As one put it: \u201cThe power has not gone to his head.\u201d In fact, Raab\u2019s approach, according to several allies, is simply to best execute the instructions he knows Johnson has given to the cabinet.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the creation weeks ago of cabinet response sub-committees means that work streams were already in place, with the de facto \u201ccoronavirus quad\u201d of Raab, chancellor Rishi Sunak, health secretary Matt Hancock and cabinet office minister Michael Gove all looking after their own briefs. It also ensured Raab was involved from early on.</p> <p>Even on the most difficult issues, such as testing, personal protective equipment and financial aid, each minister knows the target they have been set. Clashes so far have been relatively minor, including complaints about the quality of the data flowing from the NHS. \u201cI have not felt like I\u2019ve been in a vacuum in the last week,\u201d says one person heavily involved. \u201cWe\u2019ve still had clear steers.\u201d</p> <p>Even with decisions such as whether the length of lockdown should be primarily to protect the economy or to protect lives , the Whitehall reality is currently not so stark. One of the most concerned about the overall health implications of a prolonged lockdown has been Hancock. Treasury officials are also concerned about the damage that a second spike could do if social distancing rules are relaxed too soon.</p> <p>Yet while the governing process has managed to withstand a week without the prime minister, no one doubts this has been the easy part. Trouble lies ahead, as many decisions on the functioning of Britain\u2019s pandemic response speed towards government.</p> <p>Ahead is a period that gives the lie to the idea that the Covid-19 response is dictated by \u201cthe science\u201d, as ministers have been keen to state. Work is under way to examine which lockdown measures are having most and least impact, requiring decisions on what could be dialled up and down.</p> <p>Similar academic studies are looking at the impact on mental health. The effects on health are being examined by both health and Treasury officials. The extent to which people are not using the NHS for serious non-coronavirus issues is also causing concern, requiring decisions on new public communications.</p> <p>Elsewhere, private industry is pressing to fill the gaps in Britain\u2019s ability to make a vaccine should one become available. That could require the government taking big financial risks to build factories that may ultimately be redundant. All these issues, and many more, will require political decisions that will comprise the government\u2019s strategy for the next phase of its coronavirus response. With the peak of the virus expected soon, each day that Johnson is out of action will be crucial.</p> <p>It is an irony not lost on officials that this uncertainty is happening under a No 10 regime initially determined to consolidate power. \u201cWe still have cabinet government, but what\u2019s missing is the political authority of the prime minister,\u201d said Catherine Haddon, senior fellow at the<a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/\"> Institute for Government</a>. \u201cIt is worth remembering that only a few months ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/sajid-javid-resigns-as-chancellor-amid-boris-johnson-reshuffle\">Sajid Javid resigned as chancellor</a> because No 10 and the prime minister seemed to want greater control over the Treasury. So we have a prime minister who was building up his own political power \u2013 in order to do the job he felt needed to be done.\u201d</p> <p>On top of that, officials say a system similar to a Tudor court had emerged in Downing Street. Advisers could argue their case, but only certain figures had Johnson\u2019s ear. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\">Dominic Cummings</a>, Johnson\u2019s controversial senior adviser, has been self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms, and trusted aides Ben Gascoigne and Eddie Lister have also been absent from No 10. According to some, it has focused minds on the question of who is in charge.</p> <p>Suddenly, the apparent strength acquired by No 10 is at risk of becoming a weakness, should the prime minister be absent for weeks to come. As a result, could this experience curb some of the more iconoclastic plans dreamed up by Johnson\u2019s team, such as taking on the civil service? \u201cI think having that institutional expertise, memory and strength now has come in pretty handy,\u201d said one internal critic of those plans. \u201cThere is no energy, bandwidth or money for arbitrary institutional changes. All efforts will have to go into getting the economy on its feet again. Many of the battles that were fought now seem pointless.\u201d</p>",

It has been aggravated by a crunch of gears, as Downing Street, initially determined to centralise power, has been forced to delegate responsibility at a time of national crisis. And with every passing hour, the elastic connecting Johnson with the actions of his ministers is being stretched. According to officials, the weeks ahead will be about tweaking the dials of the response to the crisis \u2013 dozens of individual decisions that will ultimately dictate everyday life in Britain. And some of those decisions are already looming. In the short term at least, several sources said the machinery of government is working well enough. Even critics of Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary leading the cabinet in Johnson\u2019s absence, have commended his performance. At the daily 9.15am meeting, now largely a video conference with cabinet ministers hosted from the cabinet room, Raab has reassured the doubters by asking the right questions. As one put it: \u201cThe power has not gone to his head.\u201d In fact, Raab\u2019s approach, according to several allies, is simply to best execute the instructions he knows Johnson has given to the cabinet. Meanwhile, the creation weeks ago of cabinet response sub-committees means that work streams were already in place, with the de facto \u201ccoronavirus quad\u201d of Raab, chancellor Rishi Sunak, health secretary Matt Hancock and cabinet office minister Michael Gove all looking after their own briefs. It also ensured Raab was involved from early on. Even on the most difficult issues, such as testing, personal protective equipment and financial aid, each minister knows the target they have been set. Clashes so far have been relatively minor, including complaints about the quality of the data flowing from the NHS. \u201cI have not felt like I\u2019ve been in a vacuum in the last week,\u201d says one person heavily involved. \u201cWe\u2019ve still had clear steers.\u201d Even with decisions such as whether the length of lockdown should be primarily to protect the economy or to protect lives , the Whitehall reality is currently not so stark. One of the most concerned about the overall health implications of a prolonged lockdown has been Hancock. Treasury officials are also concerned about the damage that a second spike could do if social distancing rules are relaxed too soon. Yet while the governing process has managed to withstand a week without the prime minister, no one doubts this has been the easy part. Trouble lies ahead, as many decisions on the functioning of Britain\u2019s pandemic response speed towards government. Ahead is a period that gives the lie to the idea that the Covid-19 response is dictated by \u201cthe science\u201d, as ministers have been keen to state. Work is under way to examine which lockdown measures are having most and least impact, requiring decisions on what could be dialled up and down. Similar academic studies are looking at the impact on mental health. The effects on health are being examined by both health and Treasury officials. The extent to which people are not using the NHS for serious non-coronavirus issues is also causing concern, requiring decisions on new public communications. Elsewhere, private industry is pressing to fill the gaps in Britain\u2019s ability to make a vaccine should one become available. That could require the government taking big financial risks to build factories that may ultimately be redundant. All these issues, and many more, will require political decisions that will comprise the government\u2019s strategy for the next phase of its coronavirus response. With the peak of the virus expected soon, each day that Johnson is out of action will be crucial. It is an irony not lost on officials that this uncertainty is happening under a No 10 regime initially determined to consolidate power. \u201cWe still have cabinet government, but what\u2019s missing is the political authority of the prime minister,\u201d said Catherine Haddon, senior fellow at the Institute for Government. \u201cIt is worth remembering that only a few months ago, Sajid Javid resigned as chancellor because No 10 and the prime minister seemed to want greater control over the Treasury. So we have a prime minister who was building up his own political power \u2013 in order to do the job he felt needed to be done.\u201d On top of that, officials say a system similar to a Tudor court had emerged in Downing Street. Advisers could argue their case, but only certain figures had Johnson\u2019s ear. However, Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s controversial senior adviser, has been self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms, and trusted aides Ben Gascoigne and Eddie Lister have also been absent from No 10. According to some, it has focused minds on the question of who is in charge. Suddenly, the apparent strength acquired by No 10 is at risk of becoming a weakness, should the prime minister be absent for weeks to come. As a result, could this experience curb some of the more iconoclastic plans dreamed up by Johnson\u2019s team, such as taking on the civil service? \u201cI think having that institutional expertise, memory and strength now has come in pretty handy,\u201d said one internal critic of those plans. \u201cThere is no energy, bandwidth or money for arbitrary institutional changes. All efforts will have to go into getting the economy on its feet again. Many of the battles that were fought now seem pointless.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 Brazil Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, is one of only a handful of world leaders who have played down Covid-19\u2019s threat, for instance by sabotaging quarantine measures imposed by nearly all of the country\u2019s state governors. \u201cIt\u2019s raining. We\u2019re going to get wet. And some are going to drown in the rain,\u201d the far-right populist shrugged last week, after dismissing the pandemic as a fantasy. That cavalier attitude has sparked nightly pot-banging protests and daily media condemnations. They accuse Bolsonaro \u2013 who apparently thinks shutting down the economy will wreck his chances of re-election \u2013 of putting his own political future before Brazilian lives. \u201cBolsonaro\u2019s reckless behaviour has earned him a position never previously enjoyed by a Brazilian president \u2013 that of international villain,\u201d one conservative broadsheet recently declared. Another paper, the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo, said Brazil needed a Winston Churchill-like statesman to offer \u201cblood, toil, tears and sweat\u201d. Unfortunately, the newspaper lamented, it had nothing of the sort. Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro Mette Frederiksen \u2013 Denmark While many of her European neighbours were fumbling around for a response, Mette Frederiksen closed her country\u2019s borders on 13 March. A few days later she closed kindergartens, schools and universities and banned gatherings of more than 10 people. This decisiveness appears to have spared Denmark the worst of the pandemic: its death toll stands at less than 250, and the number of patients being treated in hospital for coronavirus is falling. It has also marked out this skilled and successful politician, who was already the country\u2019s youngest-ever PM, as a once-in-a-generation national leader. A poll at the start of this month found that 79% of Danes thought she was doing a good job, a 40 percentage point rise on the month before. Her straight-talking speeches and clear instructions to the nation have been widely praised. She has even managed to show a sense of fun, posting a clip on Facebook of herself doing the dishes while singing along to 1980s Danish popsters Dodo and the Dodos during the nation\u2019s weekly TV lockdown singalong. Richard Orange Donald Trump \u2013 United States Donald Trump has benefited from a \u201crally round the flag effect\u201d which, in a crisis, tends to give US presidents a boost, irrespective of performance. But although 50% of Americans say they approve of his handling of the pandemic, only 37% believe he has shown strong leadership or taken decisive action. And Trump\u2019s approval rating lags some 22 points behind that of state governors and a similar margin behind many other world leaders \u2013 cause for concern in an election year. Democrats accuse the president of squandering a crucial six weeks, when he played down the virus instead of preparing for it. Ron Klain, who led Barack Obama\u2019s fight against Ebola in 2014, said: \u201cThe US response will be studied for generations as a textbook example of a disastrous, failed effort.\u201d But the president\u2019s allies take the opposite view, praising him for imposing early travel restrictions on China and Europe and overseeing a government effort that included sending hospital ships to New York and Los Angeles. America, as ever, is divided. David Smith in Washington Xi Jinping \u2013 China China\u2019s initial cover-up of the emergence of Covid-19, just when the new disease might have been easiest to contain, overshadows everything it has done since. However, its move to quarantine millions in Wuhan, the centre of the crisis, was bold, unprecedented and ultimately successful in halting the spread of the disease inside China, although at considerable human cost. The outbreak was a huge threat to Xi\u2019s authority, because of the high economic costs and the inevitable questions about governance prompted by the crisis, and he initially stayed very much in the background of containment efforts. However, once it became clear they were working, Xi has re-emerged to take full credit for the turnaround. The country\u2019s international propaganda machine is also working overtime to focus on Chinese support for countries in the middle of intense outbreaks, and muddy the waters over the origins of the virus, in a bid to counter rising anger abroad about China\u2019s initial handling of the outbreak. Emma Graham-Harrison Jacinda Ardern \u2013 New Zealand Prime minister Jacinda Ardern is good in a crisis. The mosque attacks in Christchurch, the eruption of Whakaari White Island, and now the Covid-19 crisis, which has brought only four deaths in the country so far, have proved that beyond doubt. Choosing to \u201cgo hard and go early\u201d, Ardern placed the country in total lockdown on 25 March. The decisive move shocked many Kiwis, but Ardern softened the blow using clear, empathetic language and urging everyone to \u201cbe kind\u201d to one another \u2013 a slogan now emblazoned on billboards around the country. On the first night of the lockdown, she appeared in her tracksuit on Facebook live to reassure the nation. Epidemiologist Professor Michael Baker says New Zealand\u2019s \u201celimination\u201d strategy would not have been possible without Ardern at the helm. \u201cThe brilliant, decisive and humane leadership of Jacinda Ardern was instrumental in New Zealand\u2019s rapid change in direction with its response to Covid-19, and the remarkably efficient implementation of the elimination strategy.\u201d Eleanor Ainge Roy in Dunedin Tsai Ing-wen \u2013 Taiwan Taiwan\u2019s close economic and cultural links with China should have made it extremely vulnerable to Covid-19, but it has one of the most impressive track records on containing the virus. Nearly three months after its first confirmed patient, Taiwan has recorded fewer than 400 cases, and just five deaths; its economy and schools have continued to function largely as normal. Tsai\u2019s government, helped by the lessons learned during the Sars crisis in 2003 and having Chen Chien-jen, an epidemiologist, as vice-president, took an extremely proactive approach. Screening of travellers from Wuhan began in late December, as soon as China warned of a mysterious new pneumonia. At a diplomatic level, the crisis has also helped Taiwan highlight Beijing\u2019s heavy-handed approach to excluding it from international bodies, including the World Health Organization. The world health watchdog failed to share an early Taiwanese warning of human-to-human transmission of the new virus, which could have helped global efforts to contain the disease.

      "bodyText": "Surgeons treating Covid-19 patients have a \u201cterrifying\u201d lack of personal protective equipment that is risking lives, the profession\u2019s leaders warn today. Almost a third (32.5%) of UK surgeons say they do not have access to enough masks, gowns and other clothing to keep them safe, a new survey reveals. The widespread lack of PPE for frontline staff is \u201ca disgrace\u201d, according to the Royal College of Surgeons of England, which collated the views of 1,978 surgeons and surgical trainees. \u201cThere are often young doctors and nurses, many with kids at home, putting themselves in challenging situations without proper PPE. It\u2019s not acceptable, morally or ethically, that people should put their lives at risk to do their job unless they have adequate PPE,\u201d Sue Hill, the college\u2019s vice-president, told the Observer. The findings come amid a growing row after health secretary Matt Hancock sparked controversy by urging NHS staff not to use any more PPE than is clinically justified. The Royal College of Nursing and British Medical Association criticised his remarks. Hill was responding to the college\u2019s survey, which also found: Up to 70% of surgeons in some parts of the UK have seen shortages of PPE in their hospital in the last month; Across the UK 41% of surgeons believe there is enough PPE where they work, but 39% of those in Scotland and 36% in the north-west of England report a shortage; Half of surgeons doubt they will be able to get a test to tell them if they have Covid-19. Hill, a vascular surgeon in Wales, said Hancock\u2019s pledge that millions of pieces of PPE are on order mean little to NHS staff, given the heavy usage Covid-19 involves. \u201cWhen I\u2019m operating I put on a hat, visor, proper ventilating mask, two pairs of gloves and a full-length surgical gown \u2013 six pieces of PPE. So does my assistant, two scrub nurses and two anaesthetists. That\u2019s 36 pieces of PPE for just one operation.\u201d One surgeon said the lack of masks was scandalous. They and their colleagues were \u201cspoken to\u201d by hospital managers for wearing masks and gloves when visiting patients on wards, even though one coronavirus carrier infected at least six members of staff. Another said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been sent to war but with no protective armour.\u201d Overall, 72% of surgeons believe the UK will not be able to end the three week-long lockdown until the general public can get tested for Covid-19.",

Money became tight, as did our time. I was made redundant and went back to university. Danny became a landscape gardener, but it\u2019s not exactly lucrative. Before all this, our days would just disappear: cooking, school runs, cleaning, working\u2026</p> <p>By the time Danny got in \u2013 bath and bedtime done \u2013 we\u2019d collapse on the sofa: have you paid the council tax? What\u2019s left in the joint account? Do I need to make you sandwiches tomorrow? Sleep.</p> <p>Things were different when we first got together. We never had high-flying jobs, but our time was free. Now, being in isolation, in our little cocoon, has cut us off from all the outside noise and reminded us why we\u2019ve chosen to build our lives with one another. We\u2019re teaching our son how to play the xylophone and doing silly dances to pirate songs as we jump around in the kitchen. We have space to enjoy the things we did before we became parents: making music, playing Scrabble, dressing up as people from music videos.</p> <p>We\u2019re petrified, too. All Danny\u2019s work has dried up. And we\u2019re both aware things are going to get worse. Here in the country we might be behind London, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not coming. I wake up every day and it\u2019s as if I\u2019ve forgotten what\u2019s happening. When I remember, I can\u2019t help but panic. I know our little bubble may burst, but the longer we can stay inside it the better.</p> <h2>\u2018Balmoral emailed: my proposal was off\u2019</h2> <p><em>Toby, 35,</em><em> sports commentator, London</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b86499a4560e019968431b1dcbab048c88cbf6fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b86499a4560e019968431b1dcbab048c88cbf6fe/0_69_1600_960/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Toby holding up a bottle of bubbly and Claire smiling and holding up her hand showing the ring on her finger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This wasn\u2019t quite how I planned it, but who cares\u2026 She said yes\u2019: Toby, with Claire</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Love in the time of COVID-19</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Being a romantic at heart, I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019d want to make an elaborate, romantic proposal. I\u2019ve been with Claire for nearly four years, and I decided I wanted to marry her quite early on.</p> <p>She loves the royals and all things historical, so one evening I Googled \u201cWhere was the Queen proposed to?\u201d Turns out it was Balmoral. I got to work putting a plan together and booked a surprise trip to Scotland for 1 April. As the date edged closer, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">coronavirus</a> situation worsened. I was determined it would happen, but then Balmoral emailed: our visit was off.</p> <p>I had no intention of proposing in the living room when I woke up that morning. Claire was trying (and failing) to use an app to learn how to count to 10 in Italian. I told myself: if she manages to do it, I\u2019ll propose. Eventually she reached 10 \u2013 and I knew what I had to do.</p> <p>I grabbed the ring, but my mind went fuzzy and I started to cry. She pointed out that my flies were undone. Yet, somehow I managed to propose.</p> <p>We called our families as soon as the ring was on her finger and our friends organised drinks on Zoom. Yes, the whole thing is tinged with worry and this wasn\u2019t quite how I\u2019d planned it, but who cares? She said yes.</p> <h2>\u2018Infidelity makes you resourceful\u2019</h2> <p><em>Jack, 48, media technician, southeast England</em></p> <p>I\u2019ve been married 25 years and have had a relationship with another woman for seven. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of, all the deceit and concealment. But you can\u2019t help who you fall in love with. I\u2019ve never wanted to rip apart my family, because there are children involved. To stay or to go, which is kinder? It\u2019s a dilemma that\u2019s more common than you\u2019d think.</p> <p>We both have spouses, but before the lockdown we\u2019d carve out time to speak to and see each other at lunchtimes, in the evenings, whenever. We\u2019ve gone from constant communication and contact to struggling to find enough privacy to send a quick text.</p> <p>We\u2019ve seen each other once since this began, albeit very briefly. She doesn\u2019t live close by, so it took a fair bit of lying. We found a country park and went for a walk, but we couldn\u2019t be long. Disappearing off into different directions for who knows how long has been heartbreaking. We haven\u2019t made a plan to meet again yet, but we will. I know there\u2019s a lockdown, but being in this type of relationship makes you incredibly resourceful.</p> <p>I manage not to dwell too much on what I\u2019m doing when life is busy. We\u2019ve got our routine, which means we can overlook things which cause discomfort. But now we\u2019re all slowing down, you can\u2019t help but think a little more. I\u2019m realising I\u2019m making myself miserable by not being with the person I love, to protect my family. But being stuck in the house, it\u2019s clear my unhappiness is affecting my wife and the children. I\u2019ve been too much of a coward.</p> <p>We discussed leaving our partners at great length a few years ago, but there was always another set of exams, another big date in the diary. Now we\u2019re all staring at our own mortality, and it\u2019s the oldest adage in the book: life is too short. If we get through this, I think we\u2019ll have to make a go of it. If this lockdown lasts a few more weeks I\u2019m sure we can wait, but if it\u2019s six months? I\u2019m not sure I can handle it.</p> <h2>\u2018My flatmate has been relentlessly flirtatious\u2019</h2> <p><em>Ashley, 28, marketing executive, London</em></p> <p>I didn\u2019t think about him in that way at first, when I moved into the flat-share a few weeks back. I heard there was a room going through a friend and, after one of those awkward housemate interviews, I got the call to tell me the place was mine if I wanted it.</p> <p>When we\u2019d chatted over beer, one of the boys had mentioned he was gay and I told him that I was, too. He seemed cool \u2013 quite good looking, clever, sporty \u2013 but I can\u2019t say I fancied him. When I got round to moving my stuff in, he was on holiday. By the time he got back, the new measures had already started. Within a few days, the lockdown was in full swing.</p> <p>From day one of being back he\u2019s been full on: very touchy-feely and relentlessly flirtatious. He makes a point of helping me stretch when we work out together in the garden. He\u2019ll tiptoe up behind me and put his hands on my hips while I cook.</p> <p>\u201cI bet I can guess what you\u2019re about to do,\u201d he jokes when I head alone to my room. \u201cMaybe I can give you a helping hand.\u201d He laughs in a way that hides whether or not he\u2019s joking. I\u2019m pretty certain he\u2019s coming on to me, but it\u2019s impossible to be sure. It\u2019s all insinuation and innuendo.</p> <p>In normal circumstances I wouldn\u2019t hook up with a housemate \u2013 it gets messy. Plus, his room is on one side of the flat, mine on the other. The third housemate is right in between \u2013 getting off with some privacy would be a logistical nightmare. And it\u2019s possible being a tease is just his character. Imagine how awkward it would be to make a move and be rejected. Still, I think a crush is forming, although maybe that\u2019s just because he\u2019s now my only option. The last few times we\u2019ve had a drink our other housemate has gone to bed early leaving just the two of us. We sit very close, hand-touches-leg, eyes meeting momentarily.</p> <p>Next time that happens I think I\u2019ll just go for it \u2013 the prospect of no sex for months outweighs the risk of potential humiliation. Maybe it\u2019ll add a bit of excitement to our newly mundane existence. And, worst case, I can move out when this is all over. It would just be a relief to have something, well someone, to do.</p> <h2>\u2018I couldn\u2019t risk being the one to infect him\u2019</h2> <p><em>Sarah, 58, hospital pharmacist, London</em></p> <p>At first I told my husband to take some obvious precautions: don\u2019t take the tube, wash your hands regularly. Working on the frontline as a pharmacist in a busy London hospital, I\u2019d seen the epidemic developing firsthand.</p> <p>My husband is quite a bit older than me and given my job I\u2019ve always known I might come into contact with coronavirus. I was worried I\u2019d bring it home and I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being the one to infect him.</p> <p>We talked about him moving out of our home temporarily, although he wasn\u2019t keen. Not just because it seemed a pain, he didn\u2019t want me to worry. Last week I concluded it was for the best, it would make me less paranoid and him \u2013 I hope \u2013 a little safer.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t too hard to arrange. A friend not far away offered him plenty of space. One morning he dropped me off at work, then went to pack his bags. He was gone by the time I arrived home. I\u2019ve kept one of the dogs, he took the others.</p> <p>We haven\u2019t spent more than a few nights apart in our 20 years together. It\u2019s difficult for both of us: he wants to be there to support me as things get worse, but now feels helpless. When I come home after a difficult day, there\u2019s nobody to talk to.</p> <p>In the evenings we catch up, although there isn\u2019t much to say. His days have become repetitive, mine quite depressing. I come home exhausted, feed the dog, eat in front of the TV and then I\u2019m sleeping. Weekends alone feel very strange.</p> <p>What we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t special. I\u2019m sure anyone working in the NHS \u2013 who could \u2013 would do it. Hopefully it\u2019ll all be over before too long, and in a few months we\u2019ll be reunited. It\u2019s just with the weeks stretching out, I don\u2019t know when this might end, or when I might see him. And I already miss having him around.</p> <h2>\u2018My beautiful whirlwind romance is on pause\u2019</h2> <p><em>Juan, 34, photographer, Berlin</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"749cab3f21ebebf261189eccdd16a38b126fc241\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/749cab3f21ebebf261189eccdd16a38b126fc241/27_68_1720_1032/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Juan holding up his camera\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s fair to say I\u2019ve been unlucky in love\u2019: Juan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Love in the time of COVID-19</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s fair to say I\u2019ve been unlucky in love. Berlin isn\u2019t a city that lends itself to meaningful and long-term relationships. I\u2019m on and off different dating apps; when I\u2019m lonely I click download and then quickly remember why I deleted them. On a rare occasion while swiping a month ago I matched with a guy who was incredibly cute. \u201cOh, what a treat,\u201d I messaged him \u2013 my super-lame opener.</p> <p>We started chatting and right away I could tell there was a spark. We talked as if we\u2019d known each other forever. I normally find it too much to meet up with someone on the first day, but there was something to explore, so we made a plan to meet that night.</p> <p>We grabbed a kebab and walked around the neighbourhood for hours. Everything felt so right: from his Irish accent to his looks and dorky sense of humour. For me the whole evening felt special, something different. We kissed at the end, so I guess he thought it went well, too.</p> <p>From then on the texting was constant. After missing a flight two days later (I went to the wrong airport), I messaged him. He told me to come to his apartment and we cooked dim sum \u2013 already he was there to pick me up when I needed him.</p> <p>After a few more dates I went into voluntary self-isolation. We\u2019ve only met up once since then to walk in the park \u2013 no touching, which was tough \u2013 and now the city is in lockdown. It feels as if this beautiful whirlwind romance is on pause. For the past few weeks I\u2019ve wanted to message him constantly, but I don\u2019t want to overdo it or come across as clingy. I worry that what was developing into something special might stagnate.</p> <p>Today, though, I got a text. He asked if I wanted to take a bike ride next week with him. I said yes immediately. If we\u2019re still allowed to head out, and if it goes well, I might just suggest we bite the bullet and quarantine together for a while. That way there\u2019s no risk it fizzles out, and God knows I could do with the physical contact.</p> <h2>\u2018Our relationship has returned to the internet\u2019</h2> <p><em>Oliver, 14</em><em>,</em> <em>student, Chester</em></p> <p>We met online playing Fortnite nine months ago \u2013 and a week later I asked her out. We\u2019re at the same school and so we\u2019d see each other every day. When the schools closed, I didn\u2019t want to freak her out by making a big deal that this could be the last time I saw her.</p> <p>The other day she walked past my house with her mum, so we talked from each end of the driveway. We usually go to one of our houses after school on Thursday, so we\u2019ve agreed \u2013 for as long as we can \u2013 that\u2019s the day one of us will walk to wave at the other. It\u2019s funny, I met her in a video game and asked her out on Instagram. Now, in this strange situation, our relationship has returned to the internet.</p> <h2>\u2018We cancelled our golden anniversary\u2019</h2> <p><em>Judith, 74, retired schoolteacher, Shrewsbury</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31cc435e40cca0029d0c5d43934d4ce3bd3c8970\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31cc435e40cca0029d0c5d43934d4ce3bd3c8970/0_118_2520_1512/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Judith and Peter, dressed in smart party clothes, in their living room with chintz curtains\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019d planned a proper party, but we cancelled\u2019: Judith, with Peter</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Love in the time of COVID-19</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn\u2019t quite the celebration we\u2019d been hoping for. The two of us sheltering from the cold in the doorway, my daughter six feet away in the driveway shouting congratulations. It was 50 years since Peter and I got married. As golden wedding anniversaries go, ours ended up a little underwhelming.</p> <p>We\u2019d planned a proper party, but once the government made it clear this was a pandemic and over-70s like us have to stay indoors, we cancelled. Instead, on the day, we had breakfast and wished each other a happy anniversary. I opened up the cards and uploaded some photos from our wedding day to Facebook. As the comments rolled in we reminisced: our honeymoon in Scarborough; the happy days spent with the kids playing in our old family home in Yorkshire.</p> <p>I\u2019ll never forget buying our first LP together: Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s <em>Bridge </em><em>over Troubled Water</em>. I asked our Alexa to play it as we sat on the sofa. We had a listen, although not much of a dance. With two replacement knees and a replacement hip (with another on the way), we can\u2019t move like we used to. My son called and we all toasted with champagne over FaceTime.</p> <p>We\u2019ve made a promise to do it properly once this awful time is over, but it won\u2019t be the same. For now, though, we\u2019re warm, we\u2019re well and we\u2019ve got enough food and alcohol to keep us going.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m trapped with the man who betrayed me\u2019</h2> <p><em>Aaron, 32, hospital secretary, Texas</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06b1ef42715c61ae1b173aac5499c316b691854d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06b1ef42715c61ae1b173aac5499c316b691854d/0_0_720_540/500..jpg\" alt=\"Aaron smiling and holding her dog\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Turns out he\u2019d been at it for years\u2019: Aaron</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: OBSERVER MAGAZINE/Aaron Bailey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was only six weeks ago \u2013 after working a late shift at my hospital job \u2013 that I found out my husband was cheating on me. He wasn\u2019t responding to my texts and I was worried he\u2019d had another road traffic accident (he wrote off our old car a month earlier), so when my shift ended I used the vehicle tracking software built into the new car to check in on him. I found his car, and watched him leave her apartment block.</p> <p>We got married six years ago in June, but turns out he\u2019d been at it for years. I left our home to stay with friends and family. I needed space to think \u2013 and to work out a plan. Six days later, and still in shock, I got a call: my grandpa had died. I returned from the funeral prepared: we\u2019d divorce and part ways forever. The marriage was over.</p> <p>But just days after touching back down in Texas the pandemic hit. Both people I\u2019d been staying with live in high-risk households, so I couldn\u2019t go back to them. I work in a Covid-designated unit.</p> <p>The problem is that he has nowhere to go \u2013 he\u2019s alienated himself for years \u2013 and I can\u2019t just throw him on to the street in this situation. Once this is over, he\u2019ll be out the door, but I wouldn\u2019t wish the virus on anyone. And anyway, I\u2019d have had to change the locks to kick him out, and I\u2019ve been working so many hours, there\u2019s been no time to make it to the hardware store.</p> <p>So I\u2019m back living in the house with him, constantly drained and exhausted from all the overtime. I\u2019ll talk with him about groceries and how we\u2019re doing for money \u2013 and that is all. I think he knows better than to try and come near me, I can barely look at him. The only time I get alone is walking the dogs, or when I call my counsellor from my car in the driveway. It\u2019s isolating and I\u2019m hurting.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had to go into survival mode. I\u2019m an extrovert by nature, hugs from loved ones are my fix-all. Not being able to be held closely because of the pandemic\u2026 it\u2019s torture. I\u2019m avoiding all unnecessary human contact, keeping clear of all public spaces, just in case I\u2019m a carrier.</p> <p>All I needed was some time \u2013 to sell our house, pay off my student debts, then start afresh \u2013 and instead I\u2019m trapped living with the man who betrayed me.</p> <h2>\u2018At nighttime, the loneliness hits\u2019</h2> <p><em>Amrita, 43, researcher, New Jersey and Sweden</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89482bae8d170f975dc1ef438927b33c9918c377\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89482bae8d170f975dc1ef438927b33c9918c377/0_0_959_1199/800..jpg\" alt=\"Amrita and Christian.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Our wedding had been planned for July \u2013 that\u2019s not happening\u2019: Amrita, with Christian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Love in the time of COVID-19</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In summer 2017 I upped sticks from the US to start my new job in Sweden. A few weeks in \u2013 struggling with the language while ordering a coffee \u2013 a man in the queue behind jumped in to help me. We started talking, he introduced himself as Christian. We\u2019ve been together for two and half years, and he proposed last April.</p> <p>I settled in quickly, but my teenage son missed America. I decided to stay, and he headed home to be with his dad. Since then I\u2019ve been splitting my time between both countries. In early March, I made a trip to the US. Once I arrived, things started to get worse: my speaking engagements were cancelled, my son\u2019s school closed. Then my flight got cancelled. I booked a new one, but when the day came my boy was feeling insecure and I couldn\u2019t leave him. I arranged a new ticket, but the plane never took off.</p> <p>I sometimes wonder if Christian really understands the severity of what it means to live in a state of emergency. Things are different in Sweden: he\u2019s still going to work and can pop out for a walk or to a caf\u00e9 in the evening.</p> <p>Days start in lightness, we send jokey texts. It\u2019s at nighttime, when we\u2019d normally be together, that the choking loneliness hits. Our wedding was planned for July, although now that\u2019s definitely not happening. It breaks my heart to have no idea when I\u2019ll see him again.</p> <h2>\u2018Our relationship has had to mature quickly\u2019</h2> <p><em>Mikayla, 19, student, New Hampshire</em></p> <p>As soon as I met Dalton, I knew I had to convince him we were soulmates. We started college last September and lived in the same halls of residence. At a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\" title=\"\">Bernie Sanders</a> rally he turned to me and asked: \u201cWhen are we going to stop pretending we aren\u2019t perfect for one another?\u201d It wasn\u2019t until February that we officially got together.</p> <p>It was like being in a movie. The weather was warm and we had all the time in the world ahead of us. Then we got an email: there\u2019s coronavirus in New Hampshire, and you have to go home. My family lives out of state and to get there I\u2019d have to transfer at a busy airport. The last thing I wanted to do was put myself, or others, at risk.</p> <p>I was panicking, but Dalton told me not to worry: I should come home and move in with him and his family. I\u2019d met his dad only briefly and our relationship was a few weeks old.</p> <p>It\u2019s intense what we\u2019re going through, and takes a lot of communication. Our relationship has had to mature really quickly. One of us makes dinner and the other does the dishes. We share a room, so that needs tidying. Groceries need buying. The intrigue of what our future might be like is no longer a romantic mystery. That\u2019s reassuring for both of us \u2013 if we can get through this, we can get through anything.

      "bodyText": "\u2018It\u2019s reminded us why we chose one another\u2019 Catherine, 36, mature student, Conwy For the past few years, our lives have been stretched after we moved to Wales from London, when I got pregnant. Money became tight, as did our time. I was made redundant and went back to university. Danny became a landscape gardener, but it\u2019s not exactly lucrative. Before all this, our days would just disappear: cooking, school runs, cleaning, working\u2026 By the time Danny got in \u2013 bath and bedtime done \u2013 we\u2019d collapse on the sofa: have you paid the council tax? What\u2019s left in the joint account? Do I need to make you sandwiches tomorrow? Sleep. Things were different when we first got together. We never had high-flying jobs, but our time was free. Now, being in isolation, in our little cocoon, has cut us off from all the outside noise and reminded us why we\u2019ve chosen to build our lives with one another. We\u2019re teaching our son how to play the xylophone and doing silly dances to pirate songs as we jump around in the kitchen. We have space to enjoy the things we did before we became parents: making music, playing Scrabble, dressing up as people from music videos. We\u2019re petrified, too. All Danny\u2019s work has dried up. And we\u2019re both aware things are going to get worse. Here in the country we might be behind London, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not coming. I wake up every day and it\u2019s as if I\u2019ve forgotten what\u2019s happening. When I remember, I can\u2019t help but panic. I know our little bubble may burst, but the longer we can stay inside it the better. \u2018Balmoral emailed: my proposal was off\u2019 Toby, 35, sports commentator, London Being a romantic at heart, I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019d want to make an elaborate, romantic proposal. I\u2019ve been with Claire for nearly four years, and I decided I wanted to marry her quite early on. She loves the royals and all things historical, so one evening I Googled \u201cWhere was the Queen proposed to?\u201d Turns out it was Balmoral. I got to work putting a plan together and booked a surprise trip to Scotland for 1 April. As the date edged closer, the coronavirus situation worsened. I was determined it would happen, but then Balmoral emailed: our visit was off. I had no intention of proposing in the living room when I woke up that morning. Claire was trying (and failing) to use an app to learn how to count to 10 in Italian. I told myself: if she manages to do it, I\u2019ll propose. Eventually she reached 10 \u2013 and I knew what I had to do. I grabbed the ring, but my mind went fuzzy and I started to cry. She pointed out that my flies were undone. Yet, somehow I managed to propose. We called our families as soon as the ring was on her finger and our friends organised drinks on Zoom. Yes, the whole thing is tinged with worry and this wasn\u2019t quite how I\u2019d planned it, but who cares? She said yes. \u2018Infidelity makes you resourceful\u2019 Jack, 48, media technician, southeast England I\u2019ve been married 25 years and have had a relationship with another woman for seven. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of, all the deceit and concealment. But you can\u2019t help who you fall in love with. I\u2019ve never wanted to rip apart my family, because there are children involved. To stay or to go, which is kinder? It\u2019s a dilemma that\u2019s more common than you\u2019d think. We both have spouses, but before the lockdown we\u2019d carve out time to speak to and see each other at lunchtimes, in the evenings, whenever. We\u2019ve gone from constant communication and contact to struggling to find enough privacy to send a quick text. We\u2019ve seen each other once since this began, albeit very briefly. She doesn\u2019t live close by, so it took a fair bit of lying. We found a country park and went for a walk, but we couldn\u2019t be long. Disappearing off into different directions for who knows how long has been heartbreaking. We haven\u2019t made a plan to meet again yet, but we will. I know there\u2019s a lockdown, but being in this type of relationship makes you incredibly resourceful. I manage not to dwell too much on what I\u2019m doing when life is busy. We\u2019ve got our routine, which means we can overlook things which cause discomfort. But now we\u2019re all slowing down, you can\u2019t help but think a little more. I\u2019m realising I\u2019m making myself miserable by not being with the person I love, to protect my family. But being stuck in the house, it\u2019s clear my unhappiness is affecting my wife and the children. I\u2019ve been too much of a coward. We discussed leaving our partners at great length a few years ago, but there was always another set of exams, another big date in the diary. Now we\u2019re all staring at our own mortality, and it\u2019s the oldest adage in the book: life is too short. If we get through this, I think we\u2019ll have to make a go of it. If this lockdown lasts a few more weeks I\u2019m sure we can wait, but if it\u2019s six months? I\u2019m not sure I can handle it. \u2018My flatmate has been relentlessly flirtatious\u2019 Ashley, 28, marketing executive, London I didn\u2019t think about him in that way at first, when I moved into the flat-share a few weeks back. I heard there was a room going through a friend and, after one of those awkward housemate interviews, I got the call to tell me the place was mine if I wanted it. When we\u2019d chatted over beer, one of the boys had mentioned he was gay and I told him that I was, too. He seemed cool \u2013 quite good looking, clever, sporty \u2013 but I can\u2019t say I fancied him. When I got round to moving my stuff in, he was on holiday. By the time he got back, the new measures had already started. Within a few days, the lockdown was in full swing. From day one of being back he\u2019s been full on: very touchy-feely and relentlessly flirtatious. He makes a point of helping me stretch when we work out together in the garden. He\u2019ll tiptoe up behind me and put his hands on my hips while I cook. \u201cI bet I can guess what you\u2019re about to do,\u201d he jokes when I head alone to my room. \u201cMaybe I can give you a helping hand.\u201d He laughs in a way that hides whether or not he\u2019s joking. I\u2019m pretty certain he\u2019s coming on to me, but it\u2019s impossible to be sure. It\u2019s all insinuation and innuendo. In normal circumstances I wouldn\u2019t hook up with a housemate \u2013 it gets messy. Plus, his room is on one side of the flat, mine on the other. The third housemate is right in between \u2013 getting off with some privacy would be a logistical nightmare. And it\u2019s possible being a tease is just his character. Imagine how awkward it would be to make a move and be rejected. Still, I think a crush is forming, although maybe that\u2019s just because he\u2019s now my only option. The last few times we\u2019ve had a drink our other housemate has gone to bed early leaving just the two of us. We sit very close, hand-touches-leg, eyes meeting momentarily. Next time that happens I think I\u2019ll just go for it \u2013 the prospect of no sex for months outweighs the risk of potential humiliation. Maybe it\u2019ll add a bit of excitement to our newly mundane existence. And, worst case, I can move out when this is all over. It would just be a relief to have something, well someone, to do. \u2018I couldn\u2019t risk being the one to infect him\u2019 Sarah, 58, hospital pharmacist, London At first I told my husband to take some obvious precautions: don\u2019t take the tube, wash your hands regularly. Working on the frontline as a pharmacist in a busy London hospital, I\u2019d seen the epidemic developing firsthand. My husband is quite a bit older than me and given my job I\u2019ve always known I might come into contact with coronavirus. I was worried I\u2019d bring it home and I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being the one to infect him. We talked about him moving out of our home temporarily, although he wasn\u2019t keen. Not just because it seemed a pain, he didn\u2019t want me to worry. Last week I concluded it was for the best, it would make me less paranoid and him \u2013 I hope \u2013 a little safer. It wasn\u2019t too hard to arrange. A friend not far away offered him plenty of space. One morning he dropped me off at work, then went to pack his bags. He was gone by the time I arrived home. I\u2019ve kept one of the dogs, he took the others. We haven\u2019t spent more than a few nights apart in our 20 years together. It\u2019s difficult for both of us: he wants to be there to support me as things get worse, but now feels helpless. When I come home after a difficult day, there\u2019s nobody to talk to. In the evenings we catch up, although there isn\u2019t much to say. His days have become repetitive, mine quite depressing. I come home exhausted, feed the dog, eat in front of the TV and then I\u2019m sleeping. Weekends alone feel very strange. What we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t special. I\u2019m sure anyone working in the NHS \u2013 who could \u2013 would do it. Hopefully it\u2019ll all be over before too long, and in a few months we\u2019ll be reunited. It\u2019s just with the weeks stretching out, I don\u2019t know when this might end, or when I might see him. And I already miss having him around. \u2018My beautiful whirlwind romance is on pause\u2019 Juan, 34, photographer, Berlin It\u2019s fair to say I\u2019ve been unlucky in love. Berlin isn\u2019t a city that lends itself to meaningful and long-term relationships. I\u2019m on and off different dating apps; when I\u2019m lonely I click download and then quickly remember why I deleted them. On a rare occasion while swiping a month ago I matched with a guy who was incredibly cute. \u201cOh, what a treat,\u201d I messaged him \u2013 my super-lame opener. We started chatting and right away I could tell there was a spark. We talked as if we\u2019d known each other forever. I normally find it too much to meet up with someone on the first day, but there was something to explore, so we made a plan to meet that night. We grabbed a kebab and walked around the neighbourhood for hours. Everything felt so right: from his Irish accent to his looks and dorky sense of humour. For me the whole evening felt special, something different. We kissed at the end, so I guess he thought it went well, too. From then on the texting was constant. After missing a flight two days later (I went to the wrong airport), I messaged him. He told me to come to his apartment and we cooked dim sum \u2013 already he was there to pick me up when I needed him. After a few more dates I went into voluntary self-isolation. We\u2019ve only met up once since then to walk in the park \u2013 no touching, which was tough \u2013 and now the city is in lockdown. It feels as if this beautiful whirlwind romance is on pause. For the past few weeks I\u2019ve wanted to message him constantly, but I don\u2019t want to overdo it or come across as clingy. I worry that what was developing into something special might stagnate. Today, though, I got a text. He asked if I wanted to take a bike ride next week with him. I said yes immediately. If we\u2019re still allowed to head out, and if it goes well, I might just suggest we bite the bullet and quarantine together for a while. That way there\u2019s no risk it fizzles out, and God knows I could do with the physical contact. \u2018Our relationship has returned to the internet\u2019 Oliver, 14, student, Chester We met online playing Fortnite nine months ago \u2013 and a week later I asked her out. We\u2019re at the same school and so we\u2019d see each other every day. When the schools closed, I didn\u2019t want to freak her out by making a big deal that this could be the last time I saw her. The other day she walked past my house with her mum, so we talked from each end of the driveway. We usually go to one of our houses after school on Thursday, so we\u2019ve agreed \u2013 for as long as we can \u2013 that\u2019s the day one of us will walk to wave at the other. It\u2019s funny, I met her in a video game and asked her out on Instagram. Now, in this strange situation, our relationship has returned to the internet. \u2018We cancelled our golden anniversary\u2019 Judith, 74, retired schoolteacher, Shrewsbury It wasn\u2019t quite the celebration we\u2019d been hoping for. The two of us sheltering from the cold in the doorway, my daughter six feet away in the driveway shouting congratulations. It was 50 years since Peter and I got married. As golden wedding anniversaries go, ours ended up a little underwhelming. We\u2019d planned a proper party, but once the government made it clear this was a pandemic and over-70s like us have to stay indoors, we cancelled. Instead, on the day, we had breakfast and wished each other a happy anniversary. I opened up the cards and uploaded some photos from our wedding day to Facebook. As the comments rolled in we reminisced: our honeymoon in Scarborough; the happy days spent with the kids playing in our old family home in Yorkshire. I\u2019ll never forget buying our first LP together: Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s Bridge over Troubled Water. I asked our Alexa to play it as we sat on the sofa. We had a listen, although not much of a dance. With two replacement knees and a replacement hip (with another on the way), we can\u2019t move like we used to. My son called and we all toasted with champagne over FaceTime. We\u2019ve made a promise to do it properly once this awful time is over, but it won\u2019t be the same. For now, though, we\u2019re warm, we\u2019re well and we\u2019ve got enough food and alcohol to keep us going. \u2018I\u2019m trapped with the man who betrayed me\u2019 Aaron, 32, hospital secretary, Texas It was only six weeks ago \u2013 after working a late shift at my hospital job \u2013 that I found out my husband was cheating on me. He wasn\u2019t responding to my texts and I was worried he\u2019d had another road traffic accident (he wrote off our old car a month earlier), so when my shift ended I used the vehicle tracking software built into the new car to check in on him. I found his car, and watched him leave her apartment block. We got married six years ago in June, but turns out he\u2019d been at it for years. I left our home to stay with friends and family. I needed space to think \u2013 and to work out a plan. Six days later, and still in shock, I got a call: my grandpa had died. I returned from the funeral prepared: we\u2019d divorce and part ways forever. The marriage was over. But just days after touching back down in Texas the pandemic hit. Both people I\u2019d been staying with live in high-risk households, so I couldn\u2019t go back to them. I work in a Covid-designated unit. The problem is that he has nowhere to go \u2013 he\u2019s alienated himself for years \u2013 and I can\u2019t just throw him on to the street in this situation. Once this is over, he\u2019ll be out the door, but I wouldn\u2019t wish the virus on anyone. And anyway, I\u2019d have had to change the locks to kick him out, and I\u2019ve been working so many hours, there\u2019s been no time to make it to the hardware store. So I\u2019m back living in the house with him, constantly drained and exhausted from all the overtime. I\u2019ll talk with him about groceries and how we\u2019re doing for money \u2013 and that is all. I think he knows better than to try and come near me, I can barely look at him. The only time I get alone is walking the dogs, or when I call my counsellor from my car in the driveway. It\u2019s isolating and I\u2019m hurting. I\u2019ve had to go into survival mode. I\u2019m an extrovert by nature, hugs from loved ones are my fix-all. Not being able to be held closely because of the pandemic\u2026 it\u2019s torture. I\u2019m avoiding all unnecessary human contact, keeping clear of all public spaces, just in case I\u2019m a carrier. All I needed was some time \u2013 to sell our house, pay off my student debts, then start afresh \u2013 and instead I\u2019m trapped living with the man who betrayed me. \u2018At nighttime, the loneliness hits\u2019 Amrita, 43, researcher, New Jersey and Sweden In summer 2017 I upped sticks from the US to start my new job in Sweden. A few weeks in \u2013 struggling with the language while ordering a coffee \u2013 a man in the queue behind jumped in to help me. We started talking, he introduced himself as Christian. We\u2019ve been together for two and half years, and he proposed last April. I settled in quickly, but my teenage son missed America. I decided to stay, and he headed home to be with his dad. Since then I\u2019ve been splitting my time between both countries. In early March, I made a trip to the US. Once I arrived, things started to get worse: my speaking engagements were cancelled, my son\u2019s school closed. Then my flight got cancelled. I booked a new one, but when the day came my boy was feeling insecure and I couldn\u2019t leave him. I arranged a new ticket, but the plane never took off. I sometimes wonder if Christian really understands the severity of what it means to live in a state of emergency. Things are different in Sweden: he\u2019s still going to work and can pop out for a walk or to a caf\u00e9 in the evening. Days start in lightness, we send jokey texts. It\u2019s at nighttime, when we\u2019d normally be together, that the choking loneliness hits. Our wedding was planned for July, although now that\u2019s definitely not happening. It breaks my heart to have no idea when I\u2019ll see him again. \u2018Our relationship has had to mature quickly\u2019 Mikayla, 19, student, New Hampshire As soon as I met Dalton, I knew I had to convince him we were soulmates. We started college last September and lived in the same halls of residence. At a Bernie Sanders rally he turned to me and asked: \u201cWhen are we going to stop pretending we aren\u2019t perfect for one another?\u201d It wasn\u2019t until February that we officially got together. It was like being in a movie. The weather was warm and we had all the time in the world ahead of us. Then we got an email: there\u2019s coronavirus in New Hampshire, and you have to go home. My family lives out of state and to get there I\u2019d have to transfer at a busy airport. The last thing I wanted to do was put myself, or others, at risk. I was panicking, but Dalton told me not to worry: I should come home and move in with him and his family. I\u2019d met his dad only briefly and our relationship was a few weeks old. It\u2019s intense what we\u2019re going through, and takes a lot of communication. Our relationship has had to mature really quickly. One of us makes dinner and the other does the dishes. We share a room, so that needs tidying. Groceries need buying. The intrigue of what our future might be like is no longer a romantic mystery. That\u2019s reassuring for both of us \u2013 if we can get through this, we can get through anything. I\u2019ve had strong feelings since the day we met, but seeing Dalton with his family and pets has made me fall even more in love with him. Through this scary time he has become my rock. \u2018I wonder if we\u2019re being more honest online\u2019 Robyn, 30, project co-ordinator, Bristol When Boris Johnson announced lockdown, I re-downloaded [dating app] Hinge in a panic. A week earlier I\u2019d decided I was done with online dating. I\u2019d try to meet someone in real life. Then my plans were scuppered. It\u2019s weird to be single and know you won\u2019t meet anyone new for ages \u2013 being certain there\u2019ll be no one to be close to as things get worse. Going through the profiles, most of the bios felt irrelevant: you like coffee and going to the gym? Not any more. Already some were adapting to this weird new world. Ideal first date? Quarantine and chill. What do you look for in a partner? No tight chest, cough or high fever. I\u2019m not sure what I was looking for. Someone to help me get through this uncertainty? Something to pass the time? Even if I did find someone, it could be months until I ever met them. Surely the novelty would wear off. It was a relief to remember small talk when I started chatting. After speaking with one guy for a while he suggested we have a video date. Not seeing his face, keeping that air of mystery, was exciting. \u201cLet\u2019s have a phone date to start,\u201d I replied. It\u2019s like a quick drink \u2013 you don\u2019t want to commit and there\u2019s potential to build some anticipation. I realised as soon as he rang how much I usually rely on first-date flirtation. How I value smells and touch, and how kindly a potential partner treats strangers. We had to just talk. It lasted an hour, although I didn\u2019t notice. I think we\u2019re ready to progress to video. That throws up a whole load of questions. Eating dinner alone in our respective living rooms feels funny. But drinking? That should help with the nerves. I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to dress up. When else am I going to get the chance to wear lipstick in the foreseeable future? I stopped digital dating because it all felt so transient. A place for fun and a quick ego boost, but nothing deeper. I\u2019m not sure if my opinion has changed although we\u2019re in such a state of uncertainty now, I wonder if we\u2019re all being more honest online. There\u2019s no time for bravado and bullshit, none of that matters, and just being fit simply won\u2019t cut it\u2026 I want to know how you\u2019re coping as the world collapses, to hear something real.

      "body": "<p>Though fans will hope and trust that a TV adaptation of Sally Rooney\u2019s <em>Normal People</em> would not shy from the novel\u2019s sexual intimacies, it keeps us waiting a while \u2013 it is not until the second episode that undercover teenage lovers Connell and Marianne get under the covers for the first time. For a few seconds, it all seems to be going comically wrong, as her arms and her ponytail flail above her head, trapped in her pull-off bra. But then her face emerges, shiny with trust and desire, and the fireworks begin. \u201cI love that scene,\u201d says Daisy Edgar-Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s so awkward. For me, it is the most representative love scene I\u2019ve ever seen. Connell is so kind and giving and safe with her that it\u2019s a very healthy depiction of what first-time sex can look like.\u201d</p> <p>This might make it sound a bit PG, but as her co-star Paul Mescal quickly chips in: \u201cIt\u2019s not clinical. It\u2019s loving and romantic and sexy because you see two minds coming together.\u201d To describe the adaptation as hotly anticipated is an understatement. Rooney herself has co-scripted six of the episodes in collaboration with award-winning playwright and story editor on series two of HBO\u2019s <em>Succession</em> Alice Birch, who recalls \u201choovering up\u201d the novel in a jetlagged blur and immediately emailing her agent to say she was desperate to adapt it. \u201cI felt very emotional about those two people. I don\u2019t often have this feeling. In our industry, we can be quite quick to enjoy a book and then immediately think about how to hack it to bits for the screen.\u201d</p> <p>Birch is in good company. Practically as soon as Rooney hit the literary world with her debut novel <em>Conversations </em><em>With Friends</em> in 2017, she became a calling card for anyone who aspired to be seen as culturally attuned. Her novels were Instagrammed alongside chai lattes atop piles of on-trend books. She was name-dropped on Twitter by actors Lena Dunham and Sarah Jessica Parker, was featured in Florence + the Machine\u2019s fan book club, and was ranked high in books of the year charts by British <em>Vogue</em> and <em>O, The Oprah</em> <em>Magazine</em>. But she was also recognised as a writer\u2019s writer. \u201cIt is a long time since I cared so much about two characters on a page,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/it-is-time-to-take-a-sharp-inhale-people-sally-rooney-s-normal-people-is-superb-1.3608184\">wrote author Anne Enright</a><a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/it-is-time-to-take-a-sharp-inhale-people-sally-rooney-s-normal-people-is-superb-1.3608184\"> in the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/it-is-time-to-take-a-sharp-inhale-people-sally-rooney-s-normal-people-is-superb-1.3608184\">Irish Times</a>,</em> when <em>Normal People</em> was published a year later.</p> <p>Novelist and playwright Sebastian Barry, who took over from Enright as laureate for Irish fiction, says: \u201cThere is a uniqueness in Sally Rooney, not only in her absolutely crystal clear style, but also in her universal success. It is difficult to identify a comparable moment in Irish writing, both in its breadth and its immediacy, unless you can go back to the impact that the novel, and more particularly the film, of Roddy Doyle\u2019s <em>The Commitments</em> had in the early 1990s. There are other equally radiant careers, more conventionally spread over decades, like Anne Enright\u2019s, or Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s, but the suddenness of Sally Rooney, the almost abrupt arrival, reminds me more of a figure like Martin McDonagh in the theatre. There is a time before Sally Rooney and a time after.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p5yY0qdsWg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4p5yY0qdsWg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p5yY0qdsWg&amp;feature=emb_logo\">Watch a trailer for Normal People.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The sales figures are huge for a literary novel, with <em>Normal People</em> running through seven editions, selling nearly 500,000 copies in the UK and 76,000 in Ireland, according to industry analysts Nielsen Bookscan. Translation rights have been sold into 41 languages. No pressure, then, on Edgar-Jones and Mescal, who are well aware that they are playing two of the most coveted TV roles in the world for their peers right now.</p> <p>Marianne and Connell are a couple striving to find each other through a fog of class, social status and their own failures to communicate. Connell\u2019s mother cleans Marianne\u2019s house. At their secondary school in Sligo, he is a popular sporting hero, while she is the scratchy school swot. Their attraction is as much intellectual as it is sexual, as they learn when they rediscover each other at university in Dublin, by which time their status has reversed: in this rarefied new ambience, she is the cool beauty, while he is the bristly outsider.</p> <p>The series marks the screen debut of Mescal, the 24-year-old son of a garda and a schoolteacher from County Kildare, who made his first professional appearance as an earlier charismatic outsider, Jay Gatsby, at Dublin\u2019s Gate theatre. He was appearing at another Dublin theatre, the Abbey, when he heard <em>Normal People</em> was being cast. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those parts that you know quickly will be big. I was around a lot of Irish actors at the time and we all felt we were Connell, in a sense,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Edgar-Jones, a 21-year-old Londoner whose mother is from Northern Ireland, is a relative TV veteran, who made her debut at 17 in the revival of the vintage comedy <em>Cold Feet</em>. She overheard a friend auditioning for the part at her kitchen table. \u201cAnd I thought: \u2018Hmm, that sounds good.\u2019 Then I got the book and I just fell in love with it. The stakes were really high because I thought: \u2018Oh my God, I love this more than I\u2019ve loved anything. I really want this part.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"490332ee5ba1bfc2f0a443a712c0e907ffb82702\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/490332ee5ba1bfc2f0a443a712c0e907ffb82702/0_298_4488_2694/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Mescal as Connell and Daisy Edgar-Jones as Marianne in Normal People.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Mescal as Connell and Daisy Edgar-Jones as Marianne in Normal People.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Enda Bowe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all that they seem a natural on-screen match, the casting process was as technical in its way as a stud farm vetting, involving \u201cchemistry reads\u201d both together and separately to find out whether the onscreen magnetism worked. Mescal was first to be cast, emerging from a big pool of actors over several rounds of auditions. Edgar-Jones got down to the last five on the strength of a \u201cself-tape\u201d that she had hurriedly recorded in a lunch break from another show. They have clearly become good friends. \u201cWhen Daisy walked into the room for the chemistry read, I immediately thought: \u2018That\u2019s who I imagined Marianne to look like,\u201d says Mescal.</p> <p>\u201cI saw Paul and thought: \u2018I know everything about you!\u2019 Which is stupid, because he\u2019s not Connell,\u201d adds Edgar-Jones.</p> <p>The fact that this instant recognition was the product of such a painstaking selection process seems entirely in keeping with the Rooney project: for all that her novels have been hailed as an emanation of the zeitgeist, they are also steeped in classic protocols. \u201c<em>Normal People</em> has the engine of a 19th-century novel,\u201d wrote Enright. \u201cThere is an encompassing sense of authority in the voice that makes it more terrible when the characters\u2019 lives start to slip away from them\u2026 Rooney is completely in control.\u201d There\u2019s a streak of DH Lawrence in the interraction of hunky sports jock Connell and poor little rich girl Marianne, just as there\u2019s a daub of Doris Lessing\u2019s <em>The Golden Notebook</em> in their determination to find their own political and erotic space (though true to Rooney\u2019s adversarial intelligence as a former debating champion, it\u2019s Connell who precociously name-drops the novel, rather than Marianne).</p> <p>The drama unfolds over four years \u2013 sweeping the lovers from school through university to the brink of their adult lives. One might have expected it to be adapted into a lush feature film, but instead it arrives in 12 half-hour TV episodes. The Oscar-nominated Irish film-maker Lenny Abrahamson, who co-directs the series, continues the story. \u201cIt used to be that only sitcoms were half an hour and if you wanted to tell a dramatic story, it had to be an hour. But we really liked the idea of short episodes, because it allows you to be single-focused,\u201d he explains, citing that first climactic sex scene: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have had that density of focus over an hour.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25c12230f8a8281a23318e453b6991b1d646cc4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25c12230f8a8281a23318e453b6991b1d646cc4b/0_32_6000_3602/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daisy Edgar-Jones as Marianne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daisy Edgar-Jones as Marianne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Enda Bowe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen I hear the phrase \u2018sex scene\u2019, I think about a dialogue scene,\u201d Rooney told one interviewer. \u201cWhat do these characters want to say to each other? I won\u2019t just write a scene where two characters say words to each other randomly. Similarly, sex scenes have to actually play some dramatic role.\u201d <em>Irish Times</em> columnist and author Fintan O\u2019Toole picks up her point, saying: \u201cActually she reminds me of Chekhov in the acute, subtle and nonjudgmental way she calibrates human desires and foibles and self-delusions. She\u2019s not solipsistic \u2013 big things are going on underneath the intimacies: social class, money, gender, power. I think she\u2019s hit a nerve right now because we\u2019re in a moment when there\u2019s a heightened awareness that desire and sex cannot be extricated from all of these things. She\u2019s creating love stories for a post-romantic age.\u201d</p> <p>But the representation of those love stories is inevitably different in a novel, which deals in words, and on film, where articulacy lies in the manipulation of the human body. \u201cThe sex was a big challenge and we took it really seriously from the beginning,\u201d says Abrahamson. \u201cWhat we would aim to show, but also literally how we would do the sex in a way that was positive, safe and healthy for everyone involved both in front of and behind the camera.\u201d</p> <p>Not least of the challenges was the issue of asymmetry \u2013 of both gender and status \u2013 which has cast such a shadow over the media world in the era of #MeToo. The theatre, film and TV director Hettie Macdonald is responsible for six of the episodes. \u201cI wanted to make it a more gender-balanced crew right from the start,\u201d says Abrahamson. \u201cIt\u2019s often the case that crews are very male-dominated, especially in the camera department, and I\u2019m beginning to see that there\u2019s less and less reason for that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut here\u2019s the biggest thing for me,\u201dhe adds. \u201cI\u2019m in my 50s and as far as the young actors are concerned, I\u2019m successful. My worry would be \u2013 because I\u2019m squeamish about ever doing anything uncomfortable for them \u2013 that they would feel under pressure to do what I wanted, and my fear of that would stop me from asking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e138133738e7b331c28167406eff21811e585a65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e138133738e7b331c28167406eff21811e585a65/0_52_769_461/500..jpg\" alt=\"Behind the scenes on the shoot.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Behind the scenes on the shoot, with Lenny Abrahamson second from left and cinematographer Suzie Lavelle second from right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The breakthrough was the decision to hire the services of \u201cintimacy co-ordinator\u201d Ita O\u2019Brien. \u201cI was anxious to start with because I thought the most subtle and important moments would be between me and the actors,\u201d admits Abrahamson. \u201cBut what\u2019s brilliant is that she would come in and talk to the whole crew and production about simple things like not using euphemisms, about getting explicit consent every time you\u2019re about to do something and finding a language to talk about lovemaking, and the shapes and moods of it, that is empowering for the people involved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s the go-to,\u201d agrees Mescal. \u201cShe\u2019s brilliant,\u201d says Edgar-Jones. \u201cThe sex scenes were a joy to us because it was her job to worry about how it would work and we just turned up, did the choreography and carried on. We just had to think about the emotional beats.\u201d</p> <p>For Edgar-Jones, this sensitivity extends importantly to the use of nudity. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really happy with is that there\u2019s an equal representation of both our bodies. Paul is equally exposed. When we\u2019re in a scene and topless, it\u2019s different for Paul than it is for me, so that it\u2019s nice that there are shots where we are both fully nude! It means that there\u2019s more of a balance, gender-wise.\u201d One of the puzzling features of the intense identification of readers with Connell and Marianne is that they inhabit a pretty rarefied cultural niche, with its own intellectual and political snobberies. They discuss critical theory and <em>The Communist Manifesto</em> and despise fellow students who don\u2019t put in the reading. At school, Marianne turns her loneliness into an arrogant aloofness which is part of her appeal to Connell, making more popular girls seem dull and samey. Rooney herself has said she had expected the novels only to appeal to \u201cpeople who share my ideology or have a similarly jaundiced view of social systems.\u201d</p> <p>How does this aspect of the story connect with its young stars? \u201cI definitely related to Marianne at school in some ways, particularly the perception she thinks other people have of her, and playing with whether she can change that,\u201d says Edgar-Jones. \u201cI went to a very small school [the independent Mount school for girls in north London]. You grow so much as a person from 11 to 16, and by the end I felt I was fundamentally different to who I was when I began, but my friends only ever saw how I was when I was 11. When I did my first course at the National Youth Theatre at 15, suddenly, there were loads of people who were passionate about the same things, so I was able to colour in the shape I had grown into.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd0a21378b69ba54d5db9a77169507fc313b6ad7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd0a21378b69ba54d5db9a77169507fc313b6ad7/0_595_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sally Rooney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When I hear the phrase \u201csex scene\u201d, I think about a dialogue scene\u2019: Sally Rooney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Buchan/Variety/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mescal, like Connell in the film, was an academically bright Gaelic football star, who decided to veer off in an unexpected direction \u2013 in his case by taking himself off to the Lir Academy, a drama school attached to Trinity College Dublin. \u201cThat stepping out can make you feel quite naked for a while. I had no prior conception of what drama school, or a life in acting, was going to look like,\u201d he says. The university social scene is treated with a particular disdain by Rooney as a place of privileged poseurs. \u201cI was off-campus on the Conservatoire side of training, but when you venture on campus and you go to house parties, you definitely feel that degree of performance that we see at those house parties in the book. The social class performance\u2026 Sally really captures that,\u201d says Mescal.</p> <p>But in one respect the characters are quite separate from their generation. \u201cIt is funny because this has been called a millennial novel but they don\u2019t meet over a dating app,\u201d points out Edgar-Jones. \u201cThey meet in real life and they have real conversations. They don\u2019t do that much texting, they talk. That\u2019s healthy and exciting and important to show that it does still happen. We\u2019re not all chatting over Facebook Messenger, we do still have intimate, face-to-face relationships.\u201d</p> <p>Rooney herself has said she\u2019s more involved with social media than Connell and Marianne, though she abandoned her pugnacious Twitter account in 2019 with a parting line that would do Marianne proud: \u201cjust for clarity, I continue to agree with all your good opinions and disagree with your bad ones (of which I\u2019m sad to say there are many)\u201d.</p> <p>Mescal admits: \u201cMy experience of myself and my peers is that Connell and Marianne are in the minority. I do think intimacy and intimate relationships are more difficult in general because of social media and dating apps. I find that slightly depressing and scary because you\u2019re constantly aware of presenting yourself, and then your human contact with people becomes very different.

      "bodyText": "Though fans will hope and trust that a TV adaptation of Sally Rooney\u2019s Normal People would not shy from the novel\u2019s sexual intimacies, it keeps us waiting a while \u2013 it is not until the second episode that undercover teenage lovers Connell and Marianne get under the covers for the first time. For a few seconds, it all seems to be going comically wrong, as her arms and her ponytail flail above her head, trapped in her pull-off bra. But then her face emerges, shiny with trust and desire, and the fireworks begin. \u201cI love that scene,\u201d says Daisy Edgar-Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s so awkward. For me, it is the most representative love scene I\u2019ve ever seen. Connell is so kind and giving and safe with her that it\u2019s a very healthy depiction of what first-time sex can look like.\u201d This might make it sound a bit PG, but as her co-star Paul Mescal quickly chips in: \u201cIt\u2019s not clinical. It\u2019s loving and romantic and sexy because you see two minds coming together.\u201d To describe the adaptation as hotly anticipated is an understatement. Rooney herself has co-scripted six of the episodes in collaboration with award-winning playwright and story editor on series two of HBO\u2019s Succession Alice Birch, who recalls \u201choovering up\u201d the novel in a jetlagged blur and immediately emailing her agent to say she was desperate to adapt it. \u201cI felt very emotional about those two people. I don\u2019t often have this feeling. In our industry, we can be quite quick to enjoy a book and then immediately think about how to hack it to bits for the screen.\u201d Birch is in good company. Practically as soon as Rooney hit the literary world with her debut novel Conversations With Friends in 2017, she became a calling card for anyone who aspired to be seen as culturally attuned. Her novels were Instagrammed alongside chai lattes atop piles of on-trend books. She was name-dropped on Twitter by actors Lena Dunham and Sarah Jessica Parker, was featured in Florence + the Machine\u2019s fan book club, and was ranked high in books of the year charts by British Vogue and O, The Oprah Magazine. But she was also recognised as a writer\u2019s writer. \u201cIt is a long time since I cared so much about two characters on a page,\u201d wrote author Anne Enright in the Irish Times, when Normal People was published a year later. Novelist and playwright Sebastian Barry, who took over from Enright as laureate for Irish fiction, says: \u201cThere is a uniqueness in Sally Rooney, not only in her absolutely crystal clear style, but also in her universal success. It is difficult to identify a comparable moment in Irish writing, both in its breadth and its immediacy, unless you can go back to the impact that the novel, and more particularly the film, of Roddy Doyle\u2019s The Commitments had in the early 1990s. There are other equally radiant careers, more conventionally spread over decades, like Anne Enright\u2019s, or Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s, but the suddenness of Sally Rooney, the almost abrupt arrival, reminds me more of a figure like Martin McDonagh in the theatre. There is a time before Sally Rooney and a time after.\u201d The sales figures are huge for a literary novel, with Normal People running through seven editions, selling nearly 500,000 copies in the UK and 76,000 in Ireland, according to industry analysts Nielsen Bookscan. Translation rights have been sold into 41 languages. No pressure, then, on Edgar-Jones and Mescal, who are well aware that they are playing two of the most coveted TV roles in the world for their peers right now. Marianne and Connell are a couple striving to find each other through a fog of class, social status and their own failures to communicate. Connell\u2019s mother cleans Marianne\u2019s house. At their secondary school in Sligo, he is a popular sporting hero, while she is the scratchy school swot. Their attraction is as much intellectual as it is sexual, as they learn when they rediscover each other at university in Dublin, by which time their status has reversed: in this rarefied new ambience, she is the cool beauty, while he is the bristly outsider. The series marks the screen debut of Mescal, the 24-year-old son of a garda and a schoolteacher from County Kildare, who made his first professional appearance as an earlier charismatic outsider, Jay Gatsby, at Dublin\u2019s Gate theatre. He was appearing at another Dublin theatre, the Abbey, when he heard Normal People was being cast. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those parts that you know quickly will be big. I was around a lot of Irish actors at the time and we all felt we were Connell, in a sense,\u201d he says. Edgar-Jones, a 21-year-old Londoner whose mother is from Northern Ireland, is a relative TV veteran, who made her debut at 17 in the revival of the vintage comedy Cold Feet. She overheard a friend auditioning for the part at her kitchen table. \u201cAnd I thought: \u2018Hmm, that sounds good.\u2019 Then I got the book and I just fell in love with it. The stakes were really high because I thought: \u2018Oh my God, I love this more than I\u2019ve loved anything. I really want this part.\u2019\u201d For all that they seem a natural on-screen match, the casting process was as technical in its way as a stud farm vetting, involving \u201cchemistry reads\u201d both together and separately to find out whether the onscreen magnetism worked. Mescal was first to be cast, emerging from a big pool of actors over several rounds of auditions. Edgar-Jones got down to the last five on the strength of a \u201cself-tape\u201d that she had hurriedly recorded in a lunch break from another show. They have clearly become good friends. \u201cWhen Daisy walked into the room for the chemistry read, I immediately thought: \u2018That\u2019s who I imagined Marianne to look like,\u201d says Mescal. \u201cI saw Paul and thought: \u2018I know everything about you!\u2019 Which is stupid, because he\u2019s not Connell,\u201d adds Edgar-Jones. The fact that this instant recognition was the product of such a painstaking selection process seems entirely in keeping with the Rooney project: for all that her novels have been hailed as an emanation of the zeitgeist, they are also steeped in classic protocols. \u201cNormal People has the engine of a 19th-century novel,\u201d wrote Enright. \u201cThere is an encompassing sense of authority in the voice that makes it more terrible when the characters\u2019 lives start to slip away from them\u2026 Rooney is completely in control.\u201d There\u2019s a streak of DH Lawrence in the interraction of hunky sports jock Connell and poor little rich girl Marianne, just as there\u2019s a daub of Doris Lessing\u2019s The Golden Notebook in their determination to find their own political and erotic space (though true to Rooney\u2019s adversarial intelligence as a former debating champion, it\u2019s Connell who precociously name-drops the novel, rather than Marianne). The drama unfolds over four years \u2013 sweeping the lovers from school through university to the brink of their adult lives. One might have expected it to be adapted into a lush feature film, but instead it arrives in 12 half-hour TV episodes. The Oscar-nominated Irish film-maker Lenny Abrahamson, who co-directs the series, continues the story. \u201cIt used to be that only sitcoms were half an hour and if you wanted to tell a dramatic story, it had to be an hour. But we really liked the idea of short episodes, because it allows you to be single-focused,\u201d he explains, citing that first climactic sex scene: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have had that density of focus over an hour.\u201d \u201cWhen I hear the phrase \u2018sex scene\u2019, I think about a dialogue scene,\u201d Rooney told one interviewer. \u201cWhat do these characters want to say to each other? I won\u2019t just write a scene where two characters say words to each other randomly. Similarly, sex scenes have to actually play some dramatic role.\u201d Irish Times columnist and author Fintan O\u2019Toole picks up her point, saying: \u201cActually she reminds me of Chekhov in the acute, subtle and nonjudgmental way she calibrates human desires and foibles and self-delusions. She\u2019s not solipsistic \u2013 big things are going on underneath the intimacies: social class, money, gender, power. I think she\u2019s hit a nerve right now because we\u2019re in a moment when there\u2019s a heightened awareness that desire and sex cannot be extricated from all of these things. She\u2019s creating love stories for a post-romantic age.\u201d But the representation of those love stories is inevitably different in a novel, which deals in words, and on film, where articulacy lies in the manipulation of the human body. \u201cThe sex was a big challenge and we took it really seriously from the beginning,\u201d says Abrahamson. \u201cWhat we would aim to show, but also literally how we would do the sex in a way that was positive, safe and healthy for everyone involved both in front of and behind the camera.\u201d Not least of the challenges was the issue of asymmetry \u2013 of both gender and status \u2013 which has cast such a shadow over the media world in the era of #MeToo. The theatre, film and TV director Hettie Macdonald is responsible for six of the episodes. \u201cI wanted to make it a more gender-balanced crew right from the start,\u201d says Abrahamson. \u201cIt\u2019s often the case that crews are very male-dominated, especially in the camera department, and I\u2019m beginning to see that there\u2019s less and less reason for that.\u201d \u201cBut here\u2019s the biggest thing for me,\u201dhe adds. \u201cI\u2019m in my 50s and as far as the young actors are concerned, I\u2019m successful. My worry would be \u2013 because I\u2019m squeamish about ever doing anything uncomfortable for them \u2013 that they would feel under pressure to do what I wanted, and my fear of that would stop me from asking.\u201d The breakthrough was the decision to hire the services of \u201cintimacy co-ordinator\u201d Ita O\u2019Brien. \u201cI was anxious to start with because I thought the most subtle and important moments would be between me and the actors,\u201d admits Abrahamson. \u201cBut what\u2019s brilliant is that she would come in and talk to the whole crew and production about simple things like not using euphemisms, about getting explicit consent every time you\u2019re about to do something and finding a language to talk about lovemaking, and the shapes and moods of it, that is empowering for the people involved.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s the go-to,\u201d agrees Mescal. \u201cShe\u2019s brilliant,\u201d says Edgar-Jones. \u201cThe sex scenes were a joy to us because it was her job to worry about how it would work and we just turned up, did the choreography and carried on. We just had to think about the emotional beats.\u201d For Edgar-Jones, this sensitivity extends importantly to the use of nudity. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really happy with is that there\u2019s an equal representation of both our bodies. Paul is equally exposed. When we\u2019re in a scene and topless, it\u2019s different for Paul than it is for me, so that it\u2019s nice that there are shots where we are both fully nude! It means that there\u2019s more of a balance, gender-wise.\u201d One of the puzzling features of the intense identification of readers with Connell and Marianne is that they inhabit a pretty rarefied cultural niche, with its own intellectual and political snobberies. They discuss critical theory and The Communist Manifesto and despise fellow students who don\u2019t put in the reading. At school, Marianne turns her loneliness into an arrogant aloofness which is part of her appeal to Connell, making more popular girls seem dull and samey. Rooney herself has said she had expected the novels only to appeal to \u201cpeople who share my ideology or have a similarly jaundiced view of social systems.\u201d How does this aspect of the story connect with its young stars? \u201cI definitely related to Marianne at school in some ways, particularly the perception she thinks other people have of her, and playing with whether she can change that,\u201d says Edgar-Jones. \u201cI went to a very small school [the independent Mount school for girls in north London]. You grow so much as a person from 11 to 16, and by the end I felt I was fundamentally different to who I was when I began, but my friends only ever saw how I was when I was 11. When I did my first course at the National Youth Theatre at 15, suddenly, there were loads of people who were passionate about the same things, so I was able to colour in the shape I had grown into.\u201d Mescal, like Connell in the film, was an academically bright Gaelic football star, who decided to veer off in an unexpected direction \u2013 in his case by taking himself off to the Lir Academy, a drama school attached to Trinity College Dublin. \u201cThat stepping out can make you feel quite naked for a while. I had no prior conception of what drama school, or a life in acting, was going to look like,\u201d he says. The university social scene is treated with a particular disdain by Rooney as a place of privileged poseurs. \u201cI was off-campus on the Conservatoire side of training, but when you venture on campus and you go to house parties, you definitely feel that degree of performance that we see at those house parties in the book. The social class performance\u2026 Sally really captures that,\u201d says Mescal. But in one respect the characters are quite separate from their generation. \u201cIt is funny because this has been called a millennial novel but they don\u2019t meet over a dating app,\u201d points out Edgar-Jones. \u201cThey meet in real life and they have real conversations. They don\u2019t do that much texting, they talk. That\u2019s healthy and exciting and important to show that it does still happen. We\u2019re not all chatting over Facebook Messenger, we do still have intimate, face-to-face relationships.\u201d Rooney herself has said she\u2019s more involved with social media than Connell and Marianne, though she abandoned her pugnacious Twitter account in 2019 with a parting line that would do Marianne proud: \u201cjust for clarity, I continue to agree with all your good opinions and disagree with your bad ones (of which I\u2019m sad to say there are many)\u201d. Mescal admits: \u201cMy experience of myself and my peers is that Connell and Marianne are in the minority. I do think intimacy and intimate relationships are more difficult in general because of social media and dating apps. I find that slightly depressing and scary because you\u2019re constantly aware of presenting yourself, and then your human contact with people becomes very different. I think Connell and Marianne are exemplary examples of not doing that. We shouldn\u2019t forget that sometimes the best place to meet somebody is at a bar rather than over a phone.\u201d Which brings us to the question of anxiety, to which both lovers are prone. \u201cI do feel like anxiety is more prevalent among young people,\u201d admits Edgar-Jones. \u201cI feel more pressure to be living a life according to what I\u2019m exposed to, what I see on social media \u2013 a perfect, positive life. I sometimes feel stressed when I see all my friends hanging out, for example if I\u2019m self-employed and at home with nothing to do. But in a positive way, I\u2019m really grateful to social media and what it\u2019s done to exposing us to different ways of life and different views, allowing us to have bigger dialogues.\u201d Mescal adds: \u201cI think there\u2019s a greater financial pressure on people our age. There\u2019s a likelihood that we will be renting for the vast majority, if not all, of our life. That\u2019s just a shift in society that does lend itself a kind of\u2026 what\u2019s it called? A durability. As millennials, we have built up a durability to just take what comes and make the best of it. We\u2019ve known no different in that sense.\u201d The interview is taking place in London, where both actors are now based, just as social distancing is coming into force.

      "body": "<p>Yesterday, I had a conversation with the delivery driver, who I must have seen many times before but have never really talked to. We told each other to keep safe; I said I was grateful for all he was doing and he said \u201cbless you\u201d and blew me a kiss. I talked, at a distance, with the postman. I went to the supermarket and in the snaking, spaced queue, I chatted to the person in front, the person behind and the one to my side and it was like a rueful little party. I talked through the glass to the woman at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/undervalued-heroes-coronavirus-crisis-cleaners-supermarket-workers\">the checkout</a> and she told me how she was feeling about her new duties and how she was tired out.</p> <p>I talked across the hedge to my 85-year-old neighbour when I delivered his milk and vegetables and he gave me a little plant in a pot that he\u2019d grown as a thank you. I rang a friend to tell her I loved her. I smiled at the stranger on the other side of the road and she waved at me, because it felt like we were suddenly friends, made so by going through the same experience together, the one everyone is going through, kept apart by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/09/how-coronavirus-changed-the-world-in-three-months-video\">the virus</a> and yet drawn together by it.</p> <p>I can\u2019t see my daughter, who\u2019s a doctor and working all hours. I can\u2019t see my mother, in her late 80s and frail and doughty, who I want to put my arms around. But in this radically rearranged world of ours, I am suddenly seeing people who were always there but I have been blind to and I am belatedly learning to value them as they should always have been valued. In these days of fear and loss, everybody is dependent on the kindness of strangers.</p> <p>At Easter, families expect to come together, friends to gather, congregations to kneel in collective prayer. But the music has stopped and here we are, each of us suspended in our particular place, as if time had also stopped, the giddy momentum of life halted.</p> <p>Some are with people they love; some with people they need to escape but cannot; others are quite alone. Some are privileged enough to have a garden and open spaces; others are pinned in tiny rooms. Some are suffering unimaginable hardships and losses. All of us are living in a profoundly changed world, where we can no longer go where we choose, see who we want, hug who we will, feel safe, think of the body as a source of desire and comfort and connection.</p> <p>Humans need connection - we are social animals and exist in a network of reciprocal relationships. Solitary confinement is a form of torture that can swiftly drive people mad: locked into the cell of the self, the world does not reach them and they cannot reach out into the world. Words need to be heard, pain recognised, joy shared. Loneliness is hazardous.</p> <p>These past extraordinary weeks have shown how much we yearn for connection and also how ingenious, funny, imaginative, heartbreakingly generous and kind people can be in maintaining it in spite of imposed isolation. Skype and FaceTime and Houseparty and Zoom (whoever had heard of Zoom in February? Not me); competitions and online quizzes, board games, long-distance drinks and dinners, room crawls, online lessons, energetic workouts and yoga sessions, stitched-together concerts with each musician in their own room and yet fused by the music they produce, blogs and vlogs and old-fashioned phone calls, emails and handwritten letters, invitations to imitate a work of art, share a recipe, learn a poem\u2026</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Humans need connection - we are social animals and exist in a network of reciprocal relationships</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More than this, I have heard over and over how people say they are talking to each other now \u2013 talking as they never have before, revealing themselves. It is as if a skin has been peeled away; sometimes painfully, we have come face to face with our own vulnerability and precariousness. A <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-boy-death-hospital-london-youngest-uk-ismail-abdulwahab-a9439526.html\">boy dies in hospital</a> without his family and is buried without them; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/07/care-home-residents-connected-in-lockdown\">relatives look through </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/07/care-home-residents-connected-in-lockdown\">window</a>s at their loved ones in residential homes; people say goodbye to the gravely ill by Skype.</p> <p>We can no longer pretend to ourselves we are self-sufficient, autonomous, invincible and in control. More helpless, more exposed, more reliant on the generosity of others and aware of our own mortality, we can speak things we previously kept hidden. We can ask ourselves what really matters, in this world of ours that we all hold in common.</p> <p>Loneliness is a grief, sometimes a kind of despair. It is possible that during these coronavirus days, the profoundly lonely in our society have felt less so. People are talking to them now; neighbours they have never previously met are knocking on their door and offering to help or are asking for their help. A mighty collective experience draws everyone together and the brief, crisis-driven experience of isolation may have given us more empathetic understanding of what it is to be truly alone and on the margins of society.</p> <p>These days will come to an end. We will be able to travel the country, swim in the sea, sit in each other\u2019s rooms, lean over tables in restaurants and pubs, dance, hug each other at last with bodies that are no longer contagious. But we mustn\u2019t go back to the world that we were living in before or unlearn the hard-won lessons of collaboration, kindness, empathy and human vulnerability. We mustn\u2019t stop seeing and valuing the delivery driver, the hospital cleaner, the residential worker, the woman at the checkout, the neighbour over the fence, the stranger on the other side of the road, the person in need, the old and the frail and the forgotten, those hidden in life\u2019s shadows.</p> <p>When this is over, there will still be the isolated and lonely, who for a few months may have been included in a shared purpose and collective experience. Easter, for those with faith and those without, is a festival of life and death. It\u2019s about redemption and it asks what it means to be human. In the midst of fear and helplessness and loss, because of fear and helplessness and loss, we can begin to change. We can do it better. No going back.</p> <p>\u2022 Nicci Gerrard is an Observer journalist and the author of What Dementia Teaches Us About Love</p>",

      "bodyText": "Yesterday, I had a conversation with the delivery driver, who I must have seen many times before but have never really talked to. We told each other to keep safe; I said I was grateful for all he was doing and he said \u201cbless you\u201d and blew me a kiss. I talked, at a distance, with the postman. I went to the supermarket and in the snaking, spaced queue, I chatted to the person in front, the person behind and the one to my side and it was like a rueful little party. I talked through the glass to the woman at the checkout and she told me how she was feeling about her new duties and how she was tired out. I talked across the hedge to my 85-year-old neighbour when I delivered his milk and vegetables and he gave me a little plant in a pot that he\u2019d grown as a thank you. I rang a friend to tell her I loved her. I smiled at the stranger on the other side of the road and she waved at me, because it felt like we were suddenly friends, made so by going through the same experience together, the one everyone is going through, kept apart by the virus and yet drawn together by it. I can\u2019t see my daughter, who\u2019s a doctor and working all hours. I can\u2019t see my mother, in her late 80s and frail and doughty, who I want to put my arms around. But in this radically rearranged world of ours, I am suddenly seeing people who were always there but I have been blind to and I am belatedly learning to value them as they should always have been valued. In these days of fear and loss, everybody is dependent on the kindness of strangers. At Easter, families expect to come together, friends to gather, congregations to kneel in collective prayer. But the music has stopped and here we are, each of us suspended in our particular place, as if time had also stopped, the giddy momentum of life halted. Some are with people they love; some with people they need to escape but cannot; others are quite alone. Some are privileged enough to have a garden and open spaces; others are pinned in tiny rooms. Some are suffering unimaginable hardships and losses. All of us are living in a profoundly changed world, where we can no longer go where we choose, see who we want, hug who we will, feel safe, think of the body as a source of desire and comfort and connection. Humans need connection - we are social animals and exist in a network of reciprocal relationships. Solitary confinement is a form of torture that can swiftly drive people mad: locked into the cell of the self, the world does not reach them and they cannot reach out into the world. Words need to be heard, pain recognised, joy shared. Loneliness is hazardous. These past extraordinary weeks have shown how much we yearn for connection and also how ingenious, funny, imaginative, heartbreakingly generous and kind people can be in maintaining it in spite of imposed isolation. Skype and FaceTime and Houseparty and Zoom (whoever had heard of Zoom in February? Not me); competitions and online quizzes, board games, long-distance drinks and dinners, room crawls, online lessons, energetic workouts and yoga sessions, stitched-together concerts with each musician in their own room and yet fused by the music they produce, blogs and vlogs and old-fashioned phone calls, emails and handwritten letters, invitations to imitate a work of art, share a recipe, learn a poem\u2026 More than this, I have heard over and over how people say they are talking to each other now \u2013 talking as they never have before, revealing themselves. It is as if a skin has been peeled away; sometimes painfully, we have come face to face with our own vulnerability and precariousness. A boy dies in hospital without his family and is buried without them; relatives look through windows at their loved ones in residential homes; people say goodbye to the gravely ill by Skype. We can no longer pretend to ourselves we are self-sufficient, autonomous, invincible and in control. More helpless, more exposed, more reliant on the generosity of others and aware of our own mortality, we can speak things we previously kept hidden. We can ask ourselves what really matters, in this world of ours that we all hold in common. Loneliness is a grief, sometimes a kind of despair. It is possible that during these coronavirus days, the profoundly lonely in our society have felt less so. People are talking to them now; neighbours they have never previously met are knocking on their door and offering to help or are asking for their help. A mighty collective experience draws everyone together and the brief, crisis-driven experience of isolation may have given us more empathetic understanding of what it is to be truly alone and on the margins of society. These days will come to an end. We will be able to travel the country, swim in the sea, sit in each other\u2019s rooms, lean over tables in restaurants and pubs, dance, hug each other at last with bodies that are no longer contagious. But we mustn\u2019t go back to the world that we were living in before or unlearn the hard-won lessons of collaboration, kindness, empathy and human vulnerability. We mustn\u2019t stop seeing and valuing the delivery driver, the hospital cleaner, the residential worker, the woman at the checkout, the neighbour over the fence, the stranger on the other side of the road, the person in need, the old and the frail and the forgotten, those hidden in life\u2019s shadows. When this is over, there will still be the isolated and lonely, who for a few months may have been included in a shared purpose and collective experience. Easter, for those with faith and those without, is a festival of life and death. It\u2019s about redemption and it asks what it means to be human. In the midst of fear and helplessness and loss, because of fear and helplessness and loss, we can begin to change. We can do it better. No going back. \u2022 Nicci Gerrard is an Observer journalist and the author of What Dementia Teaches Us About Love",

      "body": "<p>At the time of the February cabinet reshuffle, eight weeks and an eternity ago, I was talking to a senior Tory about the power structure of the government. He remarked: \u201cBoris is not primus inter pares. He is first without equals. He is president, he is lord of all he surveys. The cabinet are just nodding dogs.\u201d As if to illustrate this, President Johnson let TV cameras into the cabinet room to film his <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-nhs-campaign-lies-cabinet-meeting-ministers-hospitals-a9250011.html\">ministers performing</a> a ridiculous nursery school call and response about their manifesto promises.</p> <p>The \u201clord of all he surveys\u201d is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/10/coronavirus-uk-live-boris-johnson-still-in-hospital-as-public-urged-to-stay-home-for-easter?page=with:block-5e9092728f08db3109f20560#block-5e9092728f08db3109f20560\">confined to hospital</a> by the coronavirus and the \u201cnodding dogs\u201d must do their best to prove that they do not deserve that derogatory label. A structure designed to concentrate the maximum amount of power at Number 10 must adapt to operating without a fully functional prime minister.</p> <p>His enforced absence coincides with an especially testing stretch of the crisis. What is crudely characterised as the \u201clives versus livelihoods\u201d argument is becoming sharper. There is a mounting debate within government about when and to what extent the lockdown might be relaxed. This is, paradoxically, a testament to its general success. Thus far, it has worked more effectively than government modelling anticipated when the prime minister reluctantly placed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">closed-for-business sign</a> over most of Britain. Some doltish police officers have overstepped, a giant dunce\u2019s cap being awarded to the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-52228475\">chief constable of Northamptonshire</a> for threatening that his coppers would check shopping trolleys for \u201cnon-essential\u201d items. A recalcitrant minority of the public are behaving stupidly. But these are the exceptions, not the rule. There is both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/11/test-of-resolve-britons-warned-to-stay-at-home-as-temperatures-set-to-hit-26c\">extensive compliance</a> with and wide support for the lockdown.</p> <p>The initial anxiety within Number 10 that the citizenry would rapidly become rebellious has not been justified. I detect a tentative confidence among ministers and their scientific advisers that the lockdown is having the desired effect of preventing the outcome that petrified them most. The fear three weeks ago was that the NHS would be engulfed by many more cases than it could possibly handle, leading to huge numbers of avoidable deaths. Public horror would have been swiftly followed by public disgust with the leaders who allowed such a catastrophe to happen, irreparably shattering the Johnson government\u2019s authority and credibility. One senior Tory remarked to me at the end of last week: \u201cI take a big gulp before I say this because I know I am tempting fate, but the fact that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/07/how-to-build-a-hospital-in-nine-days-emergency-architecture-in-a-pandemic-coronavirus-outbreak\">London Nightingale</a> is not full at the moment is grounds for optimism.\u201d</p> <p>The other side of the coin is the terrible cost being inflicted on businesses and jobs by imposing a hard stop on the economy. Ministers knew it would be dreadful, but didn\u2019t anticipate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-jobs-bailout-treasury-resolution-foundation-wage-subsidy-scheme\">just how atrocious</a>. The Treasury is now expecting a whopping 9m applications for the job retention scheme that subsidises the wages of furloughed employees, three times the number budgeted for when Rishi Sunak launched his emergency measures. So we have indications that the most diabolical scenarios for deaths may be avoided while the economic penalties are becoming increasingly stark and that combination is reshaping the politics of the crisis. There are rising demands from the headline-hungry media, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/10/labour-will-keep-you-safe-says-new-shadow-home-secretary\">an attention-seeking opposition</a> and stricken businesses for the government to start outlining an exit strategy.</p> <p>Ministers are hugely reluctant to do this for two main reasons. One is their anxiety that any talk about an exit from lockdown will dilute the \u201cstay at home, protect the NHS, save lives\u201d messaging. The other reason ministers don\u2019t want to talk about an exit strategy is that they don\u2019t have an agreed one. As a figure at the heart of decision-making puts it: \u201cThere is no get-out-of-jail-free card from this crisis.\u201d</p> <p>The most assured way back to normality is mass vaccination, but it is generally thought that a vaccine is a year to 18 months away. The assumption in government is that you can\u2019t keep a modern economy in an induced coma for that long and expect to have many businesses and jobs still breathing by the end of it. Absent a vaccine, all sorts of notions for a phased easing of the lockdown are floating around Whitehall. Many of them shrivel under scrutiny. One suggestion is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/09/lifting-lockdown-uk-options-graded-return-normality\">partial relaxation based on age</a>, so that twentysomethings could return to work. There would be problems with policing that successfully: \u201cYou don\u2019t look younger than 30 to me, sir. Show me some ID.\u201d And most enterprises do not depend on just one age group. Another notion floated is that the severity of the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/06/government-urged-consider-regional-approach-ending-uk-coronavirus/\">lockdown might be varied</a> from region to region. There are some difficulties with that. If the pubs were reopened in London, but remained shut in Manchester, how would Mancunians react to TV footage of Londoners flocking back to their boozers? \u201cThe worst of all worlds,\u201d says the city\u2019s mayor, Andy Burnham. \u201cThat\u2019s when you get a riot,\u201d remarks a former Tory cabinet minister.</p> <p>The great hope among the politicians is that science will rescue them from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-culture-war-lockdown-economy\">\u201clives versus livelihoods\u201d</a> dilemma. There was a period when the government became excited about the idea that we could find out who has had the disease by using antibody tests. That was hailed as \u201ca game-changer\u201d by Mr Johnson before he was incapacitated. Millions of kits were <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/uk-says-millions-coronavirus-test-kits-bought-china-unreliable-most-patients-1496506\">ordered from China</a> only for them to be found unreliable. There is a decent chance of eventually securing an accurate antibody test. It would be valuable to be able to tell NHS staff and other key employees that they had immunity and were safe to work. But it doesn\u2019t solve the problem with the general population. The latest guesstimate from the government\u2019s scientific advisers is that no more than 10% of us have had the virus. Even if you could identify them, this leaves 90% exposed to the risk of infection. That is not a route out of lockdown.</p> <p>When the histories of this crisis are written, it is likely that they will conclude that the colossal misjudgment initially made in Europe and America was to think this threat was similar to that from pandemic flu. Asian countries, battle-readied by earlier encounters with coronaviruses, treated the menace like Sars and Mers. South Korea has never had more than eight deaths on any one day and has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-flatten-curve.html\">achieved this feat</a> without a national lockdown. </p> <p>That is generally attributed to their comprehensive programme of community testing and contact tracing. A similar strategy may become feasible for Britain if the government can make good on <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/work/91/uk-science-research-and-technology-capability-and-influence-in-global-disease-outbreaks/publications/\">Matt Hancock\u2019s bravura promise</a> to get up to 100,000 tests a day. But it is no panacea. The South Korean formula requires the redeployment of vast numbers of local and central government officials and wouldn\u2019t work without near universal public trust and co-operation. </p> <p>Many in the cabinet are aghast at the crushing of the economy and the prospect of a contraction sharper than anything since the 1930s. They will seize on any apparently better news to argue for the earliest possible relief from lockdown. This faction is not being very noisy while bulletins report around a thousand UK fatalities a day. It will be when the casualty rate is on a downward trend that the put-the-economy-first lobby will start to apply serious pressure. Others in government are worried that passing the peak will be the most perilous phase of the crisis because it will be accompanied by a clamour for an end to restrictions. One senior adviser warns: \u201cTo suddenly switch from \u2018we\u2019ve got it under control\u2019 to \u2018release all measures\u2019 would be a terrible mistake.\u201d</p> <p>This won\u2019t be like the end of prohibition in America. There won\u2019t be an overnight flip from suppression to freedom to live life to the full again. What we will likely see is experimental relaxations of some restrictions. If the government gets it wrong, there will be a risk of a second wave of infections that forces them to reimpose a lockdown.</p> <p>When this crisis broke, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/01/faced-with-coronavirus-covid-19-boris-johnston-must-stop-playing-invisible-man\">I suggested</a> that ministers would be faced with hideously difficult tradeoffs between curbing the menace to life posed by the disease and the damage wreaked by widespread bankruptcies, mass unemployment and the implications for Britain\u2019s future ability to finance public services, all of which will have effects on mortality. </p> <p>This is the sort of decision-making that prime ministers are elected to lead. When members of the cabinet wish a speedy recovery for Boris Johnson, it is not just because they want to express sympathy with a poorly boss. It is because they know that the toughest choices of this crisis have yet to be made.</p> <p>\u2022<em> </em>Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

      "bodyText": "At the time of the February cabinet reshuffle, eight weeks and an eternity ago, I was talking to a senior Tory about the power structure of the government. He remarked: \u201cBoris is not primus inter pares. He is first without equals. He is president, he is lord of all he surveys. The cabinet are just nodding dogs.\u201d As if to illustrate this, President Johnson let TV cameras into the cabinet room to film his ministers performing a ridiculous nursery school call and response about their manifesto promises. The \u201clord of all he surveys\u201d is now confined to hospital by the coronavirus and the \u201cnodding dogs\u201d must do their best to prove that they do not deserve that derogatory label. A structure designed to concentrate the maximum amount of power at Number 10 must adapt to operating without a fully functional prime minister. His enforced absence coincides with an especially testing stretch of the crisis. What is crudely characterised as the \u201clives versus livelihoods\u201d argument is becoming sharper. There is a mounting debate within government about when and to what extent the lockdown might be relaxed. This is, paradoxically, a testament to its general success. Thus far, it has worked more effectively than government modelling anticipated when the prime minister reluctantly placed a closed-for-business sign over most of Britain. Some doltish police officers have overstepped, a giant dunce\u2019s cap being awarded to the chief constable of Northamptonshire for threatening that his coppers would check shopping trolleys for \u201cnon-essential\u201d items. A recalcitrant minority of the public are behaving stupidly. But these are the exceptions, not the rule. There is both extensive compliance with and wide support for the lockdown. The initial anxiety within Number 10 that the citizenry would rapidly become rebellious has not been justified. I detect a tentative confidence among ministers and their scientific advisers that the lockdown is having the desired effect of preventing the outcome that petrified them most. The fear three weeks ago was that the NHS would be engulfed by many more cases than it could possibly handle, leading to huge numbers of avoidable deaths. Public horror would have been swiftly followed by public disgust with the leaders who allowed such a catastrophe to happen, irreparably shattering the Johnson government\u2019s authority and credibility. One senior Tory remarked to me at the end of last week: \u201cI take a big gulp before I say this because I know I am tempting fate, but the fact that the London Nightingale is not full at the moment is grounds for optimism.\u201d The other side of the coin is the terrible cost being inflicted on businesses and jobs by imposing a hard stop on the economy. Ministers knew it would be dreadful, but didn\u2019t anticipate just how atrocious. The Treasury is now expecting a whopping 9m applications for the job retention scheme that subsidises the wages of furloughed employees, three times the number budgeted for when Rishi Sunak launched his emergency measures. So we have indications that the most diabolical scenarios for deaths may be avoided while the economic penalties are becoming increasingly stark and that combination is reshaping the politics of the crisis. There are rising demands from the headline-hungry media, an attention-seeking opposition and stricken businesses for the government to start outlining an exit strategy. Ministers are hugely reluctant to do this for two main reasons. One is their anxiety that any talk about an exit from lockdown will dilute the \u201cstay at home, protect the NHS, save lives\u201d messaging. The other reason ministers don\u2019t want to talk about an exit strategy is that they don\u2019t have an agreed one. As a figure at the heart of decision-making puts it: \u201cThere is no get-out-of-jail-free card from this crisis.\u201d The most assured way back to normality is mass vaccination, but it is generally thought that a vaccine is a year to 18 months away. The assumption in government is that you can\u2019t keep a modern economy in an induced coma for that long and expect to have many businesses and jobs still breathing by the end of it. Absent a vaccine, all sorts of notions for a phased easing of the lockdown are floating around Whitehall. Many of them shrivel under scrutiny. One suggestion is a partial relaxation based on age, so that twentysomethings could return to work. There would be problems with policing that successfully: \u201cYou don\u2019t look younger than 30 to me, sir. Show me some ID.\u201d And most enterprises do not depend on just one age group. Another notion floated is that the severity of the lockdown might be varied from region to region. There are some difficulties with that. If the pubs were reopened in London, but remained shut in Manchester, how would Mancunians react to TV footage of Londoners flocking back to their boozers? \u201cThe worst of all worlds,\u201d says the city\u2019s mayor, Andy Burnham. \u201cThat\u2019s when you get a riot,\u201d remarks a former Tory cabinet minister. The great hope among the politicians is that science will rescue them from the \u201clives versus livelihoods\u201d dilemma. There was a period when the government became excited about the idea that we could find out who has had the disease by using antibody tests. That was hailed as \u201ca game-changer\u201d by Mr Johnson before he was incapacitated. Millions of kits were ordered from China only for them to be found unreliable. There is a decent chance of eventually securing an accurate antibody test. It would be valuable to be able to tell NHS staff and other key employees that they had immunity and were safe to work. But it doesn\u2019t solve the problem with the general population. The latest guesstimate from the government\u2019s scientific advisers is that no more than 10% of us have had the virus. Even if you could identify them, this leaves 90% exposed to the risk of infection. That is not a route out of lockdown. When the histories of this crisis are written, it is likely that they will conclude that the colossal misjudgment initially made in Europe and America was to think this threat was similar to that from pandemic flu. Asian countries, battle-readied by earlier encounters with coronaviruses, treated the menace like Sars and Mers. South Korea has never had more than eight deaths on any one day and has achieved this feat without a national lockdown. That is generally attributed to their comprehensive programme of community testing and contact tracing. A similar strategy may become feasible for Britain if the government can make good on Matt Hancock\u2019s bravura promise to get up to 100,000 tests a day. But it is no panacea. The South Korean formula requires the redeployment of vast numbers of local and central government officials and wouldn\u2019t work without near universal public trust and co-operation. Many in the cabinet are aghast at the crushing of the economy and the prospect of a contraction sharper than anything since the 1930s. They will seize on any apparently better news to argue for the earliest possible relief from lockdown. This faction is not being very noisy while bulletins report around a thousand UK fatalities a day. It will be when the casualty rate is on a downward trend that the put-the-economy-first lobby will start to apply serious pressure. Others in government are worried that passing the peak will be the most perilous phase of the crisis because it will be accompanied by a clamour for an end to restrictions. One senior adviser warns: \u201cTo suddenly switch from \u2018we\u2019ve got it under control\u2019 to \u2018release all measures\u2019 would be a terrible mistake.\u201d This won\u2019t be like the end of prohibition in America. There won\u2019t be an overnight flip from suppression to freedom to live life to the full again. What we will likely see is experimental relaxations of some restrictions. If the government gets it wrong, there will be a risk of a second wave of infections that forces them to reimpose a lockdown. When this crisis broke, I suggested that ministers would be faced with hideously difficult tradeoffs between curbing the menace to life posed by the disease and the damage wreaked by widespread bankruptcies, mass unemployment and the implications for Britain\u2019s future ability to finance public services, all of which will have effects on mortality. This is the sort of decision-making that prime ministers are elected to lead. When members of the cabinet wish a speedy recovery for Boris Johnson, it is not just because they want to express sympathy with a poorly boss. It is because they know that the toughest choices of this crisis have yet to be made. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

      "bodyText": "A year on from the Easter bombs that killed more than 250 people, Sri Lanka is now under pandemic lockdown and facing rising pressure. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, whose decision to include individuals accused of atrocities during the country\u2019s 25-year civil war among his political appointments has been a source of international opprobrium, is now under fire over the country\u2019s repressive, militarised response to Covid-19. With tensions increasing, and parliament and courts suspended, a civil society that had been working hard to rebuild trust and harmony from the ground up is struggling. It was 21 April 2019 when three large bombs targeting Christians and tourists were triggered. Hasaru Jayakody was at mass in Negombo, where 115 people would die, including his mother Priyanthi whom he describes as \u201cthe best person I ever met\u201d. Badly injured, he spent his 17th birthday in hospital. A statue of Jesus, spattered with blood, has been preserved in a clear box as a poignant reminder for the people of Negombo, who over the past year have been working to come through the trauma together. The physical environment has been rebuilt. The parish priest, Father Manjula, has supported efforts to repair trust by reminding his congregation that their God tells them to forgive. Jayakody initially found he needed to keep talking about what had happened. It was from his mother\u2019s example, he says, that he learned how to forgive. Jayakody now teaches younger children at Sunday school and hopes to become an engineer in honour of his mother. But the wider environment is challenging. In the immediate aftermath, some Muslim businesses were boycotted by Sinhala or Buddhist customers \u2013 until leaders came together through local inter-religious committees, reinforcing messages of harmony and emphasising the right of all to live and work in Negombo. When refugees faced physical attacks after the bombings, human rights activists like Ruki Fernando stepped in to protect them. \u201cIn the context of large numbers of dead, injured and the magnitude of the tragedy, refugees didn\u2019t receive much attention and support from the government, media, religious leaders and overall, Sri Lankan society. But some politicians and government officials were sympathetic and mindful of their duties,\u201d he says, remembering how the Negombo police station sheltered a large number of refugees at the height of unrest, despite being overstretched. Harassment of Muslims had happened before, but the problem increased after the attacks. As some landlords and hosts were pressured to evict them, human rights groups worked with communities to support those at risk, opening their doors and providing food and medicine. Now with the current fears and restrictions, Fernando is worried about vulnerable communities such as refugees, prisoners, the poor and minorities. \u201cWe are seeing both racism and authoritarianism raising their ugly heads in the middle of the fight against Covid,\u201d he says. Bhavani Fonseka, senior researcher at Colombo\u2019s Centre for Alternative Policies thinktank, is also concerned. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is extremely worrying. For nearly a decade in the run-up to last Easter Sunday we didn\u2019t have to worry about security issues at such a scale but, since the bombings, we\u2019ve seen a continuation of the securitisation,\u201d she says. While conceding that this month\u2019s parliamentary elections had to be postponed due to the outbreak, she is worried that there is no check on executive power. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very worrying time in Sri Lanka,\u201d says Fonseka. \u201cThis has not happened overnight \u2026 but if we continue to postpone parliamentary elections then there are worrying signs over whether we are heading towards autocratic rule. \u201cWhen we mark one year on from the Easter Sunday attacks, in this current uncertainty, has there really been healing and reckoning of what happened?\u201d Jehan Perera, executive director of the National Peace Council, runs awareness programmes, educating communities about the origins of the civil war, how to build peace, and the issues involved in transitional justice. Perera acknowledges the support of senior international religious figures to help bring the communities to dialogue. In the immediate aftermath, there were claims \u2013 subsequently dismissed as untrue \u2013 that Sri Lanka\u2019s Muslims knew the bombing was planned and had let others down by not warning them. Perera believes in the power of people of different faiths meeting face to face. It\u2019s harder to sustain distorted beliefs when a community is gracious towards you, he says. \u201cWhen they see each other as individuals, there\u2019s a lot of goodwill,\u201d says Perera. \u201cIt\u2019s when people put ideas into their heads in the abstract, then it\u2019s easy to build anger\u201d Over the years he has seen unfounded accusations that a Muslim surgeon secretly sterilised Sinhalese women, and now claims that certain groups are responsible for the spread of Covid-19. Burial practices of different faiths during the outbreak are controversial. For Perera, the coronavirus outbreak is a call for unity, not more division. \u201cCovid is infecting anyone without any discrimination,\u201d he says. \u201cWe must not think on these divisive lines but face the problem together. \u201cUnless we are all secure, none of us will be secure, and that is the message that Covid is bringing us one year after the Easter bombings.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 April 2020 to make clear that claims Muslims knew about the attacks but had failed to raise warnings were dismissed as untrue.",

      "body": "<p>Sheffield-born writer-director Vicky Jones, 41, is co-founder of <a href=\"https://sohotheatre.com/people/drywrite/\">DryWrite Theatre Company</a>, alongside her frequent collaborator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/phoebe-waller-bridge\">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a>. She directed the original stage production of <em>Fleabag</em>, script-edited the TV version and is currently the National Theatre\u2019s playwright in residence. Jones has written and created new HBO series <em>Run</em>, DryWrite\u2019s first TV production, which debuts this week on Sky, starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/domhnall-gleeson\">Domhn</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/domhnall-gleeson\">all Gleeson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/16/unbelievable-quiet-power-netflix-drama\">Merritt Wever</a>.</p> <p><strong>How did the idea for </strong><em><strong>Run</strong></em><strong> come about?<br></strong>Me and Phoebe had a joke years ago where we\u2019d whisper \u201cRun!\u201d to each other in any situation we wanted to get out of. A relationship, a social engagement, the wrong job, wrong decision\u2026 The idea being that we\u2019d take each other\u2019s hands, make a dash for it and keep going. It was a comforting feeling that there was always someone who\u2019d run away with us. We never did it, never just ran off and left people hanging \u2013 except once at a festival, but that\u2019s another story! Mostly it was just a funny idea. Years later, it morphed into this TV show.</p> <p><strong>The series opens with a long-separated couple texting \u201cRun!\u201d to each other. Did you ever unwisely text your exes?<br></strong>I used to. I\u2019d also stalk them on social media and obsess about the tiniest things. Are they wearing that jumper I bought them? Bastard!</p> <p><strong>Merritt Wever\u2019s character, Ruby, is a suburban housewife who leaves her life behind. Why?<br></strong>I wanted to explore the idea of a woman at the end of her tether. Yes, she\u2019s middle-class, and in many ways she has nothing to complain about, but Ruby feels like she\u2019s not seen, even by herself. She\u2019s an intelligent woman with loads of potential, but she\u2019s ignored herself and given up so much. This is the only way Ruby can think of to change her life and she does it in a split-second. It\u2019s an extreme solution to what\u2019s perhaps a common problem.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9gnW8TAP2U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x9gnW8TAP2U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9gnW8TAP2U\">Watch a trailer for Run.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Domhnall Gleeson\u2019s character, Billy, is a motivational speaker. Did you research those?<br></strong>I did, people like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/tony-robbins-unleash-power-event-texas-dozens-injured\">Tony Robbins</a>, and you get sucked in by them. They\u2019re so powerful in the way they use language. We didn\u2019t want Billy to be an arsehole, callously using people for profit. He\u2019s one of the better ones, who genuinely wants to help people, but he does come to the conclusion that he doesn\u2019t have any right to be telling people how to live.</p> <p><strong>And the title of his bestselling book is </strong><strong>Amazing. Period</strong><strong>\u2026<br></strong>[<em>Laughs</em>] That was Phoebe\u2019s idea. She\u2019s amazing, period.</p> <p><strong>At one point, Ruby masturbates in a train toilet. Is that </strong><em><strong>Run</strong></em><strong>\u2019s equivalent of </strong><em><strong>Fleabag</strong></em><strong>\u2019s Obama scene?<br></strong>A few years ago it felt like there were no female masturbation scenes on TV, but suddenly there are loads. I liked the idea that [the characters] were so turned on by each other, they just had to. You have to be pretty desperate to do it in the toilet of a train! It was a way of showing how sexually charged they are.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The messages young girls were getting through porn were confusing. There wasn\u2019t clarity about feminism, but there is now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em><strong>Run</strong></em><strong>\u2019s writer, producers, director are all women. Was that important to you?<br></strong>Absolutely. It\u2019s not at the expense of men at all, but that\u2019s just who we naturally look to and gravitate towards. There are so many talented women out there, you don\u2019t even have to think about positive discrimination.</p> <p><strong>Was Phoebe Waller-Bridge always going to pop up in a cameo role?<br></strong>Oh yeah, she always wanted a part. It\u2019s a surprise who she plays, I think.</p> <p><strong>How does it feel, looking back now, at the cultural impact </strong><em><strong>Fleabag</strong></em><strong> made?<br></strong>It felt like a tipping point for feminism at that time. There was no real voice or leadership where feminism was concerned. In fact, lots of our friends were distancing themselves from the notions of feminism that we\u2019d grown up with. The messages that young girls were getting through porn were confusing. Where were we supposed to look for inspiration? There wasn\u2019t clarity where feminism was concerned, but now there really is. The world has changed so quickly and we\u2019re proud to have been a part of that.</p> <p><strong>Was last summer\u2019s West End run a nice way to close the chapter?<br></strong>Sadly I was in Canada making <em>Run</em>, so I didn\u2019t see any of it. But before I left, I did get to march around to Wyndham\u2019s theatre with Phoebe and I watched her do some bits from the very back of the auditorium, just to check she could reach it. Of course she was nailing it, so I knew it was going to work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"654a30273a3455e068f80d72d72def8d80a4a2ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/654a30273a3455e068f80d72d72def8d80a4a2ce/1_0_2541_1525/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phoebe Waller-Bridge performing Fleabag at Wyndham\u2019s theatre, London, August last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phoebe Waller-Bridge performing Fleabag at Wyndham\u2019s theatre, London, August 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Humphrey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What\u2019s your writing routine?<br></strong>It\u2019s bad for my back, but I write on my bed.

She directed the original stage production of Fleabag, script-edited the TV version and is currently the National Theatre\u2019s playwright in residence. Jones has written and created new HBO series Run, DryWrite\u2019s first TV production, which debuts this week on Sky, starring Domhnall Gleeson and Merritt Wever. How did the idea for Run come about? Me and Phoebe had a joke years ago where we\u2019d whisper \u201cRun!\u201d to each other in any situation we wanted to get out of. A relationship, a social engagement, the wrong job, wrong decision\u2026 The idea being that we\u2019d take each other\u2019s hands, make a dash for it and keep going. It was a comforting feeling that there was always someone who\u2019d run away with us. We never did it, never just ran off and left people hanging \u2013 except once at a festival, but that\u2019s another story! Mostly it was just a funny idea. Years later, it morphed into this TV show. The series opens with a long-separated couple texting \u201cRun!\u201d to each other. Did you ever unwisely text your exes? I used to. I\u2019d also stalk them on social media and obsess about the tiniest things. Are they wearing that jumper I bought them? Bastard! Merritt Wever\u2019s character, Ruby, is a suburban housewife who leaves her life behind. Why? I wanted to explore the idea of a woman at the end of her tether. Yes, she\u2019s middle-class, and in many ways she has nothing to complain about, but Ruby feels like she\u2019s not seen, even by herself. She\u2019s an intelligent woman with loads of potential, but she\u2019s ignored herself and given up so much. This is the only way Ruby can think of to change her life and she does it in a split-second. It\u2019s an extreme solution to what\u2019s perhaps a common problem. Domhnall Gleeson\u2019s character, Billy, is a motivational speaker. Did you research those? I did, people like Tony Robbins, and you get sucked in by them. They\u2019re so powerful in the way they use language. We didn\u2019t want Billy to be an arsehole, callously using people for profit. He\u2019s one of the better ones, who genuinely wants to help people, but he does come to the conclusion that he doesn\u2019t have any right to be telling people how to live. And the title of his bestselling book is Amazing. Period\u2026 [Laughs] That was Phoebe\u2019s idea. She\u2019s amazing, period. At one point, Ruby masturbates in a train toilet. Is that Run\u2019s equivalent of Fleabag\u2019s Obama scene? A few years ago it felt like there were no female masturbation scenes on TV, but suddenly there are loads. I liked the idea that [the characters] were so turned on by each other, they just had to. You have to be pretty desperate to do it in the toilet of a train! It was a way of showing how sexually charged they are. Run\u2019s writer, producers, director are all women. Was that important to you? Absolutely. It\u2019s not at the expense of men at all, but that\u2019s just who we naturally look to and gravitate towards. There are so many talented women out there, you don\u2019t even have to think about positive discrimination. Was Phoebe Waller-Bridge always going to pop up in a cameo role? Oh yeah, she always wanted a part. It\u2019s a surprise who she plays, I think. How does it feel, looking back now, at the cultural impact Fleabag made? It felt like a tipping point for feminism at that time. There was no real voice or leadership where feminism was concerned. In fact, lots of our friends were distancing themselves from the notions of feminism that we\u2019d grown up with. The messages that young girls were getting through porn were confusing. Where were we supposed to look for inspiration? There wasn\u2019t clarity where feminism was concerned, but now there really is. The world has changed so quickly and we\u2019re proud to have been a part of that. Was last summer\u2019s West End run a nice way to close the chapter? Sadly I was in Canada making Run, so I didn\u2019t see any of it. But before I left, I did get to march around to Wyndham\u2019s theatre with Phoebe and I watched her do some bits from the very back of the auditorium, just to check she could reach it. Of course she was nailing it, so I knew it was going to work. What\u2019s your writing routine? It\u2019s bad for my back, but I write on my bed. Pile a load of cushions up, then try to write. I\u2019ll despair for the first half-hour, then get beyond that phase and start writing. What makes you happy when you\u2019re not working? I have a podcast called Guilt &amp; Shame, which is about being completely honest. I splurge a lot of personal stuff on that, so I\u2019m hoping my mum doesn\u2019t listen to it. What\u2019s next for you? I\u2019m writing a film with Amblin [Steven Spielberg\u2019s production company] when I have time. For the next couple of months, though, I\u2019m hoping to spend a bit more time with my baby. That\u2019s one nice thing that\u2019s come out of the current situation. How are you coping in coronavirus lockdown? I\u2019m just in my bedroom. This is where I live now. Sitting on my bed all day, so it could be worse. I\u2019ve gone semi-feral. Are you expecting an influx of texts from your friends saying \u201cRun\u201d? I would love that! It\u2019s the perfect time for it now, of course. I could run to my bedroom wall and back. \u2022 Run starts on Wednesday 15 April at 9pm on Sky Comedy and Now TV",

These guys are really puffing out, which is just as bad as a cough or a sneeze in my mind.\u201d Nonetheless, he had resisted the temptation to confront these invaders of his personal space. \u201cBest to lead by example and avoid other people rather than shouting and telling them what they\u2019re doing wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one likes to hear that.\u201d Despite the various government strictures in force, there remain large areas of uncertainty on the streets and in the parks, where a new etiquette is being shaped to contend with this strange and still new terrain of the lockdown. At its heart is a paradoxical and utterly novel idea of public solidarity: in order to unite as a community we must remain apart as individuals. Social media accounts are filled with fulminating descriptions of the points at which that strained contract breaks down. And it can be hard to see the best intentions in others when your primary concern is that they should stay away from you. \u201cMost people have been absolutely lovely this morning,\u201d said the park manager. \u201cIt was later in the afternoon that we were getting groups. That\u2019s why we\u2019re closing at four.\u201d Paris closed all its parks entirely three weeks ago. And last week it banned daytime jogging in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. So far in London, where the Covid-19 death rate continues to climb, the issue has not been about people moving too fast, but those who stop still. Running may have its critics, but it\u2019s an exercise. Sunbathing, alas, is not \u2013 even if done in splendid isolation. Yet for all their fears of the draconian measures that might come, no one in Victoria Park was comfortable with the idea of telling others what to do. London prides itself on its tolerance, the ability of many different people to live side by side with minimal conflict. As Robert Copsey, a music journalist who shares a flat with King, put it: \u201cThe thing about social distancing in London is that we\u2019re all so close together all the time anyway.\u201d London\u2019s parks are commonly referred to as its lungs, and now the city is under siege from a respiratory illness. Whether it can continue to keep open these vital green spaces will come down to how carefully their users can stay apart. The signs were mostly promising on Saturday morning, but a lot of park keepers will be relieved that the temperature is due to drop tomorrow.",

<p>There will also be new restrictions in Latrobe, Kentish, Devonport, the Central Coast, Bernie, Waratah, Circular Head, and the West Coast.</p> \n  <p>In addition to the rules around only leaving the home for an essential purpose, all retail stores in the north west will be required to close unless they can do online or home delivery. <br></p> \n  <p>There is an exception for medical services, pharmacies, supermarkets, petrol stations, bakeries, laundromats, dry cleaners, newsagents, bottle shops, IT repair and car repair, vet services, pet food stores, and banks. </p> \n  <p>Kmart and Harvey Norman will be closed, Gutwein said, and Bunnings will only be allowed to sell to trade workers. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis will be a difficult period, I would ask you to work with us,\u201d Gutwein said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWith the aim of this is to get to the end of a two-week period where we can bring those health services back online and importantly we can lift the restrictions as well.

It is very dangerous \u2013 and unrealistic \u2013 to move ahead of the medical advice.

Frydenberg responded: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Again, I am talking to business leaders. And they fully understand that the restrictions are based on the health advice and the health advice needs to be followed.</p> \n   <p>Again, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball. The prime minister prepared the nation for six months at least. We are having a degree of success in flattening out that curve. But it is dangerous to move ahead of the medical advice.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s where we will leave the live blog for Easter Sunday. This is what happened in all news coronavirus-related today: The federal government has talked down extending the jobkeeper payment beyond its current capacity, although treasurer Josh Frydenberg confirmed it would cost an extra $18bn (beyond the current $130bn) to include more casuals and others who have missed out on the payment. Eleven new confirmed cases of coronavirus around the country bringing the total to 6,314, and three more deaths up to 59. A man in hotel quarantine in Melbourne died, his death is not being treated as suspicious. Tasmania will close down two hospitals in north-west Tasmania and clean them out after a number of infections were identified as being connected with the hospitals. A further shutdown of most retail outlets aside from those absolutely necessary will be in place in the region for the next two weeks. Some 112 passengers from the Antarctic cruise ship the Greg Mortimer touched down in Melbourne and, after medical checks, are headed for quarantine. About 16 New Zealanders went straight onto a smaller plane to return home. Victoria extended its state of emergency for four more weeks, to 11 May. Education minister Dan Tehan said costs for short courses in universities and tertiary settings would be cut, and he guaranteed no funding cuts for universities. We will be back again tomorrow for all the latest coronavirus coverage. Until then, stay safe. The deputy CMO Michael Kidd has been on ABC News Radio. He believes Australia isn\u2019t currently missing that many cases that aren\u2019t being tested for. And a message for people who have had Covid-19. He says national cabinet is clearly thinking about what is next, and Australia can\u2019t stay cut off from the rest of the world forever. He says there has to be a way to live a normal life with the virus still in parts of the world. He says herd immunity is not something the government is considering because it would bring with it an unacceptable level of loss of life. \u201cIn the end we will have to find a pathway forward where we normalise things,\u201d he says but adds that he hopes treatment options are developed. Finance minister Mathias Cormann is on Sky News with host Sharri Markson. He repeats the mantra that restrictions will not be eased until the medical advice says so. The advice at the moment is the restrictions have to remain as they are. It\u2019s working, he says, with new cases at around 1%. It comes with great cost, and great inconvenience he says, but it will save lives. No new cases in South Australia. There is an increase in the number of these sorts of incidents in the past few months during the coronavirus pandemic. It\u2019s not clear the full context of this, but incidents like this one seem to be around every day. The Australian Human Rights Commission says around one quarter of the racial discrimination complaints it has received in the past two months are related to people being targeted because of the coronavirus pandemic. Labor is calling for an anti-racism campaign to combat this kind of behaviour, similar to the \u201cRacism \u2013 it stops with me\u201d campaign undertaken by the then-Labor government in 2012. Patients currently in the North-West regional hospital will be transferred to the community hospital, and only transferred out of the north-west region if absolutely necessary. There are no patients at the hospital currently in the ICU. Recently discharged patients will also be required to self-isolate. The hospital will be in contact individually with expecting mothers who were due to give birth in the hospital, to explain what their plan is for those women. Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein has announced that North-West regional hospital and North-West private hospital in Burnie will be shut for a deep clean, and the staff will be required to isolate for 14 days. The government is doing this because of the 133 confirmed coronavirus cases in the state, 61 are linked to the north-west coast, 49 are linked to an outbreak in the hospitals and 35 are healthcare workers. The close contacts of those affected will also need to self-isolate. There will also be new restrictions in Latrobe, Kentish, Devonport, the Central Coast, Bernie, Waratah, Circular Head, and the West Coast. In addition to the rules around only leaving the home for an essential purpose, all retail stores in the north west will be required to close unless they can do online or home delivery. There is an exception for medical services, pharmacies, supermarkets, petrol stations, bakeries, laundromats, dry cleaners, newsagents, bottle shops, IT repair and car repair, vet services, pet food stores, and banks. Kmart and Harvey Norman will be closed, Gutwein said, and Bunnings will only be allowed to sell to trade workers. \u201cThis will be a difficult period, I would ask you to work with us,\u201d Gutwein said. \u201cWith the aim of this is to get to the end of a two-week period where we can bring those health services back online and importantly we can lift the restrictions as well. We need to do this, we need to do it now, we need to get on top of it, and I make no apologies for that, the swiftness of the action that we are taking.\u201d McGowan says he took his kids camping ... in his backyard ... over Easter because obviously other locations were unavailable. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. \u201cWe\u2019ve successfully flattened the curve, but now we\u2019ve got to figure out how to keep it there but also find out a long-term solution to the problem we face,\u201d McGowan says. He says he is working on getting commercial tenancy legislation in parliament this week. He\u2019s not sure whether residential tenancy legislation will be ready this week but it will be brought in when it is. The former will be brought into WA parliament for debate on Wednesday. McGowan says he is working with Qantas, and the state government may need to underwrite flights between WA and the eastern states in order to get WA residents back home, or people in WA back east. McGowan on the low numbers, says the war isn\u2019t won yet, but planning needs to begin on how to recover. He says Western Australia will be very cautious, but they\u2019re looking all the time at tweaking the restrictions within WA on whether restaurants and cafes and other places can open or close. He says rules will be determined based on medical advice. He says people have been good with the social distancing, he suggests a lot of the photos of people at beaches are misleading, being shot up the beach to make it look like people are closer than they actually are. McGowan says the restrictions in the state will be reviewed on a monthly basis but not so much the hard border closure with the rest of the country. He says of the seven cruise ships near WA, five have passed Fremantle, so he is hopeful they will leave the WA coast soon. WA premier Mark McGowan announces three new confirmed cases in WA in the metropolitan area. All of the people are from WA, but two were on cruise ships and they are trying to contact trace the third. It brings the total number of cases in the state to 517, including 68 from cruise ships. He says 278 are still suffering from the illness, and 38 are in hospital. Tourism minister Simon Birmingham has told Nine Newspapers Australians should be thinking they\u2019ll first be allowed to holiday within their own state first, and then interstate, and overseas last as the restrictions eventually ease up. There\u2019s still no timeline on any of this, but it makes sense that the easing of any restrictions would be localised where they can identify and contain cases of community transmission. Slightly harder to do between states, and even more difficult to do with people travelling in and out of the country. Nine Newspapers is reporting that we could have been a year closer to a vaccine for coronavirus, had an Australian research lab not had its funding cut a few years ago by a US government agency: \u201cIf these vaccine trials had gone ahead \u2013 and they looked good \u2013 we would have felt in much better shape now,\u201d said Prof Peter Doherty, an immunologist and Nobel laureate. The NT government is advising people if they\u2019re entering the NT by sea, they\u2019ll need to isolate for 14 days. They must go directly to Darwin Harbour if arriving from overseas, or Nhulunbuy Port or Darwin Harbour if arriving from interstate. Unlike other jurisdictions in Australia, although the NT government will select where they\u2019re quarantined, those who enter the territory will have to pay for their accommodation. Anyone who breaches quarantine will be fined $1,099. The NSW Poisons Information Centre has reported an increase in calls about poisoning after people (generally children) have ingested hand sanitiser. The centre is advising parents to keep hand sanitiser out of reach of children, and to be careful with home-made sanitiser, which can be more poisonous. Minor ingestions can be managed at home, but the centre says calling in first is important. Has the coronavirus pandemic made us rethink how much Australia produces? Via AAP: The impact of the coronavirus crisis has exposed gaps in the Australian economy where it has become too reliant on overseas supplies, which could see manufacturing face a revamp coming out of the pandemic. Warren Hogan, industry professor at the UTS business school and a former chief economist at ANZ said a standout feature throughout the crisis has been the reliance on overseas sources for medical supplies and equipment, and pharmaceuticals. He told Sky News on Sunday the crisis has shown Australia needs to be more self-sufficient. \u201cWhether the borders are shut or not, international supply chains are disrupted, we can make sure we can get the key things Australians needs,\u201d he said. In an interview last month, Australian Industry Group CEO Innes Willox predicted that after this crisis there will be a significant push towards doing more back in Australia. \u201cI think self-reliance will become more of a mantra,\u201d he said. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said there will be a proper assessment of global supply chains and what they mean for Australia in the coming months. \u201cOne area where Australia is self-sufficient is in agriculture, which produces enough food for 75 million people in a country of just 25 million,\u201d he said. He said Australia also plays in the \u201cniche manufacturing space\u201d and that has been quite handy in the crisis. For example, ResMed, a medical device manufacturer, has increased the number of ventilators it producers. But in contrast, Australia has had to import more than 30 million masks to try and cope with the pandemic. \u201cSo we have to look at all these supply chains,\u201d Frydenberg told ABC television. \u201cThis is where Treasury and other relevant departments like Industry will be doing more work over the months ahead.\u201d But he said this should not be seen as an argument for protectionism. \u201cAustralia is a great beneficiary of free trade. We need to play to our comparative strengths,\u201d he said. The Queensland government has announced $17m to fund 465 community kindergartens to stay open through term 2 and support around 22,000 children with free kindergarten. This is on top of the $90m normally provided by the state government every year. In addition to paying the wages of the 2,754 teachers and educators at the kindergarten, the government will also waive regulation fees. Andrew Giles, the shadow minister for cities and multicultural affairs, has penned an interesting piece arguing that the Covid-19 shutdowns could be a chance to reboot the national conversation on loneliness because we\u2019re all stuck inside at the same time. First, his statement of the problem: \u201cThe Australian Loneliness Report, released by the Australian Psychological Society and Swinburne University, found one in two Australians feel lonely for at least one day a week, while more than one in four feel lonely for three or more days per week. The report found that loneliness increases a person\u2019s likelihood of experiencing depression by 15.2%. We know that loneliness hurts people, and it can kill them.\u201d Giles writes about the fact schools, workplaces, universities, sport, book clubs, nightclubs and aged care facilities are either shut down, operating remotely or under new restrictions limiting physical closeness to others. And how might it change the conversation? He concludes: Through this we have to think about loneliness, which has been defined by reference to social isolation. That\u2019s a subjective feeling of disconnection, but presently it\u2019s our objective reality, to greater or lesser extents. It\u2019s something we are all experiencing, at the same time. I\u2019m hopeful that this might prove helpful, in that we are all thinking about the quality of our connections and how much these matter to who we are, and how we are. It\u2019s a chance to get rid of the stigma that prevents people talking about their loneliness, and for all of us to treat this with the seriousness it deserves. Before Covid-19 reshaped how we live our lives, Australia was already facing a loneliness crisis, something that was recognised by many experts and Labor\u2019s national platform. Now, many weeks into this period of physical isolation, it is urgent that we turn our minds to responding to this public policy imperative. That we work on the ways that communities can stay together, and build connections that work for all their members, on their terms, not ours.\u201d Good afternoon everyone. Former prime minister Kevin Rudd has joined the International Monetary Fund in a Covid-19-related role. Via AAP: The former Australian prime minister has joined an International Monetary Fund external advisory group to tackle issues including the coronavirus and its global economic impact. \u201cEven before the spread of Covid-19 and the dramatic health, economic, and financial disruptions it has brought, IMF members confronted a rapidly evolving world and complex policy issues,\u201d IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said. \u201cTo serve our membership well in this context, we need top-notch input and expertise from the widest range of sources, inside and outside the Fund. \u201cToward this end, I am proud that an exceptional and diverse group of eminent individuals with high-level policy, market, and private sector experience has agreed to serve on my external advisory group.\u201d The group\u2019s other members include former United Nations deputy secretary-general Lord Mark Malloch Brown, former Nigerian finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Monetary Authority of Singapore chairman Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Kristin Forbes and Guggenheim Investments chief investment officer Scott Minerd. Rudd has held numerous international roles since resigning from Australian parliament in 2013, including senior fellow at Harvard University\u2019s John F Kennedy School of Government, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and president of the Asia Society Policy Institute. Thanks all. I\u2019m going to hand over to my colleague Josh Taylor now. We\u2019ve sadly heard of three deaths today, taking the number of people who have died from Covid-19 in Australia to 59. Please let your remaining Easter Sunday be physically distanced and safe. The Labor treasury spokesman, Jim Chalmers, has responded to Josh Frydenberg\u2019s warning that his discretion to expand eligibility for the $130bn jobkeeper wage subsidy program is only for \u201cunforeseen circumstances\u201d. Chalmers told reporters in Brisbane: This weekend, Josh Frydenberg had an opportunity to include more workers in the jobkeeper scheme but unfortunately he didn\u2019t grasp it. He had the opportunity to do the right thing by more than a million Australian casuals and by temporary workers as well who can\u2019t get home, and unfortunately, he didn\u2019t grab that opportunity. He alone has the power now to decide who has access to the jobkeeper payment and who is excluded from it. The only thing standing in the way of a jobkeeper payment for more than a million workers is the treasurer\u2019s signature. This morning on the Insiders program, the treasurer said that he has the power to change the rules for unforeseen circumstances but that\u2019s not true. He has power to change the rules overall to determine who has access to the jobkeeper payments. These are not unforeseen circumstances. These workers are not being excluded by accident; these workers are being deliberately excluded from the jobkeeper payment. Josh Frydenberg\u2019s position will see even more Australians join the jobless queues in the coming months when so many of those job losses could have been avoided. When we see a spike in unemployment in the next couple of months, remember that Josh Frydenberg had the opportunity to prevent some of those job losses by exercising his powers on behalf of casual and temporary workers and that he didn\u2019t exercise those powers. It\u2019s not too late for him to change his mind and for the government to change course. Let\u2019s run through where we\u2019re at on Easter Sunday. Australia has 6,289 confirmed cases and 59 people have died from the virus, 16 of which were passengers on the Ruby Princess cruise ship. The country\u2019s 57th death, another passenger from that cruise ship, was confirmed this morning in South Australia. The 58th death was confirmed from Tasmania this morning. A woman in her 70s died. The nation\u2019s 59th death was announced in NSW \u2013 an 82-year-old man died overnight at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Some 112 passengers from the Antarctic cruise ship the Greg Mortimer touched down in Melbourne and, after medical checks, are headed for quarantine. About 16 New Zealanders went straight onto a smaller plane to return home. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg warned it was \u201cvery dangerous and unrealistic\u201d to loosen restrictions on movement ahead of medical advice. Victoria extended its state of emergency for four more weeks, to 11 May. A drop in testing over the Easter weekend may have influenced the number of new cases being reported today \u2013 Victoria reported 3, Qld 12, ACT zero, NSW 7. Education minister Dan Tehan said costs for short courses in universities and tertiary settings would be cut, and he guaranteed no funding cuts for universities. AAP reports that an 82-year-old man died at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in NSW overnight, brining the total number of deaths from Covid-19 to 24. NSW Health acting director Dr Christine Selvey said the man was in contact with a confirmed Covid-19 case and was not linked to the Ruby Princess cruise ship. There have been no new cases of Covid-19 reported in the ACT, which has 102 confirmed cases \u2013 one less than yesterday after further tests on one previously confirmed case. There are three people in Canberra hospitals and 67 people have recovered and been released from self-isolation. The state has previously confirmed two deaths from the disease. In a statement, acting ACT chief health officer Dr Vanessa Johnston thanked Canberrans for their efforts in helping flatten the curve. She said: Our actions are creating meaningful impact and Canberrans should be proud of their continued efforts to limit the spread of Covid-19. We must stay on track and not fall in the trap of becoming complacent. Please remain vigilant and stay home for the remainder of this Easter long weekend. Do not travel to the coast or interstate or gather in large groups with family and friends. If you do need to go out for essential reasons, then complying with the rules on physical distancing and practicing good hand and respiratory hygiene are the most important tools in slowing the spread of Covid-19. My colleague Anne Davies also has some information on some changes announced by the NSW government to the way people can get their prescriptions. To prevent older people from having to leave their homes, doctors will be able to prescribe medicines in NSW via email or fax from April 17. Health Minister Brad Hazzard said under the NSW government changes announced today GPs and nurse practitioners will be able to send a digital image of the prescription. Hazzard said: These changes are designed to make accessing your medications easier and safer, particularly for those in the community with chronic conditions. It ensures people with compromised immune systems will not need to go to the doctor\u2019s surgery in person and can get their script entirely through a telehealth appointment. Scripts will only be able to be sent by email or fax rather than via text to a pharmacy, to stop potential prescription forgery and diversion to the criminal supply chain. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard and health authorities in the state have been updating us on the number of cases \u2013 and there\u2019s been some adjustments to their numbers around the fringes, due to people moving back and forth between states. The state now has 2,854 confirmed cases \u2013 including seven added from yesterday \u2013 and Hazzard pointed out that 1,206 of those were people under 40. But health officers said this small rise could be down to a drop in the numbers of tests being carried out over the Easter weekend. On Saturday, there were only 840 tests carried out, when usually that daily number has been between 3,000 and 4,000. Hazzard also raised concerns about people\u2019s mental health and encouraged residents to go out an exercise and \u201cbuild up vitamin D\u201d but they needed to make sure they were still keeping a safe distance from others. He wanted people to look out for each other. I want to acknowledge that at Easter perhaps it is the right time to be talking about this. We all need to be looking after each other. I have concerns about people\u2019s mental health in this particular crisis. As the deadline approaches on Monday for people getting the jobseeker payment to get the additional $750 economic support payment, Services Australia says it is working to ensure everyone is able to get their claim in. Over 200,000 jobseeker claims have been processed so far. For those still waiting for a call back from Services Australia, or are worried they missed a call, Services Australia say they can call the dedicated jobseeker line (132 850) on Monday from 9am to 5pm to check their claim. Services Australia general manager Hank Jongen said in a statement: \u201cIf customers miss a call from us or the line disconnects, we encourage them to call us on this line. We are working with our telephony provider to address cases where this has occurred.\u201d Services Australia has put on 6,200 more staff for call centres to process claims, and has taken more than 1m calls so far. People who haven\u2019t registered their intent to claim by tomorrow will miss out on the $750 payment, but Jongen said if someone can\u2019t complete their claim, Services Australia will work with them to ensure they are paid as soon as possible. The increased jobseeker coronavirus supplement will be paid to all people on jobseeker from April 27. Education minister Dan Tehan was promoting an alternative binge earlier this morning, saying there would be a cut in the costs of diplomas and short courses. So \u201crather than bingeing on Netflix\u201d people could \u201cbinge on studying\u201d instead, Tehan said. There wasn\u2019t too much detail, but in a release to media Tehan and skills minister Senator Michaelia Cash said the cost to study short courses including \u201cnursing, teaching, health, IT and science\u201d would be cut. The courses would start at the beginning of May and will initially run for six months. Tehan told reporters: Areas where we need people, and we are going to need people as we emerge from the coronavirus pandemic. So we also want our universities to seize this opportunity, and it is an opportunity for them to become world leaders in short courses, world leaders in what is called micro-credentialling. And if our people can seize this opportunity, if our universities can seize this opportunity, we will be able to ensure that education remains one of the foundations which will build this nation into the future. What we are announcing today also is that when it comes to our universities we are going to put a ballast into their finances. Tehan also said the government would guarantee funding for universities at current levels. There\u2019s already been some reaction to that. My colleague Paul Karp says Universities Australia chair, Deborah Terry, has welcomed the \u201cfirst step\u201d but warned even with the guarantee, there will be a tough road ahead. She said: We estimate a quarter of all jobs at Australian universities will go within the next six months \u2013 that\u2019s more than 21,000 livelihoods. Without guaranteed CGS and HELP funding that figure would have been even higher. Individual universities are already cutting costs across the board through very substantial reductions in operational spending, deferral of vital capital works, and reductions in senior staff salaries. However, this will be nowhere near enough to cover what we conservatively estimate as a revenue decline of between $3bn and $4.6bn. My colleague Paul Karp has a full story now on the Treasurer Josh Frydenberg\u2019s interview on the ABC this morning. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says the state now has 98 confirmed cases of Covid-19, an increase of 12 since Saturday. The total had been revised down from yesterday, she said. There are 12 people in intensive care in the state. Palaszczuk had a \u201cbig thank you\u201d to Queenslanders who were \u201cabsolutely doing the right thing\u201d this Easter weekend. Tasmania\u2019s premier Peter Gutwein has confirmed a fifth death from Covid-19 in the state \u2013 a woman in her 70s. That puts the national death toll at 58. AAP reports that the woman died in the North West Regional Hospital. Gutwein confirmed this on Sunday and offered condolences. \u201cIt\u2019s again a stark reminder that this virus is deadly, it\u2019s taken lives and as I said it will take more yet,\u201d he said. Gutwein also said there had been 11 new cases of the coronavirus from the state\u2019s northwest. The state has a total of 133 confirmed cases of Covid-19, with 11 new cases in north-west Tasmania, where health authorities are working to contain an outbreak of the virus. Thirty-eight of the state\u2019s 133 confirmed cases have been linked to the North West Regional Hospital and North West Private Hospital in Burnie, with 26 staff among them. Gutwein hasn\u2019t ruled out tougher measures to limit the spread of the virus in the north-west, including a lockdown of the region. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy is up now in Canberra with a positive update, some thank yous and some congratulations. Australia now has 6,289 confirmed cases of Covid-19, he said. We\u2019ll try and find some clarification on that number because it is less than the 6292 that the government reported as of 3pm on Saturday. Some 80 people are in intensive care with 36 people on ventilators, Murphy said. There have been 57 deaths. Firstly, to the positive update. We have had a continual reduction in the number of new cases each day. There is no place in the world I would rather be than Australia at the moment. Having said that, as my colleagues have been saying for the past few days, we cannot become complacent. We still have some community transmission, small numbers of cases which do mean that there are people in the community that are transmitting this virus ... We are in a good place, as I have said a few days ago, but we have to maintain that good place. Now the thank yous, directed first at Australians. I would like to say a few things. I would like to thank the Australian people for embracing and living within these new, very restrictive measures that we have had to put in place, and they have come to the fore, as all Australians do. They have shown that they can change the way they behave, and I think as I have said on other occasions, we will start to see a whole different way we interact, even when this is over, in terms of hand hygiene and distancing. Murphy also had some words of thanks for frontline healthcare workers \u201cbut especially today, I want to recognise unsung heroes, and they are our public health workforce\u201d. There are 7000 or so people working in each of the public health units in the states and territories, doing case detection, contact tracing, isolation and making sure that our transmission is contained. The single biggest reason why we have not had a terrible outbreak of community transmission is that we in Australia have got on top of those cases, two-thirds of whom have still been our citizens returning back from overseas, and these public health workers, in each of the state and territory health departments, who have done that. Here are some images of the flight from Uruguay carrying Australian and New Zealand passengers from the stricken Antarctica cruise ship the Greg Mortimer. A little bit more from Victorian premier Daniel Andrews, who also gave us some numbers from the state\u2019s police service. Victorian police have done 19,303 checks so far, and have issued about 900 fines including 92 in the past 24 hours. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is providing an update on Covid-19 with the news there have been only three more cases overnight, and no further deaths. But Andrews announced the state of emergency would be extended for a further four weeks to 11 May. Andrews said Victoria now had 1,268 confirmed cases, with 28 people currently in hospital with 16 in intensive care. There have been 14 deaths. The low number of new cases was \u201cvery strong piece of evidence that our strategy is working\u201d he said, but the restrictions would stay in place, citing the nightmare of New York\u2019s recent daily death tolls of more than 1,200. He said: These things can change very quickly, and I would caution against any complacency or any sense that we will be able to change our policy settings, and wind back some of the restrictions we have put in place, any time soon. This needs to be for the long haul. We\u2019re starting to hear about some of those travellers arriving in from overseas destinations on flights in to Melbourne. News agency AAP reports that about 112 passengers from the Greg Mortimer cruise ship that had been moored off Montevideo in Uruguay landed at Tullamarine just before 7am. Previous reports suggest 16 of the 112 are New Zealanders. One small group was seen in masks leaving the plane and walking across the tarmac to a smaller plane. The ship had left Argentina, which neighbours Uruguay, on 15 March for a 16-day return trip to Antarctica. It had been stuck in South America for more than two weeks. The ship\u2019s operator Aurora Expeditions confirmed this week 128 of 217 people had tested positive for the coronavirus. Uruguay\u2019s foreign minister Ernesto Talvi said two Australian passengers could not be transported home as they were in intensive care at a hospital. The treasurer has closed up his interview with ABC Insider\u2019s host David Speers with a message of caution on lifting restrictions. It will only happen if the medical advice says it\u2019s safe. He said that \u201cso far our medical experts and those on the front line are the real heroes of the crisis\u201d. A few weeks ago, he said the number of cases per day was rising by 20%, but now the rise was at just 2%. Well, I think the Australian people are prepared for restrictions for as long as it takes, to be honest, because we have got to take the medical advice. It served us well. We have flattened that curve. We have to consolidate the gains. If you look at Japan, if you look at Singapore, they both thought they had great success. Now they have seen a second wave of cases. If you look at Sweden, they allowed large gatherings. They have now got the military setting up hospitals in the middle of Stockholm and they have had 650 deaths from coronavirus \u2013 they have half the population of us and more than 10 times the death. We have to take the medical advice. It is very dangerous \u2013 and unrealistic \u2013 to move ahead of the medical advice. It has served Australia well. Finally, the treasurer was asked if he was happy that \u201cwe can do six months of this\u201d. Frydenberg responded: Again, I am talking to business leaders. And they fully understand that the restrictions are based on the health advice and the health advice needs to be followed. Again, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball. The prime minister prepared the nation for six months at least. We are having a degree of success in flattening out that curve. But it is dangerous to move ahead of the medical advice. And that is where we will go. Victoria\u2019s health department has announced a man died on Saturday while he was in quarantine accommodation. A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said in a statement: Police are not treating the death as suspicious at this time. The coroner will be investigating the incident and as such we are unable to comment further. Our thoughts are with the family of the deceased at this time. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg says 802,000 businesses have applied for the jobkeeper payments as of Sunday morning. No doubt that represents millions of Australian workers ... We don\u2019t have the hard and fast numbers. They could be sole traders, not-for-profits, big and small businesses. They are likely to be a combination of all the above. The treasurer also says more than 600,000 Australians have \u201cindicated their interest\u201d in accessing some of their superannuation. He thinks that ultimately, because that program was announced before the jobkeeper program, less people will take the opportunity to dip into the superannuation than the government initially thought. The treasurer Josh Frydenberg is speaking to David Speers on the ABC\u2019s Insider\u2019s program and he\u2019s being asked about the options he might have to extend the jobseeker payment. Frydenberg admits he does have discretion to make changes to the program, but that right now \u201cwe have no planes to change the rules\u201d. He says: Well, there is a power to amend the rules due to unforeseen circumstances. The reason why this power was created is because the size of the program, David, $130n \u2013 it is unprecedented in scale and scope. But also because the parliament is not sitting on its normal schedule. We have no plans to change the rules. We want to implement the program as passed through the parliament with the support of the Labor party and we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the fact that Wednesday was an historic day for the federal parliament. At $130bn we have a wage subsidy in place that will support some 6 million Australian workers, at 70% of the median wage. If you\u2019re thinking about getting out and about on this Easter Sunday, there are a range of restrictions on our movement. Essentially, if you don\u2019t absolutely have to go out, then don\u2019t. We have a summary of all the restrictions. News agency AAP is reporting the death of a 74-year-old man from Covid-19 who was a passenger on the Ruby Princess cruise ship. The 74-year-old man succumbed to the infection in the Royal Adelaide hospital overnight, SA Health confirmed on Sunday. It is the state\u2019s fourth coronavirus death, with the national toll now standing at 57. \u201cOur thoughts are with the family and friends of the man,\u201d SA Health said. More than a dozen Ruby Princess passengers have died from the virus, and more than 500 people have been infected, either onboard or from contact with people who were. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, has spoken to Sky News, leaving a very small amount of wiggle room to expand the $130bn jobkeeper wage subsidy and discussing the need for \u201creform\u201d (possibly even GST reform!) on the other side of the Covid-19 crisis. On jobkeeper, McCormack said it was \u201cbroad enough ... to get as many people through to the other side as we can\u201d, playing down expectations it could be expanded beyond six million workers because Australia doesn\u2019t want \u201cto saddle ourselves with debt\u201d. But the Nationals leader said the government will \u201ccontinue to look at the situation, take advice from business and key stakeholders, and people on the ground\u201d. He also noted that the tax office has a discretion to waive the requirements of a 50% reduction in revenue for businesses earning more than $1bn a year or 30% for those below that threshold. McCormack suggested this could occur where a business \u201cmay have lost, say 45% [of revenue], or a drought stricken business that is unlikely to lose another 30% [compared to the previous year]\u201d. Asked about tax reform in general, and GST reform in particular, McCormack replied: \u201cThe recovery out the other side is going to need that [tax reform] ... I think the expenditure review committee and the states will be having a large say in that. But we need to come out the other side strong. We\u2019ve put in place $320bn of measures to make sure we can cushion our economy as best we can.\u201d McCormack praised the economic credentials of Liberal-National governments, claiming they know how to \u201cmanage money\u201d. He then flicked the switch back to bipartisanship by saying reform will \u201cneed the help of Labor states and territories, through the [Council of Australian Governments] process and the national cabinet being its best self\u201d. Asked about the possibility of a loan to Virgin, McCormack said Australia needs two airlines but has already given $1bn support package to the industry. Her Majesty The Queen released a special Easter Sunday message a few hours ago. In an effort for inclusiveness, the Queen spoke about the traditional lighting of candles during religious ceremonies, and how candles seemed to \u201cspeak to every culture and appeal to people of all faiths, and of none\u201d. Easter will be different for many of us but, by keeping apart, we keep others safe. But Easter isn\u2019t cancelled \u2013 indeed we need Easter as much as ever. Good morning to this Easter Sunday and our live coronavirus coverage for today. I\u2019m Graham Readfearn and I\u2019ll take you through the next few hours. So what\u2019s coming up, apart from all the chocolate (and it\u2019s milk chocolate for me)? We\u2019re expecting about 1,200 Australians to be arriving back into the country from today landing at Melbourne\u2019s Tullamarine airport and heading into quarantine. We\u2019ll bring you news of those arrivals a bit later. If you want to catch up with yesterday\u2019s developments \u2013 including the latest number of cases, and the folk in Sydney that still want to walk from Bondi to Bronte (and now can\u2019t because they\u2019ve shut the path due to the crowds) \u2013 you should have a quick read of my colleague Calla Wahlquist\u2019s wrap-up from late yesterday.",

      "body": "<p>Music has its seasons. So much, in centuries past, was written for the church year. As the days lengthen, still cool but bright, trees turning green, I realise how much I associate this time with JS Bach. Thanks to his two magnificent choral works, the <em>St Matthew Passion</em> and its shorter sibling, the<em> St John Passion</em>, Bach has captured the musical calendar for spring and the period leading up to Easter.

They force us to pause, to enter another mental space, as music uniquely can.</p> <p>This year all performances have been cancelled. Our lives have already been stopped by Covid-19. Churches and concert halls are shut. Choirs, large or small, professional or amateur, are silent. Battered vocal scores, marked up with \u201cstand\u201d, \u201csit\u201d and other vital instructions, remain on shelves until next year. Musicians\u2019 livelihoods have been shattered. The Passions are guaranteed dates in the diary, but I\u2019ve never heard a musician speak of this music as mere work.

That\u2019s a lot of decades of devoted attendance. I first sang in the<em> St Matthew Passion</em>, as part of the additional soprano chorus (called the <em>ripieno</em>, literally meaning stuffing) when I was a teenager. For two years, thanks to a school music teacher, I was part of the annual performances at the Royal Festival Hall, when the Bach Choir sang its heart out for its celebrated and cherubic conductor David Willcocks. He was quite a celebrity from his TV appearances as music director of the choir of King\u2019s College, Cambridge, responsible for the annual Christmas eve service of \u201cNine Lessons and Carols\u201d.</p> <p>The mezzo-soprano Janet Baker was a regular soloist. To share a platform, in however minor a way, with one of the most magnificent singers in modern times, meant something even to a recalcitrant adolescent more interested in the Top 40. These performances were all-day events, on a Sunday before Easter or on Good Friday. <em>Part One</em> was sung in the morning. Then performers and audience ate lunch, scattered around the Festival Hall\u2019s open spaces and stairwells, thermoses and Tupperware to hand, before<em> Part 2</em>. More than two and a half centuries after their composition (the <em>St John</em> in 1724, the <em>St Matthe</em>w in 1727), a communal tradition, different from Bach\u2019s but every bit as intense, was alive and perpetually renewing itself.</p> <p>Since then, Bach has been central to my life. I sang and played in these works as a student and returned often to the Festival Hall to hear the Bach Choir. I listened, in turn, to my 11-year-old daughter singing in the <em>ripieno</em> with her school choir at a local church. Her conversion to Bach, without parental coercion, was as real as mine. (I\u2019m still agonised by the memory of her little sister, who couldn\u2019t be left at home, snoring audibly through the quietest moments of the crucifixion drama. I should note that, a little later, her Bach moment came too.)</p> <p>For the past few years my Bach fix has been provided by the small choir of Polyphony, with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment at St John\u2019s Smith Square, just metres from the Houses of Parliament. In 2017 their performance took place days after the Westminster terror attack. The sound of intermittent police sirens added to the mood of solace and mutuality. This week I had planned to hear the choir of King\u2019s College, Cambridge, sing the <em>St John Passion </em>in the college\u2019s famous chapel, under their new choral director, Daniel Hyde \u2013 his first Easter in the job \u2013 a successor at two removes to David Willcocks.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WLedpz9a40\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0WLedpz9a40?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption> The alto aria <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0WLedpz9a40\">Erbarme dich</a> from the St Matthew Passion, a cry for mercy, \u2018for the sake of my tears\u2019. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Listening to one of the tens of available recordings only goes so far in replicating the experience of being there. These are works of collaboration and community. For a few hours \u2013 in every year but this \u2013 we can sit side by side with a friend or stranger, responding to the sung narrative of the Easter story, in whatever way we choose: a story of violence, prejudice, sacrifice, redemption. We make our own journeys, alone and together, through the mysteries and joys of Bach\u2019s music.</p> <p>Next spring, the singers and players will be back. Support them. They need you, but you may also find you need them. If you don\u2019t know this music, start with the alto aria <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0WLedpz9a40\">Erbarme dich</a> from the<em> St Matthew Passion</em>, a cry for mercy, \u201cfor the sake of my tears\u201d. A solo violin weaves its sobbing melody around the voice. It\u2019s a lament.

This week I had planned to hear the choir of King\u2019s College, Cambridge, sing the St John Passion in the college\u2019s famous chapel, under their new choral director, Daniel Hyde \u2013 his first Easter in the job \u2013 a successor at two removes to David Willcocks. Listening to one of the tens of available recordings only goes so far in replicating the experience of being there. These are works of collaboration and community. For a few hours \u2013 in every year but this \u2013 we can sit side by side with a friend or stranger, responding to the sung narrative of the Easter story, in whatever way we choose: a story of violence, prejudice, sacrifice, redemption. We make our own journeys, alone and together, through the mysteries and joys of Bach\u2019s music. Next spring, the singers and players will be back. Support them. They need you, but you may also find you need them. If you don\u2019t know this music, start with the alto aria Erbarme dich from the St Matthew Passion, a cry for mercy, \u201cfor the sake of my tears\u201d. A solo violin weaves its sobbing melody around the voice. It\u2019s a lament. Yet as ever with Bach\u2019s music, joyous in its unfolding beauty, it is also a dance, which moves at the pulse of the human heart. Radio 3\u2019s broadcasts of Bach\u2019s St John Passion and St Matthew Passion are available on BBC Sounds Hot gospels St Matthew Passion Bach Collegium Japan, conductor Masaaki Suzuki. A towering performance by a leading Bach authority (BIS). The Choir of King\u2019s College, Cambridge, with the Academy of Ancient Music, conductor Stephen Cleobury. A new recording, fresh and committed (KGS). St John Passion Collegium Vocale Gent, conductor Philippe Herreweghe. Always thoughtful and dramatic (OutHere Music). Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment &amp; Polyphony, conductor Stephen Layton. Top choir, top orchestra, top soloists (Hyperion). Easter Oratorio Monteverdi Choir, English Baroque Soloists, conductor John Eliot Gardiner. This less familiar work paired with the superb cantata Actus tragicus. St John Passion from Isolation A YouTube premiere by Oxford Bach Soloists, each musician performing in isolation, in aid of Help Musicians UK.",

He lives in hope that in another five years or so he might spot another one. Or even the same one</p>",

      "body": "<p>Europe is at the centre of the global pandemic but solidarity among European governments has been strikingly absent. Political fault-lines have reopened and it\u2019s now feared that tensions over the cost of the looming economic depression could feed nationalism and far-right populism. Despairing Italian and Spanish leaders have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/europes-future-is-at-stake-in-this-war-against-coronavirus\">warned</a> that the EU itself is at risk of falling apart. We asked experts how governments might still come together to reconstruct a hopeful post-lockdown future for Europe and beyond.</p> \n<h2><strong>Charles Grant</strong><strong>: The shock will be uneven \u2013 this requires a fiscal union</strong></h2> \n<p>Coronavirus has given hope to those who wish to see the EU stumble. Countries have put their own needs first and trust among governments has diminished. A long-running north-south rift over the future of the eurozone risks widening into a deadly chasm.</p> \n<p>The economic depression will hit government revenues and lead to soaring public debt and unemployment. But the virus\u2019s impact will be uneven: some EU states start with loads of debt and rely on industries such as tourism that will be severely affected, notwithstanding the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/eu-risks-break-up-over-coronabonds-row-warns-italian-pm\">compromise</a> that EU ministers signed up to on April 9.</p> \n<p>Several southern countries, and especially Italy, face grim prospects. Italians feel that after the eurozone and migration crises the EU is once again abandoning them. Their economy has scarcely grown since the birth of the euro and public debt is 135% of GDP. The populist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/matteo-salvini\">Matteo Salvini</a> now questions EU membership and is well-placed to win the next election.</p> \n<p>The European commission has struggled to give strong leadership, but most of the key levers on health, borders and the economy remain in national capitals.</p> \n<p>The European Central Bank has come up with an impressive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/ecb-asset-purchase-programme-boosts-euro\">\u20ac750bn bond-buying programme</a>. But ECB action will not suffice. The EU needs to take on a role in fiscal policy. France, Spain and Italy want the EU to issue <a href=\"https://www.cer.eu/insights/proposal-coronabond-pandemic-solidarity-instrument\">bonds guaranteed</a> by the member states. The biggest share of the money would go to the neediest countries, to subsidise spending on health, corporate grants, unemployment pay and investment.</p> \n<p>Eurobonds would mean the better-off EU countries helping to limit dire outcomes in southern Europe. The Germans, Dutch and other northerners oppose, fearing this would discourage weaker countries from undertaking painful reforms. They have a point, but the alternative \u2013 eurozone members sinking into a negative spiral of falling GDP and rising debt, and perhaps exiting the EU \u2013 would be worse for all concerned.</p> \n<p>If the EU cannot respond to Covid-19 by moving towards fiscal union it will lose credibility in many member states.</p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/charlesgrant\">Charles Grant</a> is director of the Centre for European Reform, an independent thinktank</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><br><strong>Shada Islam</strong><strong>: Europe could limit the global damage</strong></h2> \n<p>The way Europe acts today will determine everyone\u2019s post-pandemic future.</p> \n<p>So far, it is not Europe\u2019s finest hour. We see authoritarian creep <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/coronavirus-is-a-chance-for-authoritarian-leaders-to-tighten-their-grip\">in Hungary</a> and elsewhere. As solidarity becomes a hollow mantra, the EU brand is tarnished.</p> \n<p>It doesn\u2019t have to be that way.

      "bodyText": "Europe is at the centre of the global pandemic but solidarity among European governments has been strikingly absent. Political fault-lines have reopened and it\u2019s now feared that tensions over the cost of the looming economic depression could feed nationalism and far-right populism. Despairing Italian and Spanish leaders have warned that the EU itself is at risk of falling apart. We asked experts how governments might still come together to reconstruct a hopeful post-lockdown future for Europe and beyond. Charles Grant: The shock will be uneven \u2013 this requires a fiscal union Coronavirus has given hope to those who wish to see the EU stumble. Countries have put their own needs first and trust among governments has diminished. A long-running north-south rift over the future of the eurozone risks widening into a deadly chasm. The economic depression will hit government revenues and lead to soaring public debt and unemployment. But the virus\u2019s impact will be uneven: some EU states start with loads of debt and rely on industries such as tourism that will be severely affected, notwithstanding the compromise that EU ministers signed up to on April 9. Several southern countries, and especially Italy, face grim prospects. Italians feel that after the eurozone and migration crises the EU is once again abandoning them. Their economy has scarcely grown since the birth of the euro and public debt is 135% of GDP. The populist Matteo Salvini now questions EU membership and is well-placed to win the next election. The European commission has struggled to give strong leadership, but most of the key levers on health, borders and the economy remain in national capitals. The European Central Bank has come up with an impressive \u20ac750bn bond-buying programme. But ECB action will not suffice. The EU needs to take on a role in fiscal policy. France, Spain and Italy want the EU to issue bonds guaranteed by the member states. The biggest share of the money would go to the neediest countries, to subsidise spending on health, corporate grants, unemployment pay and investment. Eurobonds would mean the better-off EU countries helping to limit dire outcomes in southern Europe. The Germans, Dutch and other northerners oppose, fearing this would discourage weaker countries from undertaking painful reforms. They have a point, but the alternative \u2013 eurozone members sinking into a negative spiral of falling GDP and rising debt, and perhaps exiting the EU \u2013 would be worse for all concerned. If the EU cannot respond to Covid-19 by moving towards fiscal union it will lose credibility in many member states. Charles Grant is director of the Centre for European Reform, an independent thinktank Shada Islam: Europe could limit the global damage The way Europe acts today will determine everyone\u2019s post-pandemic future. So far, it is not Europe\u2019s finest hour. We see authoritarian creep in Hungary and elsewhere. As solidarity becomes a hollow mantra, the EU brand is tarnished. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way. With US leadership missing in action, the EU could step boldly into the breach in three important ways. First, the shock is global. Piecemeal national or even regional responses won\u2019t be enough.

After weeks of competing with other states for critical medical equipment, in the absence of strategy and coordination from the federal government, Newsom said he had had enough. So he harnessed the bulk purchasing power of \u201cthe state of California as a nation-state\u201d to spend nearly $1bn to work with non-profits and manufacturers to deliver masks for his constituents, and possibly other states.</p> <p>The next morning, as <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article241860561.html\">#PresidentNewsom trended</a> on Twitter, Newsom once again presented the state he leads as a global power. \u201cWe need to coordinate and organize our nation-state status,\u201d he told reporters at his daily Covid-19 press briefing. California \u201chas been a catalyst to increase supply that will not only avail itself to the state of California but more broadly across this country and potentially in other parts of the globe\u201d, he added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/why-california-waiting-test-results-backlog-quest-diagnostics\">Why is California still waiting for nearly 60,000 coronavirus test results?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the leader of the nation\u2019s most populous state \u2013 which, Newsom often likes to point out, would have the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy, if it were a sovereign nation \u2013 the governor has often cast himself as a foil to Donald Trump. As the president and the governor bickered, critics in California have lamented that the governor often promised more than he could deliver, and was at times counterproductive by trying to appease too many groups at once. But amid the federal government\u2019s faltering response to the coronavirus crisis, Newsom is getting both local and national recognition for stepping into a leadership vacuum.</p> <p>After identifying its first cases of Covid-19 in late February, California became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/13/california-coronavirus-response-schools-disneyland\">first US state to issue</a> a widespread stay-at-home order on 19 March. Since then, the state has seen more than 20,000 coronavirus cases and 570 deaths \u2013 but the death toll appears to be rising more slowly than in hard-hit New York and New Jersey. Public health experts have credited the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-31/coronavirus-social-distancing-west-coast-california-new-york-covid\">state\u2019s foresight</a> in enforcing social distancing. The Trump administration\u2019s response meanwhile, has lagged behind, with the president denying the crisis and delaying action even as the national death toll climbed.</p> <p>Newsom moved into the governor\u2019s mansion in 2018, replacing Jerry Brown \u2013 a prominent figure who had dominated California politics since the 1970s. At 52, he has already had a long career in politics and weathered a fair share of scandal. More than 15 years ago, as San Francisco mayor, he made headlines after he defied national law to marry same-sex couples in California.

      "bodyText": "Gavin Newsom this week declared himself the leader of a \u201cnation-state\u201d. Speaking on MSNBC, the California governor on Tuesday announced his state would be amassing more than 200m medical-grade masks per month for health workers on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. After weeks of competing with other states for critical medical equipment, in the absence of strategy and coordination from the federal government, Newsom said he had had enough. So he harnessed the bulk purchasing power of \u201cthe state of California as a nation-state\u201d to spend nearly $1bn to work with non-profits and manufacturers to deliver masks for his constituents, and possibly other states. The next morning, as #PresidentNewsom trended on Twitter, Newsom once again presented the state he leads as a global power. \u201cWe need to coordinate and organize our nation-state status,\u201d he told reporters at his daily Covid-19 press briefing. California \u201chas been a catalyst to increase supply that will not only avail itself to the state of California but more broadly across this country and potentially in other parts of the globe\u201d, he added. As the leader of the nation\u2019s most populous state \u2013 which, Newsom often likes to point out, would have the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy, if it were a sovereign nation \u2013 the governor has often cast himself as a foil to Donald Trump. As the president and the governor bickered, critics in California have lamented that the governor often promised more than he could deliver, and was at times counterproductive by trying to appease too many groups at once. But amid the federal government\u2019s faltering response to the coronavirus crisis, Newsom is getting both local and national recognition for stepping into a leadership vacuum. After identifying its first cases of Covid-19 in late February, California became the first US state to issue a widespread stay-at-home order on 19 March. Since then, the state has seen more than 20,000 coronavirus cases and 570 deaths \u2013 but the death toll appears to be rising more slowly than in hard-hit New York and New Jersey. Public health experts have credited the state\u2019s foresight in enforcing social distancing. The Trump administration\u2019s response meanwhile, has lagged behind, with the president denying the crisis and delaying action even as the national death toll climbed. Newsom moved into the governor\u2019s mansion in 2018, replacing Jerry Brown \u2013 a prominent figure who had dominated California politics since the 1970s. At 52, he has already had a long career in politics and weathered a fair share of scandal. More than 15 years ago, as San Francisco mayor, he made headlines after he defied national law to marry same-sex couples in California. He made national headlines again in 2007 after it was revealed he had an affair with a subordinate, who was also the wife of his chief campaign adviser. At the time, Newsom was separated from Kimberly Guilfoyle \u2013 now an adviser to the president, and the partner of his son Donald Trump Jr. Newsom has tried to cast himself as a young, fresh and progressive leader \u2013 whose Silicon Valley-chic contrasts with Brown\u2019s suits and ties. He has also presented himself as the governor of \u201cthe most un-Trump state in America\u201d \u2013 loudly challenging the Trump administration\u2019s policies on the environment, immigration, healthcare and gun rights \u2013 often on the president\u2019s favorite platform: Twitter. Trump, meanwhile, has relished taunting Newsom as an \u201cincompetent governor\u201d, and obsessing over narrow policies that disproportionately affect California. But amid the coronavirus crisis, rather than fighting the president, Newsom has opted to show him up, in some cases delivering on the president\u2019s empty promises. As Trump blithely reassured, \u201cJust stay calm. It will go away,\u201d Newsom earned praise from public health experts around the country for enforcing strict, early distancing orders. While Trump beat back pleas from governors to send more of the ventilators needed to treat coronavirus patients, Newsom shipped 500 ventilators to seven states. And when the federal government sent faulty equipment, Newsom harnessed the state\u2019s outsized tech industry to quickly fix them. As the federal government stepped back from the crisis, governors including Newsom, Andrew Cuomo in New York and Jay Inslee in Washington found a national audience of Americans looking for steady administration amid chaos. Governors across the country have stepped up, said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political strategist who has worked for former president Bill Clinton and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg. \u201cPeople look for heroes in times of crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cAmericans want that figure, that hero that steps out of the mist and into the sun.\u201d And among the governors, Newsom and Cuomo have shined brightest, per Sheinkopf\u2019s assessment. \u201cNewsom is almost in an attention battle with Andrew Cuomo,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could be competitors for the presidential nomination in 2024.\u201d Newsom has brushed away questions about his presidential aspirations. \u201cThis is not political,\u201d he told reporters in California, the day after his MSNBC interview. \u201cThis is not in any way, shape or form usurping or undermining.

      "bodyText": "As the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic in New York City continues to rise, grisly drone footage captured this week showed bodies of victims being buried in a trench within the city limits. The footage also offered a grim glimpse into a little-known part of New York where the still functioning potter\u2019s field of Hart Island holds more than a million bodies: overwhelmingly the poor, the anonymous and the unclaimed. Hart Island, less than a mile off the coast of the Bronx, has served as a potter\u2019s field for more than 150 years. More than a third of those interred on the island are infants, laid to rest in trenches that can fit up to 1,000 bodies. Adults were buried in graves that could accommodate 150 people at a time. New York City bought the island, a former prison for Confederate soldiers, in 1868, and the number of bodies buried on the 141-acre site quickly began to soar. The burials had been decreasing in the 21st century, but the coronavirus has led to a surge in deaths, and an unexpected spike in new burials. About 25 bodies a week are normally interred on the island, buried by inmates at Rikers Island jail, the sprawling complex that houses some 10,000 people awaiting trial in New York City. The coronavirus has changed that, however. Burials are normally conducted on one day of the week, now they are taking place on five, with about 25 people being buried each day. Aerial footage on Thursday showed workers at Hart Island in action, digging long trenches while some 40 coffins stood waiting to be interred. Rikers Island inmates have been spared the macabre task since the coronavirus hit, and the work is instead being done by contractors. The sharp increase in the island\u2019s massive body count is not quite what the city had planned for this year. In December New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, signed an order transferring management of Hart\u2019s Island to the city\u2019s parks department. Those whose loved ones are buried on the island hoped the change could make it easier to visit \u2013 currently a trip to the island can take months to schedule, through the department of corrections labyrinthine process. The surge can be attributed, at least in part, to New York City cutting the amount of time a body can remain unclaimed. Under rules brought in since the virus hit the city, if a body is not claimed in 14 days it will be shipped to Hart Island and buried \u2013 temporarily at first, then permanently if the remains are still unclaimed. The new 14-day rule was a quietly introduced switch from the previous practice, which gave families or friends 30 days to claim a body. More than 4,500 people have died in New York City from the coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University. The transfer of Hart Island management to the parks department recalls the historic intertwining of parks and mass burial sites in New York City. Recent news reports had suggested Central Park could serve as a temporary burial site for the coronavirus dead, and while the city later said Manhattan\u2019s flagship park would not be used as a grave, other parks have been previously used as resting sites for victims of widespread disease. Washington Square Park is the most notorious of these. More than 20,000 people are buried beneath the park, a haven of greenery in the otherwise brick and concrete surrounds of Manhattan\u2019s Greenwich Village. Many of the interred fell victim to a yellow fever outbreak that swept through the city in the early part of the 19th century. Others were laid to rest in Washington Square because they couldn\u2019t afford to be buried privately. The body count was added to by a public gallows, erected at the site of what is today a fountain.

The move came just days after Trump axed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/donald-trump-fires-intelligence-watchdog-michael-atkinson-impeachment\">intelligence community IG</a> who had alerted Congress to a whistleblower complaint precipitating Trump\u2019s impeachment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/06/ousted-us-intelligence-inspector-general-urges-others-to-speak-out-and-defend-whistleblowers\">Ousted US intelligence inspector general urges whistleblowers not to be 'silenced' by Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump also drew fire for tapping a White House lawyer involved in fighting impeachment as a special IG to oversee a $500bn corporate bailout piece of the $2.2tn law. Days before, Trump had used the signing statement for the law to blunt two newly created IG posts, suggesting he would decide what information Congress receives about the aid package.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s sudden oustings of the two well-respected watchdogs, Michael Atkinson, the IG for the intelligence community, and Glenn Fine, the acting IG for the Pentagon, sparked special concerns given their timing and apparent political motivations.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s ousting of Fine, who was recently picked by his fellow IGs to run a critical oversight panel for the $2.2tn law, is seen as a broad slap at any oversight on the president and his administration since it rendered Fine ineligible to lead the watchdog panel.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s motives in firing Atkinson prompted other worries. After initially saying he had simply lost confidence in Atkinson, Trump used a pandemic press briefing the next day to unleash an angry torrent at Atkinson\u2019s handling of the whistleblower complaint, slamming him as not \u201ca big Trump fan\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s antipathy to IG watchdogs was displayed again at a pandemic briefing last week when he was asked about a report by the health and human services IG revealing that hospitals faced \u201cwidespread\u201d shortages of face masks, and \u201csevere\u201d test shortages.</p> <p>Providing no evidence, Trump dismissed the report as \u201cjust wrong\u201d, and the next day labeled it \u201canother fake dossier\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06b7f8acf731ab75671a37e1764ec48afa299e3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06b7f8acf731ab75671a37e1764ec48afa299e3e/0_126_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At a recent press briefing Trump unleashed an angry torrent at Atkinson\u2019s handling of the whistleblower complaint.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At a recent press briefing Trump unleashed an angry torrent at Atkinson\u2019s handling of the whistleblower complaint.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>IGs were created in 1978 to ferret out executive agency waste, fraud and abuse. Presidents nominate them, but they require Senate approval.</p> <p>\u201cThe mandate for IGs is to serve as the public eyes and ears regarding the functioning of the executive branch,\u201d said Michael Bromwich, a prominent ex-IG at the justice department. \u201cThat means they must be independent, and they are required to be so by law. Trump doesn\u2019t understand any legal mandate that conflicts with personal loyalty. He believes everybody in the executive branch should be loyal to him personally.\u201d</p> <p>For instance, Atkinson\u2019s firing reveals Trump\u2019s penchant to \u201cretaliate against people he perceives to be his enemies whose duties require them to do things that are contrary to Trump\u2019s political interests\u201d, Bromwich said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump doesn\u2019t understand any legal mandate that conflicts with personal loyalty</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Bromwich, former IG</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Likewise, Fine \u201cis simply too independent and has too much integrity to be trusted to minimize or sweep under the rug problems with the $2tn package recently passed by Congress\u201d.</p> <p>Other ex-IGs say Trump\u2019s actions pose a danger to all IG watchdogs and the vital role they perform in curbing corruption</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s actions are clearly a threat to all IGs,\u201d said Cynthia Schnader, a former acting IG at the justice department. In just a few days, \u201che has fired one, moved another one aside, and publicly attacked a third one for accurately reporting problems.\u201d</p> <p>The former Pentagon IG Eleanor Hill stressed that Trump\u2019s moves seem to endanger the mandate of IGs \u201cto be honest and independent brokers\u201d, and alert Congress to serious problems.</p> <p>Significantly, the current justice IG, Michael Horowitz, who leads a group of executive branch IGs, quickly came to Atkinson\u2019s defense, issuing a strong statement of support for his \u201cintegrity and professionalism\u201d \u2013 including his handling of the whistleblower complaint that helped spark Trump\u2019s impeachment which featured one count of obstruction of Congress. Horowitz has also vowed that \u201caggressive, independent oversight\u201d would continue after the firing.</p> <p>Former officials say Trump mistreated Atkinson.</p> <p>\u201cIt is troubling to see that the president \u2013 apparently based on political grievances \u2013 has removed Michael Atkinson, a talented and capable inspector general who was doing exactly what his job requires,\u201d said Mary McCord, a former chief of the DoJ\u2019s national security section where Atkinson once worked.</p> <p>Atkinson himself concurred.</p> <p>\u201cIt is hard not to think that the president\u2019s loss of confidence in me derives from my having faithfully discharged my legal obligations as an independent and impartial Inspector General, and from my commitment to continue to do so,\u201d Atkinson said in a statement on Sunday.</p> <p>Other criticism of Trump erupted when he selected the White House lawyer Brian Miller as a special IG for a $500bn business chunk of the $2.2tn law.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone who currently works in the White House counsel\u2019s office, serving a president who has tried to silence other inspector generals and announced his intention to silence this one, is not independent,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate finance panel, said in a statement.</p> <p>In Bromwich\u2019s eyes, Trump \u201chas rejected all forms of oversight by congressional committees, and has now turned his opposition to oversight to the IG community\u201d.</p>",

Trump also drew fire for tapping a White House lawyer involved in fighting impeachment as a special IG to oversee a $500bn corporate bailout piece of the $2.2tn law. Days before, Trump had used the signing statement for the law to blunt two newly created IG posts, suggesting he would decide what information Congress receives about the aid package. Trump\u2019s sudden oustings of the two well-respected watchdogs, Michael Atkinson, the IG for the intelligence community, and Glenn Fine, the acting IG for the Pentagon, sparked special concerns given their timing and apparent political motivations. Trump\u2019s ousting of Fine, who was recently picked by his fellow IGs to run a critical oversight panel for the $2.2tn law, is seen as a broad slap at any oversight on the president and his administration since it rendered Fine ineligible to lead the watchdog panel. Trump\u2019s motives in firing Atkinson prompted other worries. After initially saying he had simply lost confidence in Atkinson, Trump used a pandemic press briefing the next day to unleash an angry torrent at Atkinson\u2019s handling of the whistleblower complaint, slamming him as not \u201ca big Trump fan\u201d. Trump\u2019s antipathy to IG watchdogs was displayed again at a pandemic briefing last week when he was asked about a report by the health and human services IG revealing that hospitals faced \u201cwidespread\u201d shortages of face masks, and \u201csevere\u201d test shortages. Providing no evidence, Trump dismissed the report as \u201cjust wrong\u201d, and the next day labeled it \u201canother fake dossier\u201d. IGs were created in 1978 to ferret out executive agency waste, fraud and abuse. Presidents nominate them, but they require Senate approval. \u201cThe mandate for IGs is to serve as the public eyes and ears regarding the functioning of the executive branch,\u201d said Michael Bromwich, a prominent ex-IG at the justice department. \u201cThat means they must be independent, and they are required to be so by law. Trump doesn\u2019t understand any legal mandate that conflicts with personal loyalty. He believes everybody in the executive branch should be loyal to him personally.\u201d For instance, Atkinson\u2019s firing reveals Trump\u2019s penchant to \u201cretaliate against people he perceives to be his enemies whose duties require them to do things that are contrary to Trump\u2019s political interests\u201d, Bromwich said. Likewise, Fine \u201cis simply too independent and has too much integrity to be trusted to minimize or sweep under the rug problems with the $2tn package recently passed by Congress\u201d. Other ex-IGs say Trump\u2019s actions pose a danger to all IG watchdogs and the vital role they perform in curbing corruption \u201cTrump\u2019s actions are clearly a threat to all IGs,\u201d said Cynthia Schnader, a former acting IG at the justice department. In just a few days, \u201che has fired one, moved another one aside, and publicly attacked a third one for accurately reporting problems.\u201d The former Pentagon IG Eleanor Hill stressed that Trump\u2019s moves seem to endanger the mandate of IGs \u201cto be honest and independent brokers\u201d, and alert Congress to serious problems. Significantly, the current justice IG, Michael Horowitz, who leads a group of executive branch IGs, quickly came to Atkinson\u2019s defense, issuing a strong statement of support for his \u201cintegrity and professionalism\u201d \u2013 including his handling of the whistleblower complaint that helped spark Trump\u2019s impeachment which featured one count of obstruction of Congress. Horowitz has also vowed that \u201caggressive, independent oversight\u201d would continue after the firing. Former officials say Trump mistreated Atkinson. \u201cIt is troubling to see that the president \u2013 apparently based on political grievances \u2013 has removed Michael Atkinson, a talented and capable inspector general who was doing exactly what his job requires,\u201d said Mary McCord, a former chief of the DoJ\u2019s national security section where Atkinson once worked. Atkinson himself concurred. \u201cIt is hard not to think that the president\u2019s loss of confidence in me derives from my having faithfully discharged my legal obligations as an independent and impartial Inspector General, and from my commitment to continue to do so,\u201d Atkinson said in a statement on Sunday. Other criticism of Trump erupted when he selected the White House lawyer Brian Miller as a special IG for a $500bn business chunk of the $2.2tn law. \u201cSomeone who currently works in the White House counsel\u2019s office, serving a president who has tried to silence other inspector generals and announced his intention to silence this one, is not independent,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate finance panel, said in a statement. In Bromwich\u2019s eyes, Trump \u201chas rejected all forms of oversight by congressional committees, and has now turned his opposition to oversight to the IG community\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>A lot has been written about how this pandemic is exacerbating social inequalities. But what if it\u2019s because our societies are so unequal that this pandemic happened?</p> <p>There is a school of thought that, historically, pandemics have been more likely to occur at times of social inequality and discord. As the poor get poorer, the thinking goes, their baseline health suffers, making them more prone to infection. At the same time they are forced to move more, in search of work, and to gravitate to cities. The rich, meanwhile, have more to spend on luxuries, including products that hail from far-flung places. The world becomes more tightly connected through trade, and germs, people and luxury goods travel together along trade routes that connect cities. On paper, it looks like a perfect storm.</p> <p>What about in reality? Historian Peter Turchin has described a strong statistical association between global connectedness, social crises and pandemics throughout history. An example is the second century CE, when the Roman and Chinese empires were at the peak of their wealth and power; the poor in both places were very poor, and the ancient silk routes were enjoying a heyday. Starting in 165CE, the Antonine plagues struck Rome; within a decade plague was devastating China too, and both empires then went into decline.</p> <p>The plague of Justinian in the 6th century and the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Black-Death\">Black Death</a> in the 14th century emerged in similar circumstances, and Turchin sees the same forces at work again today: globalisation, leading to the emergence of new human pathogens, combined with widening inequality. \u201cAnd now it looks like our Age of Discord got its own pandemic,\u201d he wrote in a <a href=\"http://peterturchin.com/cliodynamica/coronavirus-and-our-age-of-discord/\">blog</a> last week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-could-turn-back-the-clock-30-years-on-global-poverty\">Coronavirus could turn back the clock 30 years on global poverty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pandemics don\u2019t always trigger social unrest, but they can do, by throwing into relief the very inequalities that caused them. That\u2019s because they hit the poor hardest \u2013 those in low-paid or unstable employment, who live in crowded accommodation, have underlying health issues, and for whom healthcare is less affordable or less accessible. This was true in the past and remains so today. During the 2009 flu pandemic the death rate was <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22297400\">three times higher</a> in the poorest fifth of England\u2019s population than in the richest. Covid-19 is showing no signs of departing from the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/world/europe/coronavirus-inequality.html\">pattern</a>, which, because of the way the socioeconomic dice fall, also has a racial dimension.</p> <p>But there is something brand new about this pandemic, which has never been seen before in the history of humanity \u2013 and that is our unprecedented global experiment in lockdown. These lockdown measures are designed to slow the spread of the disease, relieve the burden on health systems and ultimately save lives \u2013 and it looks as if they may be doing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52133054\">that</a>. But they may also be exacerbating social inequalities themselves.</p> <p>We won\u2019t have a full picture of their impact until the pandemic is over, but there have been anecdotal <a href=\"https://voxeu.org/article/covid-19-inequality-and-gig-economy-workers\">reports</a> that point to this, and some more systematic analyses are emerging. Preliminary findings from a survey of 1,200 Norwegians, <a href=\"https://www.oslomet.no/en/research/featured-research/how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-is-affecting-people-s-health-and-careers\">published</a> last week, indicate that people with lower levels of education and income are more likely to be temporarily laid off. They can apply for a government furlough scheme, similar to the one in the UK, but they are also more likely to see their income fall and to worry that their unemployment might become permanent.</p> <p>The Norwegian study found no correlation between poverty and self-reported sickness from Covid-19, but it did find that poorer, less well-educated people were less likely to comply with social distancing guidelines. It\u2019s hard to tell why, says demographer Svenn-Erik Mamelund of Oslo Metropolitan University, who was involved in the survey, but he has theories.</p> <p>People in lower socioeconomic groups may feel more pressure to go out to work, Mamelund says. They may also have lower levels of health literacy, less trust in officialdom, and even language problems if they are of non-Norwegian origin. He fears that these lower levels of compliance with public health measures might spill into higher levels of sickness and death later on, as they are exposed to the disease.</p> <p>Whether these measures are justified by the threat Covid-19 poses to human life is impossible to say, but those who imposed them knew there would be a high price to pay. Last year Mamelund sat on a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/influenza/publications/public_health_measures/publication/en/\">committee</a> that advised the World Health Organization on non-pharmaceutical interventions in case of a pandemic. The committee\u2019s job was to assess the costs and benefits of measures for slowing disease spread \u2013 everything from hand-washing to border closure \u2013 based on the available evidence. They came up with a list of recommendations that excluded lockdown, even in the worst-case scenario. \u201cWe never suggested lockdown because we knew it would be so harmful socially and economically for all countries,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I never thought the rest of the world would follow China\u2019s lead.\u201d</p> <p>Norway has a small population \u2013 5.4 million people \u2013 and a well-funded welfare state.

      "body": "<p>Hannah Arendt once wrote that in times of deep crisis \u201cwe have a right to expect illumination\u201d. It seems callous to suggest that this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">tenebrous pandemic</a> is letting the light in, and daft to offer immediate consolations amid so much grief. But there is a sense that, with the world having ground to a halt, our fantasies are finally taking flight.</p> <p>Much of what we have always been told was impossible is actually happening: the homeless are (in some places) being housed in hotels while prisoners are (in others) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/04/up-to-4000-inmates-to-be-temporarily-released-in-england-and-wales\">being released</a>. Kids are told not to go to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/06/school-closures-have-little-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-study\">school</a> and to forget exams. Massive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/chancellor-makes-30bn-budget-pledge-to-protect-economy-from-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\">government spending</a> is ensuring that people are guaranteed an income even if they can\u2019t work. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-spain-nationalises-private-hospitals-emergency-covid-19-lockdown-2020-3?r=US&amp;IR=T\">Private hospitals in Spain</a> are being nationalised. A hospital has been <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-spain-nationalises-private-hospitals-emergency-covid-19-lockdown-2020-3?r=US&amp;IR=T\">built in London</a> under a fortnight. In Portugal, tens of thousands of migrants and asylum seekers have been \u201cregularised\u201d and given full rights. It\u2019s not quite a revolution, but it\u2019s an epic conceptual awakening.</p> <p>I live in Parma, but despite the profound anguish here in Italy, it also feels, paradoxically, as if the world has come right in some way. With our despoiling suddenly stopped, wildlife is returning with innocent ebullience. Bottlenose dolphins have been playfully leaping in the <a href=\"Bottlenose%20dolphins%20have%20been%20playfully%20leaping%20in%20the%20waters%20around%20Venice\">waters around Venice</a>. The canals are so crystalline that swans, and shoals of fish, have returned. Hares graze undisturbed in parks in Milan. Deer have been strolling the golf courses of Sardinia and paddling along sandy beaches. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/picture/2013/oct/01/1\">Mallards are bathing</a> in Piazza di Spagna and birds have been nesting in the crooks of closed-up, disused wing-mirrors.</p> <p>In some ways it\u2019s like a blissed-out stoner\u2019s dream of what the world might be. The \u201cPianura Padana\u201d, the flat plain of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/picture/2013/oct/01/1\">Po valley</a>, usually has some of the worst air pollution in the world. The air is now perfumed by spring. You can see the mountains. Two weeks ago we were singing Rino Gaetano\u2019s The Sky Is Evermore Blue from our balconies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"612e806230b6cdb8d7a7ef932c5d4cac9320986c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/612e806230b6cdb8d7a7ef932c5d4cac9320986c/0_141_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Grand Canal, Venice, empty of traffic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Grand Canal, Venice, empty of traffic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Silvestri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Realists have, rightly, tempered the utopian excitement and warned of a bleak future. Outbreaks of localised barbarism and criminality are predictable when people feel impoverished, paranoid and vulnerable. Already, in Italy, we\u2019ve had instances of toughs refusing to pay in supermarkets. Democratic politicians have had a taste of almost dictatorial power over the people, and it will be hard to roll back rule by emergency decrees. Countries like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/hungarian-journalists-fear-coronavirus-law-may-be-used-to-jail-them\">Hungary</a> might be slipping away from the democratic fraternity. Public health will be an excuse to ramp up state surveillance and, when we need to jump-start the economy, environmental protections may well be ripped up. The counter-revolution, those seers say, is just around the corner.</p> <p>But despite all these fantasies, one of the consequences of the crisis is that we\u2019re suddenly more serious about the truth. \u201cAccurate scientific, economic, political and social information about what is happening somewhere,\u201d <a href=\"Bill%20Foster,%20a%20history%20lecturer%20at%20Homerton%20College,%20Cambridge\">Bill Foster</a>, a history lecturer at Homerton College, Cambridge, told me last week, \u201cis suddenly valuable everywhere. It\u2019s literally a matter of life and death. We might just be tempted now to remember what we lost when we started to abandon trying to find truths together.\u201d It\u2019s intriguing that it\u2019s taken this pandemic, rather than sensitive referendums and elections, to persuade social media companies of the need to <a href=\"Bill%20Foster,%20a%20history%20lecturer%20at%20Homerton%20College,%20Cambridge\">combat fake news</a> and conspiracy theories.</p> <p>Without truth there is no trust, and the gates of civilisation are wide open to political blackguards and devious disinformation. Those gates have been open for decades, and it\u2019s one of the hard-to-swallow lessons of this contagion that gate-keeping is paramount, that we need boundaries and membranes. Having managed a therapeutic community for almost a decade, I\u2019ve always known that blocking, or expelling, damaging elements was vital to communal wellbeing (you can\u2019t, for example, have drug use in a rehab). I knew that monastic wisdom depended on enclosure. But I still instinctively baulked at any impediment to free movement on a global level. We internationalists inevitably struggle to accept the idea. And yet the very first principle of a functioning group (as enunciated by Nobel prize-winning political economist, <a href=\"Nobel%20Prize-winning%20political%20economist,%20Elinor%20Ostrom\">Elinor </a><a href=\"Nobel%20Prize-winning%20political%20economist,%20Elinor%20Ostrom\">Ostrom</a>) is \u201ceffective exclusion of external, unentitled parties\u201d.</p> <p>The penny has also dropped that wellbeing isn\u2019t individual but social. We are not actually independent at all, but dependent. We can make each other sick and we can try to make each other well. We\u2019ve understood that a healthy community (as Wendell Berry wrote in his essay <a href=\"https://scienceandsociety.duke.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Berry-Health-is-Membership.pdf\">Health Is Membership</a>) isn\u2019t merely human, but also \u201cits soil, its water, its air\u201d.</p> <p>It has been fascinating to see the speed at which other attitudes have changed. The indignation expressed towards people not respecting <a href=\"https://scienceandsociety.duke.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Berry-Health-is-Membership.pdf\">social distancing</a> (from those who would never normally describe themselves as moralists) has been understandably shrill: here too we\u2019ve suddenly realised that the wellbeing of the group is endangered by indifferent individuals, and that community \u2013 for which we\u2019ve yearned for so long \u2013 means originally simply a pooling of duties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ba36caf01032dfedadb4284a7c06c27095a8af8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ba36caf01032dfedadb4284a7c06c27095a8af8/0_187_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man with a bouquet in San Fiorano, Italy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 16th day of quarantine in San Fiorano, one of the 11 small towns in northern Italy that has been on lockdown since February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marzio Toniolo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/18/need-roots-disconnection-past-community\">The Need for Roots</a></em>, her manifesto for how to refound society after the second world war, the philosopher and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/feb/03/religion-simone-weil\">Simone Weil</a> wrote that \u201cthe notion of obligations comes before that of rights\u201d. It\u2019s a complicated, but convincing case, and it seems to me that in the last month there has been a radical shift in the balance between rights and responsibilities that has changed the timbre of our lives. I\u2019ve never seen so many news items about <a href=\"the%20notion%20of%20obligations%20comes%20before%20that%20of%20rights\">applause</a>, or so many social media posts accompanied by clappy emojis. Before, \u201cin the absence of adversity\u201d, the psychiatrist and philosopher <a href=\"https://iainmcgilchrist.com/\">Iain McGilchrist</a> said this month: \u201cWe grew flabby, selfish. We manufactured grievances that now can be seen for what they were.\u201d Now, when people meet their obligations to us we\u2019re obliged. Gratitude replaces knee-jerk annoyance.</p> <p>The lockdown has made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-has-exposed-a-desperate-need-for-localism\">everything local</a>. The world has got much larger and we\u2019re rediscovering corner shops and neighbours, the wisdom of proximity and closeness. The great Italian communalist Lanza del Vasto once urged: \u201cFind the shortest, simplest way between the earth, the hands, and the mouth.\u201d That shortening of the supply chain has rehumanised us slightly. We\u2019re bartering with strangers on our street and sales of yeast and flour have increased exponentially as we rediscover the consolations of baking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve come to an emergency stop. We're not just separated from others but we can no longer separate from ourselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I have a high-powered lawyer friend who has described the joy of just darning socks and knitting. It sounds folksy, I know, but the kitchen table is the centre of our lives once more. We\u2019re rediscovering that frugality and resourcefulness are creative, if not always comfortable. Last week I was cutting the communal grass of our palazzo \u2013 the only place our kids can play outside \u2013 with a borrowed billhook, which is a bit like cutting hair with a fork.</p> <p>That centring has been mental as well as physical. It\u2019s a truism of modern life that we struggle to be settled or present. Because we can be anywhere, we actually end up being nowhere. We suffer, as the sociologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jan/15/zygmunt-bauman-obituary\">Zygmunt Bauman</a> once wrote, an<strong> \u201c</strong>electronically assured out-of-placeness\u201d. We\u2019re notoriously fidgety and lacking attention. We just keep clicking and tapping. When I was running our community, one of the hardest things for those in early recovery was just to sit still. We used to have Quaker-like silences twice a day, and to begin with, many just couldn\u2019t cope with the sudden stillness.</p> <p>It seems to me as if we\u2019re all in a similar situation right now. We\u2019ve come to an emergency stop, and it\u2019s painful not just because we\u2019re separated from others, but because we can no longer separate from ourselves. Until now we\u2019ve kept frenetically busy to keep from reflection, but now that we\u2019re still, demons, voices and shame can quickly surface. I know friends who are suffering panic attacks, even something close to psychosis. Many are alone and far from the solace of any fellowship.</p> <p>The poet and psychologist Hala Alyan wrote a <a href=\"https://emergencemagazine.org/story/this-is-not-a-rehearsal/\">beautiful essay</a> in <em>Emergence</em> magazine last week, in which she suggested that this pandemic is \u201cserving as a flashlight \u2013 illuminating people\u2019s unsteadiest, half-finished parts. It\u2019s showing us where our work remains. People talk about their ex-boyfriends, their long-resolved eating disorders, their childhood secrets\u2026\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c69c7fb4a2bde0187e3684175851e605ab3e8a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c69c7fb4a2bde0187e3684175851e605ab3e8a7/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A daughter paints her father's toenails while her mother looks out of a balcony\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Schoolteacher Marzio Toniolo, 35, has been documenting life under lockdown in San Fiorano since February. Here, his daughter paints his toenails to amuse herself.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marzio Toniolo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My optimism about this time of collective retreat isn\u2019t a denial of such anxieties or lonelinesses, but the opposite. The Dutch theologian Henri Nouwen once described <a href=\"wounds%20and%20pains%20become%20openings%20or%20occasions%20for%20a%20new%20vision\">a healing community</a> as a place not where \u201cwounds are cured and pains are alleviated\u201d, but where \u201cwounds and pains become openings or occasions for a new vision\u201d. I don\u2019t delight in the pain, but I am glad we\u2019re being honest about it.</p> <p>It may be that this medical emergency will offer the space and time for us to focus, for once, on our interior worlds. Because any speculation about the future is redundant unless there is spiritual, as well as medical, healing. Johnny Sertin, founder of a soul-centred consultancy called Becoming, said last week: \u201cWe need another way, another world, but it\u2019s impossible if we cannot do that from a place of being at home with who we are.\u201d</p> <p>As we\u2019re all pondering self-preservation, it\u2019s inevitable that we\u2019re wondering what has been eating us up all this time. Many of the friends I\u2019ve talked to in recent weeks have expressed relief that there\u2019s an enforced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/social-distancing-tips-the-rules-of-safe-shopping-under-coronavirus\">detox from shopping</a>. Many seem to have realised the true nature of consumerism, which is that we\u2019re not only consumers but also being consumed by it. Choice is so limitless that we never make up our minds. All the energy, movement and money to buy stuff and experiences leaves us feeling empty and remorseful. I personally know that every time we drive to the out-of-town shopping mall, built (allegedly) on the proceeds of organised crime, with speakers in the car park blasting the very worst pop music, to buy cheap clobber for the kids \u2013 it rips my spirit.</p> <p>As long ago as 1955, Victor Lebow suggested that we seek \u201c<a href=\"https://sustainablesociety.com/social/consumerism#.XoxVEFNKi9Y\">spiritual satisfaction</a>\u201d in consumption. Acquisition pretends to fill an existential void but only deepens it. We\u2019re constantly engaging in a psychic gorging and purging that leaves us weak and guilty. It\u2019s only during this slow-down that I realise how similar we are to Leonia, the imaginary society described by Italo Calvino in <em>Invisible Cities</em>: \u201cexpelling, discarding, cleansing a recurrent impurity. Street cleaners are welcomed like angels\u201d.</p> <p>It feels as if this crisis is allowing us to glimpse the back office of society, not just those street cleaners, but also the detritus we\u2019re sprinkling every day online. Perhaps it\u2019s because notions of <a href=\"expelling,%20discarding,%20cleansing%20a%20recurrent%20impurity.%20Street%20cleaners%20are%20welcomed%20like%20angels\">personal protection</a> are now at the forefront of our minds, or because talk of biometric monitoring and state surveillance are now being explicitly discussed\u2026 but I feel as if we\u2019ve finally awoken to the truth about the information age: that it\u2019s we who are being informed upon. In an attempt to understand this pandemic, many of us are fixated with statistics, graphs and clusters. But we\u2019re also constantly giving ourselves away. That jittery clicking comes at a cost. As that old adage goes: \u201cWhen something online is free, you\u2019re not the customer, you\u2019re the product.\u201d</p> <p>It seems even more important now, because almost the last distraction now left to us is the internet. All our social rituals \u2013 in pubs, clubs, schools, religious gatherings \u2013 are currently mediated by screens. There\u2019s still idealism in our digital connections, as evidenced by the open-source community\u2019s collaboration on the design or production of medical equipment. But our online habits are being constantly monetised. Writing about surveillance capitalism last week, Simona Guerra, an associate professor of politics at the University of Leicester, said that, just like manual labour of old, \u201chuman activities themselves are sold and bought\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f41c164bd787f13616a56806c69e38df49fa9431\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f41c164bd787f13616a56806c69e38df49fa9431/0_27_3189_1913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The deserted Gallery Vittorio Emanuele II, Milan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The deserted Gallery Vittorio Emanuele II, Milan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicola Marfisi/AGF/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because of this crisis we\u2019ve also begun to question the greatest absolutism of the last half-century: the supremacy of the market. It\u2019s become clear, as <a href=\"human%20activities%20themselves%20are%20sold%20and%20bought\">Rowan Williams</a> said to me, that \u201cthe so-called \u2018market state\u2019 is lethally ill-equipped to cope with large-scale collective crisis\u201d. The minimum wages of essential workers, the failure of supply and demand for medical equipment and the sheer cruelty of comments suggesting that the vulnerable could be sacrificed to keep the economy going \u2013 all have revealed the pickpocketing of the market\u2019s \u201chidden hand\u201d and the steepness of its \u201clevel playing field\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s as if the sacred \u201cmarket\u201d has, like a hated dictator, finally been toppled. Instead of our society having a market, we\u2019re realising that the market had our society. Jonathan Rowson, the philosopher and director of the Perspectiva research institute, wrote recently that \u201cthe state\u201d, instead of \u201csocialising and humanising the economy\u201d, had allowed \u201cmarkets to gradually economise and dehumanise society\u201d. Even the <em>Financial Times</em> has been advocating Keynesian, collectivist financial packages. We\u2019re rehabilitating those heretics who have long lamented neo-liberalism\u2019s corrosive effects. The great social theorist Steven Lukes is blunt: \u201cmarket fundamentalism\u201d, he told me, has created \u201cdevastation and unbridled inequalities\u201d.</p> <p>Globalisation has been a large part of the market\u2019s supremacy. The idealistic telling of globalisation was that it was an equitable trading free-for-all which could enrich the poor. The reality, though, has been incessant outsourcing so that our consumables remain as cheap as chips. We\u2019ve come to expect all produce, at all times, in all seasons. Globalisation has been a race to the bottom, which has created semi-slavery at the harsh end of very long supply chains. It has eradicated businesses and jobs close to home and shred local networks of trust and kinship. Like the globe-trotting money, we\u2019ve become frenetically mobile and rootless.</p> <p>But the most naked truth of this crisis is that we can no longer remain in denial about finitude, not just our own as we see mortality close up, but also our planet\u2019s. The Quaker economist Kenneth E Boulding once (allegedly) said: \u201cAnyone who believes in infinite growth on a finite planet is either mad or an economist.\u201d It\u2019s so obvious it\u2019s been ignored for decades. But if this Covid crisis is a dress rehearsal for the climate one, we have seen some of the costs and consequences. \u201cThe case for post-growth economics,\u201d Rowson says, \u201cjust became stronger. We need economies that make sense of 8 billion or so human beings living together in a planetary system as a whole, not the extraction of profit to achieve abstract aggregate targets like GDP.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s long been one of the truisms of modern life that we suffer mythic deprivation. We tell stories, but are never enveloped in one. There has been no belonging and thus no community, no heroes and no quests. Suddenly we have all the above. But it\u2019s not entirely like a film where the heroes would be the medics dying to save us (125 in Italyat the time of writing) and the quest would be the global race to find a vaccine. They\u2019re just a part of this story. Heroism for the rest of us is much subtler and quieter: it\u2019s about restraint and retreat, solitude and stillness. And our quest is perhaps even harder: to discern the common good and look for enlightenment in this darkness.</p> <p><em>Tobias Jones </em><em>is the author of A Place of Refuge</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Hannah Arendt once wrote that in times of deep crisis \u201cwe have a right to expect illumination\u201d. It seems callous to suggest that this tenebrous pandemic is letting the light in, and daft to offer immediate consolations amid so much grief. But there is a sense that, with the world having ground to a halt, our fantasies are finally taking flight. Much of what we have always been told was impossible is actually happening: the homeless are (in some places) being housed in hotels while prisoners are (in others) being released. Kids are told not to go to school and to forget exams. Massive government spending is ensuring that people are guaranteed an income even if they can\u2019t work. Private hospitals in Spain are being nationalised. A hospital has been built in London under a fortnight. In Portugal, tens of thousands of migrants and asylum seekers have been \u201cregularised\u201d and given full rights. It\u2019s not quite a revolution, but it\u2019s an epic conceptual awakening. I live in Parma, but despite the profound anguish here in Italy, it also feels, paradoxically, as if the world has come right in some way. With our despoiling suddenly stopped, wildlife is returning with innocent ebullience. Bottlenose dolphins have been playfully leaping in the waters around Venice. The canals are so crystalline that swans, and shoals of fish, have returned. Hares graze undisturbed in parks in Milan. Deer have been strolling the golf courses of Sardinia and paddling along sandy beaches. Mallards are bathing in Piazza di Spagna and birds have been nesting in the crooks of closed-up, disused wing-mirrors. In some ways it\u2019s like a blissed-out stoner\u2019s dream of what the world might be. The \u201cPianura Padana\u201d, the flat plain of the Po valley, usually has some of the worst air pollution in the world. The air is now perfumed by spring. You can see the mountains. Two weeks ago we were singing Rino Gaetano\u2019s The Sky Is Evermore Blue from our balconies. Realists have, rightly, tempered the utopian excitement and warned of a bleak future. Outbreaks of localised barbarism and criminality are predictable when people feel impoverished, paranoid and vulnerable. Already, in Italy, we\u2019ve had instances of toughs refusing to pay in supermarkets. Democratic politicians have had a taste of almost dictatorial power over the people, and it will be hard to roll back rule by emergency decrees. Countries like Hungary might be slipping away from the democratic fraternity. Public health will be an excuse to ramp up state surveillance and, when we need to jump-start the economy, environmental protections may well be ripped up. The counter-revolution, those seers say, is just around the corner. But despite all these fantasies, one of the consequences of the crisis is that we\u2019re suddenly more serious about the truth. \u201cAccurate scientific, economic, political and social information about what is happening somewhere,\u201d Bill Foster, a history lecturer at Homerton College, Cambridge, told me last week, \u201cis suddenly valuable everywhere. It\u2019s literally a matter of life and death. We might just be tempted now to remember what we lost when we started to abandon trying to find truths together.\u201d It\u2019s intriguing that it\u2019s taken this pandemic, rather than sensitive referendums and elections, to persuade social media companies of the need to combat fake news and conspiracy theories. Without truth there is no trust, and the gates of civilisation are wide open to political blackguards and devious disinformation. Those gates have been open for decades, and it\u2019s one of the hard-to-swallow lessons of this contagion that gate-keeping is paramount, that we need boundaries and membranes. Having managed a therapeutic community for almost a decade, I\u2019ve always known that blocking, or expelling, damaging elements was vital to communal wellbeing (you can\u2019t, for example, have drug use in a rehab). I knew that monastic wisdom depended on enclosure. But I still instinctively baulked at any impediment to free movement on a global level. We internationalists inevitably struggle to accept the idea. And yet the very first principle of a functioning group (as enunciated by Nobel prize-winning political economist, Elinor Ostrom) is \u201ceffective exclusion of external, unentitled parties\u201d. The penny has also dropped that wellbeing isn\u2019t individual but social. We are not actually independent at all, but dependent. We can make each other sick and we can try to make each other well. We\u2019ve understood that a healthy community (as Wendell Berry wrote in his essay Health Is Membership) isn\u2019t merely human, but also \u201cits soil, its water, its air\u201d. It has been fascinating to see the speed at which other attitudes have changed. The indignation expressed towards people not respecting social distancing (from those who would never normally describe themselves as moralists) has been understandably shrill: here too we\u2019ve suddenly realised that the wellbeing of the group is endangered by indifferent individuals, and that community \u2013 for which we\u2019ve yearned for so long \u2013 means originally simply a pooling of duties. In The Need for Roots, her manifesto for how to refound society after the second world war, the philosopher and activist Simone Weil wrote that \u201cthe notion of obligations comes before that of rights\u201d. It\u2019s a complicated, but convincing case, and it seems to me that in the last month there has been a radical shift in the balance between rights and responsibilities that has changed the timbre of our lives. I\u2019ve never seen so many news items about applause, or so many social media posts accompanied by clappy emojis. Before, \u201cin the absence of adversity\u201d, the psychiatrist and philosopher Iain McGilchrist said this month: \u201cWe grew flabby, selfish. We manufactured grievances that now can be seen for what they were.\u201d Now, when people meet their obligations to us we\u2019re obliged. Gratitude replaces knee-jerk annoyance. The lockdown has made everything local. The world has got much larger and we\u2019re rediscovering corner shops and neighbours, the wisdom of proximity and closeness. The great Italian communalist Lanza del Vasto once urged: \u201cFind the shortest, simplest way between the earth, the hands, and the mouth.\u201d That shortening of the supply chain has rehumanised us slightly. We\u2019re bartering with strangers on our street and sales of yeast and flour have increased exponentially as we rediscover the consolations of baking. I have a high-powered lawyer friend who has described the joy of just darning socks and knitting. It sounds folksy, I know, but the kitchen table is the centre of our lives once more. We\u2019re rediscovering that frugality and resourcefulness are creative, if not always comfortable. Last week I was cutting the communal grass of our palazzo \u2013 the only place our kids can play outside \u2013 with a borrowed billhook, which is a bit like cutting hair with a fork. That centring has been mental as well as physical. It\u2019s a truism of modern life that we struggle to be settled or present. Because we can be anywhere, we actually end up being nowhere. We suffer, as the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman once wrote, an \u201celectronically assured out-of-placeness\u201d. We\u2019re notoriously fidgety and lacking attention. We just keep clicking and tapping. When I was running our community, one of the hardest things for those in early recovery was just to sit still. We used to have Quaker-like silences twice a day, and to begin with, many just couldn\u2019t cope with the sudden stillness. It seems to me as if we\u2019re all in a similar situation right now. We\u2019ve come to an emergency stop, and it\u2019s painful not just because we\u2019re separated from others, but because we can no longer separate from ourselves. Until now we\u2019ve kept frenetically busy to keep from reflection, but now that we\u2019re still, demons, voices and shame can quickly surface. I know friends who are suffering panic attacks, even something close to psychosis. Many are alone and far from the solace of any fellowship. The poet and psychologist Hala Alyan wrote a beautiful essay in Emergence magazine last week, in which she suggested that this pandemic is \u201cserving as a flashlight \u2013 illuminating people\u2019s unsteadiest, half-finished parts. It\u2019s showing us where our work remains. People talk about their ex-boyfriends, their long-resolved eating disorders, their childhood secrets\u2026\u201d My optimism about this time of collective retreat isn\u2019t a denial of such anxieties or lonelinesses, but the opposite. The Dutch theologian Henri Nouwen once described a healing community as a place not where \u201cwounds are cured and pains are alleviated\u201d, but where \u201cwounds and pains become openings or occasions for a new vision\u201d. I don\u2019t delight in the pain, but I am glad we\u2019re being honest about it. It may be that this medical emergency will offer the space and time for us to focus, for once, on our interior worlds. Because any speculation about the future is redundant unless there is spiritual, as well as medical, healing. Johnny Sertin, founder of a soul-centred consultancy called Becoming, said last week: \u201cWe need another way, another world, but it\u2019s impossible if we cannot do that from a place of being at home with who we are.\u201d As we\u2019re all pondering self-preservation, it\u2019s inevitable that we\u2019re wondering what has been eating us up all this time. Many of the friends I\u2019ve talked to in recent weeks have expressed relief that there\u2019s an enforced detox from shopping. Many seem to have realised the true nature of consumerism, which is that we\u2019re not only consumers but also being consumed by it. Choice is so limitless that we never make up our minds. All the energy, movement and money to buy stuff and experiences leaves us feeling empty and remorseful. I personally know that every time we drive to the out-of-town shopping mall, built (allegedly) on the proceeds of organised crime, with speakers in the car park blasting the very worst pop music, to buy cheap clobber for the kids \u2013 it rips my spirit. As long ago as 1955, Victor Lebow suggested that we seek \u201cspiritual satisfaction\u201d in consumption. Acquisition pretends to fill an existential void but only deepens it. We\u2019re constantly engaging in a psychic gorging and purging that leaves us weak and guilty. It\u2019s only during this slow-down that I realise how similar we are to Leonia, the imaginary society described by Italo Calvino in Invisible Cities: \u201cexpelling, discarding, cleansing a recurrent impurity. Street cleaners are welcomed like angels\u201d. It feels as if this crisis is allowing us to glimpse the back office of society, not just those street cleaners, but also the detritus we\u2019re sprinkling every day online. Perhaps it\u2019s because notions of personal protection are now at the forefront of our minds, or because talk of biometric monitoring and state surveillance are now being explicitly discussed\u2026 but I feel as if we\u2019ve finally awoken to the truth about the information age: that it\u2019s we who are being informed upon. In an attempt to understand this pandemic, many of us are fixated with statistics, graphs and clusters. But we\u2019re also constantly giving ourselves away. That jittery clicking comes at a cost. As that old adage goes: \u201cWhen something online is free, you\u2019re not the customer, you\u2019re the product.\u201d It seems even more important now, because almost the last distraction now left to us is the internet. All our social rituals \u2013 in pubs, clubs, schools, religious gatherings \u2013 are currently mediated by screens. There\u2019s still idealism in our digital connections, as evidenced by the open-source community\u2019s collaboration on the design or production of medical equipment. But our online habits are being constantly monetised. Writing about surveillance capitalism last week, Simona Guerra, an associate professor of politics at the University of Leicester, said that, just like manual labour of old, \u201chuman activities themselves are sold and bought\u201d. Because of this crisis we\u2019ve also begun to question the greatest absolutism of the last half-century: the supremacy of the market. It\u2019s become clear, as Rowan Williams said to me, that \u201cthe so-called \u2018market state\u2019 is lethally ill-equipped to cope with large-scale collective crisis\u201d. The minimum wages of essential workers, the failure of supply and demand for medical equipment and the sheer cruelty of comments suggesting that the vulnerable could be sacrificed to keep the economy going \u2013 all have revealed the pickpocketing of the market\u2019s \u201chidden hand\u201d and the steepness of its \u201clevel playing field\u201d. It\u2019s as if the sacred \u201cmarket\u201d has, like a hated dictator, finally been toppled. Instead of our society having a market, we\u2019re realising that the market had our society. Jonathan Rowson, the philosopher and director of the Perspectiva research institute, wrote recently that \u201cthe state\u201d, instead of \u201csocialising and humanising the economy\u201d, had allowed \u201cmarkets to gradually economise and dehumanise society\u201d.

Globalisation has been a large part of the market\u2019s supremacy. The idealistic telling of globalisation was that it was an equitable trading free-for-all which could enrich the poor. The reality, though, has been incessant outsourcing so that our consumables remain as cheap as chips. We\u2019ve come to expect all produce, at all times, in all seasons. Globalisation has been a race to the bottom, which has created semi-slavery at the harsh end of very long supply chains. It has eradicated businesses and jobs close to home and shred local networks of trust and kinship. Like the globe-trotting money, we\u2019ve become frenetically mobile and rootless.

Not counting the pre-filmed shorts which have become more prevalent over the years, this is about as far removed from the show\u2019s modus operandi as possible. If nothing else, Saturday Night Live At Home should be a memorable episode.</p> <p>After a title sequence in which the cast and bandmembers are shown in their individual homes, we are greeted by the night\u2019s \u201chost\u201d, Tom Hanks. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/23/tom-hanks-feeling-better-after-covid-19-diagnosis\">Fresh off his own Covid-19 infection</a>, \u201cAmerica\u2019s dad\u201d admits it feels both good and weird to be hosting from home, although he tries to make it as normal as possible by wearing a suit for the first time in months, using cue cards \u2013 including one that reads: \u201cI am even using cue cards, see?\u201d \u2013 and fielding question from the audience, which is just him doing broad foreign accents.</p> <p>It\u2019s all very silly and endearing, although the closing moments of his monologue, in which he sounds an optimistic note while recognizing the efforts of healthcare and service industry workers, carries more moral weight than any statement by our actual leaders.</p> <p>For the first sketch, Pete Davidson puts the \u201cstudio\u201d in studio apartment by performing Drake Song, in which he sings \u201cI miss my ex, this is a Drake song, number one on the billboard\u201d while moving around his home. It\u2019s followed by RBG Workout, which sees Kate McKinnon doing her standard mugging as the supreme court justice, sans wig and make-up.

      "bodyText": "When strict social distancing efforts were put in place to combat the coronavirus, it looked as though Saturday Night Live\u2019s 45th season had come to an abrupt end. To the surprise of everyone, the show announced a new episode of remotely filmed sketches. Not counting the pre-filmed shorts which have become more prevalent over the years, this is about as far removed from the show\u2019s modus operandi as possible. If nothing else, Saturday Night Live At Home should be a memorable episode. After a title sequence in which the cast and bandmembers are shown in their individual homes, we are greeted by the night\u2019s \u201chost\u201d, Tom Hanks. Fresh off his own Covid-19 infection, \u201cAmerica\u2019s dad\u201d admits it feels both good and weird to be hosting from home, although he tries to make it as normal as possible by wearing a suit for the first time in months, using cue cards \u2013 including one that reads: \u201cI am even using cue cards, see?\u201d \u2013 and fielding question from the audience, which is just him doing broad foreign accents. It\u2019s all very silly and endearing, although the closing moments of his monologue, in which he sounds an optimistic note while recognizing the efforts of healthcare and service industry workers, carries more moral weight than any statement by our actual leaders. For the first sketch, Pete Davidson puts the \u201cstudio\u201d in studio apartment by performing Drake Song, in which he sings \u201cI miss my ex, this is a Drake song, number one on the billboard\u201d while moving around his home. It\u2019s followed by RBG Workout, which sees Kate McKinnon doing her standard mugging as the supreme court justice, sans wig and make-up. The jokes volley between sight gags about physical frailty (her home workout equipment includes tea bags, Q-tips and pencils) and bad puns directed at conservatives: \u201cSocial distancing is important \u2013 take it from me, I\u2019ve been social distancing from Justice Alito since \u201903\u201d. While Saturday\u2019s episode definitely deserves to be cut some slack, these first two sketches are so terrible they threaten to destroy any goodwill earned. Luckily, things rebound. In Zoom Meeting, office receptionists Henriette and Nan (Aidy Bryant and McKinnon), flail spectacularly during a video conference. Utterly incapable of telecommuting, the pair break down, crying about how they \u201cbroke Zoom\u201d before airing terrible quarantine confessions, such as \u201cI\u2019ve never used soap before\u201d, \u201cI used my license as toilet paper and now I don\u2019t know my own birthday\u201d and \u201cI tried to clean my ass in the middle of the night with a hose in the driveway and I went viral!\u201d \u201cAlways a bridesmaid, never the Democratic nominee,\u201d Bernie Sanders (Larry David) calls in to answer supporter questions, such as \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d, \u201cWhat to do about the coronavirus?\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d He answers: \u201cI finally have time to relax and finish that heart attack from October.\u201d It\u2019s just David being David, and it does slightly ease the pain of Curb Your Enthusiasm being off the air.

      "body": "<p>UK government stockpiles containing protective equipment for healthcare workers in the event of a pandemic fell in value by almost 40% over the past six years, the Guardian has found.</p> <p>Analysis of official financial data suggests \u00a3325m was wiped off the value of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) emergency stockpile, reducing it from \u00a3831m in 2013 under the Conservative-led coalition government to \u00a3506m by March last year.</p> <p>The finding is likely to raise further questions for the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who faced criticism over the weekend after urging healthcare workers not to \u201coveruse\u201d personal protective equipment (PPE).</p> <p>The revelation raises questions about why the value depreciated so quickly and how the fall related to stock-levels.</p> <p>According to official figures at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/11/matt-hancock-reveals-deaths-of-19-nhs-workers-amid-ppe-row\">19 UK healthcare workers</a> had died after contracting coronavirus. Frontline medical staff have complained of PPE shortages, which they say are putting lives at risk.</p> <p>Last week, it emerged that three nurses who had been wearing bin bags due to a lack of PPE had <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/08/exclusive-three-nurses-forced-wear-bin-bags-ppe-shortage-test/\">tested positive for coronavirus</a>. It was also confirmed that a consultant at a hospital in east London <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/consultant-who-pleaded-for-more-nhs-hospital-ppe-dies-of-coronavirus\">died from the virus</a> weeks after making a plea to the prime minister for more PPE for NHS staff.</p> <p>Hospitals have turned to schools for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/25/schools-asked-donate-science-goggles-nhs-use-face-shields\">donations of science goggles</a> amid shortages of eye protection, while some NHS staff have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/01/nhs-staff-making-masks-from-snorkels-amid-ppe-shortages\">made improvised masks</a> out of snorkels and bought kit from hardware stores.</p> <p>The widespread shortages of equipment, which Hancock has blamed on problems with the distribution system, has raised questions about the UK\u2019s levels of preparedness for a pandemic of this kind.</p> <p>Accounts suggest funding for \u201cstockpiled goods\u201d that are \u201cheld for use in national emergencies\u201d was increased between 2008 and 2011, when pandemic preparedness was identified as a national priority for the NHS. But since 2013 the value of the stockpile has fallen.</p> <p>The findings are likely to renew questions about whether government stockpiles held sufficient quantities of personal protective equipment (PPE) before the Covid-19 pandemic and whether emergency preparations were affected by almost a decade of cuts and reduced public investment.</p> <p>On Sunday, it was revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/one-in-three-uk-surgeons-lacks-enough-protective-kit-survey-finds\">one in three UK surgeons</a> say they do not have access to enough masks, gowns and other clothing to keep them safe.</p> <p>Contacted by the Guardian, DHSC declined to provide a breakdown of its emergency stockpile\u2019s contents, which will also include medicines such as antivirals and flu vaccines. However, NHS plans drawn up in 2017 state that \u201cthe bulk of\u201d the pandemic stockpiles available to the health service consisted of PPE, including FFP3 respirator masks, gloves and aprons.</p> <p>The stockpiled goods have shelf lives and so require frequent replenishment. According to the DHSC\u2019s financial accounts, between 2011 and 2019 depletions of the emergency stockpile significantly outstripped the amount spent on adding new supplies to the reserves.</p> <p>A spokesman for DHSC said the value of the emergency stockpile \u201cdoes not relate to the volume of its contents\u201d, adding that \u201cthrough responsible procurement\u201d officials had been \u201csuccessful in maintaining its stock\u201d.</p> <p>The department refused to answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about the volume of the stockpile in 2019 compared with 2011.</p> <p>The spokesman said the UK was \u201cone of the most prepared countries in the world for pandemics\u201d and the government \u201ccontinues to work around the clock to give the NHS and the wider social care sector the equipment and support they need\u201d.</p> <p>The reduction in the stockpile\u2019s value occurred at a time the government considered that a pandemic represented the most serious emergency threat likely to face the UK. The government has in recent years been concerned about the rapid worldwide spread of a novel virus to which people have no immunity.</p> <p>Since 2007, a series of studies and exercises to prepare the UK for an event of this kind identified the availability of PPE for health and social care workers as a cornerstone to a national response, essential to reducing transmission of a new virus.</p> <p>Dr Lindsey Davies, a former national director of pandemic influenza preparedness, told the Guardian that PPE shortages were modelled as far back as 2007, during a large cross-government pandemic simulation codenamed Exercise Winter Willow. \u201cIt was a live issue at the time,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Davies explained that following the 2007 exercise \u201cthere was an increased momentum after that to develop a business case for stockpiling, and a lot of discussion about the right amounts and how far it was right to have a nationally funded stockpile\u201d.</p> <p>In the wake of the Winter Willow exercise, and with the emergence of the swine flu pandemic two years later, the Department of Health, as it was then known, embarked on a procurement programme aimed at boosting stockpiles of medicines and PPE, according to departmental accounts and performance reports. By the end of the 2010-11 financial year, the value of the department\u2019s stockpile stood at \u00a3830m, an 80% increase from 2008-09.</p> <p>In 2016, after years of delays, the government staged another nationwide pandemic drill, codenamed Exercise Cygnus.

      "bodyText": "UK government stockpiles containing protective equipment for healthcare workers in the event of a pandemic fell in value by almost 40% over the past six years, the Guardian has found. Analysis of official financial data suggests \u00a3325m was wiped off the value of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) emergency stockpile, reducing it from \u00a3831m in 2013 under the Conservative-led coalition government to \u00a3506m by March last year. The finding is likely to raise further questions for the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who faced criticism over the weekend after urging healthcare workers not to \u201coveruse\u201d personal protective equipment (PPE). The revelation raises questions about why the value depreciated so quickly and how the fall related to stock-levels. According to official figures at least 19 UK healthcare workers had died after contracting coronavirus. Frontline medical staff have complained of PPE shortages, which they say are putting lives at risk. Last week, it emerged that three nurses who had been wearing bin bags due to a lack of PPE had tested positive for coronavirus. It was also confirmed that a consultant at a hospital in east London died from the virus weeks after making a plea to the prime minister for more PPE for NHS staff. Hospitals have turned to schools for donations of science goggles amid shortages of eye protection, while some NHS staff have made improvised masks out of snorkels and bought kit from hardware stores. The widespread shortages of equipment, which Hancock has blamed on problems with the distribution system, has raised questions about the UK\u2019s levels of preparedness for a pandemic of this kind. Accounts suggest funding for \u201cstockpiled goods\u201d that are \u201cheld for use in national emergencies\u201d was increased between 2008 and 2011, when pandemic preparedness was identified as a national priority for the NHS. But since 2013 the value of the stockpile has fallen. The findings are likely to renew questions about whether government stockpiles held sufficient quantities of personal protective equipment (PPE) before the Covid-19 pandemic and whether emergency preparations were affected by almost a decade of cuts and reduced public investment. On Sunday, it was revealed that one in three UK surgeons say they do not have access to enough masks, gowns and other clothing to keep them safe. Contacted by the Guardian, DHSC declined to provide a breakdown of its emergency stockpile\u2019s contents, which will also include medicines such as antivirals and flu vaccines. However, NHS plans drawn up in 2017 state that \u201cthe bulk of\u201d the pandemic stockpiles available to the health service consisted of PPE, including FFP3 respirator masks, gloves and aprons. The stockpiled goods have shelf lives and so require frequent replenishment. According to the DHSC\u2019s financial accounts, between 2011 and 2019 depletions of the emergency stockpile significantly outstripped the amount spent on adding new supplies to the reserves. A spokesman for DHSC said the value of the emergency stockpile \u201cdoes not relate to the volume of its contents\u201d, adding that \u201cthrough responsible procurement\u201d officials had been \u201csuccessful in maintaining its stock\u201d. The department refused to answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about the volume of the stockpile in 2019 compared with 2011. The spokesman said the UK was \u201cone of the most prepared countries in the world for pandemics\u201d and the government \u201ccontinues to work around the clock to give the NHS and the wider social care sector the equipment and support they need\u201d. The reduction in the stockpile\u2019s value occurred at a time the government considered that a pandemic represented the most serious emergency threat likely to face the UK. The government has in recent years been concerned about the rapid worldwide spread of a novel virus to which people have no immunity. Since 2007, a series of studies and exercises to prepare the UK for an event of this kind identified the availability of PPE for health and social care workers as a cornerstone to a national response, essential to reducing transmission of a new virus. Dr Lindsey Davies, a former national director of pandemic influenza preparedness, told the Guardian that PPE shortages were modelled as far back as 2007, during a large cross-government pandemic simulation codenamed Exercise Winter Willow. \u201cIt was a live issue at the time,\u201d she said. Davies explained that following the 2007 exercise \u201cthere was an increased momentum after that to develop a business case for stockpiling, and a lot of discussion about the right amounts and how far it was right to have a nationally funded stockpile\u201d. In the wake of the Winter Willow exercise, and with the emergence of the swine flu pandemic two years later, the Department of Health, as it was then known, embarked on a procurement programme aimed at boosting stockpiles of medicines and PPE, according to departmental accounts and performance reports. By the end of the 2010-11 financial year, the value of the department\u2019s stockpile stood at \u00a3830m, an 80% increase from 2008-09. In 2016, after years of delays, the government staged another nationwide pandemic drill, codenamed Exercise Cygnus. The exercise, which simulated a deadly outbreak of so-called \u201cswan flu\u201d, is believed to have shown that in the event of a deadly pandemic the NHS would be overwhelmed by a shortage of critical care beds and vital equipment. The government is refusing to release the official conclusions from Exercise Cygnus, which have never been made public, but there are indications in reports by local authorities who participated in the exercise that PPE supplies were an area of concern. It is not clear whether at a national level the conclusions included recommendations about emergency stockpile funding. But DHSC accounts show that in the three years after the 2016 drill, the value of the stockpile fell by more than \u00a3200m. Sir Ian Boyd, the chief scientific adviser to Defra between 2012 and 2019 , told the Guardian it was difficult to get ministers to spend money on preparing for high-impact, low-frequency events like pandemics. \u201cGovernments over the years have buried their heads, and it is harder to have those conversations with people who have a small-government view of the world,\u201d he said. This year, as the government began to consider the threat posed by the novel coronavirus outbreak in China to the UK, PPE soon found its way on to the agenda of meetings between officials and high-level scientific and clinical advisers. Minutes of meetings suggest that as early as January the government was involved in discussions with advisers about when emergency PPE stockpiles would need to be released. During a meeting on 28 January of the government\u2019s new and emerging respiratory virus threats group (Nervtag), attended by senior officials including England\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, it was noted that if sustained community transmission of the novel virus in the UK was established, the numbers of infected patients in hospitals would rise. \u201cThis would entail deployment and use of the UK\u2019s pandemic influenza PPE stockpiles,\u201d a minute of the meeting states. According to minutes from early February, Nervtag went on to make a series of recommendations to the government\u2019s emergency committee Cobra about what PPE would be required for different settings and different groups of workers. A month later, in early March, advisers discussed a potential scenario where stocks of respirator masks ran out. Additional reporting by Rob Evans",

In another Easter missive, addressed to \u201cbrothers and sisters of the popular movements and organisations\u201d grouped in the World Meeting of Popular Movements, which run soup kitchens and provide medical guidance and other vital social services in the multitudinous slums of South America, Francis also came out in favour of a universal basic income. \u201cYou informal workers, independent workers, or workers of the popular economy, do not have a stable salary to resist this moment and the quarantines are unbearable for you,\u201d he said in his missive. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s time to think of a universal wage that recognises and dignifies the noble and irreplaceable tasks you perform.\u201d He also addressed the plight of people in slums who find it difficult to self-isolate. \u201cHow difficult it is to stay at home for those who live in small precarious houses or who directly have no roof.\u201d At the Vatican, as Francis asked that society\u2019s most vulnerable \u2013 \u201cthose living on the peripheries, refugees and the homeless\u201d \u2013 not be abandoned, Avvenire, the official newspaper of the Italian bishops\u2019 conference, reported that 105 priests have so far died of coronavirus after becoming infected while tending to the sick. At least 24 nuns are also known to have died, 13 of whom were in Bergamo, the Italian province worst-hit by the virus. Six nuns died following an outbreak of the virus at their convent in Tortona, Piedmont, in March, and five others died in Sanremo, Liguria, in early April. During his mass on Holy Thursday, Pope Francis said that priests, living and dead, along with doctors and nurses, represented \u201cthe saints next door\u201d during the coronavirus emergency.",

But the government of President Mario Abdo Ben\u00edtez has been heavily criticised for failing to support people left without income during the total quarantine \u2013 which is now coming to the end of the third week and is set to continue until 19 April. Sixty-five per cent of Paraguay\u2019s workers earn their living in the informal economy and have no access to benefits during the coronavirus crisis.

      "body": "<p>Cast your mind back four weeks. Coronavirus deaths in the UK were in the tens, and the disease was ravaging Italy. The daily death tolls from Italy and then Spain were reported every 24 hours and the numbers were staggering, unfathomable and rising. Italy was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/14/italians-80-will-left-die-country-overwhelmed-coronavirus/\">overwhelmed</a>\u201d, succumbing to a tragic scenario because of quarantine enforcement failures, and an inability to predict how quickly the disease would be transmitted. The highest daily death toll recorded in Italy was on 28 March, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/uks-coronavirus-death-toll-how-accurate-is-it-and-how-does-it-compare\">971 deaths</a>. Spain\u2019s highest came five days later with 950. On Friday, the death toll in UK hospitals was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/coronavirus-uk-deadliest-day-deaths-announced\">980</a>.</p> <p>The UK is now surpassing the apocalyptic tolls we fixated on just two weeks ago. The same tragedies are unfolding across our country. Doctors and nurses are dying, exposed to heavy viral loads and often without adequate protective equipment. Covid-19 wards are saturated, echoing the calls of distress from Italian medical staff, as the specific shifts of doctors and nurses disappear and blend into one long coronavirus rota. But the sense of distress with which the Italian scenario was reported and received in the UK is strangely absent. Missing too is the urgent need to understand why this is happening.</p> <p>Not only did the UK have the experience of Italy play out before the virus hit its own shores, illustrating clearly the measures that needed to be taken, it had explicit warnings from Italians spelling out the pitfalls to be avoided. Voices called out to the UK and foretold the mistakes that would cost lives. On 27 March, the Italian author Francesca Melandri <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/a-letter-to-the-uk-from-italy-this-is-what-we-know-about-your-future\">wrote a letter to the UK</a> from \u201cour future\u201d: \u201cWe watch you as you behave just as we did. You hold the same arguments we did until a short time ago, between those who still say, \u2018It\u2019s only a flu, why all the fuss?\u2019 and those who have already understood.\u201d</p> <p>It is a jarring experience to wake up to a British death toll that is almost a thousand a day, and not see that number on every front page, being put to every politician in every single interview, with a demand for an explanation.

      "bodyText": "Cast your mind back four weeks. Coronavirus deaths in the UK were in the tens, and the disease was ravaging Italy. The daily death tolls from Italy and then Spain were reported every 24 hours and the numbers were staggering, unfathomable and rising. Italy was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d, succumbing to a tragic scenario because of quarantine enforcement failures, and an inability to predict how quickly the disease would be transmitted. The highest daily death toll recorded in Italy was on 28 March, with 971 deaths. Spain\u2019s highest came five days later with 950. On Friday, the death toll in UK hospitals was 980. The UK is now surpassing the apocalyptic tolls we fixated on just two weeks ago. The same tragedies are unfolding across our country. Doctors and nurses are dying, exposed to heavy viral loads and often without adequate protective equipment. Covid-19 wards are saturated, echoing the calls of distress from Italian medical staff, as the specific shifts of doctors and nurses disappear and blend into one long coronavirus rota. But the sense of distress with which the Italian scenario was reported and received in the UK is strangely absent. Missing too is the urgent need to understand why this is happening. Not only did the UK have the experience of Italy play out before the virus hit its own shores, illustrating clearly the measures that needed to be taken, it had explicit warnings from Italians spelling out the pitfalls to be avoided. Voices called out to the UK and foretold the mistakes that would cost lives. On 27 March, the Italian author Francesca Melandri wrote a letter to the UK from \u201cour future\u201d: \u201cWe watch you as you behave just as we did. You hold the same arguments we did until a short time ago, between those who still say, \u2018It\u2019s only a flu, why all the fuss?\u2019 and those who have already understood.\u201d It is a jarring experience to wake up to a British death toll that is almost a thousand a day, and not see that number on every front page, being put to every politician in every single interview, with a demand for an explanation. It is as if those who should be asking these questions, from the media to opposition politicians, have been subjected to a mass memory-erasing exercise. Every report showing the scale of the crisis should be framed in the language of accountability and anchored in the premise of preventability. With all the benefits of hindsight, the government dragged its feet, wasted precious time and infused the issue with a sense of British exceptionalism: drastic measures need not be taken because in the UK things will somehow be different. If there was any chance of that interrogation happening, it was made even less likely by Boris Johnson\u2019s illness. The nation\u2019s tragedy became secondary to his infection. It is understandable that the hospitalisation of a nation\u2019s premier \u2013 a unique and destabilising event \u2013 should concern the media and government. But Johnson\u2019s illness was folded into a larger, editorialised narrative about his martyrdom and indefatigability, turning his sickness and recovery into a virtue of character. And as that hagiography was being enthusiastically written in large parts of the press, the stories of the thousands of dead and grieving were buried under daily updates of the prime minister\u2019s \u201chigh spirits\u201d from his ICU bed. Questions over his responsibility for the national carnage \u2013 his complacent messaging over shaking hands with the afflicted, his delay in shutting down the country, his \u201cherd immunity\u201d policy, the ongoing lack of testing, of equipment and of ventilators \u2013 were not asked. The organisers of Cheltenham festival, which attracted more than 250,000 people from 10 to 13 March, justified going ahead by citing the presence of Johnson at an international rugby match a few days before.

The death toll became not a daily count of individual devastation, but a cold sterile ticker of battle casualties. The Queen\u2019s message, a call for noble resolve, further generalised the crisis into an act of God that we must weather by mobilising the powers of the British national character.

Easter weekend would usually mark the start of the tourist season on Eigg, which has about 100 permanent residents, but visitors can no longer reach the island, with the ferry company that connects Eigg to the mainland only carrying residents.

Coronavirus is destroying newsprint newspapers across Britain, delivering the coup de grace to businesses that were already in the process of dying.</p> <p>Local and regional newspaper publishers have found it economically unsustainable to go on producing papers. In response, they have suspended the publication of scores of titles and placed hundreds of journalists on paid leave. \u201cFurloughs\u201d have become part of the new pandemic lexicon.</p> <p>At national level, print runs have been drastically reduced because of distribution problems, most obviously resulting from the widespread closure of retail stores. Edition sizes have also been cut back due to the drop-off in advertisers. Similarly, many magazines are also forsaking print in favour of digital-only publication.</p> <p>Although formal announcements by publishers stress that their dramatic Covid-19 measures will be temporary, there is reason to believe some may be permanent. Newsprint, the transmission of news by ink on paper, might not recover from the contagion in what could eventually be seen as a transformational moment for the 380-year British newspaper history.</p> <p>There will not be a post-pandemic \u201cold media\u201d recovery because it seems inconceivable that publishers, already struggling to fund journalism, will return to the previous status quo. That\u2019s because the status quo was, itself, one of perpetual fragility in which publishers were engaged in the delicate task of managing newsprint decline while, in parallel, seeking to create a digital journalism business model.</p> <p>As is well known, their central problem has been the failure to find any viable alternative to advertising as newspapers\u2019 major source of revenue. Throughout the past 20 years, papers have defied forecasters who predicted that advertising income was on the verge of disappearing. Instead, it has lasted well enough to sustain newspapers, even though its decrease has necessitated severe cuts to editorial budgets and a consequent diminution in the quality and quantity of content.</p> <p>Advertising\u2019s surprising durability has been important because it enabled publishers to play circus performers \u2013 riding two horses at the same time to provide funds for both newsprint and digital platforms. But sensible newspaper owners, managers and editors have long realised that there would come a time when advertising would dry up, newsprint\u2019s ever-decreasing audience would vanish, and they would need to find a way to fund digital journalism without ad support.</p> <p>That there is a hunger for online news is undeniable. For the past month, every major publisher has been reporting record numbers of website visits. Page views each day have been off the chart. Dwell time, one of the key metrics to show the depth of reader engagement with individual articles, has increased, too. One result, according to some national publishers that impose charges for online access, has been <a href=\"https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/ft-and-reach-titles-hit-new-online-records-with-coronavirus-coverage/\">a rise in subscriptions</a>.</p> <p>To put this in an even more positive perspective for newspapers, the expansion of interest in their content has occurred despite record viewing figures for TV and radio news and current affairs broadcasts. This interest is obviously due to coronavirus being, as everyone emphasises on a daily basis, an unprecedented event.</p> <p>What is not emphasised, however, is the certainty that its aftermath will also be unprecedented. Economic activity will surely be slower to revive than optimists, such as government ministers, would like us to believe. Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/brexit-britain-economy-coronavirus-gdp-figures-economic-growth\">it wasn\u2019t in a healthy state prior to the shock of Covid-19</a>. </p> <p>By the time the lockdown ends \u2013 and that light appears to be a long way down the tunnel \u2013 many companies may not be in a state to recover. It is true that some could seek to revive their businesses through advertising; but financial constraints on potential consumers, because of depleted income during the emergency, will make the outcome of such initiatives uncertain.</p> <p>Post-lockdown, publishers will be reassessing the state of their businesses. Aside from the difficulties they face in winning back advertisers, they will need to make rational decisions about their bottom lines. Did the closure of this or that title really matter? How much money did we save by publishing fewer newsprint issues? Do we need expensive offices when our papers have been so effectively produced by journalists operating remotely?</p> <p>In mid-March, that wise historian, Peter Hennessy, conveyed the epoch-making significance of the pandemic during a BBC Radio 4 interview. Future historians, he said, will divide our age into BC and AC: \u201cBefore corona and after corona.\u201d</p> <p>I am convinced media analysts will make the same division. AC will likely mark the final stage in newsprint\u2019s long decline.</p> <p><br></p>",

Throughout the past 20 years, papers have defied forecasters who predicted that advertising income was on the verge of disappearing. Instead, it has lasted well enough to sustain newspapers, even though its decrease has necessitated severe cuts to editorial budgets and a consequent diminution in the quality and quantity of content. Advertising\u2019s surprising durability has been important because it enabled publishers to play circus performers \u2013 riding two horses at the same time to provide funds for both newsprint and digital platforms. But sensible newspaper owners, managers and editors have long realised that there would come a time when advertising would dry up, newsprint\u2019s ever-decreasing audience would vanish, and they would need to find a way to fund digital journalism without ad support. That there is a hunger for online news is undeniable. For the past month, every major publisher has been reporting record numbers of website visits. Page views each day have been off the chart. Dwell time, one of the key metrics to show the depth of reader engagement with individual articles, has increased, too. One result, according to some national publishers that impose charges for online access, has been a rise in subscriptions. To put this in an even more positive perspective for newspapers, the expansion of interest in their content has occurred despite record viewing figures for TV and radio news and current affairs broadcasts. This interest is obviously due to coronavirus being, as everyone emphasises on a daily basis, an unprecedented event. What is not emphasised, however, is the certainty that its aftermath will also be unprecedented. Economic activity will surely be slower to revive than optimists, such as government ministers, would like us to believe. Indeed, it wasn\u2019t in a healthy state prior to the shock of Covid-19. By the time the lockdown ends \u2013 and that light appears to be a long way down the tunnel \u2013 many companies may not be in a state to recover. It is true that some could seek to revive their businesses through advertising; but financial constraints on potential consumers, because of depleted income during the emergency, will make the outcome of such initiatives uncertain. Post-lockdown, publishers will be reassessing the state of their businesses. Aside from the difficulties they face in winning back advertisers, they will need to make rational decisions about their bottom lines. Did the closure of this or that title really matter? How much money did we save by publishing fewer newsprint issues? Do we need expensive offices when our papers have been so effectively produced by journalists operating remotely? In mid-March, that wise historian, Peter Hennessy, conveyed the epoch-making significance of the pandemic during a BBC Radio 4 interview. Future historians, he said, will divide our age into BC and AC: \u201cBefore corona and after corona.\u201d I am convinced media analysts will make the same division. AC will likely mark the final stage in newsprint\u2019s long decline.",

      "bodyText": "Drug treatment experts have raised concerns a drop in the supply of illicit drugs to the UK triggered by the lockdown is leading to an increase in the number of users turning to more dangerous alternatives. A reduction in global travel, increased border restrictions and a slowdown in movement within the UK has resulted in a drop in the supply of illicit drugs, including heroin and the designer drug spice. The Guardian understands that border guards have noted a recent drop in seizures as traffic into the country subsides, while senior police sources have noted the dip in supply. But experts have warned that fewer drugs on the streets is not as positive as it sounds, as users are already turning to high-strength alternatives such benzodiazepines, while there is a significant risk of heroin users substituting with fentanyl, a lethal drug 50 to 100 times stronger than heroin. The number of drug-related deaths is at a record high, according to the most recent official estimates, driven by deaths linked to drug misuse. The reduced supply is also leading to an increase in the price of some substances, including cannabis, and decreasing the purity of others as dealers cut them with different chemicals to increase bulk, experts have told the Guardian. Dr Rachel Britton, the director of pharmacy at the drug, alcohol and mental health charity We Are With You, which runs 80 drug treatment services across England and Scotland, said: \u201cWe are receiving reports that the coronavirus is affecting the supply of illicit drugs. \u201cWhile less drugs on the street may seem like a good thing, what replaces them is usually more dangerous.

I would like to thank the Chinese government for their support and securing that capacity,\u201d the senior minister said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have failed to take a strategic view of Britain\u2019s long-term economic, technical and security needs</p> <footer> <cite>Tory MPs</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Under David Cameron and George Osborne, the government pursued a policy of actively courting Chinese investment in areas such as nuclear power and telecoms. When Theresa May took over as prime minister, she ordered a review of the China General Nuclear Power Group\u2019s investment in the new Hinckley Point nuclear plant, but it was allowed to proceed.</p> <p>Charles Parton, a former China diplomat, and a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said that \u201ca rethink of UK-China relations has been needed for a long time\u201d because Beijing sees itself as in long-term competition with the west. </p> <p>But the foreign policy specialist also argued that the agencies\u2019 job was \u201cnot to make policy but provide information, and added: \u201cWhen they have strayed in the past, the results have not always been edifying\u201d. Despite their concern about high-tech, it was not clear that spy agencies were technological experts, Parton said.</p> <p>The future relationship with China is one of many issues due to be tackled by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/25/johnson-unveils-major-review-of-foreign-and-defence-policy\">integrated review of foreign policy and defence</a> announced in February. It had been due to report in the autumn but is widely expected to be delayed given the current crisis.</p> <p>A group of Conservative backbenchers, many of whom were prominent Brexiters, have begun to form a bloc of China-sceptics. Thirty-eight of the party\u2019s MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/10/government-wins-huawei-vote-despite-tory-rebellion\">voted against allowing Huawei</a> into supplying 5G technology last month, cutting the government\u2019s majority in a Commons vote to 24.</p> <p>Fifteen Tory MPs, led by Bob Seely, and including former ministers Iain Duncan Smith and David Davis, wrote to Johnson over the weekend asking that the UK \u201crethink our wider relationship with China\u201d after the pandemic has eased. \u201cWe ... have failed to take a strategic view of Britain\u2019s long-term economic, technical and security needs,\u201d they said.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s intelligence community believes the UK needs to reassess its relationship with China after the coronavirus crisis subsides and consider if tighter controls are needed over high-tech and other strategic industries. They reckon China will become more assertive in defending its one-party model as having successfully tackled the pandemic and that Boris Johnson and other ministers will have to take a \u201crealistic view\u201d and consider how the UK responds. Issues being aired are whether the UK wants to restrict takeovers of key companies in high-tech areas such as digital communications and artificial intelligence, and whether it should reduce Chinese students\u2019 access to research at universities and elsewhere. But MI6, the foreign intelligence service, and MI5, its domestic equivalent, still believe it was correct to allow Huawei access to Britain\u2019s 5G network, capped at 35% \u2013 a decision made by Johnson in January \u2013 although the new emphasis on China may make that decision increasingly hard to defend as Conservative rebels press for a rethink. A Whitehall source said the UK needs to ensure diversity of supply \u201cin 6G and 7G\u201d and, more broadly, to protect \u201cthe crown jewels\u201d of technology, research and innovation. MI6 is also understood to have told ministers that China was significantly under-reporting the number of coronavirus cases and deaths in January and February, echoing similar briefings given by the CIA to the White House. Intelligence agencies have been urging a greater emphasis on Chinese activity for months, and the announcement of Ken McCallum as the new director general of MI5 at the end of last month was accompanied by a promise that the organisation would focus more clearly on Beijing. Late last month, Michael Gove, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, accused China of playing down the initial threat posed by Covid-19. \u201cIt was also the case that some of the reporting from China was not clear about the scale, the nature, the infectiousness of this,\u201d he said. Other ministers who are known to be China-sceptics include Priti Patel, the home secretary, Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the house. Concern about China, however, remains tempered by the UK\u2019s deep trade relationship with Bejing, a point reinforced when Gove was forced to soften his criticism earlier this month after the arrival of badly-needed Chinese ventilators in the UK. \u201cToday 300 new ventilators arrived from China. I would like to thank the Chinese government for their support and securing that capacity,\u201d the senior minister said. Under David Cameron and George Osborne, the government pursued a policy of actively courting Chinese investment in areas such as nuclear power and telecoms. When Theresa May took over as prime minister, she ordered a review of the China General Nuclear Power Group\u2019s investment in the new Hinckley Point nuclear plant, but it was allowed to proceed. Charles Parton, a former China diplomat, and a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said that \u201ca rethink of UK-China relations has been needed for a long time\u201d because Beijing sees itself as in long-term competition with the west. But the foreign policy specialist also argued that the agencies\u2019 job was \u201cnot to make policy but provide information, and added: \u201cWhen they have strayed in the past, the results have not always been edifying\u201d. Despite their concern about high-tech, it was not clear that spy agencies were technological experts, Parton said. The future relationship with China is one of many issues due to be tackled by the integrated review of foreign policy and defence announced in February. It had been due to report in the autumn but is widely expected to be delayed given the current crisis. A group of Conservative backbenchers, many of whom were prominent Brexiters, have begun to form a bloc of China-sceptics. Thirty-eight of the party\u2019s MPs voted against allowing Huawei into supplying 5G technology last month, cutting the government\u2019s majority in a Commons vote to 24. Fifteen Tory MPs, led by Bob Seely, and including former ministers Iain Duncan Smith and David Davis, wrote to Johnson over the weekend asking that the UK \u201crethink our wider relationship with China\u201d after the pandemic has eased. \u201cWe ... have failed to take a strategic view of Britain\u2019s long-term economic, technical and security needs,\u201d they said.",

No one wanted to destroy the club and not have a job.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to a player at Perpignan, in France\u2019s second division, clubs there have also told their employees they will receive a salary deduction.

A member of newly promoted Newcastle told me many players voiced their concerns when information was distributed via text messages and emails. \u201cThe cuts didn\u2019t favour us at all and are more significant than other clubs,\u201d he said, suggesting a 25% cut for one player may also have greater consequences than for another. \u201cHowever, as a group we realised if we did push back there would potentially be no club to come back to. No one wanted to destroy the club and not have a job.\u201d Speaking to a player at Perpignan, in France\u2019s second division, clubs there have also told their employees they will receive a salary deduction. Players feel a sense of \u201cbeing left in the dark\u201d as Perpignan and other clubs in France are \u201cstill under the illusion they will be back training in May and they will finish their league games\u201d. Nevertheless even if the French leagues don\u2019t restart, players there can be encouraged by the ch\u00f4mage system, which helps those unable to sign any contracts after the end of their fixed term to get 12 months\u2019 pay while searching for another job. For players in the UK, there is much less certainty. Those out of contract are left with a deafening silence because club recruitment has halted. Most clubs are waiting for further news about the government\u2019s help schemes. But rugby\u2019s long-term financial future is not all about cutting players\u2019 wages. The sport has a global market. Cut too far and you risk your best players moving overseas. Too often as a player you hear how, in financial terms, rugby has made no progress over the last decade. Meanwhile the standard of play, athleticism and skill has continued to increase. The sport is becoming faster and more physical, which has led to careers being shorter. Looking at it in those terms, players have a case for being paid more, not less. So what about the business of rugby? Players are invested in this as much as anyone; arguably more than most. We have questions that demand answers. Are those running the sport maximising its potential? Is it gathering the best television deals and sponsorship? Is the game understandable, attractive and accessible to viewers? My friend from Perpignan said rugby, in the UK particularly, is not progressing: \u201cThe product selling seems average. In France there is more money being spent on rugby with TV rights being a lot more lucrative. Pro D2 matches are on Thursday and Friday nights, then the Top 14 is played on the weekend. Maybe they can try this with the Championship and Premiership? \u201cI think overall though, rugby needs to drop the \u2018amateurishness\u2019 to it. It needs to be streamlined into a strong business. Look at the finances overall, yes look at the wages, but don\u2019t just look at that.\u201d His passion is obvious and he speaks for all of us.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a letter to the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, Catalonia\u2019s regional president asked to see the medical and epidemiological advice on which the decision was taken.

Evidence that a strict lockdown, in place since 14 March, was working came as some factory and construction workers prepared to return to work on Monday, a call that has drawn criticism in some quarters. In a letter to the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, Catalonia\u2019s regional president asked to see the medical and epidemiological advice on which the decision was taken.

Recently released data from judicial authorities in Madrid, for example, suggests that 6,600 more people than usual died in the last two weeks of March, compared with the official tally of 3,500 Covid-19 deaths in the region. Infection rates continued to decelerate elsewhere in Europe including the Netherlands, where coronavirus cases topped 25,000 on Sunday with more than 2,700 deaths. Italy recorded its lowest daily rise in deaths in three weeks on Sunday, with 431 people killed by the virus and new cases growing by 1,984, or 2%. The curve for infections has been flattening over the past week or so, and Walter Ricciardi, the scientific adviser to the Italian government on the coronavirus outbreak, told the Guardian last week that the plateau could continue for 20-25 days before there is a definitive decrease. To date, there have been 156,363 cases of coronavirus in Italy, including 19,899 victims and 34,211 survivors The European commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, told the German daily Bild that elderly people on the continent may need to remain isolated until at least the end of the year to protect them from the virus, even if freedom of movement is relaxed for others. \u201cWithout a vaccine, we have to limit as much as possible contact with the elderly,\u201d she said. \u201cI know it\u2019s difficult and that isolation is a burden, but it is a question of life or death, we have to remain disciplined and patient. \u201cChildren and young people will enjoy more freedom of movement earlier than elderly people and those with pre-existing medical conditions,\u201d she said. In an Easter Sunday mass performed to a handful of people in St Peter\u2019s Basilica and livestreamed around the world, Pope Francis said he hoped rivalries from before the second world war \u201cdo not regain force\u201d as a result of the pandemic. He said the crisis presented the European Union with an \u201cepochal challenge, on which will depend not only its future but that of the whole world\u201d. Nearly 110,000 people have died from coronavirus, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, with more than 1.78 million people diagnosed. Tight restrictions on movement came into force on Sunday in Jerusalem, where predominantly ultra-orthodox Jewish areas have been hit disproportionately by the virus, in part because influential rabbis were slow to shut synagogues and religious seminaries. Mainland China reported 99 new cases on Saturday, of which all but two were imported, and the country\u2019s national health commission said there were no new deaths. The two local cases were in Heilongjiang, China\u2019s northern-most province, which borders Russia. Of the 97 imported cases recorded, 43 were in the city of Shanghai.

      "body": "<p>The highlights of the career of the comedian Tim Brooke-Taylor were a hit TV series that mysteriously became very hard to see and a successful radio show that offered a remarkably enduring opportunity to be heard.</p> <p>From 1970-82, he co-starred, with Dr Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie \u2013 whom he had met at Cambridge University \u2013 in the TV series The Goodies. A distinctive combination of slapstick and satire, it has struggled to achieve a repeat afterlife, to the regret and occasional suspicion of its creators.</p> <p>However, Brooke-Taylor had better luck with the BBC as a regular on the Radio 4 panel show, I\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t a Clue, on which he had appeared since 1972. The 73rd series is due to run from May, although the scheduling of a show recorded in front of live audiences around the country was already complicated by the social distancing restrictions imposed to counter the Covid-19 pandemic.

      "bodyText": "The highlights of the career of the comedian Tim Brooke-Taylor were a hit TV series that mysteriously became very hard to see and a successful radio show that offered a remarkably enduring opportunity to be heard. From 1970-82, he co-starred, with Dr Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie \u2013 whom he had met at Cambridge University \u2013 in the TV series The Goodies. A distinctive combination of slapstick and satire, it has struggled to achieve a repeat afterlife, to the regret and occasional suspicion of its creators. However, Brooke-Taylor had better luck with the BBC as a regular on the Radio 4 panel show, I\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t a Clue, on which he had appeared since 1972. The 73rd series is due to run from May, although the scheduling of a show recorded in front of live audiences around the country was already complicated by the social distancing restrictions imposed to counter the Covid-19 pandemic. Brooke-Taylor had recently been diagnosed with the virus, becoming the second senior British comedy figure to die with it, following Eddie Large. The Goodies featured the conceit of a trio of eccentric friends who operated as trouble-shooters, racing on their signature \u201ctrandem\u201d, a three-seater bike, to deal with emergencies \u2013 most famously, Kitten Kong, a massive baby cat that terrorised London. The monstrous moggy scaled the Post Office Tower in homage to massive gorilla King Kong\u2019s treatment of New York\u2019s Empire State Building as a plaything in a famous movie. Cinematic parody was a frequent Goodies device, other send-ups including \u201c2001 and a Bit\u201d and \u201ca Cornish western called Bunfight at the OK Tea Rooms\u201d. But, although The Goodies achieved high ratings and won awards (including the Silver Rose of Montreux, a high European TV honour, for \u201cKitten Kong\u201d), it was less popular with BBC bosses, who kept the trio loosely contracted, and did not seem heart-broken to lose them to ITV\u2019s London Weekend Television in 1980.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has thanked the NHS for saving his life as he left hospital to recuperate at Chequers, after a week of treatment for Covid-19. The prime minister praised two nurses in particular for watching over his bedside in intensive care for 48 hours \u201cwhen things could have gone either way\u201d \u2013 Jenny from New Zealand and Luis from Portugal. Speaking in a video message just hours after leaving St Thomas\u2019 hospital in south London, the prime minister expressed optimism the UK was \u201cmaking progress in this incredible national battle against coronavirus\u201d. Johnson said he had left hospital \u201cafter a week in which the NHS has saved my life, no question\u201d. He said the country was mourning \u201cevery day those who are taken from us in such numbers, and the struggle is by no means over\u201d but he argued progress was being made \u201cbecause the British public formed a human shield around this country\u2019s greatest national asset \u2013 our NHS\u201d. Johnson said he had seen the pressures the NHS was under after seven days in hospital, including three in intensive care. And he had witnessed the \u201cpersonal courage not just of the doctors and nurses but of everyone: the cleaners, the cooks, the healthcare workers of every description, physios, radiographers, pharmacists\u201d. He praised a list of nurses and doctors who had looked after him by name, and gave extra thanks to Jenny and Luis, saying their care and interventions were \u201cthe reason in the end my body did start to get enough oxygen\u201d. \u201cThat is how I also know that across this country, 24 hours a day, for every second of every hour, there are hundreds of thousands of NHS staff who are acting with the same care and thought and precision as Jenny and Luis,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we will defeat this coronavirus and defeat it together. We will win because our NHS is the beating heart of this country. It is the best of this country. It is unconquerable. It is powered by love.\u201d He also praised and thanked the public for observing social distancing when \u201cthe whole natural world seems at its loveliest and the outdoors is so inviting\u201d. However, he made no mention of the criticism that has dogged the government in recent weeks over its failure to get personal protective equipment to all NHS and care staff who need it, the problems with increasing testing and the UK\u2019s daily mortality rate having exceeded the deadliest days in Italy and Spain. No 10 said the prime minister will head to Chequers to continue his recovery, leaving Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, deputising for him. A No 10 spokesman said: \u201cThe PM has been discharged from hospital to continue his recovery at Chequers. On the advice of his medical team, the PM will not be immediately returning to work. He wishes to thank everybody at St Thomas\u2019 for the brilliant care he has received. All of his thoughts are with those affected by this illness.\u201d Raab has already announced the UK\u2019s lockdown will continue beyond the initial three-week period set out by Johnson and may have to take further decisions in the coming days about how much longer it should stay in place. Johnson was taken into hospital last Sunday after his coronavirus symptoms, including a cough and a high temperature, persisted. He was moved into intensive care on Monday evening. The government said he was not put on a ventilator but had continued to receive \u201cstandard oxygen treatment\u201d. On Thursday, he was moved back to a hospital ward after three nights in intensive care, and was said to be in \u201cextremely good spirits\u201d, according to Downing Street. Following his admission, colleagues expressed concern Johnson had still been receiving his red box of government papers at his hospital bed and urged him to rest. No 10 has insisted it has been transparent throughout Johnson\u2019s illness but several reports have confirmed that the prime minister was more ill than officials were letting on in the days before his admission to hospital. Johnson is expected to take some time to recuperate, rather than returning swiftly to Downing Street, but is likely to want to be involved in the decision about when and how to end the lockdown. In a statement, Johnson\u2019s fiancee Carrie Symonds said she \u201ccannot thank our magnificent NHS enough\u201d: \u201cThe staff at St Thomas\u2019 hospital have been incredible. I will never, ever be able to repay you and I will never stop thanking you.\u201d She added: \u201cThere were times last week that were very dark indeed. My heart goes out to all those in similar situations, worried sick about their loved ones. Thank you also to everyone who sent such kind messages of support. Today I\u2019m feeling incredibly lucky.\u201d",

The lesson of the Osborne experiment is that trying to get the deficit down too fast leads to sluggish growth, which reduces tax revenues and means it takes longer to reduce borrowing.

National debt \u2013 a measure of the budget surpluses and deficits accumulated over centuries \u2013 rose to 250% of gross domestic product.

Sunak has promised to pay off his overdraft by the end of the year, which he could do either by selling more gilts or by raising taxes.

      "body": "<p>A robotic delivery service in Milton Keynes could prove to be the future of locked-down Britain, as miniature autonomous vehicles bring food deliveries to almost 200,000 residents of the town.</p> <p>Starship Technologies, an autonomous delivery startup created in 2014 by two Skype cofounders, has been testing its beer cooler-sized robots in public since 2015. The small, white, six-wheeled vehicles trundle along pavements to bring small deliveries to residents and workers of the neighbourhoods in which they operate, without the need for a human driver or delivery person.</p> <p>The Milton Keynes operation is the first commercial deployment in the UK, and started in mid-March, just as the country was implementing widespread social distancing in an effort to tackle the spread of coronavirus. Residents can <a href=\"https://starshipdeliveries.com/\">download the Deliveroo-style Starship Deliveries app</a> to buy cooked food and small orders from supermarkets, which gets loaded into the robots and driven to them.</p> <p>Sam Crooks, the mayor of Milton Keynes, said: \u201cI\u2019ve got a fairly young demographic in my ward, and they love it. There was obviously a burst of use at the beginning, because of the novelty, but already it\u2019s just a part of people\u2019s routines.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are taking seriously the guidance about not going out, so something like the robot deliveries are absolutely ideal, because people can order and obtain something without going out. Particularly as their first relationship was with Tesco and the Co-op.\u201d</p> <p>Andy Curtis, the head of UK operations at Starship, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen huge surges in demand since we started operating in Milton Keynes two years ago. We\u2019re excited that both residents and workers can now enjoy this low cost and convenient benefit in the centre of Milton Keynes, and we hope that it will make the town an even more attractive place to work in the future.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0db193f802b84e6ad1fc90c8c0e878ac32a8925e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0db193f802b84e6ad1fc90c8c0e878ac32a8925e/0_109_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Starship robot in Milton Keynes.

      "bodyText": "A robotic delivery service in Milton Keynes could prove to be the future of locked-down Britain, as miniature autonomous vehicles bring food deliveries to almost 200,000 residents of the town. Starship Technologies, an autonomous delivery startup created in 2014 by two Skype cofounders, has been testing its beer cooler-sized robots in public since 2015. The small, white, six-wheeled vehicles trundle along pavements to bring small deliveries to residents and workers of the neighbourhoods in which they operate, without the need for a human driver or delivery person. The Milton Keynes operation is the first commercial deployment in the UK, and started in mid-March, just as the country was implementing widespread social distancing in an effort to tackle the spread of coronavirus. Residents can download the Deliveroo-style Starship Deliveries app to buy cooked food and small orders from supermarkets, which gets loaded into the robots and driven to them. Sam Crooks, the mayor of Milton Keynes, said: \u201cI\u2019ve got a fairly young demographic in my ward, and they love it. There was obviously a burst of use at the beginning, because of the novelty, but already it\u2019s just a part of people\u2019s routines. \u201cPeople are taking seriously the guidance about not going out, so something like the robot deliveries are absolutely ideal, because people can order and obtain something without going out. Particularly as their first relationship was with Tesco and the Co-op.\u201d Andy Curtis, the head of UK operations at Starship, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen huge surges in demand since we started operating in Milton Keynes two years ago. We\u2019re excited that both residents and workers can now enjoy this low cost and convenient benefit in the centre of Milton Keynes, and we hope that it will make the town an even more attractive place to work in the future.\u201d The launch of Starship\u2019s Milton Keynes offering comes as conventional delivery services are under increasing strain. Royal Mail delivery workers have complained that they are being asked to risk their health for non-essential deliveries, and the service has had to deal with a growing number of workers taking sick leave. Gig economy delivery companies, such as Deliveroo, have come under pressure too, with their riders, who are not normal employees, worrying that they may have to continue deliveries if they get sick or lose their income entirely. The robotics firm says demand has been high in the last week, and that it plans to expand further across the UK and US.

The 66,000 figure had been rejected by scientists whose modelling of the probable shape of the UK epidemic is relied on by the government. Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London said the IHME figures on \u201chealthcare demand\u201d \u2013 including hospital bed use and deaths \u2013 were twice as high as they should be. In March, the Imperial College London team said the number of deaths could reach 260,000 in the UK with no restrictions on movement, but they hoped to get this down to 20,000 with the lockdown strategy. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 April 2020 to include reference to the IHME\u2019s prediction for UK deaths from Covid-19 being revised down from 66,000 to 37,000.",

      "body": "<p>Technology firms are processing large volumes of confidential UK patient information in a data-mining operation that is part of the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak, according to documents seen by the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Palantir, the US big data firm founded by the rightwing billionaire Peter Thiel, is working with Faculty, a British artificial intelligence startup, to consolidate government databases and help ministers and officials respond to the pandemic.</p> \n<p>Data is also being used by Faculty to build predictive computer models around the Covid-19 outbreak. One NHS document suggests that, two weeks ago, Faculty considered running a computer simulation to assess the impact of a policy of \u201ctargeted herd immunity\u201d. Lawyers for Faculty said the proposed herd immunity simulation never took place.</p> \n<p>NHSX, the digital transformation arm of the National Health Service that has contracted the tech companies to help build the \u201cCovid-19 datastore\u201d, said the technology would give ministers and officials \u201creal-time information about health services, showing where demand is rising and where critical equipment needs to be deployed\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe companies involved do not control the data and are not permitted to use or share it for their own purposes,\u201d a spokesperson said. Faculty\u2019s lawyers said the firm only had access to aggregated or anonymised data via NHS systems.</p> \n<p>The government had previously said it would use Faculty and Palantir in a Covid-19 data project. But the full scope of that operation, and the sensitive nature of patient-level data being used, is revealed in the documents seen by the Guardian.</p> \n<p>One portion of the project involves giving leaders in the NHS, Cabinet Office and Downing Street a live feed of \u201caggregate\u201d statistics on hospitalisations, availability of critical care beds, ventilator orders and oxygen supplies.</p> \n<p>However, the documents also appear to show the project includes large volumes of data pertaining to individuals, including protected health information, Covid-19 test results, the contents of people\u2019s calls to the NHS health advice line 111 and clinical information about those in intensive care.</p> \n<p>While such data will be anonymised, it remains sensitive and confidential, and its use on a centralised new government database is likely to raise questions among privacy experts. A Whitehall source said they were alarmed at the \u201cunprecedented\u201d amounts of confidential health information being swept up in the project, which they said was progressing at alarming speed and with insufficient regard for privacy, ethics or data protection.</p> \n<p>The documents also suggest that:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>While anonymised, confidential 111 information in the Covid-19 datastore may include people\u2019s gender, postcode, symptoms, the mechanism through which any prescription was dispatched to them, and the precise time they ended the call.</p></li> \n <li><p>The project appears to be using a \u201cpseudo NHS number\u201d to cross-match large datasets, including a master patient index, an existing NHS resource that uses \u201csocial marketing data\u201d to segment the British population into different \u201ctypes\u201d at household level.</p></li> \n <li><p>While not a current priority, phone location data could be used in the datastore after it was \u201coffered\u201d to the government by two private companies for help with contact tracing. The NHS declined to say which companies had offered the location data or how it would be used.</p></li> \n <li><p>Faculty\u2019s proposed simulation of a policy described as \u201ctargeted herd immunity\u201d was part of an NHSX and Faculty planning document considered around 23 March, more than a week after ministers insisted the controversial policy was no longer being contemplated.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Lawyers for Faculty suggested the proposed simulation was the result of entirely internal, preliminary discussions. The planning document listed potential analysis of the impact of \u201ctargeted herd immunity (only isolate most vulnerable parts of population)\u201d alongside other possible government policies such as social distancing, school closures and household quarantines.</p> \n<p>The document was considered by senior NHS officials more than a week after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, tried to draw a line under the government\u2019s controversial flirtation with the strategy of herd immunity, which involves enough people contracting the disease to develop population\u2013level resistance.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/cumulative\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The NHS said the data in the Covid-19 datastore would remain under its control and be subject to severe restrictions under data protection legislation. \u201cStrict data protection rules apply to everyone involved in helping in this critical task,\u201d an NHSX spokesperson said.</p> \n<p>However, the Guardian was able to see confidential documents used by Palantir, Faculty and NHSX officials to plan, develop and execute the Covid-19 datastore.

      "bodyText": "Technology firms are processing large volumes of confidential UK patient information in a data-mining operation that is part of the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak, according to documents seen by the Guardian. Palantir, the US big data firm founded by the rightwing billionaire Peter Thiel, is working with Faculty, a British artificial intelligence startup, to consolidate government databases and help ministers and officials respond to the pandemic. Data is also being used by Faculty to build predictive computer models around the Covid-19 outbreak. One NHS document suggests that, two weeks ago, Faculty considered running a computer simulation to assess the impact of a policy of \u201ctargeted herd immunity\u201d. Lawyers for Faculty said the proposed herd immunity simulation never took place. NHSX, the digital transformation arm of the National Health Service that has contracted the tech companies to help build the \u201cCovid-19 datastore\u201d, said the technology would give ministers and officials \u201creal-time information about health services, showing where demand is rising and where critical equipment needs to be deployed\u201d. \u201cThe companies involved do not control the data and are not permitted to use or share it for their own purposes,\u201d a spokesperson said. Faculty\u2019s lawyers said the firm only had access to aggregated or anonymised data via NHS systems. The government had previously said it would use Faculty and Palantir in a Covid-19 data project. But the full scope of that operation, and the sensitive nature of patient-level data being used, is revealed in the documents seen by the Guardian. One portion of the project involves giving leaders in the NHS, Cabinet Office and Downing Street a live feed of \u201caggregate\u201d statistics on hospitalisations, availability of critical care beds, ventilator orders and oxygen supplies. However, the documents also appear to show the project includes large volumes of data pertaining to individuals, including protected health information, Covid-19 test results, the contents of people\u2019s calls to the NHS health advice line 111 and clinical information about those in intensive care. While such data will be anonymised, it remains sensitive and confidential, and its use on a centralised new government database is likely to raise questions among privacy experts. A Whitehall source said they were alarmed at the \u201cunprecedented\u201d amounts of confidential health information being swept up in the project, which they said was progressing at alarming speed and with insufficient regard for privacy, ethics or data protection. The documents also suggest that: While anonymised, confidential 111 information in the Covid-19 datastore may include people\u2019s gender, postcode, symptoms, the mechanism through which any prescription was dispatched to them, and the precise time they ended the call. The project appears to be using a \u201cpseudo NHS number\u201d to cross-match large datasets, including a master patient index, an existing NHS resource that uses \u201csocial marketing data\u201d to segment the British population into different \u201ctypes\u201d at household level. While not a current priority, phone location data could be used in the datastore after it was \u201coffered\u201d to the government by two private companies for help with contact tracing. The NHS declined to say which companies had offered the location data or how it would be used. Faculty\u2019s proposed simulation of a policy described as \u201ctargeted herd immunity\u201d was part of an NHSX and Faculty planning document considered around 23 March, more than a week after ministers insisted the controversial policy was no longer being contemplated. Lawyers for Faculty suggested the proposed simulation was the result of entirely internal, preliminary discussions. The planning document listed potential analysis of the impact of \u201ctargeted herd immunity (only isolate most vulnerable parts of population)\u201d alongside other possible government policies such as social distancing, school closures and household quarantines. The document was considered by senior NHS officials more than a week after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, tried to draw a line under the government\u2019s controversial flirtation with the strategy of herd immunity, which involves enough people contracting the disease to develop population\u2013level resistance. The NHS said the data in the Covid-19 datastore would remain under its control and be subject to severe restrictions under data protection legislation. \u201cStrict data protection rules apply to everyone involved in helping in this critical task,\u201d an NHSX spokesperson said. However, the Guardian was able to see confidential documents used by Palantir, Faculty and NHSX officials to plan, develop and execute the Covid-19 datastore. It is unclear who was responsible for making the documents \u2013 which did not contain NHS patient data \u2013 accessible via an unrestricted portal. The Whitehall source described the open accessibility of the documents as a \u201cshocking data breach\u201d. Palantir did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Faculty\u2019s lawyers said there had been no breach of patient or other sensitive NHS data. The involvement of private sector data scientists at the heart of the government\u2019s Covid-19 response stems in part from a Downing Street \u201csummit\u201d on 11 March attended by executives from dozens of tech firms, chaired by the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, an enthusiast of artificial intelligence and computer modelling. Faculty, which had a pre-existing contract to build an artificial intelligence lab for the NHS, took on a leading role in the data response to the pandemic. It is run by Marc Warner, whose brother, Ben, was reportedly recruited to Downing Street by Cummings after running the Conservative party\u2019s private election model. Ben Warner, who used to be a principal at his brother\u2019s AI company, is said to have worked closely with Cummings on the modelling programme used in the Vote Leave campaign to leave the European Union. Faculty\u2019s lawyers said its NHS contract was the result of a tender process that was not influenced by Cummings. Faculty said in a statement it was \u201cenormously proud\u201d of its work for the NHS, which it said was helping save lives. \u201cFaculty is not dealing with personally identifiable information. Faculty is helping to develop dashboards, models and simulations to provide key central government decision-makers with a deeper level of information about the current and future coronavirus situation to help inform the response.\u201d Palantir\u2019s role in the project involves integrating NHS datasets with the US company\u2019s data-management platform, Foundry. Microsoft, Google and Amazon products are also being used on the datastore project, but staff at those companies are understood to be less directly involved. Senior NHS officials have insisted the operation is only temporary, saying: \u201cWhen the pandemic abates and the outbreak is contained, we will close the Covid-19 datastore.\u201d However, the Whitehall source said there was lingering concerns in the civil service that the powerful new apparatus could outlast the crisis. Neither Downing Street nor Cummings responded to a request for comment. Lawyers for Faculty said Cummings did not request the proposed simulation on herd immunity, and was not the mastermind of the datastore.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Dr William Hanage, a professor of the evolution and epidemiology of infectious disease at Harvard, wrote in the Guardian that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19\">such a policy would result in large numbers of people dying</a> and the NHS being overwhelmed.

      "bodyText": "The inclusion of \u201ctargeted herd immunity\u201d as a possible UK government response to the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 in a list of possible interventions considered for analysis by a contractor \u2013 appears to contradict strong denials by the health secretary 10 days earlier that it was any part of government policy. Matt Hancock gave that response on 14 March after two senior government officials had said publicly that achieving \u201cherd immunity\u201d was a key aim, prompting widespread alarm among medical experts that the British government was planning to allow the majority of the population to become infected. However, a proposed computer simulation of the impact of \u201ctargeted herd immunity\u201d was contained in a planning document, used by NHSX and a technology contractor to map out the data response to the pandemic, around 23 March. While it does not appear the herd immunity simulation took place, its inclusion in a list of possible interventions raises questions about the government\u2019s stance on the policy. Dr William Hanage, a professor of the evolution and epidemiology of infectious disease at Harvard, wrote in the Guardian that such a policy would result in large numbers of people dying and the NHS being overwhelmed. He reflected the general bafflement among many experts, because \u201cherd immunity\u201d is typically achieved via widespread vaccination against a disease. There is no vaccine for Covid-19, and \u201cherd immunity\u201d without a vaccine assumes that the vast majority of people who recover from the coronavirus will then be immune, which has not yet been conclusively established. Hancock set out the government\u2019s position in an article for the Sunday Telegraph on 14 March, explicitly denying that it was aiming for herd immunity. \u201cWe have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists. Herd immunity is not a part of it.

Groups in the UK promoting the conspiracy theory on Facebook \u2013 often linking it to explicitly antisemitic messages \u2013 have been growing at a significant rate, warned the campaign group Hope not Hate. The largest group in the UK, Stop 5G UK, added almost 3,000 members in just 24 hours from 6-7 April while another, Direct Action Against 5G, gained more than 1,400 members in its first week after it was created on 31 March. Hope not Hate warned that an ever-growing number of Facebook users are now accessing posts that not only encourages them to take illegal action against 5G infrastructure but also contains potentially damaging misinformation about health and wellbeing. Almost a third of British people say they can\u2019t rule out a link between coronavirus and 5G, according to new polling revealing the extent of the baseless conspiracy theory. Some 8% believe there is a link, while 19% are unsure, according to the survey of 2,032 adults by the polling firm Focaldata. At least 20 phone masts across the UK are believed to have been set alight or otherwise vandalised since the start of the coronavirus crisis, according to government and industry sources who said this month that they have grown increasingly concerned about the impact of the baseless claims about risks associated with the next-generation mobile technology. An analysis by Hope not Hate researchers of recent posts from six UK-based anti-5G Facebook groups has found evidence of a \u201ctoxic cocktail\u201d of influence from far-right activists and others, where antisemitic and anti-government conspiracies are combined with calls to illegal direct action. Stop 5G UK has people posting pictures of masts in their area of west London and asking what they were, before being urged by other users to \u201cburn it\u201d and \u201cdrive into it\u201d. A post which combined antisemitic tropes and conspiracy theories about 9/11 received more than a hundred likes and was shared dozens of times. On another group, a user who posted pictures of masts in his town was urged by others to \u201cburn it\u201d and \u201cbomb them before it bombs us\u201d. Facebook told the Guardian that it had removed the Stop 5G UK group following violations of its \u201cpromoting or publicising\u201d crime policies before it received the report from Hate not Hate and has since removed a Destroy 5G Save Our Children group. It also removed a number of other posts flagged by Hope not Hate.

Richard Fuller, Conservative MP for North East Bedfordshire, told Branson to \u201cpay your employees yourself their unpaid leave\u201d.</p> <p>Fuller added: \u201cWhen it comes to looking at the protection of your workers, the time is now, and we will judge you all by your actions.\u201d</p> <p>Sunak told Virgin Atlantic and other airlines last month that the government would offer them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/24/uk-airlines-and-airports-told-not-to-expect-industry-wide-covid-19-bailout\">no special support</a>. He said airline companies were expected to raise money from shareholders and to have \u201cexhausted other options\u201d before asking for state help, which would only be there as \u201ca last resort\u201d.</p> <p>Branson, who is the 312th richest person in the world with an estimated <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/richard-c-branson/\">$5.2bn (\u00a34.2bn) paper fortune</a>, told staff the company faced a \u201cmassive battle to survive and save jobs\u201d.</p> <p>He pledged to inject $250m into Virgin Group, his empire that stretches from planes and trains to health clubs and spaceships and employs some 70,000 people. The $250m pledge \u2013 of which $100m is thought to be earmarked for the airline \u2013 is 5% of his fortune.</p> <p>Thousands of staff across the group, including 8,000 working for Virgin Atlantic, have been put on extended leave or asked to take voluntary redundancy.</p> <p>A Virgin Group spokesman said: \u201cVirgin Atlantic, in which Virgin Group is a 51% shareholder, appealed to UK Government for clear and decisive support. The aviation industry is facing unprecedented pressure following the severe impact of Covid-19. The airline continues to take decisive action to reduce costs, preserve cash and protect jobs. With support, airlines including Virgin Atlantic, can weather this storm and emerge in a position to assist the nation\u2019s economic recovery, providing the essential passenger and cargo connectivity that people and businesses across the nation rely on.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, healthcare campaigner Dr John Lister accused Branson\u2019s Virgin healthcare group of playing a <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/richard-bransons-virgin-healthcare-paid-21366075\">\u201cparasitic role in the NHS</a>, fragmenting services and poaching NHS-trained staff and undermining nearby NHS trusts\u201d.</p> <p>Virgin Care had been awarded \u00a32bn worth of NHS and local authority healthcare deals, but paid no corporate tax in the UK as it operated at a loss. The company is ultimately controlled by Virgin Group Holdings in the BVI.</p> <p>Virgin Group told the Guardian that \u00a32bn was the maximum Virgin Care would be paid to fund the delivery of health and care services from 2010 until 2027. \u201cIt is not profit, it is revenue and the vast majority of this will be paid in salaries to more than 7,000 health and social care staff, which includes more than 1,300 nurses, around 100 doctors and 400 other health staff,\u201d said the spokesperson.</p> <p>\u201cThe Virgin Group has invested more than \u00a375m into Virgin Care and neither Richard, nor the Virgin Group have ever<del> </del>taken a penny out of the NHS, nor do they intend to do so. All monies received have been reinvested back into paying for delivering services as well as being invested in transformation projects to improve the NHS. Richard and everyone at the Virgin Group are immensely proud of the Virgin Care team who have, like everyone else in the NHS, been going above and beyond in this time of crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Branson, who often drapes himself in the Union flag and last year had <a href=\"https://blog.virginatlantic.com/displaying-our-aircraft-mascots-the-rules/\">Virgin Atlantic planes painted with a range of mascots carrying the flag</a>, claims he moved to his private 30-hectare Necker Island, part of the BVI archipelago, to take advantage of the weather rather than the tax breaks.</p> <p>\u201cI have not left Britain for tax reasons but for my love of the beautiful British Virgin Islands and in particular Necker Island,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/on-necker-island\">he said in a now-deleted blog post </a>when his Caribbean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/13/richard-branson-tax-exile-virgin\">tax domicile was revealed in 2013</a>. \u201cI have been very fortunate to accumulate so much wealth in my career, more than I need in my lifetime and would not live somewhere I don\u2019t want to for tax reasons.\u201d</p> <p>At the nadir of the stock market rout last month, Branson moved his $1.1bn stake in Virgin Galactic Holdings, his space tourism for billionaires business, from the US state of Delaware to the BVI. US regulatory filings show the transfer was made on 16 March \u2013 that day the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst one-day point drop in history.</p> <p>A spokesperson said: \u201cThis is as an internal re-organisation that has no effect on our ownership interest.\u201d</p> <p>Virgin Group said the company paid all of corporate taxes due in the UK and the other countries in which it operates. The company\u2019s <a href=\"chrome-extension://oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm/https://www.virgin.com/sites/virgin.com/files/virgin_group_tax_strategy_statement.pdf\">tax strategy statement</a> states: \u201cWe invest significant resources in managing and monitoring our tax risk to ensure that we pay the right amount of tax.\u201d</p> <p>Dividends sent to Branson on Necker island are not subject to any taxes. Over a 22-year period, he collected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/11/richard-branson-earned-300m-virgin-rail-franchises\">\u00a3306m in dividends from Virgin Trains </a>before losing the franchise for the west coast main line last year. Loss-making Virgin Atlantic has not paid a dividend in recent years, but in 2014 it paid shareholders \u00a387.9m.</p> <p>Branson is not the only member of the tax efficient wealthy elite seeking to benefit from the government\u2019s furlough scheme. Sir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/philip-green\">Philip Green</a> is asking the taxpayer to support 14,500 employees at Arcadia, the fashion empire that includes Topshop.</p> <p>Tottenham Hotspur football club, which is majority-owned by Bahamas-based billionaire Joe Lewis, has put hundreds of its non-playing staff on the furlough scheme. Newcastle\u2019s billionaire owner, Mike Ashley, has also put Newcastle\u2019s non-football staff on furlough and applied for the government\u2019s support.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Luke Hildyard, who campaigns against executive excess at the High Pay Centre, said: \u201cAt a time when the government is struggling to fund the NHS and support low and middle income earners hit by the economic shutdown, it would be unthinkable to commit hundreds of millions of pounds to an effective bailout for billionaire Richard Branson and multibillion dollar corporation Delta Airlines.</p> <p>\u201cIf Branson and Delta can\u2019t find the money to fund Virgin Atlantic through this period themselves, they should have to accept a loss and a dilution of their shareholding, with the company moving into part public ownership.</p> <p>\u201cThe 2008-09 financial crisis should have taught us that lavishing public money on big businesses, often ones with questionable social and environmental records, without any conditions attached would be a big mistake.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 April 2020 to include statements from Virgin Group, concerning the activities of Virgin Care and Virgin Atlantic, that were received after publication. The sentence referring to Virgin Australia was also amended to make clear that Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Group has only a 10% stake in that company, while the reference to dividends from Virgin Trains was also amended to explain these were paid over a 22-year period. Virgin Group also pointed out that the airlines are independent businesses whose executive teams and boards lead any discussion on future support.</p>",

      "bodyText": "From his private island in the Caribbean, Sir Richard Branson is trying to convince the UK government to give his Virgin Atlantic airline a \u00a3500m bailout to help it survive the coronavirus pandemic and the economic fallout of the lockdown. Virgin Australia, which is 10% owned by the billionaire\u2019s Virgin Group, is also seeking a \u00a3700m bailout from the Australian government. Branson has the backing of bosses at Airbus, which makes Virgin Atlantic\u2019s planes, and Rolls-Royce, which makes its jet engines, who have warned ministers that if the airline collapsed it could drag them down too. At the weekend, Manchester Airports Group chief, Charlie Cornish, added his name to the list of travel industry bosses desperate for Virgin to survive, saying in a letter to chancellor, Rishi Sunak, that Virgin flights \u201care directly benefiting the economies of Manchester and the surrounding region\u201d. He said: \u201cVirgin Atlantic\u2019s growth in capacity has been essential in allowing Manchester to become one of the best-connected European airports to the US.\u201d Branson, who founded Virgin Atlantic in 1984 and retains a 51% stake alongside US airline Delta with 49%, is pleading for UK government support. And he has the industry\u2019s backing. But the plea has prompted a substantial backlash, with many pointing out that the entrepreneur has paid the exchequer no personal income tax since moving to the tax free British Virgin Islands (BVI) 14 years ago. Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the Guardian it was unacceptable that \u201crich billionaires [were] milking the system\u201d at a time of national crisis. Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the Labour party, tweeted: \u201cRichard flog your private island and pay your staff, we are in unprecedented times here. Now is the time your staff need support after making mountains of cash for the company.\u201d It is not just Labour MPs who think the billionaire should dig into his own resources to help out in the current crisis. Richard Fuller, Conservative MP for North East Bedfordshire, told Branson to \u201cpay your employees yourself their unpaid leave\u201d. Fuller added: \u201cWhen it comes to looking at the protection of your workers, the time is now, and we will judge you all by your actions.\u201d Sunak told Virgin Atlantic and other airlines last month that the government would offer them no special support. He said airline companies were expected to raise money from shareholders and to have \u201cexhausted other options\u201d before asking for state help, which would only be there as \u201ca last resort\u201d. Branson, who is the 312th richest person in the world with an estimated $5.2bn (\u00a34.2bn) paper fortune, told staff the company faced a \u201cmassive battle to survive and save jobs\u201d. He pledged to inject $250m into Virgin Group, his empire that stretches from planes and trains to health clubs and spaceships and employs some 70,000 people. The $250m pledge \u2013 of which $100m is thought to be earmarked for the airline \u2013 is 5% of his fortune. Thousands of staff across the group, including 8,000 working for Virgin Atlantic, have been put on extended leave or asked to take voluntary redundancy. A Virgin Group spokesman said: \u201cVirgin Atlantic, in which Virgin Group is a 51% shareholder, appealed to UK Government for clear and decisive support. The aviation industry is facing unprecedented pressure following the severe impact of Covid-19. The airline continues to take decisive action to reduce costs, preserve cash and protect jobs. With support, airlines including Virgin Atlantic, can weather this storm and emerge in a position to assist the nation\u2019s economic recovery, providing the essential passenger and cargo connectivity that people and businesses across the nation rely on.\u201d Earlier this year, healthcare campaigner Dr John Lister accused Branson\u2019s Virgin healthcare group of playing a \u201cparasitic role in the NHS, fragmenting services and poaching NHS-trained staff and undermining nearby NHS trusts\u201d. Virgin Care had been awarded \u00a32bn worth of NHS and local authority healthcare deals, but paid no corporate tax in the UK as it operated at a loss. The company is ultimately controlled by Virgin Group Holdings in the BVI. Virgin Group told the Guardian that \u00a32bn was the maximum Virgin Care would be paid to fund the delivery of health and care services from 2010 until 2027. \u201cIt is not profit, it is revenue and the vast majority of this will be paid in salaries to more than 7,000 health and social care staff, which includes more than 1,300 nurses, around 100 doctors and 400 other health staff,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cThe Virgin Group has invested more than \u00a375m into Virgin Care and neither Richard, nor the Virgin Group have ever taken a penny out of the NHS, nor do they intend to do so. All monies received have been reinvested back into paying for delivering services as well as being invested in transformation projects to improve the NHS. Richard and everyone at the Virgin Group are immensely proud of the Virgin Care team who have, like everyone else in the NHS, been going above and beyond in this time of crisis.\u201d Branson, who often drapes himself in the Union flag and last year had Virgin Atlantic planes painted with a range of mascots carrying the flag, claims he moved to his private 30-hectare Necker Island, part of the BVI archipelago, to take advantage of the weather rather than the tax breaks. \u201cI have not left Britain for tax reasons but for my love of the beautiful British Virgin Islands and in particular Necker Island,\u201d he said in a now-deleted blog post when his Caribbean tax domicile was revealed in 2013. \u201cI have been very fortunate to accumulate so much wealth in my career, more than I need in my lifetime and would not live somewhere I don\u2019t want to for tax reasons.\u201d At the nadir of the stock market rout last month, Branson moved his $1.1bn stake in Virgin Galactic Holdings, his space tourism for billionaires business, from the US state of Delaware to the BVI. US regulatory filings show the transfer was made on 16 March \u2013 that day the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst one-day point drop in history. A spokesperson said: \u201cThis is as an internal re-organisation that has no effect on our ownership interest.\u201d Virgin Group said the company paid all of corporate taxes due in the UK and the other countries in which it operates. The company\u2019s tax strategy statement states: \u201cWe invest significant resources in managing and monitoring our tax risk to ensure that we pay the right amount of tax.\u201d Dividends sent to Branson on Necker island are not subject to any taxes. Over a 22-year period, he collected \u00a3306m in dividends from Virgin Trains before losing the franchise for the west coast main line last year. Loss-making Virgin Atlantic has not paid a dividend in recent years, but in 2014 it paid shareholders \u00a387.9m. Branson is not the only member of the tax efficient wealthy elite seeking to benefit from the government\u2019s furlough scheme. Sir Philip Green is asking the taxpayer to support 14,500 employees at Arcadia, the fashion empire that includes Topshop. Tottenham Hotspur football club, which is majority-owned by Bahamas-based billionaire Joe Lewis, has put hundreds of its non-playing staff on the furlough scheme. Newcastle\u2019s billionaire owner, Mike Ashley, has also put Newcastle\u2019s non-football staff on furlough and applied for the government\u2019s support. Luke Hildyard, who campaigns against executive excess at the High Pay Centre, said: \u201cAt a time when the government is struggling to fund the NHS and support low and middle income earners hit by the economic shutdown, it would be unthinkable to commit hundreds of millions of pounds to an effective bailout for billionaire Richard Branson and multibillion dollar corporation Delta Airlines. \u201cIf Branson and Delta can\u2019t find the money to fund Virgin Atlantic through this period themselves, they should have to accept a loss and a dilution of their shareholding, with the company moving into part public ownership. \u201cThe 2008-09 financial crisis should have taught us that lavishing public money on big businesses, often ones with questionable social and environmental records, without any conditions attached would be a big mistake.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 16 April 2020 to include statements from Virgin Group, concerning the activities of Virgin Care and Virgin Atlantic, that were received after publication. The sentence referring to Virgin Australia was also amended to make clear that Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Group has only a 10% stake in that company, while the reference to dividends from Virgin Trains was also amended to explain these were paid over a 22-year period. Virgin Group also pointed out that the airlines are independent businesses whose executive teams and boards lead any discussion on future support.",

If ministers are allowed to dodge tough questions, there\u2019s no great point in asking them. I note an increasing tendency on the part of this government to answer all questions about relativities with answers based on absolutes. This isn\u2019t good enough.</p> <p>For example, health professionals tell us that the available PPE is, relative to their demand for it, inadequate. Yet when questioned ministers say that \u201c\u00a3X million has been spent on PPE\u201d, and that \u201cY million pieces have been delivered/are on order\u201d. The health professionals and the ministers are almost certainly both right, simply because they are addressing different questions.</p> <p>Ministers need to be pressed on the tougher questions: is the current spending sufficient? Is the current availability of PPE sufficient? And if not, why not?</p> <p>Answering questions of sufficiency with statistics of spending is not a new phenomenon. The cuts which led the NHS to its present vulnerable state are typically answered with statistics about \u201ctoday\u2019s record-breaking spending levels\u201d; similarly, ministers answer questions about the provision of state education, policing, probation, funding of local government etc with answers based on current \u201crecord-breaking\u201d spending levels. But the important questions need to focus on whether the spending translates into services sufficient for the demands made upon them.</p> <p>Let us ensure not only that ministers are asked the tougher questions, but that they are pressed to answer the questions posed, rather than the questions they know they can answer.<br><strong>Adrian Darnell</strong><br><em>Durham</em></p> <p>\u2022 In light of the now appalling death toll of around 1,000 deaths a day, Marina Hyde wonders with acerbic courtesy \u201cif we might have expected better\u201d of our government in the decisions made in response to the coronavirus crisis. Well, I would think so. They might like to have a look at New Zealand \u2013 in a population of 5 million, there have been four deaths so far, and just over 1,300 confirmed cases. There is relentless testing and contact tracing, within a lockdown managed with outstanding, humane and lucid leadership that we can only dream of here.</p> <p>The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has stated that she never considered for one moment the idea of herd immunity, and she acted decisively and rapidly on the data coming in from other countries to leap into a much more comprehensive response at a much earlier point in the curve than many of those countries. It\u2019s still early days, but it is the case that New Zealand and the UK started lockdown on almost the same day, and that New Zealand\u2019s four deaths so far would translate into fewer than 60 deaths in our own population of 67 million.<br><strong>Felicity Laurence</strong><br><em>Hastings, East Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 I watch with despair the daily briefings, where politicians are dealt with deferentially by the media. They seem to be grateful to be allowed a comeback question even though the response to their initial question has been at best nebulous. The press should be holding these people to account. Can I suggest that journalists focus on just one question per day that gets to the nub of the matter, and pursue it relentlessly until it is addressed properly.<br><strong>Tom Kenny</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The acclamation of healthcare workers as \u201cheroes\u201d is politically convenient but disturbing. There is no heroism in doing a job, even a stressful one, under reasonable working conditions. What makes the work heroic (as indeed it is) is the danger to life, a consequence of dismal failure at government level to provide adequate protection. Headline figures on numbers of delivered items are a predictable and tiresome distraction \u2013 what is 5 million if 50 million are needed?</p> <p>We are well behind the curve on testing, so the published incidence figures are likely to be a gross underestimate \u2013 apart from the rather inconvenient death statistics, which cannot be massaged away. We are also meant to be on a \u201cwar\u201d footing, but have a parliament on holiday. I think a little more is going to be needed than weekly applause.<br><strong>Philip Barber</strong><br><em>Consultant respiratory physician, Manchester University NHS foundation trust</em></p> <p>\u2022 When Matt Hancock stops patting himself on the back over the PPE crisis (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/10/matt-hancock-urges-public-not-to-overuse-ppe\" title=\"\">NHS workers angered at Hancock\u2019s warning not to overuse PPE</a>, 10 April), he might like to consider why he had to \u201ccreate a whole new logistics network, essentially from scratch\u201d. I suggest that the NHS is no longer a national health service but just a vast multitude of competing cost centres, with no strategy other than to meet their own annual financial constraints, held together as a service by its dedicated staff, still honouring Aneurin Bevan\u2019s vision.</p> <p>As for a new logistics network (the previous national service having been dismantled), perhaps he could have looked to cooperate with any number of national warehousing and delivery services, not just Royal Mail, DHL, etc, but also the supermarket chains, all of whom have timed delivery services and navigation systems, and probably have an address list considerably larger than the 58,000 he quoted.<br><strong>Tony Winters</strong><br><em>Benson, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Just as I heard that Matt Hancock was accusing NHS staff of \u201coverusing\u201d or \u201cmisusing\u201d PPE, I got a text from my daughter, who is an A&amp;E doctor in Liverpool.

      "bodyText": "Marina Hyde (With 1,000 deaths a day, our leaders should be facing far tougher questions, 10 April) and your editorial (The Guardian view on coronavirus: as the death toll mounts so do the questions, 10 April) share a common theme. If ministers are allowed to dodge tough questions, there\u2019s no great point in asking them. I note an increasing tendency on the part of this government to answer all questions about relativities with answers based on absolutes. This isn\u2019t good enough. For example, health professionals tell us that the available PPE is, relative to their demand for it, inadequate. Yet when questioned ministers say that \u201c\u00a3X million has been spent on PPE\u201d, and that \u201cY million pieces have been delivered/are on order\u201d. The health professionals and the ministers are almost certainly both right, simply because they are addressing different questions. Ministers need to be pressed on the tougher questions: is the current spending sufficient? Is the current availability of PPE sufficient? And if not, why not? Answering questions of sufficiency with statistics of spending is not a new phenomenon. The cuts which led the NHS to its present vulnerable state are typically answered with statistics about \u201ctoday\u2019s record-breaking spending levels\u201d; similarly, ministers answer questions about the provision of state education, policing, probation, funding of local government etc with answers based on current \u201crecord-breaking\u201d spending levels. But the important questions need to focus on whether the spending translates into services sufficient for the demands made upon them. Let us ensure not only that ministers are asked the tougher questions, but that they are pressed to answer the questions posed, rather than the questions they know they can answer. Adrian Darnell Durham \u2022 In light of the now appalling death toll of around 1,000 deaths a day, Marina Hyde wonders with acerbic courtesy \u201cif we might have expected better\u201d of our government in the decisions made in response to the coronavirus crisis. Well, I would think so. They might like to have a look at New Zealand \u2013 in a population of 5 million, there have been four deaths so far, and just over 1,300 confirmed cases. There is relentless testing and contact tracing, within a lockdown managed with outstanding, humane and lucid leadership that we can only dream of here. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has stated that she never considered for one moment the idea of herd immunity, and she acted decisively and rapidly on the data coming in from other countries to leap into a much more comprehensive response at a much earlier point in the curve than many of those countries. It\u2019s still early days, but it is the case that New Zealand and the UK started lockdown on almost the same day, and that New Zealand\u2019s four deaths so far would translate into fewer than 60 deaths in our own population of 67 million. Felicity Laurence Hastings, East Sussex \u2022 I watch with despair the daily briefings, where politicians are dealt with deferentially by the media. They seem to be grateful to be allowed a comeback question even though the response to their initial question has been at best nebulous. The press should be holding these people to account. Can I suggest that journalists focus on just one question per day that gets to the nub of the matter, and pursue it relentlessly until it is addressed properly. Tom Kenny London \u2022 The acclamation of healthcare workers as \u201cheroes\u201d is politically convenient but disturbing. There is no heroism in doing a job, even a stressful one, under reasonable working conditions. What makes the work heroic (as indeed it is) is the danger to life, a consequence of dismal failure at government level to provide adequate protection. Headline figures on numbers of delivered items are a predictable and tiresome distraction \u2013 what is 5 million if 50 million are needed? We are well behind the curve on testing, so the published incidence figures are likely to be a gross underestimate \u2013 apart from the rather inconvenient death statistics, which cannot be massaged away. We are also meant to be on a \u201cwar\u201d footing, but have a parliament on holiday. I think a little more is going to be needed than weekly applause. Philip Barber Consultant respiratory physician, Manchester University NHS foundation trust \u2022 When Matt Hancock stops patting himself on the back over the PPE crisis (NHS workers angered at Hancock\u2019s warning not to overuse PPE, 10 April), he might like to consider why he had to \u201ccreate a whole new logistics network, essentially from scratch\u201d. I suggest that the NHS is no longer a national health service but just a vast multitude of competing cost centres, with no strategy other than to meet their own annual financial constraints, held together as a service by its dedicated staff, still honouring Aneurin Bevan\u2019s vision. As for a new logistics network (the previous national service having been dismantled), perhaps he could have looked to cooperate with any number of national warehousing and delivery services, not just Royal Mail, DHL, etc, but also the supermarket chains, all of whom have timed delivery services and navigation systems, and probably have an address list considerably larger than the 58,000 he quoted. Tony Winters Benson, Oxfordshire \u2022 Just as I heard that Matt Hancock was accusing NHS staff of \u201coverusing\u201d or \u201cmisusing\u201d PPE, I got a text from my daughter, who is an A&amp;E doctor in Liverpool. She waited a long time for the proper equipment, and has been reusing equipment that was supposed to be single-use and disposable. More recently, staff were finally measured for proper masks, and when hers arrived it was the wrong size. There was nothing else, so she was told she had no choice but to use it. Does Matt Hancock think that her lack of proper equipment may have contributed to the NHS now having another frontline doctor at home ill? Amanda Baker Edinburgh \u2022 In the space of one empathy-free, blame-shifting sentence \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m sorry if people feel that there have been failings\u201d (11 April) \u2013 when pressed to apologise for the shortage of PPE for NHS staff, Priti Patel perfectly illustrated why the policy of letting her nowhere near the daily coronavirus press briefings should have continued. Rob Sykes Oxford \u2022 Boris Johnson did not \u201ctake one for the team\u201d as his father claims (Boris Johnson waved thanks to NHS staff as he left intensive care, 10 April). It is possible that Johnson caught Covid-19 through his recklessness in continuing to shake hands with people when the early signs of this disease were emerging, combined with his subsequent failure to follow social distancing advice adequately. To claim the prime minister somehow sacrificed himself for the greater good is a pre-emptive, blatant attempt to deflect blame in what must surely follow \u2013 a thorough inquiry into whether the deaths of so many people were avoidable. We must not fall for it.

Alok Sharma, the business secretary, revealed the lack of progress as pressure mounted on officials and leading banks to speed up the processing of loan applications before thousands of businesses go bust. Sunak has reacted to criticism of slow progress by recruiting former Bank of England adviser Richard Sharp as a consultant with a brief to speed up the processing of rescue loans. Sharp, a former Goldman Sachs banker who was Sunak\u2019s boss during the chancellor\u2019s time at the investment bank, was a member of the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee working with the new governor, Andrew Bailey. Sunak expects to announce Sharp\u2019s appointment this week. He also expects to finalise plans for an extension of the loan scheme to include businesses with a turnover above \u00a3500m, including doubling the interest-free sums available to businesses to \u00a350m. Sharma told Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cThe latest figure that I have is around 4,200, and just over \u00a3800m has gone out. \u201cI have spent the last couple of days talking directly to some of the largest lenders who are part of this scheme and I have been very clear to say to them that we need to get money out of the door as quickly as possible. They understand that \u2026 we have set this up at pace and everyone is literally working around the clock.\u201d When challenged that the current numbers equated to a success rate of just 1.4%, he did not dispute this figure. Asked whether he was worried, the business secretary said: \u201cWell, of course. It is not just a question of me being worried \u2013 I completely understand the concerns that businesses have.\u201d On Wednesday the British Chambers of Commerce said only 1% of firms responding to its survey had managed to secure a loan under the scheme, while 7% had received one of the grants offered to small businesses by the Treasury. On 3 April, Sunak loosened the criteria for CBILS loans and banned banks from asking for personal guarantees from small businesses seeking help. On Sunday the Observer reported that Ed Miliband had urged Sharma to overhaul the scheme after low take-up by small and medium-sized firms. The shadow business secretary said thousands of companies were on the verge of collapse, and that without a bigger commitment from the government, they were likely to go bust. \u201cThe risks of doing too little, too slowly to help businesses are much greater for the long-term health of the economy than the risks of doing too much, too quickly,\u201d he said. A lack of available bank staff is understood to have held up initial applications, despite the fact that bank employees are considered key workers.",

The PM mentioned two immigrant nurses in particular, who had monitored him round-the-clock for 48 hours in the ICU. He said the NHS \u201cis unconquerable. It is powered by love.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, refused to apologise over the delay in providing NHS frontline staff with PPE</strong>, after the Royal College of Nursing said that, as a last resort, staff might have to refuse treating patients if they did not have appropriate protection.<br></li> \n   <li>Hancock announced <strong>the development of a new contact-tracing app</strong> that would let people enter their personal health data, recent contacts and coronavirus symptoms, as the government got under increased pressure to announce plans for an exit strategy from the lockdown. </li> \n   <li><strong>The Scottish government is set to publish data on the deaths of elderly care home residents</strong> from Covid-19 after disclosing more than a third of Scotland\u2019s care homes have had coronavirus cases.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>This is all from me, and this blog will now wrap up.

      "bodyText": "Here a brief overview of the latest key developments: The toll of reported hospital deaths in the UK has passed 10,000, up from 9,875 the previous day. The daily rise of reported hospital deaths has thus slowed down, but as always, a delay in the reporting as well as delayed test results for those who have died prevent clear-cut insights into the behaviour of the curve. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, was discharged from hospital today and released a video address the nation, in which he thanked NHS staff for saving his life. The PM mentioned two immigrant nurses in particular, who had monitored him round-the-clock for 48 hours in the ICU. He said the NHS \u201cis unconquerable. It is powered by love.\u201d The health secretary, Matt Hancock, refused to apologise over the delay in providing NHS frontline staff with PPE, after the Royal College of Nursing said that, as a last resort, staff might have to refuse treating patients if they did not have appropriate protection. Hancock announced the development of a new contact-tracing app that would let people enter their personal health data, recent contacts and coronavirus symptoms, as the government got under increased pressure to announce plans for an exit strategy from the lockdown. The Scottish government is set to publish data on the deaths of elderly care home residents from Covid-19 after disclosing more than a third of Scotland\u2019s care homes have had coronavirus cases. This is all from me, and this blog will now wrap up. For more updates, please head over to our global coronavirus blog. Thanks for reading and writing in, be well. The Liberal Democrats have called for \u201ctransparency\u201d over how data in the new NHS coronavirus app the health secretary Matt Hancock announced earlier will be used. Acting party co-leader Ed Davey said: \u201cProposals laid out today to allow people to voluntarily provide data through an NHS app to improve contact tracing are likely to be crucial in enabling the UK to move out of the lockdown at some point in the future. This is therefore a welcome step to protect public health. \u201cHowever, there must be complete transparency around how the data will be stored and used, coupled with watertight guarantees that data will be anonymised, kept for the shortest possible time, and won\u2019t be shared between government departments. \u201cAny proposal on the use of mobile phone data or other technology to track people must also be scrutinised properly by MPs before a final decision is made, further strengthening our argument that parliament should be recalled urgently.\u201d There will be enough drugs to treat critically ill patients in intensive care despite fears of drug shortages, senior medics have said, but also warned that people should obey social distancing rules in order to reduce the burden on NHS resources. Amid reports that key medicines at some intensive care units were in short supply, intensive care consultant Ron Daniels told the BBC that quality of care for all patients \u2013 not just coronavirus sufferers \u2013 would \u201clikely be lower\u201d as a result. But Alison Pittard, dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, said that the NHS was not going to run out of medicines to treat patients and that care will not be compromised. She told the PA Media news agency that medics have been issued new guidance telling them to use alternatives which were \u201cperfectly safe for patients\u201d. Pittard added: \u201cWe are not going to run out of drugs to treat patients, that\u2019s the bottom line. \u201cWe may do things differently, but patient care won\u2019t be compromised because we have to change the choice of drug.\u201d Labour leader Keir Starmer reacted with an emotional tweet to the news that more than 10,000 people had died from Covid-19 in the UK and appeared to be urging the government to \u201cremember the people behind the numbers\u201d. Jeane Freeman, the Scottish health secretary, has announced that social care workers in Scotland would receive this year\u2019s pay rise of 3.3% immediately, and backdated to 1 April, instead of waiting for protracted negotiations with ministers and local authorities. She said the increase for staff providing direct adult support would reach at least the real living wage rate of \u00a39.30 per hour, including any hours worked for sleepovers. Extra funding would be provided to charities and independent care providers to ensure staff had sick pay or were self-isolating. In more uplifting news, Michael, a reader from Warwick, wrote in to report a somewhat unorthodox interpretation of the new police powers. \u201cI and my family were minding our own business during our daily exercise session when two tough looking police, without warning, forcefully thrust an Easter egg into my grumpy toddler\u2019s hands. Suffice to say her mood improved. Many thanks to Warwickshire police,\u201d he wrote. Reacting to the death toll update from No 10, James Naismith, Director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute and University of Oxford, emphasised that the lowered rise in deaths reported today were likely down to delayed reporting. \u201cBased on experience of previous weeks, today\u2019s lower number could well arise from reporting delays due to the weekend and bank holiday,\u201d he said. \u201cIf so there may be higher daily numbers next week as delayed reported deaths end up in future announcements. \u201cThe UK, with over 10,000 deaths, is one of the worst-hit countries in Europe. Even this number is an underestimate due to lags in reporting and counting only hospital deaths. We are not in a macabre competition with other countries, every death, here or elsewhere, leaves a grieving family. We are only approaching the end of the beginning.\u201d Naismith added that, he expected the government, before it was taking the next steps, \u201cto take and share the most up to date advice from a range of experts across all relevant fields, to identify what we can do better and to see what lessons from elsewhere can be applied here in time to make a difference.\u201d The Scottish government is to publish data on the deaths of elderly care home residents from Covid-19 after disclosing more than a third of Scotland\u2019s care homes have had coronavirus cases. Jeane Freeman, the Scottish health secretary, sought to douse a secrecy row over the data by confirming the Care Inspectorate had been told of Covid-19 cases in 406 adult care homes, 37% of the total. The inspectorate, the government agency responsible for inspecting the sector, came under fire from Labour and the Conservatives on Saturday after telling the BBC it had to file a freedom of information request if it wanted detailed figures on deaths and suspected infections at care homes. Under new emergency laws introduced by the Scottish government, backed by the Scottish Greens and the Scottish information commissioner, public agencies now have up to 60 working days to reply to FoI requests \u2013 three times the previous legal limit. There has been growing anxiety about a surge of Covd-19 deaths in care homes, with several homes experiencing significant outbreaks involving multiple deaths, amid continuing rows about their access to protective equipment and GPs refusing to visit. More than 50 care home residents, many of whom have serious underlying health conditions, are thought to have died from Covid-19. Speaking after disclosing that 566 people had now died in Scotland from the virus, with 24 further fatalities in the last 24 hours, Freeman said more detailed figures on care homes would now be published this week. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said we are determined to make sure that the information we have is shared with you as transparently as we possibly can. But it\u2019s really important that we\u2019re confident about the robustness and accuracy of that information,\u201d she said. The latest national figures for Scotland, which will be revised after further cases are confirmed following the Easter bank holiday, showed a total of 5,912 positive cases, up by 322 from Saturday, and 221 people in intensive care, up by nine. Predictions regarding deaths \u201care not possible\u201d, Hancock and Doyle say, as it all depended on the behaviour of the British population. Asked whether the government would have to ask itself whether it had the right policies in place in terms of NHS staffing and funding but also immigration after the crisis, Hancock says his party had brought in the NHS visa, and wanted to \u201cpay tribute\u201d to immigrants who have \u201cgiven their lives working in the NHS\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m delighted we went into this crisis with record numbers of people and record numbers of funding in the NHS,\u201d he adds. Pressed on whether the UK\u2019s response to the crisis and the ordering and distribution of PPE and other vital equipment have been too slow, Hancock says he doesn\u2019t \u201cquite agree with that\u201d. \u201cWe had the stockpiles, we went into this with the stockpiles\u201d, he said, adding the challenge was distribution, and that now used up stockpiles had to be \u201creplenished\u201d. Hancock says it is \u201cincumbent\u201d on the government \u201cto learn everything we can so we can better protect people in the future.\u201d He says there is currently no advice on how long the PM will need to recover fully and that the government is working \u201cincredibly efficiently\u201d in the meantime. Pressed on testing in care homes and asked whether he can guarantee the care sector that they can get regular tests, Hancock says he can, \u201cthat is coming\u201d. \u201cThis is an area of incredibly high importance,\u201d he says. He added that one of the things the country has succeeded in in this crisis is that people have recognised that care staff are on the frontline as much as NHS staff. Answering a follow-up question on testing in care homes and the timescale of testing becoming available to them, Hancock says the testing was being rolled out \u201cright now\u201d. Asked whether he wants to apologise to healthcare staff in light of calls by the Royal College of Nursing to refuse treatment to patients if no appropriate PPE is available, Hancock says the government is \u201cworking night and day\u201d to ensure they \u201cget this right\u201d, but does not apologise. Asked about the delivery of PPE, Hancock says \u201cwe won\u2019t rest\u201d until everyone gets the necessary PPE delivered, and praised procurement experts. Asked about reports that the UK could have the highest death toll in Europe, Hancock responds that \u201cthe future of this virus is unknowable\u201d. Doyle adds that every single one of the over 10,000 deaths is \u201can absolute tragedy\u201d. Doyle starts out by sharing some data on the reduced use of transport and motor vehicles. In terms of new UK cases, 838 NHS staff had tested positive yesterday and today and, she said. The rate of people in hospital beds in London is stabilising, Doyle said, but in other regions such as the North West and the North East trends were worsening now, she said. Hancock was speaking at a desk bearing the message: \u201cStay home this Easter\u201d. He has now handed over to Yvonne Doyle, medical director and director of health protection for Public Health England. 121,000 PPE gowns have been delivered over the past week, Hancok says. \u201cThank you to all involved in the herculean effort on PPE,\u201d he says. He says he wants to outline the next steps for tracing infections via an app, that will allow people to log their symptoms anonymously, data only to be used by NHS staff. The app is being tested, Hancock says. Today I wanted to outline the next step: a new NHS app for contact tracing. If you become unwell with the symptoms of coronavirus, you can securely tell this new NHS app and the app will then send an alert anonymously to other app users that you\u2019ve been in significant contact with over the past few days, even before you had symptoms, so that they know and can act accordingly. All data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards, and would only be used for NHS care and research, and we won\u2019t hold it any longer than it\u2019s needed. And as part of our commitment to transparency we\u2019ll be publishing the source code, too. We\u2019re already testing this app and as we do this we\u2019re working closely with the world\u2019s leading tech companies and renowned experts in digital safety and ethics.\u201d Hancock said six further temporary Nightingale hospitals are being built across England, which was possible partly because of a \u201crecord number\u201d of 9,775 ventilators that was now available. Over 5,000 former staff were now back on the NHS frontline, he added. \u201cWe are increasing the amount of PPE, and I\u2019m glad to say that there are now record amounts in the system,\u201d he says. \u201cToday marks a sombre day\u201d, Hancock says, as the death toll has topped 10,000 in the UK. A total of 19,945 people had now been admitted to hospital, he says, which means about half of all hospital admissions have died. Today is \u201cextra tough\u201d, he says, and thanks people for the part they are playing but warns against complacency. An additional 150 critical care beds are now available, he says. The government\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing has just started, today led by Matt Hancock. Hancock says he hopes everyone has seen the PM\u2019s \u201cmessage of love\u201d, and that this will have shown people that the NHS cares for all. The prime minister praises the NHS staff who have been taking care of him during his stay in St Thomas\u2019 hospital. He left the south London hospital after a week of treatment and will go to Chequers to continue his recovery: Around half of the A&amp;E staff at the Royal Gwent hospital in Newport, Wales, one of the worst-affected areas in the UK for coronavirus, have tested positive for Covid-19. According to consultant Tim Rogerson, 50% of the consultants and nurses at the Royal Gwent hospital\u2019s accident and emergency department have tested positive. Rogerson said he had tested positive himself. The doctor revealed the statistics in a video shared by the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board - as he said he had also tested positive for the virus and had been off work since experiencing \u201cmild to moderate\u201d coronavirus symptoms. 1,453 people have tested positive for Covid-19 at the health board, which includes Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Monmouthshire, Newport and Torfaen, making it the biggest cluster in Wales and one of the worst in the UK. \u201cThis has obviously happened despite all of the PPE that we\u2019ve got and all the hand washing that we\u2019re doing but it\u2019s probably just a likely thing that\u2019s going to happen when we\u2019re faced with such numbers of patients coming in with coronavirus,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably inevitable and it is proving a challenge when it\u2019s coming to staffing the department when we are facing these numbers coming through.\u201d Rogerson also urged members of the public to stay indoors over the Easter weekend as breaching social distancing guidelines would hit the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit capacity in \u201ctwo weeks\u2019 time\u201d. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s difficult, we really do want people to abide by the guidance, to stay at home and protect the NHS,\u201d he said. The Department of Health and Social Care has updated the total number of deaths from Covid-19 of people in hospitals in the UK to 10,612, as of 5pm Saturday, a daily rise of 737. On Saturday, there had been 9,875 hospital deaths recorded in the UK, with a day-on-day rise of 917. As of 9am 12 April, 352,974 tests have concluded, with 18,000 tests on 11 April, the department said. 282,374 people have been tested of which 84,279 tested positive. While the daily increase of deaths has slowed, it is unclear how high the actual daily death toll is, as many deaths are being reported days or even weeks after they have occurred. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has shared a message of reassurance on Twitter, announcing a citywide mental health and wellbeing movement in the capital aimed at supporting Londoners who feel \u201cworried, anxious or lonely\u201d. The website of this new campaign, Thrive LDN, contains a message directly addressed to \u201cyoung Londoners\u201d, urging them \u201cto stay apart and keep our physical distance to ensure we stop the spread of the virus.\u201d Hi all, this is Jedidajah Otte, taking over from my colleague Jessica Murray. If you want to share updates or a story please get in touch via email or on Twitter. In his video posted to Twitter, Johnson praised the general public for adhering to lockdown measures and the staff who cared for him when \u201cthings could have gone either way\u201d. \u201cWhen the natural world is at its loveliest and the outdoor world seems so inviting, I can only imagine how tough it has been to follow the rules on social distancing,\u201d he said. Although we mourn everyday those who are taken from us in such numbers, and though the struggle is by no means over, we are now making progress in this incredible national battle against coronavirus. A fight we never picked against an enemy we still don\u2019t entirely understand. He said the British public have formed a \u201chuman shield\u201d around the NHS and that he had seen the pressure the service is under over the past seven days, thanking the wide range of staff who continued to work throughout the outbreak. \u201cIt is thanks to that devotion, that duty, and that love, that out NHS has been unbeatable.\u201d He thanked a number of staff members by name, including two nurses from New Zealand and Portugal who stood beside his bedside for 48 hours, \u201cwhen things could have gone either way\u201d, he said. Boris Johnson has posted a video on Twitter, praising NHS staff for saving his life, after he left hospital earlier today. He said: \u201cIt is hard to find the words to express my debt to the NHS for saving my life. \u201cThe efforts of millions of people across this country to stay home are worth it. \u201cTogether we will overcome this challenge, as we have overcome so many challenges in the past. #StayHomeSaveLives.\u201d University Hospitals Birmingham has recorded the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths for any NHS trust in England. As of 5pm on 11 April, the trust had announced 404 deaths, according to figures from NHS England. Four other trusts have announced between 200 and 300 deaths. They are London North West university healthcare NHS trust (272 deaths), the Royal Free London NHS foundation trust (267), King\u2019s College hospital NHS foundation trust (237) and Barts health NHS trust (230). A further 22 trusts have announced between 100 and 200 deaths. Of the 657 new hospital deaths announced on Sunday by NHS England, 121 occurred on 11 April while 531 took place between 1 April and 10 April. The remaining five deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 26 March. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including new deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for post-mortem tests to be processed, and for data from the tests to be validated. The figures published today by NHS England show that 8 April currently has the highest total for the most hospital deaths occurring in a single day (709) although this could change in future updates. Head teachers say the Department for Education\u2019s private provider is still failing to deliver the food vouchers designed to replace free school meals for poor families during the Covid-19 lockdown, despite the DfE having \u201creassured\u201d them that delays would be resolved. The DfE contracted Edenred, a French voucher vendor, to supply email codes to families with children eligible for free school meals in England. But last week the Guardian reported that families and schools have not been issued the voucher codes, worth \u00a315 a week for each child, and report frustration and bureaucracy in dealing with Edenred. One teacher said she spent more than \u00a350 on calls to Edenred\u2019s customer helpline, before discovering that the company had opened a free-phone number. Others say that the company\u2019s online platform has been frozen and complain of unanswered emails and slow responses, leading the DfE to pledge to work \u201ctirelessly\u201d to clear the backlog. But during the Easter weekend many families had still failed to receive vouchers, with Edenred telling those who rang to complain: \u201cWe have been experiencing enormous traffic to the site.\u201d Edenred told one teacher on Saturday that it had processed 500,000 voucher codes so far - which left 800,000 still to go, the teacher pointed out. The UK coronavirus death toll has passed 10,000. The combined figures from England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland make it clear that the official total, when it comes later today, will take the UK past 10,000 deaths. As of yesterday, the UK had 9,875 confirmed deaths of patients who had contracted Covid-19. Almost 5,000 former staff are back on the NHS frontline after coming out of retirement to support the coronavirus effort. NHS England said on Sunday that the 4,800 returning doctors, nurses, midwives and other healthcare professionals in England are the first tranche of those returning to service, with another 10,300 joining them over the next fortnight. The NHS issued a callout for recent leavers, who left the profession within the past three years, to come back to help care for patients. The General Medical Council is helping to widen the search by extending its register, so that those who left the service between four and six years ago can also return. The Nursing and Midwifery Council is due to follow suit later this week with similar measures for nurses and midwives who left the profession four or five years ago. Ruth May, chief nursing officer for England, said: Given the scale of the task ahead, we cannot have too many doctors, nurses, midwives or other health and social care staff. If you would like to play your part supporting our colleagues at a time of need, it is not too late \u2013 your NHS still needs you. All returning staff have been given a full induction and training to help them hit the ground running. The number of deaths of patients with Covid-19 by region in England are as follows: East of England - 82 London - 130 Midlands - 125 North East &amp; Yorkshire - 107 North West - 94 South East - 73 South West - 46 NHS England said on Sunday a further 657 people have died in hospital in England after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total deaths there to 9,594. Patients were aged between 26 and 100 years old, and 42 of the 657 patients (aged between 30 and 98 years old) had no known underlying health condition. Their families have been informed. Historically, disease outbreaks have happened at a time of social inequality and discord, writes science journalist Laura Spinney. As the poor get poorer, the thinking goes, their baseline health suffers, making them more prone to infection. At the same time they are forced to move more, in search of work, and to gravitate to cities. The rich, meanwhile, have more to spend on luxuries, including products that hail from far-flung places. The world becomes more tightly connected through trade, and germs, people and luxury goods travel together along trade routes that connect cities. As the coronavirus pandemic continues to expose inequalities across the globe, Spinney explores whether inequality doesn\u2019t just make pandemics worse, but actually causes them. Northern Ireland has reported 11 more deaths associated with Covid-19, and 89 new cases. This takes the total number of deaths in the country to 118, and the total number of cases to 1,806. Hospital chief Dr Ian Abbs has praised the staff at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 who looked after the prime minister while he battled Covid-19. The chief executive at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019, said: I am incredibly proud of the staff who have cared for the prime minister and pleased that he is now able to continue his recovery at home. I want to pay tribute to the teams whose dedication, skill and compassion made this possible. It is a great credit to the exceptional professionalism of clinical teams, as well as everyone in the wider organisation, that we have been able to care for the prime minister so effectively, while continuing to deliver equally high standards of care to all of our patients. While it is right that we celebrate this good news, our thoughts turn immediately to those who still need our help at this time. On behalf of everyone at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019, I\u2019d ask that people stay home to help us save lives and protect the NHS. A further 18 deaths have been reported of people who had tested positive for Covid-19, taking the number of deaths in Wales to 369. There have been 367 new cases of Covid-19 in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 5,297, although the true number of cases is likely to be higher, Public Health Wales said. A further 24 people have died in Scotland after contracting coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths to 566. As of 2pm today, 31,114 Scottish tests have concluded 25,202 confirmed negative and 5,912 positive. That\u2019s 322 new cases compared to yesterday\u2019s figures. Rob Bryden and David Mitchell are among a series of comedians paying tribute to Goodies star Tim Brooke-Taylor, \u201cwho had years more joy to give.\u201d David Mitchell said: \u201cThis is terribly sad news. He was a wonderful comedian and a really lovely man and I feel honoured to have known and worked with him. \u201cThe world has been robbed - he had years more joy to give.\u201d Rob Bryden said he was \u201ca wonderful man\u201d, and he enjoyed \u201cmany happy times sat next to him on I\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t a Clue.\u201d Comedian Jack Dee, current host of I\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t a Clue, also paid tribute: Carrie Symonds, Boris Johnson\u2019s fiancee, said times \u201cwere very dark indeed\u201d as the prime minister battled coronavirus over the past week. In a series of tweets, she said: There were times last week that were very dark indeed. My heart goes out to all those in similar situations, worried sick about their loved ones. Thank you also to everyone who sent such kind messages of support. Today I\u2019m feeling incredibly lucky. Tributes are continuing to pour in for The Goodies star Tim Brooke-Taylor, who has died aged 79 after contracting coronavirus. His Goodies co-star Graeme Garden said he was \u201cterribly saddened by the loss of a dear colleague and close friend of over 50 years\u201d. He said in a statement: \u201cTim and I met at Cambridge University in the early 1960s and have enjoyed working together almost constantly from that time onwards, on radio, stage, and TV. \u201cHe was a funny, sociable, generous man who was a delight to work with. Audiences found him not only hilarious but also adorable. \u201cHis loss at this dreadful time is particularly hard to bear, and my thoughts are with Christine, Ben, Edward and their families.\u201d He was a regular panellist on BBC Radio 4\u2019s I\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t a Clue for over 40 years, and current host Jack Dee paid tribute: \u201cIt has come as devastating news to hear that Tim has succumbed to this dreadful virus \u2013 especially when we all thought he was recovering. \u201cTim was a delightful man and never anything but great company. \u201cIt\u2019s always heartbreaking to lose a loved one, but these times have created the cruellest of circumstances for that to happen in.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s fiancee, Carrie Symonds, has Tweeted her thanks to the NHS after the prime minister was discharged from hospital. \u201cI cannot thank our magnificent NHS enough,\u201d she said. \u201cThe staff at St Thomas\u2019 Hospital have been incredible. \u201cI will never, ever be able to repay you and I will never stop thanking you.\u201d Boris Johnson has been discharged from hospital, Downing Street has confirmed. A No 10 spokesman said: \u201cThe PM has been discharged from hospital to continue his recovery, at Chequers. \u201cOn the advice of his medical team, the PM will not be immediately returning to work. He wishes to thank everybody at St Thomas\u2019 for the brilliant care he has received. \u201cAll of his thoughts are with those affected by this illness.\u201d The prime minister was first admitted to hospital at 8pm on Sunday 5 April and then transferred to intensive care the following day after his symptoms worsened. He left the intensive care ward on Thursday evening and released a short statement on Saturday night praising staff at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London where he was being treated. \u201cI can\u2019t thank them enough, I owe them my life,\u201d he said. On Sunday morning, business secretary Alok Sharma said on Sky News that Johnson was \u201cin very good spirits\u201d and that he was \u201cwalking about a bit\u201d. Comedian and actor Tim Brooke-Taylor has died after contracting coronavirus, his agent has said. The 79-year-old was probably most famous as part of television comedy trio, The Goodies. His agent said in a statement: It is with great sadness that we announce Tim\u2019s death early today from Covid-19. Joining Footlights in 1960 took him to providing a huge variety of splendid entertainment \u2013 television, radio, theatre, film, books, DVDs, CDs, quizzes, etc \u2013 all of which he undertook with energy and a great sense of fun. We will remember him for so much but must just mention The Goodies and I\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t a Clue. He had, of course, many fans whom he always treated cheerfully even after long and exhausting rehearsals and recordings. He was an exceptional client and a pleasure to represent. We\u2019re grateful that we have so much of his work to view, read and listen to. In all the time with us and in all his showbiz work, he has been supported by Christine, his wife. Comedian and actor Marcus Brigstocke tweeted, \u201cThis is terribly sad news... God you made me laugh Tim. RIP you dear, daft, wonderful man.\u201d Meanwhile, Sioned Wiliam, Radio 4\u2019s commissioning editor for comedy, said: \u201cTim Brooke-Taylor had a long and distinguished career in comedy. \u201cHe was charming, quick witted and a hugely skilful comic. He was much loved both by our listeners and by his colleagues, and he will be sorely missed by all at Radio 4.\u201d Football legend Sir Kenny Dalglish has left hospital after testing positive for coronavirus, and thanked the \u201cabsolutely brilliant\u201d NHS workers who treated him. The 69-year-old was admitted to hospital on Wednesday for treatment on gallstones, including intravenous antibiotics. Dalglish underwent a coronavirus test which returned a positive diagnosis for Covid-19. He did not show any symptoms and is now recovering in self-isolation at home. \u201cI\u2019d just like to thank the doctors, nurses and all the staff for looking after me,\u201d Dalglish wrote in the Sunday Post. \u201cThey were absolutely brilliant. \u201cPeople may think the Dalglish name got me in and got me the best of care,\u201d he added. \u201cNot so. I was looked after because the NHS staff treat everyone the same. They look upon everyone as human beings.\u201d Tributes have been paid to two Filipino hospital porters thought to have died after contracting coronavirus in Oxford. The men, named locally as Oscar King Jr and Elbert Rico, were described as \u201cpopular and hard-working\u201d members of the team at the city\u2019s John Radcliffe hospital. Both men were married to members of the nursing team at the hospital, the trust said. King Jr, believed to have worked at the hospital for 10 years, was described as a \u201cbeloved friend, loving husband, and devoted father\u201d to his 10-year-old daughter. His wife had also been taken to hospital after suffering severe symptoms, according to a GoFundMe page. A page set up for Rico said he had worked for the hospital since coming to the UK in 2004, adding that he \u201cloved the work that he did\u201d. \u201cHe was always hard working and would prioritise others\u2019 needs firsts. He would walk around the hospital with a smile on his face and very rarely would he call in sick from work.\u201d The news comes days after the death of Filipino nurse Leilani Dayrit, who worked at St Cross Hospital in Rugby. A Commons library report published last year found that more than 18,000 Filipinos work in the NHS, third only to the numbers from Britain and India. The Philippines also provided more nurses and clinical support staff than any other country outside of the UK, the study found. Lola McEvoy, NHS organiser for the GMB union, said the porters\u2019 deaths was \u201cawful, awful news\u201d. She added: Support staff in our NHS are risking their lives to protect us. The sacrifice to our country of those who have lost their lives must never be forgotten. Ministers\u2019 broken promises on PPE have exposed frontline workers to increased risk. Protective equipment is not just a precious resource \u2013 it\u2019s an absolute necessity to protect lives. Unison general secretary, Dave Prentis, said: \u201cStaff across health, care and key local services are facing huge risks and pressures. These deaths will heighten anxiety and show why the government must sort any problems with PPE supplies immediately.\u201d South Korea\u2019s ambassador to the UK has said mandating the use of face masks could help tackle the coronavirus outbreak in the UK. Enna Park told Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cThe Korean government made an official recommendation to wear a mask because from our experience we know that the mask helps reduce the risk of being infected and also transmitting. \u201cWe know that wearing a mask doesn\u2019t completely prevent [people] being infected or [the virus] from transmitting, but it helps.\u201d She also emphasised the importance of testing: \u201cThe main lesson we have learned is testing is very important. \u201cAt the beginning of our outbreak we encouraged medical institutes to develop the testing kits and we gave very quick approval, and we also promoted medical companies to produce the testing kits on the large scale so we built up a stockpile and it was the foundation of mass testing. \u201cOur strategy was test, trace and treat and it has worked so far.\u201d She went on: \u201cSo far we have conducted more than half a million tests so in terms of population per capita, Korea [is] the highest, the biggest testing country in the world.\u201d She described how South Korea uses information such as credit card transactions, CCTV and mobile phone GPS data to track down all suspected cases and their contacts for early medical intervention. Addressing the privacy concerns about using this technology, she said: \u201cThe law stipulates to what extent we can collect information and how we can use it [...] so we used that to check only relevant and anonymous information and disclosed only relevant and anonymous information to the public. \u201cPeople in Korea, they were willing to compromise their privacy to some extent for the sake of the greater good, for the sake of public health.\u201d There will be enough drugs to treat critically ill patients in intensive care despite fears of drug shortages, senior medics have said. Their comments come amid reports key medicines at some intensive care units were in short supply. Intensive care consultant Dr Ron Daniels told the BBC that the quality of care for all intensive care patients and not just coronavirus sufferers, will \u201clikely be lower\u201d as a result. But Dr Alison Pittard, dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, said that the NHS was not going to run out of medicines to treat patients and that care will not be compromised. She told PA Media that medics have been issued new guidance telling them to use alternatives, which were \u201cperfectly safe for patients\u201d. Pittard added: \u201cWe are not going to run out of drugs to treat patients, that\u2019s the bottom line. There may be shortages of specific drugs but there are always alternatives in the same class that although staff will need to slightly modify their practice, they will be perfectly safe for patients. We may do things differently, but patient care won\u2019t be compromised because we have to change the choice of drug. I want to reassure the public \u2013 we know what we are doing, we are working together, we know what the situation is, and we are making sure they are our first priority. Her comments come as she released a joint statement with leaders of the Intensive Care Society, Association of Anaesthetists and Royal College of Anaesthetists. However, the statement also warned that people should obey social distancing rules in order to reduce the burden on NHS resources. The Department of Health and Social Care said it had banned the \u201cparallel export\u201d of more than 100 medicines to keep supplies in the UK. Walsall council has become the latest local authority to close all access to cemeteries, citing \u201cgroups continuing to congregate despite government guidelines regarding social distancing\u201d. The council said in a statement: While recognising the disappointment and distress this may cause those that routinely visit and tend the resting place of lost loved ones, the closure has been deemed as necessary, as the battle with Covid-19 continues. Access to crematorium and cemeteries is now limited for funerals and cremations with a maximum of 10 people permitted in the funeral party. Healthcare worker Donna Campbell, who worked at the Velindre cancer centre in Cardiff, has died after testing positive for coronavirus, health officials said. Campbell, who was a healthcare support worker, died at the University Hospital Wales in Cardiff. Steve Ham, chief executive of Velindre university NHS trust, said: \u201cWe are devastated to have lost a member of the Velindre family. \u201cWe will always remember her as a dedicated, hard-working member of our nursing team who was proud to work for the NHS. \u201cFirst and foremost, we want to extend our deepest condolences to Donna\u2019s family and friends.\u201d A cross-party letter is calling on the UK government to ensure equitable access to any Covid-19 vaccine. The letter, signed by MPs and peers from all political parties in Westminster, asked the government to ensure any publicly funded vaccine is available on an open-access basis so developing countries can afford to purchase and produce the vaccine at a reasonable cost. Any pharmaceutical monopoly could see developing countries left behind, the letter said. The chair of the all-party parliamentary group on vaccinations for all, Dr Philippa Whitford MP, wrote the letter. She said: The UK government must work cooperatively with the rest of the world and ensure that any Covid-19 vaccine will not be patented, to create a monopoly, but allow equitable access across the world. Just as coronavirus does not see borders, it is absolutely crucial that the fight against the virus is a worldwide effort. The UK government should follow the lead of Costa Rica in supporting a global sharing or open access mechanism so that any patent rights are held by the World Health Organization. While this a humanitarian approach, it also makes sense from a public health perspective. A hospital trust has said it was forced to intervene with Cambridgeshire police after officers stopped staff on their way to work and told them NHS ID cards were insufficient evidence of essential travel. In its newsletter, seen by the Guardian, bosses at Cambridge University hospitals foundation trust said they had received reports from staff who had been \u201cstopped by the police on their way to work and asked to confirm if their travel was essential\u201d. The newsletter went on: When staff showed their NHS ID and said they were on their way into or from work, they were advised by the police officers that this was insufficient evidence of essential travel. Following these reports the trust has been in discussions with Cambridgeshire Constabulary. It has confirmed it will remind all police officers that such an explanation together with an NHS ID badge is sufficient evidence. Cambridgeshire police was forced to apologise on Friday after officers sent a tweet saying they had been checking \u201cnon-essential aisles\u201d of a local supermarket to make sure they were empty. A \u201cgiant of a man\u201d and \u201cfather figure\u201d to police officers on the Isle of Man has died after he contracted Covid-19. Retired sergeant Richard Lloyd, 57, died in hospital on Saturday, the second death on the island from the virus. A married father-of-one, Lloyd had strong connections with Merseyside police where he followed in the footsteps of his parents who served in the force, and where his son, Andrew, is currently a sergeant. He later moved to the Isle of Man to carry on his police service and went on to become head coach of the island\u2019s judo team. Tributes poured in for Lloyd, including from the island\u2019s Chief Constable Gary Roberts, who tweeted on Saturday: \u201cToday has been the saddest of my 36 yr police career. So many of us are heartbroken after the death of a friend, colleague and giant of a man, who has been taken by this wicked virus.\u201d His son Andrew tweeted: \u201cHe died alone but with a team of now traumatised medics. If 1 person stayed home, he\u2019d be alive. Stay home. Please.\u201d Ministers are resisting demands for an emergency recall of parliament to respond to urgent questions about the coronavirus outbreak. The Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has insisted MPs will return on 21 April, the date agreed before the Easter recess. MPs approved the Easter adjournment timings on 25 March, minutes before the chamber rose, at a time when the increasing impact of Covid-19 was clear. The motion was unopposed although several concerns were raised by opposition parties about their inability to scrutinise major decisions in this four-week period. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has demanded \u201curgent talks\u201d with the government to discuss how MPs can put questions to ministers given the rising death toll and concerns over personal protective equipment supplies to NHS staff, among other issues. He added parliament must be recalled \u201cas soon as possible\u201d when asked about the issue on Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge on Sunday. A letter signed by a cross-party group of MPs demanding an \u201cimmediate virtual recall of parliament\u201d has also been sent to Dominic Raab, who is deputising for prime minister Boris Johnson as he recovers from Covid-19. Talks involving commons speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the government, opposition parties and parliamentary officials are expected to continue this week about proposals for a \u201cvirtual parliament\u201d and what role technology can play as social distancing measures remain in place. But only the government can request the speaker to recall the commons. It is unclear whether a small group of MPs will still attend the chamber after recess, with others allowed to question ministers from their homes by webcam. Schools should consider opening in some form over the six-week summer holidays to help children catch up with the curriculum \u2013 and to provide childcare for families who need to get back to work, the children\u2019s commissioner has said. Anne Longfield said that when schools are allowed to reopen, they could be vital during the long summer holidays. It would be really valuable, if the scientific advice says they can, to have schools consider opening in some form over the summer holidays to help children learn and catch up but also to offer them a safe place to play and socialise with friends. It would also provide vital childcare for families who need to get their incomes back up as they, hopefully, return to work. Confusion persists over whether employees can be forced by their bosses to take holidays while on the government\u2019s furlough scheme. One worker contacted the Guardian to complain their employer was spending official furlough money to cover wages now and also using it to pay down holiday entitlement that would otherwise be payable later in the year. John Bowers QC, a barrister specialising in employment law, told the Guardian: \u201cThere is a split in the legal profession as to whether employees on furlough can be required to take part of their leave. Both government guidance and Acas guidance is ambiguous on this (perhaps deliberately) but this makes it difficult for employers to handle this.\u201d One law service published online advice stating: \u201cYou could insist employees take their holiday entitlement \u2026 so that when you get busier again your staff are there to support income generation rather than taking their holidays\u201d. The solicitors Farrer &amp; Co agreed the situation was unclear but said: \u201cOur preliminary view is that, unless and until we have guidance to the contrary, it seems employees can be required to take holiday during furlough and the pay they receive during this time will depend on whether employees are receiving furlough pay or topping up.\u201d The Guardian attempted to clarify the confusion. The Treasury press office redirected the inquiry to HM Revenue and Customs which, in turn, insisted it was a matter that for the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy department. BEIS stated that it was a Treasury responsibility. Medics trained overseas are being barred from the UK coronavirus frontline, reports Nosheen Iqbal. Thousands of experienced foreign doctors are being excluded from the battle against coronavirus by \u201cunnecessary and hostile red tape\u201d. A petition co-ordinated by RefuAid and Help Refugees, is calling on the General Medical Council (GMC) to make the registration process for overseas-qualified doctors faster and more straight-forward so they can help treat Covid-19 patients. Jennifer Lee specialised in respiratory and intensive care medicine for more than a decade in New York. She said: So much energy and resources have gone into trying to recruit former doctors, many of them older and at higher risk, back into the NHS, when there is an eager cohort of us ready to go. I\u2019ve been doing everything I can to get registered with the GMC and have just been stalled and faced roadblocks at every turn. This is an international emergency; I\u2019m a doctor and it\u2019s my calling. It\u2019s beyond frustrating to not be able to help. Tax rises could be required to deal with the economic cost of the coronavirus crisis, Sir Keir Starmer said as he warned against further austerity measures. The Labour leader tentatively hinted at an increase in taxes when pressed about what Labour would do to pay for the extra costs associated with the Covid-19 response. But he insisted \u201cpretending\u201d he could answer what would be needed in 2024 is \u201cnot something I\u2019m going to do\u201d, acknowledging the damage to the economy is unclear. Sir Keir added that a different approach to that adopted by the Conservatives since 2010 would be needed, with key workers requiring better support. The government has committed tens of billions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 cash in a bid to support businesses and keep people in jobs during the lockdown. Appearing on Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Starmer said: We can\u2019t go out every Thursday on our doorsteps and clap for our key workers who are keeping us going in this period, and then at the end of this return to business as usual. What we can\u2019t have is another decade of austerity on top of this decade of austerity. Just look what it\u2019s done to the health service, public services, social care, all of these areas that are now so being relied on have been cut for 10 years. The Liberal Democrats are demanding an immediate recall of parliament, saying the announcement today that it will resume on 21 April as planned \u201cis not good enough\u201d. The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, said: The government\u2019s failure to deliver on key promises to NHS and social care workers, especially over supplies of protective equipment, has become a national scandal. On top of this, we are now hearing reports of shortages of critical medicines for treating Covid-19 patients in some hospitals. He said recalling parliament on 21 April \u2013 in 10 days\u2019 time \u2013 is not good enough and that \u201cMPs from across the house must have the opportunity to ask ministers the urgent questions at the earliest opportunity, particularly on life or death issues like the supply of protective kit and essential medicine\u201d. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, said \u201ctechnological solutions\u201d would be used to allow parliament to sit, but did not provide details. Davey called for Rees-Mogg to clarify \u201cexactly what form any recalled parliament will take\u201d, adding: For the government to maintain the support of the opposition, we must have complete transparency. That is the only way we can all play our part to protect our frontline workers and beat the coronavirus. A third of UK surgeons and surgical trainees do not believe they have an adequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) in their trust, with wide regional variations, a survey has found. More than half of those who responded (57%) to the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) of England survey said there have been shortages in the past 30 days. The survey of nearly 2,000 surgeons and trainees showed a postcode lottery when it comes to PPE. More than half (52%) of respondents in the Thames Valley said they now have access to adequate PPE, but that dropped to just over a third (34.7%) in the North West. In London, which has been at the heart of the outbreak in the UK, a third (33.4%) of respondents said they do not believe their trust has an adequate supply of PPE. The survey was carried out after improved PPE guidance was issued by the Department of Health and Social Care at the beginning of April Sue Hill, RCS vice-president, said: The guidance is now much improved, but we have consistently said that advice about what protection to use for which medical procedures is rendered meaningless if the kit doesn\u2019t reach the front line. More than half of those responding to the survey also expressed scepticism about their chances of getting a Covid-19 test for themselves, should they need one. Confidence was particularly low in the East of England, where 75% of surgeons said they believed they would not get access to a test. One surgeon, who responded to the survey said: The lack of mask wearing in general patient contact has been scandalous. I caught Covid-19 from a patient on the ward who was pre-symptomatic but later tested positive. He infected at least six staff. One of my colleagues remains very sick from this. I was denied a test even on appeal. We were \u2018spoken to\u2019 for wearing simple masks and gloves in general ward areas. We agreed to submit to authority but strongly disagreed that there was no risk. The RCS is urging its members not to risk their health, and that of their patients, by carrying out risky procedures without adequate PPE. Future waves of coronavirus are \u201cprobably inevitable\u201d without a vaccine in place, said Sir Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust. \u201cIt is my view that treatment and vaccines are our only true exit strategy from this,\u201d he told the BBC. We are determined that we don\u2019t go through this ever again and I think the chances of second and third waves of this epidemic are probably inevitable. And therefore having the right treatments to save lives and also having a vaccine in the future is going to be absolutely critical to prevent those second and third waves. On the prospect of a vaccine, he added: \u201cThe vaccine I think will be available during the autumn of this year but that will not be at the scale required to vaccinate maybe billions of people around the world.\u201d Easter eggs have been delivered to hospitals around the UK as a thank you to NHS staff and those forced to spend the bank holiday away from family. More than 1,800 eggs were given out by the Chocolate Society, which set itself a challenge of seeing how many it could make in a 24-hour period of non-stop production. Al and Duncan Garnsworthy, who run the company, said the team worked from 8.30am to 8.30am the following day to produce eggs and show their support for hard-working healthcare staff. In a post on Instagram after completing the challenge, Al said: \u201cWe have produced more than we ever thought we would. I am super proud of the team.\u201d The company also raised more than \u00a33,000 for Heroes, an organisation that helps support the NHS and will help distribute the eggs. A council that was criticised for banning all mourners at its crematorium says it will now let relatives attend outside the building. City of York council said last week it was following other local authorities and stopping all funeral services at cremations \u2013 a move that York Central MP Rachael Maskell said \u201cwas a step too far\u201d and a possible breach of the UN declaration of human rights. On Saturday evening, the council changed its policy and said in a statement: \u201cFollowing the announcement of unattended cremations, faith groups and the council have confirmed that they will offer a faith officiant present at the crematorium to undertake the committal of the body according to the appropriate religious rites, and that celebrants or a minister can read your words during the private cremation and that this will be recorded for families. \u201cThe immediate family may wish to attend York crematorium, remaining outside to pay their respects, similarly at Fulford cemetery, whilst following official social distancing guidelines.\u201d The council confirmed that \u201cin all cases no mourners can be present inside the crematorium\u201d. Maskell said on Twitter: \u201cYork\u2019s reissued crematorium policy does not go far enough. I can\u2019t understand why they are making this so hard for distraught families. It is going to have to change again.\u201d Over 3,500 people have signed a petition calling for a maximum of five immediate family members be allowed to attend the funerals. Sir Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, said it was possible the UK could end up with the worst coronavirus death rate in Europe. Sir Farrer, who is a member of the Sage committee, which advises the government on the pandemic, said on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: The numbers in the UK have continued to go up. I do hope we\u2019re coming close to the number of new infections reducing \u2026 and the number of deaths plateauing and starting to come down. And yes, the UK is likely to be certainly one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe. He said continuing testing in the community would \u201cbuy you time\u201d to deal with the crisis, giving an additional six to eight weeks to ensure health systems were up to capacity. \u201cUndoubtedly there are lessons to learn from that,\u201d Sir Jeremy said. The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, has said the Labour party will support any necessary extension of the lockdown, but said more support needs to be put in place to help people through it. \u201cIf the lockdown has to continue, then of course we\u2019ll support it,\u201d she said this morning on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. She joined the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, in saying the government needs to set out its lockdown exit strategy. \u201cYou need to be open and transparent with the public so they understand why they\u2019re being asked to do the things they are, and so they can see some light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Nandy said. She also called on the government to name an interim foreign secretary replacement while Dominic Raab deputises for prime minister Boris Johnson as he recovers from Covid-19 in hospital. She also said that, while the crisis was unprecedented, the government was slow to act in some respects. To be fair to the government, this is quite unprecedented for Britain, and we\u2019re a country that has always taken civil liberties very seriously. These are big measures the government has taken over the past couple of weeks, and not a foreseeable crisis. But it is also right to acknowledge that in some areas we haven\u2019t been able to act quickly enough. Some of it is because it was unprecedented, but some of it is because we were in quite a weakened state as a country. When we come out the other side of this \u2026 I think we do really need to reflect on how we need to change as a country. We should never again be in a position where our public services don\u2019t have the resilience they need to respond, and where families are only one step away from financial collapse. Parliament remains on course to return on 21 April, a date agreed by MPs before the Easter recess, despite demands for an emergency recall. A spokesman for the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said: Parliament will return on 21 April to fulfil its essential constitutional functions of conducting scrutiny, authorising spending and making laws. In these unprecedented times, technological solutions have already been implemented for select committees and options are being prepared for the Speaker, the government and other parties to consider next week. It is important that we have a comprehensive solution that does not inadvertently exclude any members. The Leader of the House of Commons will respond to the leader of the opposition\u2019s letter in the usual way. Addressing concerns that only 1.4% of the 300,000 applications for business support had been processed, business secretary Alok Sharma said he had held conversations with lenders to speed up loan payouts. Speaking to Sky News, he said: \u201cI have spent the last couple of days talking directly to some of the largest lenders who are part of this scheme. \u201cI am very clear to say to them, we need to get money out of the door as soon as possible and they understand that and banks know on this occasion why they have to be part of the solution and they want to be part of the solution.\u201d Sharma said \u00a3800m had been paid out as part of 4,200 loans under the coronavirus business support measures. Asked whether he was worried, the business secretary said: \u201cWell, of course. It is not just a question of me being worried \u2013 I completely understand the concerns that businesses have.\u201d The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, delivered his first digital Easter Sunday service from his kitchen in London. \u201cWelcome to the kitchen of our home on Easter Day,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this very difficult time in the life of the nation and of the world, our prayers today are especially with those who are suffering, with those who care for them, and for all who mourn.\u201d The service was pre-recorded on the archbishop\u2019s iPad, with him wearing full robes and having set up a makeshift altar on his dining table He was joined \u201cvirtually\u201d by bishop Rose Hudson-Wilkins and a 10-year-old parishioner named Theo from the diocese of Canterbury. Nurses should refuse to treat Covid-19 patients \u201cas a last resort\u201d if they are not given adequate personal protective equipment, according to guidance from the Royal College of Nursing (RCN). At least 19 NHS workers are known to have died during the coronavirus outbreak, and the government has been criticised for failing to provide enough protection. A spokesman for RCN said: \u201cFor nursing staff, this will go against every instinct. But their safety must not be compromised.\u201d The union said it would provide legal assistance to those making what it acknowledged was an \u201cenormously difficult decision\u201d. Business secretary Alok Sharma said health workers should not be put in such a position. He told Sky News: \u201cIt is absolutely right that no medical professional should be placed in a position where they have to make that choice. \u201cThat for me is self-evident. That is why we are making sure we get the equipment to the front line.\u201d Sharma added: \u201cIn a normal circumstance, you would have us providing PPE to about 233 hospital trusts across the country. We are now talking about supplying 58,000 NHS and social care settings. \u201cThat is a huge increase and on top of that, there is huge global demand for PPE and that does put a squeeze on supply.\u201d The leader of the Labour party, Sir Keir Starmer, has said now is \u201cnot the time to ask difficult questions\u201d on whether the government was too slow to act on the coronavirus crisis, but said more scrutiny of decisions is needed. \u201cI challenge the government hard on this, not just to score a point, but to fix it,\u201d said Starmer on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, adding that challenging questions will need to be asked in time. \u201cI\u2019m trying to resist calls for apologies or criticising past decisions. I will work with the government on this, we will support them in trying to get this right.\u201d He said \u201cit would be smart\u201d of the government to acknowledge it has failed to meet its ambitions on personal protective equipment for NHS staff and apologise. He also welcomed the announcement from the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, that parliament will return on 21 April using \u201ctechnological solutions\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s very important in a crisis like this that parliament is sitting so decisions must be scrutinised,\u201d said Starmer. He also called on the government to set out its lockdown exit strategy The business secretary, Alok Sharma, stopped short of apologising for the lack of adequate protective equipment for NHS staff on the frontline. Speaking on Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Sharma said: \u201cI am extremely sorry for the loss of any life that has taken place during this global pandemic. \u201cIt is our job to make sure we get that protective equipment out to them. We do have a plan, we\u2019re putting that in place.\u201d He also praised British companies who have joined the effort to produce more personal protective equipment (PPE). He refused to comment on any extension to the lockdown in the UK, but when asked about tightening restrictions, he said:\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s particularly helpful at this stage.\u201d When asked about the health of prime minister Boris Johnson, who is no longer in intensive care, Sharma said: \u201cHe\u2019s in very good spirits. He\u2019s walking about a bit.\u201d Boris Johnson has praised the NHS staff at St Thomas\u2019 Hospital who have cared for him during his time in hospital. In his first statement since leaving intensive care, Johnson said: \u201cI can\u2019t thank them enough, I owe them my life.\u201d A No 10 spokeswoman said on Saturday: \u201cThe prime minister continues to make very good progress.\u201d Johnson\u2019s fiancee, Carrie Symonds, provided the prime minister with daily updates while he was in hospital, including scans of their unborn child, as he struggled with coronavirus in hospital, a Downing Street source confirmed. The Post Office is making two of its products available to all UK banks, building societies and credit unions, to make it easier for people who are self-isolating to access cash. The products are Payout Now - a voucher sent by text, email or post to a customer who can share it with a trusted person to withdraw cash; and Fast Pace - a service allowing a customer to arrange for a trusted person to collect a cheque from them, cash it at Post Office and return with the money. Martin Kearsley, banking director at the Post Office, said: \u201cThe vast majority of post offices are open, however there are branches that have to close for self-isolation reasons. He said anyone collecting cash on someone else\u2019s behalf must remember to practise safe distancing and should consider arranging with the recipient how the cash can be safely handed over - through a person\u2019s letterbox, for example. Good morning, this is Jessica Murray, and I\u2019ll be running the live blog tracking the latest coronavirus developments in the UK this Easter Sunday. Feel free to get in touch to share your experiences, or with any tips, comments and suggestions via jessica.murray@theguardian.com or via Twitter (@journojess_) Tributes have been paid to three more nurses who died after contracting Covid-19, with more than 30 NHS staff now thought to have died with the virus. On Saturday, Central and North West London (CNWL) NHS Foundation Trust confirmed Sara Trollope, a nurse employed by the trust, had died at Watford General Hospital after testing positive for Covid-19. Paying tribute to the mother-of-four who worked at Hillingdon Hospital, medical director Dr Paul Hopper said: \u201cSara had that unbeatable combination of kindness, selflessness and total determination to get things right for patients. She was an example to every one of us.\u201d It comes after Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust confirmed the death of a nurse who was self-isolating due to Covid-19 symptoms. Julie Omar, 52, was an experienced nurse who had been working at Redditch\u2019s Alexandra Hospital. Trust chief executive Matthew Hopkins said: \u201cIt is with great sorrow that I have to share with you the sad news that a much-loved member of our nursing team - Julie Omar - has died.\u201d Gareth Roberts, who had been a nurse since the 1980s, was also confirmed to have died after testing positive for the virus, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said. Two porters at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford were also confirmed to have died. Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said on Saturday that both men were married to nursing staff at the hospital. On Saturday morning, Health Secretary Matt Hancock paid tribute to those who had died, then announcing a total of 19 deaths. He said: \u201cMy heart goes out to their families, these are people who have put themselves on the front line.",

      "bodyText": "So far, discussions of a coronavirus exit strategy have mainly focused on the steps that could bring an end to the lockdown. In the short term, both in the UK and elsewhere, there is nothing more desirable than letting people resume their lives, once it is safe to do so. But the speed of the \u201creturn to normal\u201d is not the only thing that matters. The manner in which the world\u2019s leaders manage the colossal economic and political shocks caused by the virus is also of the utmost importance. And at the top of their list of priorities, alongside human welfare, must be the biosphere and its future. It\u2019s too soon to say with any confidence what impact coronavirus will have on the climate emergency. The brakes placed on economic activities of many kinds, worldwide, have led to carbon emission cuts that would previously have been unthinkable: 18% in China between February and March; between 40% and 60% over recent weeks in Europe.

Humans have become more like deer, flinching and jerking our heads every time someone near us coughs. A new normal in which everyone can measure 1.5 metres with a glance. Waiting is a huge part of this new normal. The world is waiting for the coronavirus to pass so we can dial down the fear and start seeing our family, friends and colleagues again, in person. People are waiting for news of certainty about their jobs, and about the health of their loved ones. Countless people are waiting to move beyond the confines of their homes, while many others are waiting to just get back to theirs. Waiting is tough at the best of times. In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, the exercise of having to wait seems all the more daunting. \u201cThese kinds of periods involve a really problematic combination of not knowing what\u2019s coming \u2013 uncertainty \u2013 and not being able to do much about it \u2013 lack of control.

      "body": "<p>Pressure is mounting on private schools to open their land to the public and ease overcrowding in city parks, with a key government adviser urging ministers to requisition them to help avoid potential social unrest during the lockdown.</p> <p>Prof Susan Michie, of the government\u2019s scientific advisory group on coronavirus, said that private green spaces should be officially commandeered by the state to ensure everyone can exercise safely while maintaining social distancing.</p> <p>Along with independent schools, Michie said private parkland and golf courses should also be temporarily used by the government to help city dwellers improve their physical and mental health and tackle frustration during the lockdown.</p> <p>There are 130 independent private schools in Greater London alone and some have huge grounds, such as Harrow school, which has 300 acres \u2013 bigger than east London\u2019s Victoria Park, which reopened on Saturday to large crowds and strict stewarding.</p> <p>Across the UK, police said that the vast majority of the public had abided by the coronavirus lockdown rules and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/apr/11/matt-hancock-urges-people-to-stay-at-home-this-easter-video\" title=\"\">stayed at home for Easter, </a>although officers in Essex stopped a number of motorists, whose excuses ranged from \u201cgoing to a BBQ\u201d to \u201cbuying drugs\u201d.</p> <p>Michie, director of the centre for behaviour change at University College London (UCL) and member of the government advisory body the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science, said ministers had operated on the \u201cback foot\u201d for much of the crisis and needed to do more to retain the trust of the public, particularly poorer households who had no private gardens.</p> <p>\u201cWe know from the evidence that if groups feel that the government is recognising the situation they are in and addressing it, they are more likely to trust and more likely to adhere,\u201d said Michie.</p> <p>Experts welcomed the call to open access to private schools\u2019 land, with some saying that the government should consider any scheme that made it easier for people to exercise safely, rather than issuing threats. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, warned last week that the government could stop people leaving their homes for exercise if too many individuals flouted its rules on social distancing.</p> <p>Professor Stephen Reicher of St Andrews University, a specialist in crowd psychology, said: \u201cPerhaps the government could start by asking the question: \u2018How do we help people to comply?\u2019 Rather than starting from a punitive perspective, you start from a facilitative perspective.</p> <p>\u201cIf you start from a presumption of goodwill towards people \u2013 how do we help? \u2013 then one obvious answer is by increasing the amount of space they can go to.\u201d</p> <p>With the link between access to outdoor space and benefits to mental health well established, Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a behavioural psychologist at UCL, said that the mental health of the poorest, typically those living in overcrowded flats with no outdoor space, was most likely to be affected by the lockdown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In addition to requisitioning swaths of private land, Michie also urged the government to seize empty hotels and office blocks and convert them into safe spaces for victims of abuse and domestic violence.</p> <p>She said: \u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t [do more to] acknowledge that we\u2019re not all in this together \u2013 some people are much more in it than others \u2013 and take steps to address those at the bottom of the pile, then I think that during the next weeks of lockdown there is potential for resentment, disquiet, anger, lack of adherence and even social unrest.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pressure is mounting on private schools to open their land to the public and ease overcrowding in city parks, with a key government adviser urging ministers to requisition them to help avoid potential social unrest during the lockdown. Prof Susan Michie, of the government\u2019s scientific advisory group on coronavirus, said that private green spaces should be officially commandeered by the state to ensure everyone can exercise safely while maintaining social distancing. Along with independent schools, Michie said private parkland and golf courses should also be temporarily used by the government to help city dwellers improve their physical and mental health and tackle frustration during the lockdown. There are 130 independent private schools in Greater London alone and some have huge grounds, such as Harrow school, which has 300 acres \u2013 bigger than east London\u2019s Victoria Park, which reopened on Saturday to large crowds and strict stewarding. Across the UK, police said that the vast majority of the public had abided by the coronavirus lockdown rules and stayed at home for Easter, although officers in Essex stopped a number of motorists, whose excuses ranged from \u201cgoing to a BBQ\u201d to \u201cbuying drugs\u201d. Michie, director of the centre for behaviour change at University College London (UCL) and member of the government advisory body the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science, said ministers had operated on the \u201cback foot\u201d for much of the crisis and needed to do more to retain the trust of the public, particularly poorer households who had no private gardens. \u201cWe know from the evidence that if groups feel that the government is recognising the situation they are in and addressing it, they are more likely to trust and more likely to adhere,\u201d said Michie. Experts welcomed the call to open access to private schools\u2019 land, with some saying that the government should consider any scheme that made it easier for people to exercise safely, rather than issuing threats. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, warned last week that the government could stop people leaving their homes for exercise if too many individuals flouted its rules on social distancing. Professor Stephen Reicher of St Andrews University, a specialist in crowd psychology, said: \u201cPerhaps the government could start by asking the question: \u2018How do we help people to comply?\u2019 Rather than starting from a punitive perspective, you start from a facilitative perspective. \u201cIf you start from a presumption of goodwill towards people \u2013 how do we help? \u2013 then one obvious answer is by increasing the amount of space they can go to.\u201d With the link between access to outdoor space and benefits to mental health well established, Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a behavioural psychologist at UCL, said that the mental health of the poorest, typically those living in overcrowded flats with no outdoor space, was most likely to be affected by the lockdown. In addition to requisitioning swaths of private land, Michie also urged the government to seize empty hotels and office blocks and convert them into safe spaces for victims of abuse and domestic violence. She said: \u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t [do more to] acknowledge that we\u2019re not all in this together \u2013 some people are much more in it than others \u2013 and take steps to address those at the bottom of the pile, then I think that during the next weeks of lockdown there is potential for resentment, disquiet, anger, lack of adherence and even social unrest.\u201d",

I most certainly will do a bit less. Just so you know, the crow pose \u2013 bakasana \u2013 goes something like this: start with a squat, as you might over a bush toilet. Follow that by manoeuvring both knees into your armpits. Come up on to tippy-toes, plant your outstretched hands on the ground, look forward, lift both feet off the ground, hover. It\u2019s mad, it\u2019s acrobatic, it\u2019s totally beyond me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"A yoga teacher in crow pose during a Power Living live stream class.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

      "bodyText": "If you attempt a yoga pose and fall flat on your face but no one is around to see it, did it really happen? Somewhere in the space between warrior II pose and downward-facing dog, I topple and land heavily on my yoga mat, on the floor of my bedroom in the social isolation of my elderly mother\u2019s Queensland home. I decide it didn\u2019t happen; my laptop is perched on a stool in front of me but the video is off. Kel Newstead, the teacher who is leading this livestreamed vinyasa yoga class via Zoom from Power Living Adelaide, can\u2019t see me. It definitely didn\u2019t happen. I return to an upright position and study my screen where Kel\u2019s cheerful face is framed by a gallery of other students, each a small, smudged figure drawing in motion. I try to catch up with her sweet-voiced instructions: \u201cLeft leg up, three-legged dog. You\u2019ll cross-body tiger curl when you breathe out, so a little core work here \u2026 \u201d This is not the style of yoga I normally do. Frankly, I\u2019m a bit lost. Perhaps I should have started with the level one classes instead of launching into level two. Kel is offering warm praise to other students on the screen \u2013 the ones who have chosen to turn their cameras on. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s it, Henry, gorgeous.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s it, take your time, Sarah.\u201d I\u2019m all tangled up in tiger curls and three-legged dogs. I\u2019m panting furiously and my monkey mind is wandering to my leftover tuna-macaroni casserole lunch sitting heavily in my stomach. The tuna came from the depths of my mother\u2019s bottomless pantry. The can had a little rust on it but, mindful of social distancing rules and empty supermarket shelves, we had ploughed on with the casserole endeavour. I decide it\u2019s indigestion, not food poisoning. Kel and the gallery of students on my screen have moved on when I return my attention to the class. \u201cThis practice is yours. If you need to do a little less, you can.\u201d Now she announces that we will move into crow pose. She doesn\u2019t hear the bad words I use to tell her \u201cno way\u201d. I most certainly will do a bit less. Just so you know, the crow pose \u2013 bakasana \u2013 goes something like this: start with a squat, as you might over a bush toilet. Follow that by manoeuvring both knees into your armpits. Come up on to tippy-toes, plant your outstretched hands on the ground, look forward, lift both feet off the ground, hover. It\u2019s mad, it\u2019s acrobatic, it\u2019s totally beyond me. While the gallery of students on my laptop screen contort their bodies into birdlike postures, I remain in a simpler yogic squat. I\u2019m diverted by my feet. They need a pedicure. My mind wanders to the women who speak little English who run my local nail salon in Sydney. How are they doing?

Much depends on how quickly the changes introduced to manage the coronavirus are rescinded. Experts have suggested a slow withdrawal may be necessary to prevent a sudden resurgence in infections. Economist Saul Eslake says the government, having shown what it can provide in terms of a generous social safety net, will find itself in a tug-of-war with voters. \u201cPeople are going to have much bigger expectations of what government can and should do for them,\u201d Eslake says.

Physical isolation aids accessibility The author Anna Spargo-Ryan has watched both mental health services and events in the arts community become more accessible with a growing sense of frustration. She routinely turns down invitations to speak at writers\u2019 festivals because she cannot appear in person and has been told that it\u2019s \u201ctoo hard\u201d for writers to appear via videolink. \u201cIt [the lack of access] is not malicious; it\u2019s just not a priority,\u201d Spargo-Ryan says. Even events that might be expected to do better are often not set up for people with different access requirements. \u201cI have received emails like: \u2018we have a conference about agoraphobia in Sydney and we would really like you to come and speak about it\u2019,\u201d Spargo-Ryan says. It has been both exciting and annoying for her to see events such as the Newcastle Writers Festival and Emerging Writers\u2019 Festival convert to an online-only format in response to the coronavirus. \u201cIt is annoying on the one hand to feel like \u2026 the reason that I felt it was important was not good enough,\u201d she says. \u201cThat my need and the needs of people who have similar requirements to me, that wasn\u2019t a good enough reason to provide it and that after all that it wasn\u2019t as hard as people had implied.\u201d In many professions, the coronavirus has led to a relaxation of red tape so that business can continue.

But Wright says other changes, like a decision in Victoria to give priority to judge-only trials, should not continue after restrictions are lifted. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see changes brought into place just for the sake of efficiency, because efficiency does not mean fairness or justice,\u201d she says.

However Alex Prineas, an equity analyst from Morningstar Australasia, says some people may emerge from the pandemic with a loathing for working from home, and companies will have to adjust accordingly. \u201cHuman nature is not going to have changed, we are still going to need to socialise, to meet in person to communicate better than we do over the phone,\u201d Prineas says. Whatever the office looks like, it will be cheaper. The cost of renting an office building has increased 60% in the past five years. That\u2019s likely to take a dive, Prineas says. The combined impact of having to work from home, care for children at home, and conduct home-schooling for older children could discourage women from having children, says Australian National University demographer Liz Allen. \u201cAustralia will likely see postponement and even foregone births, meaning we may see fewer and fewer children being born \u2026 leading to major pressure on the economic wellbeing of the nation \u2013 population growth is crucial to a strong economy,\u201d Allen says. The decline may only be marginal, but Australia\u2019s birth rate is already below replacement level. Immigration will become even more important, and could cause conflict if not managed against a growing view among nationalists that isolationism was the right approach all along. Allen says the socioeconomic impact of the virus will be much harder on and felt for much longer by women, whose average superannuation balance on retirement is already lower. The chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rob Sims, cites e-health and e-education services as one area where Australia may be permanently changed. But mostly, he says, Australia will go back to normal. \u201cI\u2019m certainly going to want a haircut when this is over,\u201d Sims says. \u201cI\u2019m going to go to my office and get a cup of coffee from the coffee shop at the bottom of my floor, I\u2019m going to catch up with friends and go out to a restaurant four or five times in the first week. \u201cThere\u2019ll be interesting changes out of this but I largely see things going back to normal.\u201d \u2022 Additional reporting by Ben Butler",

On Thursday the education minister, Dan Tehan, wrote to all independent school associations ordering them to provide in-person education to children from term two or risk losing their federal funding. The direction antagonised Independent Schools Victoria, which believes it clashes with health advice in that state, and CSA, which has been lobbying behind the scenes for a guarantee on 2020 schools funding. Federal funding for non-government schools is based on enrolments at a census date, usually in August, but CSA wants funding to be guaranteed at the level of student enrolment at the start of term one. Throughout March the Morrison government opposed school closures on the basis of medical advice, but the issue was forced by Victoria bringing forward its school holidays and other states introducing pupil-free days, resulting in higher rates of parents keeping their children home and in some cases withdrawing them from independent schools. CSA director of public policy, Mark Spencer, said it had \u201cbeen asking the minister for a declaration to provide certainty on commonwealth funding for weeks\u201d. \u201cInstead we read in the media that our funding is being threatened,\u201d he said. \u201cChristian schools, along with other independent schools, have remained open to children of essential workers and vulnerable children and have strongly supported the government\u2019s position that schools remain safe.\u201d \u201cThe declaration was unnecessary and disheartening, following on the back of that announcement that schools could not access the lower threshold for jobkeeper payments that applies to other charities.\u201d Independent schools, like universities, were excluded from the lower threshold of 15% revenue decrease to qualify for jobkeeper extended to other charities.

The family business \u2013 William Barrett and Sons in Bunbury, Western Australia \u2013 has survived periods of immense social upheaval: world wars and financial collapses. It has been shaped by cultural changes that have affected the way death is observed, such as more secular mourning rites, and including women in active roles. But Barrett says the restrictions in place now are \u201cunprecedented\u201d. Death is a time of distress for the bereaved and people have an innate need to be with each other for support. The fact mourners are permitted to congregate as a group of up to 10 \u2013 while weddings are restricted to five people, and all other types of gathering to two \u2013 speaks to the significance of the role funerals play. But choosing those 10 people when ordinarily there might be 500, is complicating the grieving process for many, as is the requirement to stand two metres from someone you would naturally comfort with a hug or a kiss. \u201cAll the things we know about funerals and how they can help that transition in people\u2019s lives when they\u2019ve lost someone have been taken away,\u201d Barrett says. \u201cIt means we have to come up with alternatives to help people in that transition.\u201d In recent weeks, Barrett has witnessed anger and guilt among families grappling with the restrictions.

There are strict handling procedures, including personal protective equipment to be worn by staff. Family members \u2013 for both Covid and non-Covid deaths \u2013 are permitted to view the body at a distance in a special room. MacLeod says viewings have helped families who in some cases have not seen their loved one in the weeks before their death. \u201cThere\u2019s so much these people are going through \u2013 we\u2019ve got to do all we can and more to assist them,\u201d he says. \u201cThat physical response that seeing their loved ones brings is really important.\u201d Since the introduction of the restrictions, MacLeod says, some funerals have been attended by as many as 700 people online.

      "bodyText": "Qantas staff are exploring options, including a class action alleging the airline failed to adequately protect them against Covid 19, after more than 59 employees became infected along with some family members. The Flight Attendants\u2019 Association of Australia has begun exploring possible legal avenues for staff, amid deep dissatisfaction about the way in which Qantas has handled what they say are the risks, particularly to cabin crew. \u201cOur members have asked us to explore what options are available to them,\u201d vice president of the FAAA, Bruce Roberts, told Guardian Australia. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) has now acknowledged that international cabin crew face a higher risk and issued new guidance to the airlines, as Qantas gears up to begin limited scheduled international flights to Los Angeles, London, Auckland and Hong Kong. The flights will operate for a month, Qantas said. Previously air crew were exempt from quarantine \u2013 unlike their passengers \u2013 to allow them to maintain a semblance of normal life while staffing essential flights. Crew were told to social distance and not to interact with members of the community at risk ports. But crews were still able to eat out in the hotels where they were accommodated. The emergence of recent clusters among flight crew had raised a new awareness of the risk of Covid-19 in returning flight crew and those operating repatriation flights. With the cruise ship industry now banned from Australian ports, there has been growing concern about the possibility that international airline crews could become a new vector for infections into the community. Far more stringent protections were taken on the most recent rescue charter flight from Uruguay which brought back a large number of infected people from the cruise ship, Greg Mortimer, to Melbourne. The planes were met by emergency staff in full hazmat suits. Qantas\u2019s medical director, Ian Hosegood had insisted that the risk to flight crew of catching Covid-19 on a flight was \u201clow\u201d. \u201cIn most cases, employees have contracted the coronavirus while overseas including staff who were on holidays,\u201d he has said. \u201cThere\u2019s been no confirmed cases of transmission of the coronavirus to employees or customers on board our aircraft, or any aircraft globally for that matter.\u201d But in recent days several alarming clusters have emerged. Sources said there were now 15 cases associated with a Santiago rescue flight on 28 March. The airline says it believes cabin crew were infected while in overseas cities that had not yet put social distancing rules in place. One crew member on another international flight, who was not required to self-isolate, has told the union that her 11-year-old child with asthma has now become infected. She is said to be deeply upset. In the case of a Dallas to Sydney flight on 27 March, four crew have tested positive. Guardian Australia has seen social media posts in which a crew member said they had not been told about Ruby Princess passengers being on board a flight to Dallas on 21 March a week earlier until several days later. \u201cIf you saw my whinge the other day about the QF7 and finding out we had cruise ship passengers \u2026 fast forward 3 days and four of us from the same crew [have] tested positive for coronavirus,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDon\u2019t think about yourself ... think about who you live with because QF [Qantas] will not.\u201d Qantas insists there is no evidence the infections were acquired on board the aircraft but health authorities appear to have upped the precautions including altering the exemption for airline crew. In its latest advice AHPPC published late Thursday, the committee noted \u201cspecific failures in controls\u201d and has recommended more stringent measures, including either self-isolation away from family between flights or 14 days\u2019 isolation on return, whichever is shorter. A spokesman for Qantas said it has now implemented the stricter protocols and will pay for a hotel if staff do not want to isolate at their homes. The committee has also recommended new rules for air crew in ports and on aircraft. \u201cIf possible use an aircraft with personalised ventilation as this has been shown to reduce cross-infection,\u201d the new advice says. In order to reduce movement on aircraft, the committee says \u201cmeal and drink service must be minimal or prepackaged\u201d and that \u201ccrew should be seated away from passengers and appropriate distance should be maintained between crew members where possible\u201d. \u201cContact between aircrew and passengers must be minimised,\u201d it says. When they reach their destination, air crew must now undertake self-isolation in their hotel room and order meals through room service . They must adopt strict social distancing and high standards of hygiene. \u201cThe shortest possible stay to allow appropriate rest should be facilitated,\u201d the new protocol says. Qantas also confirmed it would now pay its staff at their normal rate of pay during a period of self-isolation. This had been a particularly vexing issue with the union which said staff exposed prior but stood down by Qantas were not being compensated yet were required to self-isolate. All Australian states have been publishing lists of flights where there have been cases of Covid- 19, and contacting people in nearby rows where the positive case was seated, as part of their efforts to track and trace infections and to ensure people with potential exposure self isolate. \u201cNSW has had people who have returned from overseas on flights who have subsequently developed Covid-19. It is not possible to determine whether they acquired their illness from a close contact on the plane or in the community,\u201d a NSW Health spokesman said.",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s largest oil producers have agreed a historic deal to cut global oil production by almost 10% to protect the market against the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Members of the Opec oil cartel and its allies have agreed to withhold almost 10m barrels a day from next month after the outbreak of Covid-19 wiped out demand for fossil fuels and triggered a collapse in global oil prices. The biggest oil production deal in history is double the size of the cuts agreed following the global financial crisis and marks a truce in the oil price war brewing between Saudi Arabia, Opec\u2019s de facto leader, and Russia. The alliance, known as Opec+, agreed to the production cuts after more than a week of tense talks between the world\u2019s biggest oil-producing nations to shore up the battered global oil market. Opec+ has also called in help from major oil producers outside the alliance \u2013 including Brazil, Canada, Norway and the US \u2013 which could double the size of the unprecedented deal to 20m barrels a day. The planned cooperation agreement comes just weeks after Riyadh and Moscow vowed to pump record crude volumes, despite the economic slowdown triggered by Covid-19, in a bid to claim a bigger share of the market. The oil price plunged to 18-year lows of less than $28 (\u00a323) a barrel as fears of a global economic recession and severe restrictions on road transport and aviation caused oil demand to fall by an average of 27m barrels a day in April. Donald Trump, the US president, tweeted his thanks to Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia for the \u201cbig oil deal\u201d, which would save \u201chundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States\u201d. The US expects its oil production to fall this year because of a slump in the shale industry, which requires higher oil prices than many other oil-producing sectors do. Oil rigs have already begun to close in some landlocked areas of the US after market prices fell below the cost of transporting the barrels to buyers, cutting almost 1m barrels a day from US production.

The Associated Press reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Long before there was a global coronavirus pandemic, brick-and-mortar retailers struggled to get people to walk through their doors instead of shopping online.</p> <p>Now those retailers are faced with an even more Herculean task: how to stay on people\u2019s minds and more importantly their pocketbooks when many of their store doors are closed.</p> <p>More than 250,000 stores like Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom and Nike that sell non-essential merchandise have temporarily shuttered since mid-March in response to the pandemic. Thats 60% of overall U.S. retail square footage, according to Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.</p> <p>\u201cRetail has hung a closed sign on the door literally and metaphorically,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cThis is the most catastrophic crisis that retail has faced worse than the financial crisis in 2008, worse than 9/11. Almost overnight, the retail economy shifted from being about things people want to things that they need.\u201d</p> <p>Some retailers have responded to the challenge by coming up with creative ways to stay relevant. Nike, for instance, introduced workout apps in China when the coronavirus first surfaced there, resulting in an 80% increase in users within the quarter and a 30% increase in online sales. It\u2019s now pushing a similar campaign in the U.S. and Europe.</p> <p>Yoga pants maker Lululemon is holding online classes in North America and Europe after gaining thousands of new followers in China on WeChat. Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald told analysts during a recent call that during its first week of closures in the U.S., it saw nearly 170,000 customers join Lululemon for its live classes.</p> <p>Small businesses are also pivoting in order to hold onto customers. Camp, a new toy chain that set itself apart from online retailers by doubling down on the physical experience, is hosting virtual birthday parties and creating curated gift boxes now that its five stores have gone dark. Politics &amp; Prose, a popular Washington D.C. bookstore, was also forced to temporarily close and is now starting to stream author talks online and offering a curbside pickup service.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e9395128f082dfd549d5368\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-12T22:31:48.406Z\">11.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has outlined his plan to safely reopen the United States in an op-ed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/opinion/joe-biden-coronavirus-reopen-america.html\">published in today\u2019s New York Times</a>. </p> <p>His three steps include: 1) getting the number of new cases down significantly through continued social distancing and improved supply lines to our hospitals with a more thorough deployment of the Defense Production Act; 2) the establishment of widespread, easily available and prompt testing with contact tracing strategy that protects privacy; and 3) increasing the capacity of our healthcare system to protect against the potential flare-up of cases when economic activity reopens.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cFor more Americans to go back to their jobs, the president needs to do better at his job,\u201d Biden wrote. </p> <p>As if Trump, the great counterpuncher, was going to take that lying down.

class=\"block-elements\">  <p>NBC\u2019s Meet the Press also spoke to World Health Organization Special Envoy Dr David Nabarro \u2013 not to be confused with Trump adviser, China trade hawk and coronavirus tsar Peter Navarro, about whom Julian Borger, our world affairs editor, wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/peter-navarro-what-trumps-covid-19-tsar-lacks-in-expertise-he-makes-up\"><strong>this must-read profile</strong></a>.</p> <p>Asked about what southern hemisphere experiences in the virus might teach us about the seasonality or otherwise of Covid-19, Dr Nabarro offered a disturbing thought: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think <strong>it is going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time</strong> to come until we can all have a vaccine that will protect us and that there will be small outbreaks that will emerge sporadically and they will break through our defenses.</p> </blockquote> <p>Nabarro was also asked about Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of the WHO and his threat this week \u2013 how serious he was was, as ever, unclear \u2013 to withdraw US funding for the international healthcare body:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The World Health Organization actually works on behalf of all the governments in the world. And it operates within mandates that are given to it. And, and we have to rely on information that\u2019s received from different governments. And that then permits us to work out what\u2019s going on \u2026 but <strong>we know that there will be many things that are found to have perhaps not been done as well as they could have been done</strong>. And we\u2019re anticipating there\u2019ll be lots of examinations afterwards. </p> <p>Right now, we have to move forward. We have to get the best possible cooperation. I just heard you discussing with the head of the FDA some of the challenges, the things that we\u2019re learning about this virus all the time. That\u2019s why we need a strong WHO, a trusted WHO. And we hope all leaders will continue to work with us in that way.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Meet the Press Chuck Todd asked</strong> that given <strong>\u201c</strong>the United States is anywhere \u2013 approximately 15% to 20% of your annual budget \u2026 how devastating would it be if the United States pulled its funding?\u201d</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, you know, <strong>we\u2019re right in the middle of this massive epic struggle. Every single human being in the world is affected by it</strong>. Businesses are really in trouble. Communities are in distress. I really do hope that all nations will not find any reason to make threats or other such things that will undermine our capacity to bring together all the best knowledge that we can find. </p> <p>\u201cAnd of course we love our partnership with the United States. We work with United States scientists for years \u2026 and <strong>that would be so unfortunate if anything happened to lessen that cooperation</strong>. </p> <p>\u201cI know that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tedros-adhanom\"><strong>Tedros [Adhanom Ghebreyesus], the director general</strong></a>, has had direct discussions with the president of the US. And he really does trust when \u2013 trust him when he hears from the president that respect for the WHO. And we hope that will go on.

A day later, health and human services secretary Alex Azar issued a similar warning. The White House did not issue national social distancing guidelines until 16 March. </p> <p>On Saturday, Trump vowed to rebuild the US economy, which has suffered trillions of dollars in damage from the outbreak, as a tribute to those who have died. Trump predicted that the economy to rebound like a \u201crocket ship\u201d because Americans have combated the coronavirus the \u201cright way\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe did it the right way. We took care of social distancing and all of the things, words that nobody ever heard before, frankly, and phrases. But if we didn\u2019t do that, we would have pulled through it,\u201d Trump said. </p> <p>\u201cThere were estimates, 2.2 million people.

Bernie Sanders may have dropped out this week but he still won a few delegates. Biden, of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/democratic-primary-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-2020\"><strong>is now the presumptive nominee</strong></a> to face Donald Trump in November.</p> <p>Of which, the Associated Press reports an interesting wrinkle:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The primary was scheduled for 4 April, but Covid-19 upended plans. In response, the party, which had planned to offer voting by mail and at in-person locations, <strong>went exclusively to a vote-by-mail system</strong>.</p> <p>\u2026The party said <strong>it sent in early March</strong> ballots to every person who was registered as a Democrat as of mid-February, <strong>more than 71,000</strong>. The party also included voter registration forms and <strong>downloadable ballots</strong> on its website.<br></p> <p>Ballots had to be received by Friday to be counted, the party said. </p> </blockquote> <p>Trump, remember, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/trump-mail-in-voting-2020-election\">really, <em>really</em> doesn\u2019t like voting by mail</a>.

      "bodyText": "Fauci confirms New York Times report Trump rebuffed social distancing advice. Health adviser says on CNN: \u201cYou could logically say if you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives.\u201d Trump advisers doubt swift reopening as WHO official says virus will \u201cstalk human race\u201d. Senior US public health officials have pushed back on Donald Trump\u2019s eagerness to reopen the country quickly. The first wave of stimulus checks were sent out to Americans on Saturday, the IRS has confirmed. \u201cWe know many people are anxious to get their payments; we\u2019ll continue issuing them as fast as we can,\u201d the tax service said. The White House did not conduct press briefing for today. Sunday marked the first time since the president started his Covid-19 updates that Trump has missed two days in a row. Andrew Cuomo and Bill de Blasio continue their debate on whether NYC schools will close for the year. Neither he New York governor nor NYC mayor appear ready to back down over who has the authority to close the schools in America\u2019s biggest city. Brick-and-mortar retailers continue to take a major hit amid the coronavirus pandemic, forcing many to come up with creative ways to reach customers. The Associated Press reports: Long before there was a global coronavirus pandemic, brick-and-mortar retailers struggled to get people to walk through their doors instead of shopping online. Now those retailers are faced with an even more Herculean task: how to stay on people\u2019s minds and more importantly their pocketbooks when many of their store doors are closed. More than 250,000 stores like Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom and Nike that sell non-essential merchandise have temporarily shuttered since mid-March in response to the pandemic. Thats 60% of overall U.S. retail square footage, according to Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. \u201cRetail has hung a closed sign on the door literally and metaphorically,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cThis is the most catastrophic crisis that retail has faced worse than the financial crisis in 2008, worse than 9/11. Almost overnight, the retail economy shifted from being about things people want to things that they need.\u201d Some retailers have responded to the challenge by coming up with creative ways to stay relevant. Nike, for instance, introduced workout apps in China when the coronavirus first surfaced there, resulting in an 80% increase in users within the quarter and a 30% increase in online sales. It\u2019s now pushing a similar campaign in the U.S. and Europe. Yoga pants maker Lululemon is holding online classes in North America and Europe after gaining thousands of new followers in China on WeChat. Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald told analysts during a recent call that during its first week of closures in the U.S., it saw nearly 170,000 customers join Lululemon for its live classes. Small businesses are also pivoting in order to hold onto customers. Camp, a new toy chain that set itself apart from online retailers by doubling down on the physical experience, is hosting virtual birthday parties and creating curated gift boxes now that its five stores have gone dark. Politics &amp; Prose, a popular Washington D.C. bookstore, was also forced to temporarily close and is now starting to stream author talks online and offering a curbside pickup service. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has outlined his plan to safely reopen the United States in an op-ed published in today\u2019s New York Times. His three steps include: 1) getting the number of new cases down significantly through continued social distancing and improved supply lines to our hospitals with a more thorough deployment of the Defense Production Act; 2) the establishment of widespread, easily available and prompt testing with contact tracing strategy that protects privacy; and 3) increasing the capacity of our healthcare system to protect against the potential flare-up of cases when economic activity reopens. \u201cFor more Americans to go back to their jobs, the president needs to do better at his job,\u201d Biden wrote. As if Trump, the great counterpuncher, was going to take that lying down. Moments ago, he fired off a tweet that appeared to take aim at Times and, more broadly, the \u201cLamestream Media\u201d, a wordplay popularized by former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential candidate. Illinois\u2019 governor, JB Pritzker, expressed hope that his state\u2019s coronavirus figures are leveling off during Sunday\u2019s daily press briefing in Chicago, despite the largest one-day increase of infections to date. Pritzker said the increase of 1,672 cases in the last 24 hours can be attributed in part to increased testing statewide, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve spoken before about a stabilizing or bending of the curve and today is one more piece of evidence that it may indeed be happening.\u201d The governor reported 43 additional lives lost to the virus in the last day, bringing the overall total to 720, but noted it is the lowest death count since last weekend. He lauded Illinoisans adherence to social distancing and other preventative measures, also expressing thanks for a shipment of 100,000 N95 masks courtesy of Apple and company founder Tim Cook. A New York Times report on Saturday, which appeared to be backed up by Dr Anthony Fauci today, that said Donald Trump ignored warnings as early as February that he needed to take action against Covid-19 has clearly riled the president. Trump had already complained about the Times\u2019 reporting on Saturday but renewed his attacks on Twitter on Sunday. \u201cIf the Fake News Opposition Party is pushing, with all their might, the fact that President Trump \u2018ignored early warnings about the threat,\u2019 then why did Media &amp; Dems viciously criticize me when I instituted a Travel Ban on China,\u201d wrote the president this afternoon. \u201cThey said \u2018early &amp; not necessary.\u2019 Corrupt Media!\u201d Fauci, a prominent government health adviser, appeared to confirm the Times report earlier on Sunday. Asked on CNN\u2019s State of the Union why the administration did not act when he and other officials advised, Fauci said: \u201cYou know \u2026 as I have said many times, we look at it from a pure health standpoint. We make a recommendation. Often, the recommendation is taken. Sometimes, it\u2019s not ... It is what it is. We are where we are right now.\u201d Storms and tornadoes have hit the south today with 20 states, including Texas, Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana, affected. That raises two dangers for residents -\u2013 Covid-19 and the elements. However, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said that people should prioritize shelter over social distancing in the case of emergency. \u201cHave a safe place to go. If you go to a public shelter please wear a mask, bandana, or scarf around your nose and mouth. Practice social distancing. We will get through this,\u201d wrote the agency in a tweet. Louisiana, which has the fourth-highest number of deaths of any state despite ranking only 25th in population, has reported a drop in deaths. The 34 deaths from Covid-19 reported on Sunday was the lowest total in Louisiana since 1 April. Fears the state will run out of ventilators and intensive care beds have also eased. 840 people have now reported to have died from the virus in Louisiana since the start of the outbreak. The New Orleans Times-Picayune also reports that the number of most serious crimes, such as homicide and robberies, have fallen since Mayor LaToya Cantrell ordered the closing of most businesses in the city last month. However, other crimes such as some categories of domestic violence and shoplifting have risen. A friend who Donald Trump alluded to when detailing his experiences with Covid-19 has died from the virus. The Real Deal, which covers the New York real estate industry, identified the man as Stanley I Chera when it reported his death on Saturday. Chera\u2019s identity was then confirmed to the Associated Press by a White House official. Chera was in his late 70s and involved in the real estate business and had donated money to the Trump campaign. The president mentioned Chera, but did not identify him, when he spoke about the effects of Covid-19 on 29 March. \u201cI had a friend who went to a hospital the other day. He\u2019s a little older, and he\u2019s heavy, but he\u2019s [a] tough person,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd he went to the hospital, and a day later, he\u2019s in a coma ... he\u2019s not doing well ... The speed and the viciousness, especially if it gets the right person, it\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s really horrible.\u201d Trump mentioned Chera at a 2019 rally when he described him as \u201cone of the biggest builders and real estate people in the world.\u201d The president added: \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy, and he\u2019s been with me from the beginning.\u201d The Associated Press spoke to a New York cab driver as part of a project to gauge the effect of the pandemic on the nation\u2019s workers. Nicolae Hent has been a cab driver in the city since 1988 and said he no longer bothers heading to JFK airport for lucrative fares as there are almost no passengers. He said on a good day he used to be able to earn $300 but the figure is more like $100 since the start of the lockdown. He said the best places to look for a fare are hospitals. \u201cThat\u2019s where the customers are now,\u201d Hent told AP last week. \u201cHospital workers, nurses, doctors, and where there are stores for food.\u201d He said once the day shift at hospitals ends around 7pm he heads home too. \u201cThen there\u2019s no reason to stay on the street, because there\u2019s nobody,\u201d he said. The first wave of stimulus checks were sent out to Americans on Saturday, the IRS has confirmed. \u201cWe know many people are anxious to get their payments; we\u2019ll continue issuing them as fast as we can,\u201d the tax service said in a Twitter post. The first to receive direct deposits are tax payers who have filed tax returns for 2018 or 2019 and authorized direct deposit. Others may have to wait weeks or months to receive disbursement authorized under a $2.2tn stimulus package passed by Congress last month. Individuals are due up to $1,200 and couples will receive up to $2,400 \u2013 plus $500 a child. Tax payers with adjusted gross incomes of more than $75,000 will receive less according to sliding scale, with eligibility capped at $99,000. Qualification thresholds are double for couples. According to a memo issued by democrats, the IRS anticipates issuing paper checks starting in the first week of May. The checks will be issued at a rate of about five million per week, the memo says. The service has until the end of 2020 to make the transfers. One day after Donald Trump declared Wyoming a disaster area due to the coronavirus outbreak, the US president framed it in the broader context of national victory \u2013 namely, winning \u2013 on Sunday afternoon. According to White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere, it is the first time a disaster declaration has been in effect in all 50 states at once. As of Sunday afternoon, the overall US toll from the pandemic has surpassed 21,300 deaths and more than half a million confirmed cases. Richard Luscombe has news on Joe Biden\u2019s movements over the weekend... From a basement in deepest Wilmington, Delaware, comes a special Easter Sunday edition of the popular podcast Here\u2019s the Deal. Its host is none other than Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, chewing the fat with Reverend William J Barber II, the prominent activist, Protestant minister and board member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In lockdown and unable to command national attention in the way he would like, Biden has turned to the internet to spread his message. Today\u2019s podcast, the third of a series launched just over a week ago, deals with the coronavirus, a return to civility in the US, and \u201cthis guy in the White House.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve preached about the soul of America and how we had to restore it,\u201d Biden says, referring to a central tenet of his campaign to unseat Donald Trump in November. \u201cWell, you\u2019re seeing it not just in those poor folks out there making the minimum wage and busting their neck and putting their lives on the line to help everybody else, you\u2019re seeing it with acts of kindness that haven\u2019t occurred in a long time across the board, in white communities, Asian communities, black communities, Latino communities. \u201cAnd that, I pray God, is going to be contagious.\u201d In the podcast, Biden and Barber discuss their faith, hope that comes from the Easter story and the long fight for civil rights and racial equality in the US. \u201cGod doesn\u2019t bring us viruses, but God works in the midst of pain, just like God worked in the midst of the slavery of the Hebrew people in ancient Israel,\u201d Barber said. Despite the religious overlay, Biden\u2019s podcast did not stray far from the political. People\u2019s experiences with the pandemic, the vice-president believes, have made them more appreciative of social policy. \u201cIf Hillary had won, if we didn\u2019t have this guy in the White House, it would have been very hard for Hillary to sell some of the things she wanted to sell, and the things that I want to sell, that Bernie wanted to sell, because people didn\u2019t quite get it. \u201cPeople now understand. When\u2019s the last time people walked out and thanked the guy who\u2019s cleaning the sewer, for keeping his basement from backing up? When\u2019s the last time that somebody walked out and said, \u2018Hey, thanks?\u2019 \u201cWell, people now are seeing every single day people busting their neck, risking their lives, to save other people, these first responders, these nurses, the people that are out there in the ambulances\u2026 People are getting their eyes opened.\u201d Biden also has thoughts about the financial hardships people are experiencing. \u201cWe should freeze all evictions for rent, we should freeze mortgage payments, we should be increasing social security payments right now by at least another $200 a month, we should be forgiving student debt,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need a lot more money spent to deal with this crisis and the aftermath of this crisis.\u201d Ariel Dorfman warned of the dangers of Donald Trump\u2019s attack on science in 2017. Now he says that even those dire predictions did not go far enough as the president\u2019s response to Covid-19 begins to play out: Today\u2019s chaotic and bumbling response to this emergency is no accident, but deeply rooted and systemic, the direct result of a pattern of callow benightedness that verges on the criminal and that goes back to the very start of Trump\u2019s regime, embedded in the very recalcitrant anti-intellectual DNA of this president and his followers. If, back in October of 2017, Trump seemed a remote, albeit inadvertent, disciple of the fascist general who shouted \u201cLong live death!\u201d all those decades ago as democracy was being destroyed in Spain, today I see him as someone far more terrifying: the personification of one of the horsemen of the apocalypse, the one riding the white horse of pestilence. You can read the full column below: Edward Helmore has the latest on oil production during the pandemic: The world\u2019s top oil producers have agreed to reduce global crude output, ending a price war after four days of video conferences involving government ministers from around the globe. Under the terms of the deal, the 13-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries \u2013 and 10 other nations including Russia \u2013 will cut production by 9.7m barrels a day, just below the initial proposal of 10m. The US, Brazil and Canada will contribute another 3.7m barrels as their production declines. Last week, talks stalled when Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, refused to compromise with Mexico, which wanted to reduce output by 100,000 barrels a day. Under the agreement struck on Sunday, the US will reportedly cut 300,000 barrels per day to compensate for Mexico. Delegates are set to hold a final call to agree the deal ahead of the market\u2019s opening on Monday. Oil prices have dropped 40% since early March, when Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to reach an agreement to counter an oil-market supply glut as the spread of coronavirus signaled a slowdown in world consumption. Last week, Saudi and Russian delegates pledged to bury their differences. New Jersey, the state with the second-most deaths in the US from Covid-19, reported another 168 deaths on Sunday, although that is down from Saturday\u2019s figure of 251. However, the number of positive tests (3,733) was up from Saturday\u2019s total of 3,599. The total number of deaths from Covid-19 in New Jersey now stands at 2,350. New Jersey\u2019s governor, Phil Murphy, said the state has received another 200 ventilators from the federal government. \u201cVentilators are our number one need right now. We won\u2019t stop fighting to get the equipment we need to save every life we can,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Prominent US public health adviser Dr Anthony Fauci has appeared to confirm a bombshell New York Times report which said he and other Trump administration officials recommended the implementation of social distancing to combat the coronavirus in February, but were rebuffed for almost a month. Fauci appeared on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. Asked why the administration did not act when he and other officials advised, he said: \u201cYou know \u2026 as I have said many times, we look at it from a pure health standpoint. We make a recommendation. Often, the recommendation is taken. Sometimes, it\u2019s not. \u201c\u2026It is what it is. We are where we are right now.\u201d More than 530,000 cases of Covid-19 have now been confirmed in the US, with almost 21,000 deaths. Officials currently expect a death toll of around 60,000 by August. CNN host Jake Tapper asked if Fauci thought \u201clives could have been saved if social distancing, physical distancing, stay-at-home measures had started [in the] third week of February, instead of mid-March.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to go back and say that,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cI mean, obviously, you could logically say, that if you had a process that was ongoing, and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives. Obviously, no one is going to deny that. \u201cBut what goes into those kinds of decisions is complicated. But you\u2019re right. I mean, obviously, if we had, right from the very beginning, shut everything down, it may have been a little bit different. But there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then.\u201d Since the White House issued social distancing guidelines on 16 March, much of the country has gone into lockdown, shuttering the economy and leading to unprecedented and potentially ruinous unemployment. Chafing against such conditions in an election year, Donald Trump has been voicing an eagerness to reopen the economy as early as 1 May. On Sunday, Fauci, other experts and governors of hard-hit states were skeptical. Phil Murphy, governor of New Jersey, the state with the highest death toll after New York, told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation: \u201cIf we start to get back on our feet too soon \u2026 we could be throwing gasoline on the fire.\u201d The White House has not scheduled a press briefing for today. If Donald Trump does not appear it will be the first time since the president started his Covid-19 updates that he has missed two days in a row. It should be noted that there was no briefing scheduled for last Sunday either before one was called at the last minute. However, the president could help his popularity by missing a few. He has been accused of spreading misinformation and undermining his own advisers during the briefings, and there is some evidence even his own base may be tiring of his behavior during his appearances. Saturday\u2019s report in the New York Times detailing the Trump administration\u2019s failure to act on early warnings about the potential of Covid-19 to cause havoc in the US continues to cause a stir. On Saturday night, Donald Trump himself attacked the Times as \u201cfake news\u201d. On Sunday, Fox News host and Trump ally Sean Hannity ramped things up with a series of tweets directed at the Times and the newspaper\u2019s White House correspondent, Maggie Haberman. \u201cHey .@maggieNYT . @nytimes You should Thank .@Potus for the Travel Ban(s) put in place while you and .@Nytimes were fixated on impeachment and advising people to travel to China. #NYTimesEpicFail,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. He also called Haberman and the Times \u201ccorrupt and abusively biased\u201d and said \u201cit was your paper telling people it is safe to travel to China\u201d. Hannity, it should be noted, said early on in the Covid-19 outbreak that the virus was being overplayed by Democrats and the media to \u201cbludgeon Trump with this new hoax\u201d. He has since denied calling the virus a hoax. Reverend Brian X Needles delivers Easter Sunday mass via livestream from at Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church in South Orange, New Jersey. In an effort to include the congregation, Needles and the church staff attached pictures sent in by parishioners so that they may be there for today\u2019s celebration. Pope Francis, as well as many Christian leaders, pivoted to live streaming services during the pandemic. A police chief in Florida has been suspended for apparently claiming another officer\u2019s \u201chomosexual lifestyle\u201d was the reason he contracted coronavirus and died. Town managers in Davie placed chief Dale Engle on administrative leave after colleagues complained about his conduct at a fiery briefing this week at which they say Engle lambasted Broward sheriff\u2019s deputy Shannon Bennett, 39, a 12-year veteran of the agency. The Miami Herald obtained a copy of a letter written by the Florida fraternal order of police to Davie town administrator Richard Lemack. \u201cChief Engle allegedly yelled about a \u2018backstory\u2019 which proclaimed that Deputy Bennett contracted and died from the virus because he was a \u2018homosexual who attended homosexual sexual events\u2019,\u201d the letter says. \u201cHe intimated that it was because of the homosexual lifestyle that Deputy Bennett first contracted a serious underlying disease which aggravated the Covid-19 virus and lead to his death.\u201d According to the newspaper, Engle was placed on administrative leave Saturday evening while town officials investigate the allegations. Engle has not responded to requests for comment. Meanwhile, the Herald is itself in the news over a lawsuit its filing against the Florida governor Ron DeSantis. Its journalists have been pressing the governor to identify senior living facilities in the state where coronavirus deaths have spiked, information the newspaper says he has been withholding. The Herald is now accusing DeSantis of \u201cleaning\u201d on the attorneys\u2019 firm it used to draft a public records lawsuit demanding the information, and getting them to withdraw. The newspaper\u2019s publisher says it now plans to use another law firm to file the papers instead. The two sides have been at odds over DeSantis\u2019s patchy handling of the coronavirus crisis in Florida, especially since a Herald reporter was excluded from a press briefing in Tallahassee last month. The Associated Press reports that more than 2,600 deaths over the past two weeks in nursing homes and long-term care facilities have been linked to the coronavirus outbreak: Because the federal government has not been releasing a count of its own, the AP has kept its own running tally based on media reports and state health departments. The latest count of at least 2,646 deaths is up from about 450 deaths just 10 days ago. But the true toll among the 1 million mostly frail and elderly people who live in such facilities is likely much higher, experts say, because most state counts dont include those who died without ever being tested for COVID-19. Alarming outbreaks in just the past few weeks have included one at a nursing home in suburban Richmond that has killed 39 and infected 84, another at nursing home in central Indiana that has killed 24 and infected 16, and one at a veterans home in Holyoke, Mass., that has killed 37, infected 76 and prompted a federal investigation. This comes weeks after an outbreak at a nursing home in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland that has so far claimed 43 lives. And those are just the outbreaks we know about. Most states provide only total numbers of nursing home deaths and dont give details of specific outbreaks. Most notable among them is New York, which alone accounts for 1,439 nursing home deaths but has so far declined to detail specific outbreaks, citing privacy concerns. Experts say the deaths may keep climbing because of chronic staffing shortages in nursing homes that have been made worse by the coronavirus crisis, a shortage of protective supplies and a continued lack of available testing. And the deaths have skyrocketed despite steps taken by the federal government in mid-March to bar visitors, cease all group activities, and require that every worker be tested for fever or respiratory symptoms at every shift. Cuomo\u2019s pitched skirmish with New York City mayor Bill de Blasio has continued into a second day with the governor reasserting that a final decision on opening schools will be made by him. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to open any schools until it is safe from a public health point of view,\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cWe won\u2019t open schools one minute sooner than they should be opened, but we won\u2019t open schools one minute later than they should be opened either.\u201d On Saturday, De Blasio\u2019s announced that New York City\u2019s school district, which oversees 1.1 million students, would shutter for the rest of the academic year to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus, only for Cuomo to insist no decision had been made. The governor is only reemphasizing that line during today\u2019s briefing. \u201cAm I, as I sit here, prepared to say what we\u2019ll be doing in June? No,\u201d he says. \u201cI do not know what we will be doing in June. Nobody knows what we will be doing in June.\u201d Cuomo says he is signing an executive order requiring employers to provide essential workers with cloth or surgical face masks if they interact with the public, which is similar to the directive signed by New Jersey governor Phil Murphy. \u201cSpring is my favorite season,\u201d he says, comparing the coronavirus shutdown to the cold of winter. \u201cWhat spring says to all of us is it\u2019s a time of rebirth. That no matter how cold the winter, no matter how barren the landscape got, the earth comes back to life.\u201d He adds: \u201cThis has been a cold period from a societal point of view and we\u2019ve closed down in a way we\u2019ve never closed down. But we will come back to life and we will have a rebirth. And that\u2019s what spring is all about.\u201d Cuomo talks about the coordination that will be required for an evenutal re-opening of the economy, which is something he says everybody wants because we can\u2019t keep going on like this: \u201cYou almost lose track of what day of the week it is because they don\u2019t even have meaning anymore.\u201d \u201cWe need to be smart in the way we re-open,\u201d the governor says. \u201cWhat does smart mean? It means a coordinated approach, a regional approach and a safe approach. Nobody wants to pick between a public health strategy and an economic strategy. And as governor of the state, I\u2019m not going to pick one over the other. You need a public health strategy that is safe, that is consistent with an economic strategy. How do you re-open but how do you do it in a way that is smart from a public health point of view. Rhe last thing we want to see an uptick in that infection rate and an uptick in those numbers that we worked so hard to bring down. So we need a strategy that coordinates business and schools and transportation and workforce. \u201cWhat New York Pause did was it stopped everything at the same time. It was a blunt device, but it shut down everything at the same time. We\u2019re going to need testing, more testing, faster testing than we now have when you start to move people back to work. And we\u2019re going to need federal help, there is no doubt about that.\u201d Here\u2019s more from Ed Helmore on what New York mayor Bill de Blasio had to say this morning about his move to close New York City public schools until September: As New York City\u2019s coronavirus death toll climbs above 6,000, mayor Bill De Blasio has rejected a challenge from New York governor Andrew Cuomo over who has authority over the decision that will affect 1.3m students. \u201cThe right thing to do to beat back this pandemic is to keep the schools closed and that\u2019s really what it comes down to,\u201d De Blasio said. \u201cI want to absolutely respect the fact that the governor has a important crucial role to play in a crisis,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe children of this city, to the parents of this city and educators who serve this city, are my singular focus. \u201cThis is not about legal or jurisdictional questions, this is a moral question, how do we protect people best? The best way to protect people is to keep our schools closed.\u201d On Saturday, the mayor announced the city\u2019s schools would remain closed until September. Two hours later, Cuomo said that decision-making power rested with him \u2013 and he hadn\u2019t decided. On Sunday De Blasio downplayed notions of a rift. \u201cFrom beginning of the challenge of coronavirus, the governor and I have agreed on the vast majority of things. Our teams are working constantly together, so you know, there may be times when people have different perspectives. That\u2019s not unusual.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo says the total hospitalizations for coronavirus cases in the state is about 18,700 but the day-to-day change is down again. There were 53 new hospitalizations in the last day, which is the lowest since they started tracking. The governor reports there were 758 deaths in the last day, down from 783 the day before. A total of 9,385 people have died from Covid-19 across the state since the start of the outbreak, more than all but four countries. \u201cSomebody asked a question once: can you ever get numb to these seeing these numbers?\u201d he says. \u201cUnfortunately, no. Seven hundred fifty-eight people lost their lives in a 24-hour period. I speak to many families are who are going through this, many people who have lost loved ones. Every one is a face and the name in a family that is suffering.\u201d The great Bryan Armen Graham will be along shortly to take the controls from me, so I thought I\u2019d summarise where we are this Sunday morning: On the political talk shows, debate has largely centered around when Donald Trump might attempt to re-open the US for business. The president is eyeing 1 May, the day after federal social distancing guidelines expire, and spoke to Jeanine Pirro of Fox News about it on Saturday night. Public health experts including Dr Anthony Fauci of the White House task force and Dr Stephen Hahn of the FDA expressed caution \u2013 and Fauci mentioned the possibility of a resurgence of Covid-19 in the fall. World Health Organization Special Envoy Dr David Nabarro, meanwhile, told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press: \u201cWe think it is going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time to come until we can all have a vaccine that will protect us and that there will be small outbreaks that will emerge sporadically and they will break through our defenses. New York mayor Bill de Blasio and New York governor Andrew Cuomo remain at loggerheads over whether New York City public schools will stay closed until September. Ivanka Trump has wished British prime minister a continued good recovery from his stay in intensive care with Covid-19, which gave me an excuse to blog about Withnail and I. Here comes Bryan, anyway, to take us through Andrew Cuomo\u2019s daily briefing at 11.30am ET and everything else that occurs. Bill de Blasio, the New York mayor, has been discussing his disagreement with Andrew Cuomo, the New York governor, over the announcement on Saturday that New York public schools will remain closed for the rest of the academic year. De Blasio wants it, Cuomo said at a briefing on Sunday he did not, necessarily, agree. Ed Helmore has been watching and will chime in soon. Here in the meantime is Victoria Bekiempis\u2019s report on the whole sorry episode (despairing tone of sentence not at all dictated by blogger being a New York public schools system parent, no, not at all): More from Ed Helmore\u2026 Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr Stephen Hahn has walked back projections that the peak of Covid-19 deaths in the US would likely be seen today. \u201cI think that information is accurate,\u201d Hahn told ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cBut, again, we have to take this day by day as the data come in, because this has to be a data-driven approach.\u201d Responding to warnings that a much-cited model predicting a death toll of 60,000 in the US only applies if full social distancing is kept in place through the end of May, Hahn confirmed that reopening the country on that date, the day after the end of current federal social distancing guidelines, remains merely a target. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early to be able to tell that,\u201d Hahn said. \u201cWe see light at the end of the tunnel. We see the incredible resiliency of the American people with respect to social distancing, hand washing and all of those mitigation factors. So, that gives me great hope.\u201d But he added: \u201cI think it\u2019s just too early for us to say whether 1 May is that date. But more to come on that as we learn more information, and as our planning proceeds.\u201d Here\u2019s Donald\u2026 the president does not, at the moment, have a White House briefing on his schedule for Sunday. He did not stage one on Saturday, either. But he has been busy tweeting. \u201cA very good sign,\u201d he writes this morning, \u201cis that empty hospital beds are becoming more and more prevalent.\u201d Trump is looking at his home city, New York: \u201cWe deployed 418 Doctors, Nurses and Respiratory Therapists from the hospital ship Comfort and the Javits Convention Center to hospitals in NYC &amp; State. Have more bed capacity than was needed. Good!\u201d The USNS Comfort, docked off Manhattan island, and the temporary hospital set up at the Javits were initially meant to serve as release valves for the New York City hospital system, taking non-coronavirus cases. As such cases have fallen off dramatically in a city under lockdown \u2013 fewer car crashes, less crime, no elective surgeries and so on \u2013 they have been switched to the effort against Covid-19. The New York state figures, again, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University: 181,825 cases 8,650 deaths The president\u2019s cheerleading is of course understandable and part of his role as president, but it is also well to remember New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s solemn tone at his press briefing on Saturday. \u201cThat is not an all-time high,\u201d he said of the death toll, \u201cand you can see that the numbers [are] somewhat stabilizing. But it is stabilizing at a horrific rate.\u201d Away from the shows for a while, Ivanka Trump has wished British prime minister Boris Johnson a swift recovery, after he left hospital in London after a spell in intensive care. I\u2019m really blogging this as a chance to mention that Johnson\u2019s recovery has included viewings of the Lord of the Rings and Withnail and I. For anyone who doesn\u2019t know what a Withnail and I is, it\u2019s the greatest British film of all time (it is) and an enduring testament to, among other things, the writing and direction of Bruce Robinson and the greatness of star Richard E Grant, who not only now follows me on Twitter but is posting daily \u201cWithnail and Isolation\u201d videos to cheer devotees up in lockdown. And they do. Here\u2019s Toby Helm on the prime minister\u2019s recovery \u2013 and gratitude to the NHS: More from Ed Helmore: Maryland governor Larry Hogan has called for a study of coronavirus infections by race in his state, after describing the rate of cases among African Americans as \u201cvery disturbing\u201d. Asked what he was doing to protect minority Marylanders, the Republican told ABC\u2019s This Week he had called for the study because \u201cnobody was really tracking these things and it was difficult to do because none of the federal labs, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], nobody was actually tracking these tests by race.\u201d Around 7,600 people have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus in Maryland and more than 200 have died amid fears that Baltimore, which is 63% African American, could become a new outbreak hotspot. Last week, the Maryland department of health said African Americans have more confirmed cases and deaths from Covid-19 than other groups. While black residents make up 31% of Maryland\u2019s population, they make up the majority of deaths in the state from Covid-19 infections at 52%, and 49% of total coronavirus infections. Hogan, with New York governor Andrew Cuomo, has called on the Trump administration to give $500bn to states in direct assistance as they respond to the pandemic. Hogan told ABC \u201ca vast majority of our resources\u201d are focused on the Baltimore-Washington corridor. \u201cIt\u2019s where almost all of our attention and all of our focus, all of our money, all of our healthcare, all the assistance from the national guard, it\u2019s really where all of our testing is being done, it\u2019s where all of our healthcare is being ramped up, where we\u2019re adding 6,000 hospital beds.\u201d NBC\u2019s Meet the Press also spoke to World Health Organization Special Envoy Dr David Nabarro \u2013 not to be confused with Trump adviser, China trade hawk and coronavirus tsar Peter Navarro, about whom Julian Borger, our world affairs editor, wrote this must-read profile. Asked about what southern hemisphere experiences in the virus might teach us about the seasonality or otherwise of Covid-19, Dr Nabarro offered a disturbing thought: We think it is going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time to come until we can all have a vaccine that will protect us and that there will be small outbreaks that will emerge sporadically and they will break through our defenses. Nabarro was also asked about Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of the WHO and his threat this week \u2013 how serious he was was, as ever, unclear \u2013 to withdraw US funding for the international healthcare body: The World Health Organization actually works on behalf of all the governments in the world. And it operates within mandates that are given to it. And, and we have to rely on information that\u2019s received from different governments. And that then permits us to work out what\u2019s going on \u2026 but we know that there will be many things that are found to have perhaps not been done as well as they could have been done. And we\u2019re anticipating there\u2019ll be lots of examinations afterwards. Right now, we have to move forward. We have to get the best possible cooperation. I just heard you discussing with the head of the FDA some of the challenges, the things that we\u2019re learning about this virus all the time. That\u2019s why we need a strong WHO, a trusted WHO. And we hope all leaders will continue to work with us in that way. Meet the Press Chuck Todd asked that given \u201cthe United States is anywhere \u2013 approximately 15% to 20% of your annual budget \u2026 how devastating would it be if the United States pulled its funding?\u201d Well, you know, we\u2019re right in the middle of this massive epic struggle. Every single human being in the world is affected by it. Businesses are really in trouble. Communities are in distress. I really do hope that all nations will not find any reason to make threats or other such things that will undermine our capacity to bring together all the best knowledge that we can find. \u201cAnd of course we love our partnership with the United States. We work with United States scientists for years \u2026 and that would be so unfortunate if anything happened to lessen that cooperation. \u201cI know that Tedros [Adhanom Ghebreyesus], the director general, has had direct discussions with the president of the US. And he really does trust when \u2013 trust him when he hears from the president that respect for the WHO. And we hope that will go on. It\u2019s too important to have anything that disturbs the functioning of the international system at this time.\u201d Transcripts from the later shows are starting to come in, which is always handy. On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, FDA commissioner Dr Stephen Hahn faced similar questioning to Dr Anthony Fauci on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, specifically about whether a 1 May reopening or partial reopening of the US economy, which Trump hopes for, might prove possible. \u201cThe primary issue here is the safety and the welfare of the American people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has to come first.\u201d Hahn also said he had not felt political pressure on any decision. Pressed on the issue of testing \u2013 and how many Americans have had access to it \u2013 Hahn said: \u201cTesting is one component of the response to the outbreak, in addition to the mitigation efforts \u2026 So all hands on deck to try to get more diagnostic tests in. And we\u2019re seeing more people come forward with very novel approaches to getting more tests, so that is one component.\u201d He also said, however, he was \u201cconcerned that some of the antibody tests that are in the market that haven\u2019t gone through the FDA scientific review may not be as accurate as we\u2019d like them to be \u2026 We know \u2026 that no test is 100% perfect. But what we don\u2019t want are wildly inaccurate tests. Because, as I said before, that\u2019s going to be much worse, having wildly inaccurate tests than having no test.\u201d According to this version of the interview transcript, at least (a rush version sent by NBC), Dr Hahn was not questioned about hydroxychloroquine and Trump\u2019s support for its use as a treatment for Covid-19. Under federal guidelines for emergency use, doctors can prescribe the unproven anti-malarial drug if agreed with their patients. Next up on CNN is Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, who like seven other Republican governors has not issued a stay-at-home order. Are those who have issued such orders wrong? No, says Hutchinson, saying New York and New Jersey and other states are more densely populated than Arkansas, which he says is pursuing a targeted policy which is working. \u201cI\u2019d like to think we\u2019re at the peak but we\u2019re at least flat,\u201d he says, adding that there is optimism that things will be getting better. Tapper asks about towns and cities in Arkansas, which Hutchinson won\u2019t let issue stay at home orders themselves. The governor says mayors can issue curfews, close parks if they need to, but he wants to take a long term approach as \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as a true lockdown\u201d. He repeats his contention that Arkansans would not obey such an order, so why bother. \u201cIf we need to do more, we will do more,\u201d Hutchinson says, however. Tapper reads off the increase to more than 1,200 cases and at least 25 deaths in Arkansas and says extreme measures do work. Why not take them? Hutchinson says 1,200 cases is more than 1,000 cases short of \u201cthe projections\u201d. We have 80 hospitalised because of Covid-19 and 8,000 hospital beds available, the governor adds. \u201cWe\u2019ll do more if need be,\u201d he repeats. Hutchinson has said he supports mail-in absentee voting in Arkansas if the national emergency is ongoing. Tapper asks if he therefore does not agree mail-in voting fraud exists, as the president does. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned,\u201d he says. It\u2019s Easter, and church services in Arkansas are exempt from a ban on indoor gatherings of more than 10 people if they observe social distancing guidelines. People violating those guidelines will not be punished, Hutchinson says, but specific directives will be given. Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey is up next on CNN. He reports the deaths of 2,183 \u201cblessed souls\u201d from his state. Asked if the outbreak in Jersey has peaked, as some models suggest, Murphy says he hopes so but nothing will be done precipitously. Tapper asks if parts of New Jersey might be ready for a reopening by 1 May, as Donald Trump hopes. \u201cIt would be great,\u201d Murphy says but he wants health recovery first and then the economic recovery and reopening without \u201ccracking the back of this virus\u201d would be a disaster. So no, essentially. Or no, not likely. But it\u2019d be nice if it were possible. Does he have a plan to guard against a second wave of the virus if and when restrictions are lifted? Murphy says he is \u201cbeginning to war game on that\u201d. Does Jersey have enough coronavirus tests, enough labs, enough PPE for healthworkers and ventilators for patients? \u201cBroadly speaking the answer is no,\u201d he says. Jersey is still testing only for symptomatic patients, he says, and does not have universal testing for anyone who wants it, which the White House has long said Americans will have or even have already. Equipment shortages continue, he says. \u201cPlease God I hope we do a national post-mortem,\u201d Murphy says, hoping it will be bipartisan like the 9/11 commission was, when asked about whether Jersey prepared properly for the outbreak. Here\u2019s Ed Helmore \u2013 who is in Rockland county, a New York state coronavirus hotspot \u2013 with more on what Donald Trump told Fox News about reopening the US economy, or not, last night: Donald Trump has re-iterated his position that any decision to re-open the US economy will be his to make, saying the decision will be the biggest of his presidency. In a call to Jeanine Pirro on Fox News on Saturday evening, Trump said he would seek advise from many \u201csmart people\u201d before issuing any directive. Last week, the Trump announced he would establish a bipartisan \u201cOpening Our Country Council\u201d to weigh in on issue. \u201cA lot of very smart people, a lot of professionals, doctors and business leaders are a lot of things that go into a decision like that,\u201d he told Pirro. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be based on a lot of facts and a lot of instinct also. Whether we like it or not, there is a certain instinct to it. The council, Trump added, would include \u201csome of the most distinguished leaders in virtually every field, including politics and business and medical. And we\u2019ll be making that decision fairly soon.\u201d Trump\u2019s phone-in came ahead of an early morning tweet on Sunday in which he attacked a New York Times report which said the White House failed to act on several explicit security agency warnings in January about the potential for coronavirus to spread to the US. \u201cSo now the Fake News is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe, NOT China. This is a first! I wonder what the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs, and obviously want back in. Sad!\u201d Trump\u2019s interpretation of the report appeared to misconstrue scientific evidence that the spread of coronavirus to the Eastern US came through Europe \u2013 but not that it originated there. The claim comes despite evidence that trade adviser Peter Navarro warned Trump in 29 January memo that as many as 500,000 Americans could die if the virus was allowed to spread across the US unchecked. A day later, health and human services secretary Alex Azar issued a similar warning. The White House did not issue national social distancing guidelines until 16 March. On Saturday, Trump vowed to rebuild the US economy, which has suffered trillions of dollars in damage from the outbreak, as a tribute to those who have died. Trump predicted that the economy to rebound like a \u201crocket ship\u201d because Americans have combated the coronavirus the \u201cright way\u201d. \u201cWe did it the right way. We took care of social distancing and all of the things, words that nobody ever heard before, frankly, and phrases. But if we didn\u2019t do that, we would have pulled through it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere were estimates, 2.2 million people. Well, if you cut that in more than half and you said a million and cut that in half. You say 500,000, it just would have been unacceptable.\u201d Fauci says that it is not fair to compare the US response to that of South Korea, which has clamped down on its outbreak relatively effectively and swiftly. The US is where it is because of many factors, he says. Fauci is asked about a blockbuster New York Times report which said \u2013 among many other things about shortcomings in the Trump administration\u2019s response to warnings about the coming outbreak \u2013 Fauci wanted severe measures in February but Trump did not. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d he says. Tapper presses \u2013 Fauci parries: \u201cIt\u2019s the what would have and what could have.\u201d Such decisions are complicated, he says, repeatedly, before adding tellingly: \u201cThere was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then.\u201d Will it be safe for voters to go to the polls in November? \u201cI hope so, Jake,\u201d Fauci says. He doesn\u2019t want to be pessimistic, he says, but there is a possibility that fall and early winter could \u201csee a rebound\u201d. The experience of now will help then, he says, making it \u201can entirely different ball game.\u201d Fauci then speaks about the role of faith, and his in particular, on Easter Sunday. CNN are first, with State of the Union and host Jake Tapper. Here comes Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984. Is the US in the worst of the outbreak, with more than 2,000 deaths in a day and more than 20,000 in total? It\u2019s hard to tell, he says, but notes that this week was predicted to be bad. The New York metropolitan area is showing signs of flattening and \u201cstarting to turn the corner\u201d. The task force is feeling cautious optimism that a corner is being turned and sharp decline in cases could be relatively close at hand. Nothing will be done prematurely or precipitously, Fauci stresses. When restrictions are relaxed people will still be getting infected, he adds: that\u2019s called containment when right now the US is in mitigation. He speaks in praise of the states too, and governors\u2019 efforts. As Tom McCarthy writes here, the relationship between Trump\u2019s federal government and the states has not been smooth. Asked when he thinks reopening might happen, Fauci says \u201cIt is not going to be a light switch where we say OK it is now June, July or whatever and the light switch goes back on.\u201d Different parts of the country will reopen at different times \u2013 some places maybe \u201cat least in some ways maybe next month\u201d. \u2026Fauci continues to say it is very important not to view reopening society from social distancing and lockdown \u201cis not an all or none\u201d and \u201ceverybody knows that\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll hear the same thing from the governors,\u201d he says. The politics talk shows are coming up \u2013 making Sunday morning the time of any week in which weekend editors take a deep breath, make their sixth coffee since 6am and get their eyes down for the big prize, which is usually a vaguely contentious quote, a testy back-and-forth with Wallace, Tapper, Stephanopoulos, Brennan or Todd, or something that will just make Trump tweet. So, as Kurt Vonnegut said, it goes. Dr Anthony Fauci, leading White House public health expert and regular dampener-down of Trump-laid fires, is due up on CNN, so we\u2019ll watch that closely. Dr Stephen Hahn of the Food and Drug Administration is due up on a couple of shows too, probably to be asked about Trump\u2019s love for Hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial drug I still can\u2019t pronounce but which the president thinks people should take for Covid-19, unproven as it remains. Here\u2019s Julia Carrie Wong\u2019s excellent deep dive into all that: Politics news from Alaska, where Joe Biden won a Democratic primary on Saturday that was delayed by Covid-19. Bernie Sanders may have dropped out this week but he still won a few delegates. Biden, of course, is now the presumptive nominee to face Donald Trump in November. Of which, the Associated Press reports an interesting wrinkle: The primary was scheduled for 4 April, but Covid-19 upended plans. In response, the party, which had planned to offer voting by mail and at in-person locations, went exclusively to a vote-by-mail system. \u2026The party said it sent in early March ballots to every person who was registered as a Democrat as of mid-February, more than 71,000. The party also included voter registration forms and downloadable ballots on its website. Ballots had to be received by Friday to be counted, the party said. Trump, remember, really, really doesn\u2019t like voting by mail. He claims \u2013 and claimed again on Saturday night \u2013 it increases the risk of voter fraud. Experts disagree. Perhaps the real reason for the president\u2019s loathing for mail-in voting was, memorably, expressed to Fox &amp; Friends last month. Here\u2019s how the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine put it: Last week, he dismissed Democratic efforts in Congress making it easier to vote in the coronavirus era. Trump said the move would make it so \u2018you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again\u2019. Voting by mail, and Republican loathing for it, was also a key issue in this week\u2019s farcical and many said dangerous Wisconsin elections. Here\u2019s more from Sam: \u2026and welcome to another day\u2019s coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in the US. As usual, first the figures according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University: Confirmed Covid-19 cases in US: 529,843 Covid-19 deaths in US: 20,603 Confirmed cases in worst-hit state, New York: 181,825 Deaths in New York: 8,650 As we reported, Saturday saw the US, the country with by far the most coronavirus cases, ahead of Spain, become the country with the most coronavirus deaths, passing Italy. Donald Trump did not hold a White House briefing on Saturday \u2013 at the time of writing there is no briefing scheduled for Sunday either \u2013 but shortly after dumping on Fox News in a tweet which praised conservative rival OAN, the president called into Fox News to speak to Jeanine Pirro about, among other things, when he will attempt to reopen the US for business. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be the toughest decision I ever made and hopefully the most difficult I will ever have to make,\u201d the president said. \u201cI hope I\u2019m going to make the right decision. I will be basing it on a lot of very smart people, a lot of professionals, doctors and business leaders. There are a lot of things that go into a decision like that. And it\u2019s going to be based on a lot of facts and instincts. \u201cPeople want to get back to work \u2026 We are setting up a council of some of the most distinguished leaders in virtually every field, including politics, business and medical. And we\u2019ll be making that decision fairly soon.\u201d We\u2019ll have more on the president\u2019s thoughts as we go, and will keep an eye on the morning politics shows of course. In terms of Guardian reading to be getting on with, here\u2019s southern bureau chief Oliver Laughland\u2019s report on the coronavirus outbreak in the Deep South, where poverty and racism have created conditions ripe for a public health disaster: And here\u2019s our columnist Robert Reich, a former US labor secretary, on why millions donated to efforts to contain Covid-19 by Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Elon Musk and other billionaires might not be quite the selfless acts they seem:",

Mississippi governor Tate Reeves declared a state of emergency after saying several tornadoes had struck the state. In northern Louisiana, up to 300 homes and other buildings were damaged. Utility companies reported thousands of power outages. The storm provided a dilemma for public safety officials trying to find a balance between wanting people to stay in lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic and wanting them to leave their homes for shelter if conditions worsened. The American Meteorological Society, however, was unequivocal in its advice. \u201cDo not let the virus prevent you from seeking shelter in a tornado,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cIf a public tornado shelter is your best available refuge from severe weather, take steps to ensure you follow CDC [federal] guidelines for physical distancing and disease prevention.\u201d Community shelters, the meteorological society said, should be a last resort. The Louisiana twister touched down in the city of Monroe at lunchtime, where officials posted to Twitter images of damage from a number of locations. Buildings and aircraft at the town\u2019s airport were destroyed and managers closed runways to all air traffic. There were reports of damage in Kingston, Louisiana, 120 miles to the east, while local media said at least two tornadoes touched down in central Texas. The National Weather Service (NWS) issued tornado watches and warnings for several states across the south, including Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and Alabama, as the storm continued to march east. Severe weather warnings including flood watches were in place for parts of Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, the Carolinas and as far north as Tennessee. In all, up to 20 states could see some effects, weather experts warned \u201cStay safe and weather alert \u2013 it is a dangerous day in Mississippi,\u201d Reeves said in a series of tweets. \u201cPlease take today\u2019s severe storms very seriously. Please take precautions to keep your family safe. We are working and watching closely. Stay safe.\u201d Meteorologists said up to 95 million people could be affected by the massive storm through Sunday night and into Monday, with hailstones the size of tennis balls possible in places. \u201cThe severe weather threat currently over Mississippi will shift east into Alabama later this afternoon,\u201d the NWS storm prediction centre said in a bulletin issued at 2.45pm ET. The storm, it said, was \u201clikely to strengthen further as it moves into Alabama\u201d, bringing more tornadoes, winds up to 70mph and heavy rains leading to flooding. In a live broadcast on Facebook on Sunday afternoon, the NWS office in Jackson, Mississippi, told residents in some areas to seek immediate shelter as it confirmed a tornado on the ground in the state. It was not immediately clear if that touchdown had caused any damage. Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The unprecedented crash had already prompted oil and gas giants to defer investment decisions on projects including Woodside\u2019s massive Burrup Hub expansion off the Western Australian coast and Santos\u2019 $7bn Barossa project 300km north of Darwin. A decision on the first parts of the Burrup Hub expansion, including a $17bn development of the Scarborough gas field, has been pushed to 2021. Calls on Barossa and the largest section of the proposed Burrup Hub, a $30bn development of the untapped Browse gas field involving Woodside, Shell and BP, have been deferred to an unnamed date.

Skyrocketing LNG production has added significantly to the country\u2019s heat-trapping greenhouse gas pollution.

It could result in a further 80m tonnes a year when the gas was burned overseas. The fall in the oil price is yet to fully hit existing Australian gas projects as it takes about three months for changes in the crude benchmark to affect LNG contracts, but hundreds of oil and gas workers have been laid off or stood down as companies slashed planned investment this year. The oil price initially plummeted as Opec leader Saudi Arabia and Russia flooded the market, in part to undermine the US shale industry. Combined with the significant reduction in demand due to Covid-19 economic shutdown, it sent oil prices to their lowest level in 18 years. On Friday, the Saudi-led group known as Opec+ agreed to reduce oil supply by 10% to little immediate effect. Tom Swann, a senior researcher with the Australia Institute think tank, said a further complicating issue facing the oil and gas industry was the rising electrification of transport, which could lead to some investors rushing to get reserves out of the ground while there was a market to sell it into. \u201cThose three trends together [the pandemic, the geopolitical price war and electrification] just mean there is chronic uncertainty in the industry, and that\u2019s reflected in these companies share prices and investment decisions,\u201d he said.
