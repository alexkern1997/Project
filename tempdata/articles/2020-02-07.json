The Daily Telegraph editor, Ben English, who last week apologised for his headline \u201cChina kids stay home\u201d by saying it \u201cwas in no way intended to single out Chinese people\u201d, did not respond to a request for comment. Taking their cue from Blair, some of the readers\u2019 comments on the post are similarly offensive. Today flicks the switch to vaudeville With Karl Stefanovic back on the Today show couch after a year\u2019s break, Nine is trying to improve the breakfast show\u2019s ratings \u2013 which are trailing behind Sunrise on Seven \u2013 with some pretty desperate tactics. Stefanovic and co-host Allison Langdon have been fronting promos to give away a house: \u201cOne lucky viewer is going to travel to Melbourne and will walk away with the great Australian dream: a house and land package, and a new lifestyle. It\u2019s unbelievable. With one turn of a key, someone\u2019s life is going to change forever.\u201d But now they\u2019ve flicked the switch to vaudeville with a promo in the style of Silence of the Lambs with Stefanovic as Hannibal Lecter and Langdon as Clarice. \u201cI\u2019ve missed the smell of morning coffee,\u201d Stefanovic says. \u201cApparently I\u2019ve been a very naughty boy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A second Qantas coronavirus evacuation flight is scheduled to fly overnight on Friday to rescue more Australians from virus-hit Wuhan and take them to a quarantine site outside Darwin. On Friday the flight was still awaiting final approval from Chinese authorities to take people out of the locked down city in China\u2019s central Hubei province, but preparations were being made for Australians to leave for the new quarantine centre rather than Christmas Island, where the first Qantas evacuees were taken. Scott Morrison confirmed on Friday that a vacated former construction workers\u2019 village outside Darwin will be used as quarantine site for the evacuees. Australian citizens and permanent residents in Wuhan who have been approved for the flight have been told they must make their own way to the airport. Check-in for the flight was due to open just after 6pm Wuhan time on Friday. The flight was scheduled to leave just after midnight. In correspondence from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, passengers have been told: \u201cPlease allow sufficient time to arrive at the airport noting there will be a number of checkpoints en route. We are aware that there may be long delays at the checkpoint. \u201cAs a reminder you need to meet both Chinese and Australian government conditions, you will be subject to immigration checks by both governments.\u201d The flight is likely to be the last charter the Australian government is able to organise to leave Wuhan. Speaking in Townsville, Morrison said: \u201cWe will be moving to the contingency plans for overflow that we have been working on \u2026 we will be using a mining camp facility in the Northern Territory near Darwin and we are working through the consultation phase with local community and others about the implications of those arrangements.\u201d When the Australian government\u2019s initial charter flight, which left Wuhan Monday, was first announced, some Australians chose to stay in the city, preferring to wait for the outbreak to subside, but as it has spread and intensified, many are now taking the chance to leave. Globally, the outbreak has infected more than 31,000 people and killed 636, the vast majority of those in Hubei province. The first Qantas flight evacuated 243 Australian citizens and permanent residents to Christmas Island on Monday. Thirty-six Australians who left Wuhan on a NZ-government chartered flight on Wednesday were also eventually taken to Christmas Island. The second Australian flight appeared to be over-subscribed, the foreign affairs department said. \u201cThe number of people wanting to secure their return to Australia is far more than there are seats available on the flight.\u201d Some Australians in Wuhan approved for the flight are already making plans for the unpredictable journey through police and military checkpoints to reach the airport. Identification checks are being carried out up to three kilometres from the airport. On previous international evacuation flights, some passengers have not been able to reach the airport. Others have been refused boarding at final medical screenings. \u201cIf someone in your family has a fever or other symptoms, we advise they consider their options before they leave home,\u201d Dfat has advised. \u201cIf a fever is detected at a checkpoint it is possible they will be directed to a Chinese medical facility and not allowed to board the flight. The Chinese authorities consider 37.3 degrees temperature as the point you will require medical assistance.\u201d Passengers have been warned to expect long delays. \u201cThere are limited facilities at the airport. Access to water, electricity and toilets will be available. Restaurants and shops are closed at check-in and inside the terminal. \u201cWe recommend you bring some food provisions for you and your families at the airport to last you up to 10 hours. You will not be able to take food on the plane.\u201d Nearly 280 Australians are currently being held in isolation inside the Christmas Island immigration detention centre. The centre can house more than 1000 people, but because of the medical necessity to isolate coronavirus evacuees from each other, as well as the general community, to minimise the impact of any possible outbreak, the capacity of the centre is significantly reduced. The government\u2019s preference \u2013 advised by doctors managing the cohort on Christmas Island \u2013 was for a second quarantine facility elsewhere. The Manigurr-ma village, 30km outside Darwin, was built in 2012 by Japanese energy giant Inpex as accommodation for its workers. At the peak of construction work on Inpex\u2019s $55b gas plant on Darwin Harbour it housed around 3,500 workers. One student from the Good Shepherd Lutheran College, which shares a fence with the mining village, told Guardian Australia students were worried about being potentially so close to the infectious virus. The village has a medical centre, industrial kitchen, dining hall, cinema, library, gym and swimming pool. It was handed over to the NT government, on a peppercorn rent, in 2019. NT chief minister Michael Gunner confirmed he had had discussions with the federal government about using the facility as a quarantine site. \u201cObviously we are happy to help to make sure Australians are looked after,\u201d he said. \u201cOur priority in any of those conversations will be how do we make sure Territorians remain safe and healthy.\u201d Gunner said the federal government\u2019s now-defunct Wickham Point immigration detention centre could also be repurposed to house evacuees.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s eight most prominent universities have dismissed media reports that they are planing to quarantine international students on regional campuses as a result of the federal government\u2019s travel ban. Since 1 February foreign nationals have been barred from entering Australia within 14 days of leaving China, as a result of the novel coronavirus outbreak. On Friday, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Australian universities were \u201cdrawing up plans to quarantine thousands of international students\u201d on regional campuses or in student accommodation to reduce disruption to the start of semester. The University of Sydney\u2019s campus in Camden, 50km from its main site, was listed as a potential site. But Vicki Thompson, the chief executive of the Group of Eight (Go8), told Guardian Australia this was not under consideration by its universities. The Go8 comprises the University of Sydney, UNSW, ANU, the University of Melbourne, Monash, the University of Queensland, the University of Adelaide and the University of WA. A spokeswoman for the University of Sydney said it had \u201cno plans to use our Camden campus for isolation purposes\u201d. Under the current travel restrictions, any student who had left China and had been outside the country for 14 days without showing symptoms would not need to be further quarantined. International students contributed $34bn to the Australian economy last year, and the sector faces major losses from students cancelling enrolments. The travel ban has left nearly 100,000 Chinese students with valid visas stranded outside Australia, according to the latest figures from the Department of Home Affairs. Almost 59,000 Chinese international students are in Australia. As of Friday, there had been 15 confirmed cases of coronavirus across Australia, of which five people had recovered. Many universities have extended the deadline to enrol for the first semester, or to defer studies for a semester, or are offering online classes. On Thursday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told Radio National there \u201cmight be opportunities for some of the universities to provide quarantine for those Chinese students who are coming to Australia\u201d \u2013 but did not mention regional campuses. On Friday, the Go8 said it was implementing other measures to \u201cminimise the disruption to study\u201d. Thompson said where possible semester one programs could \u201cjoin seamlessly\u201d to semester two programs, especially for students close to completing their degrees. Monash University has pushed back the start date of the semester by a week, while more than 4,000 students at the University of Sydney signed a petition to delay theirs by a fortnight. The University of Sydney said it had arranged temporary accommodation for the \u201csmall number of students living in student accommodation that need to self-isolate\u201d. Financial analysts Moody\u2019s said on Friday that the financial hit of coronavirus and travel restrictions would be \u201cmanageable\u201d if it was contained within the next few months. But it noted that Australian universities were more dependent on international students from China than other OECD countries. Among the Go8, 60% of international student enrolments are from China, and they represent 40% across all universities. \u201cIf coronavirus is quickly contained \u2013 meaning within several months \u2013 the effect on Australian universities is likely to be manageable, with revenue deferred (not lost) and no change to credit quality,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. \u201cHowever, if the current outbreak is not contained quickly, the revenue effect and drawdown of cash reserves has the potential to be significant.\u201d The co-secretary of the NSW branch of the National Tertiary Education Union, Michael Thomson, said academics and teachers were worried by universities\u2019 confusing responses to the ban. \u201cThere is concern that university authorities are not being completely clear about what is happening,\u201d he said. \u201cPutting something back two weeks \u2013 does that mean a 13-week semester becomes an 11-week semester? \u201cIn a sense the concern is the unknown. It\u2019s almost like policy is being made on the hop.\u201d On Friday, the NSW NTEU and the University of Sydney\u2019s student representative council organised a protest against the travel ban. SRC president Liam Donohoe said earlier in the week the travel ban went against the advice of the World Health Organisation and led to international students \u201closing out on learning, work, relationships and communities\u201d to the extent that they \u201cmay never return\u201d.",

A national health crisis would be declared, and judging by the reaction to the coronavirus, panic would ensue. This public health crisis, which leaves its victims more than twice as likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias, has a name: loneliness.</p> <p>More than <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/loneliness-lethal-condition-therapy-psychology-cox-commission-ons-health-a8311781.html\" title=\"\">2 million adults</a> suffer from chronic loneliness; and although its most severe form is more prevalent among Britain\u2019s oldest citizens, <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/lonelinesswhatcharacteristicsandcircumstancesareassociatedwithfeelinglonely/2018-04-10\" title=\"\">younger adults report loneliness more </a> than any other age group.</p> <p>A desire for social connection is fundamentally hardwired into our psychology, and so being deprived of it has devastating mental and physical consequences.

Though this period was male-dominated, and the work often physically damaging, whole communities were based around mines, docks and factories.

The pub gives everyone a free drink, and they mingle: I found myself chatting to a woman born in 1939 who fought for equal pay in the 60s, and another who became isolated after spending years caring for her ill mother, and now fears there will be no one to care for her at the end of life.</p> <p>Here is an imaginative attempt to overcome loneliness and bridge Britain\u2019s generational divide. \u201cI think obviously there\u2019s a big difference between being lonely and being isolated,\u201d says Annie, a 26-year-old volunteer from Bath. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to feel lonely ... in London everyone is doing their own thing. But older people are genuinely isolated: there\u2019s no social structure around them, they often don\u2019t have family and friends around them.\u201d</p> <p>Here are clubs that build connections, and self-confidence too.

      "bodyText": "Imagine there was a virus you\u2019d never heard of which increased the likelihood of mortality by 26%, or a condition which had a death rate comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. A national health crisis would be declared, and judging by the reaction to the coronavirus, panic would ensue. This public health crisis, which leaves its victims more than twice as likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias, has a name: loneliness. More than 2 million adults suffer from chronic loneliness; and although its most severe form is more prevalent among Britain\u2019s oldest citizens, younger adults report loneliness more than any other age group. A desire for social connection is fundamentally hardwired into our psychology, and so being deprived of it has devastating mental and physical consequences. Yet we live in a society which has become ever more fragmented and atomised. This coincides with the decline of Britain\u2019s industrial era. Though this period was male-dominated, and the work often physically damaging, whole communities were based around mines, docks and factories. Call centres, supermarkets, office blocks and zero-hours work do not provide the same social connections. Indeed, in that era the problem was often the opposite of loneliness: of claustrophobia, of everyone knowing what everyone else was up to. Jobs have become more precarious and staff turnover has increased while union membership has plummeted, weakening workplace solidarity. Alongside this, the mass sell-off of council housing and the collapse of homeownership among younger people has forced many of them towards the insecure private-rented sector, leaving them unable to set down lasting roots in communities. While more than three-quarters of us think it would be better if we knew our neighbours, 73% of us don\u2019t even know their names. More and more of us live alone, and while some may consider the 28% rise in the numbers working from home as liberating, it is undoubtedly isolating too. The social spaces where we congregate and connect are dying. In the 1970s, there were more than 4,000 working men\u2019s clubs; just 1,300 remain. A quarter of Britain\u2019s pubs have closed since the beginning of the century. Nightlife is withering: in 2018 alone, the number of British nightclubs fell by a fifth. The decade-long fall in young people\u2019s living standards has robbed them of their collective spaces: hundreds of youth centres have closed their doors. And almost 800 libraries have been axed in the decade of austerity. Nonbelievers may welcome the collapse in British religiosity, but the decline in church attendance has meant that the chance to chat each week with other people has vanished. Is this unravelling of social connections inevitable and irreversible? On Tuesday night at the Old Red Lion pub in Kennington, south London, there were people in their 80s chatting to women six decades younger. This was the local group of The Cares Family: an initiative bringing together older locals and young professionals in urban areas. The pub gives everyone a free drink, and they mingle: I found myself chatting to a woman born in 1939 who fought for equal pay in the 60s, and another who became isolated after spending years caring for her ill mother, and now fears there will be no one to care for her at the end of life. Here is an imaginative attempt to overcome loneliness and bridge Britain\u2019s generational divide. \u201cI think obviously there\u2019s a big difference between being lonely and being isolated,\u201d says Annie, a 26-year-old volunteer from Bath. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to feel lonely ... in London everyone is doing their own thing. But older people are genuinely isolated: there\u2019s no social structure around them, they often don\u2019t have family and friends around them.\u201d Here are clubs that build connections, and self-confidence too. Activities range from singing in choirs to script reading. Some attract 150 people, young and old in equal numbers, ranging from working-class white residents from \u201cold London\u201d to first-generation migrants. The Cares Family is the brainchild of Alex Smith, a former Labour activist who met an octogenarian named Fred while door-knocking for a council election. Fred had never missed an election before, but he hadn\u2019t been able to leave the house in three months: so Alex wheeled him to the polling station, watching as Fred waved and smiled at people he hadn\u2019t seen for ages. Alex discovered that Fred had once run a fancy-dress shop in Camden Town that he visited in his youth. \u201cI realised there were a lot of people like Fred,\u201d Alex explains, with deep historic community connections but few current ones.

      "bodyText": "Top story: China doctor a \u2018hero who told the truth\u2019 Good morning, this is Graham Russell bringing you today\u2019s news. The government has significantly widened its response to the coronavirus epidemic, urging travellers from a range of countries to isolate themselves if they feel ill, after a third Briton tested positive for the virus. Health officials added eight destinations including Thailand and Japan to the list of at-risk areas, after it emerged that a middle-aged man had contracted the virus in Singapore. Recent travellers with a cough, fever or shortness of breath were told to stay indoors and call NHS 111, \u201ceven if symptoms are mild\u201d. In China the death of Li Wenliang, the doctor punished for sounding the alarm about the virus, has sparked fury at Beijing\u2019s handling of the crisis, spiralling into calls for freedom of speech. \u201cThey owe you an apology, we owe you our gratitude. Take care, Dr Li,\u201d said a Weibo post from Xiakedao, an account housed under the overseas edition of the People\u2019s Daily, a Communist party outlet. Online posts about Li\u2019s death were viewed more than 1.5bn views overnight, but were eclipsed views of posts translated as saying \u201cwe want freedom of speech\u201d before they were censored. \u201cIn the eyes of the people, Dr Li was the hero who bravely told the truth,\u201d said a state-affiliated financial newspaper, the Economic Observer. The vast majority of coronavirus cases \u2013 more than 31,000 \u2013 are in China, where there have now been 636 deaths. There have been more than 260 confirmed cases and two deaths in 28 other countries. We are covering all the latest updates here. * * * XR investigation \u2013 Counter-terrorism police ordered a formal assessment of the threat posed by Extinction Rebellion a year ago, showing its interest in the group began earlier and was more extensive than previously thought. The confidential assessment, Rising Up, concluded XR was not a terrorist or extremist threat. An XR spokesperson said police should make the report publicly available. Separately, the police watchdog has warned the public is increasingly not bothering to report some less serious crimes as dwindling resources mean their claims are often not investigated. * * * \u2018I\u2019ve got to kill somebody\u2019 \u2013 The 18-year-old who admitted pushing a boy from the 10th floor of the Tate Modern art gallery in London told his carers a year earlier of his plans to kill, an investigation has claimed. In an audio recording, Jonty Bravery allegedly tells his carers he wants to go to central London and visit a tall landmark to push somebody off it. Care provider Spencer &amp; Arlington told the BBC they had \u201cno knowledge or records of the disclosure\u201d but had reported the concerns to the Care Quality Commission. * * * From dock to centre stage \u2013 In 1999, following his impeachment trial, Bill Clinton said he was \u201cprofoundly sorry\u201d. In 2020, Donald Trump took a decidedly different tack: \u201cIt was all bullshit,\u201d he said in the East Room of the White House following his acquittal, blaming \u201cdirty cops\u201d in US intelligence for investigations into not only Ukraine but also his dealings with Russia. The president has begun his victory lap, Julian Borger writes, but there is plenty yet to come out on the Ukraine affair. In the meantime, says Tom McCarthy, it\u2019s time to brace for a Trump unleashed, with suggestions his sights are set on controlling the justice department. * * * Prince\u2019s birthday honour scrapped \u2013 Councils around the country will no longer be required to fly the flag on the birthday of Prince Andrew as the fallout from his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein continues. The Duke of York turns 60 on 19 February, but the occasion will not be marked by a flying of the union flag. He has also asked the Ministry of Defence to defer a promotion to admiral until he is able to fully resume royal duties * * * Grade I listed, despite the odd Beatle \u2013 A Liverpool pub that was once the haunt of the Beatles has become the first Victorian drinking den in England to receive a Grade I heritage listing. The Philharmonic Dining Rooms are regarded as \u201cthe pinnacle of the \u2018gin palace\u2019 form of pub\u201d and features mahogany fireplaces, mosaic-clad bar counters and Instagram-friendly gents with imitation marble urinals. * * * Today in Focus podcast: Why are the Oscars still so white? When the lists of nominees for the major film awards in 2020 were announced, there was, once again, a glaring anomaly. Not a single person of colour was nominated in the Baftas acting categories, while the Oscars managed only Cynthia Erivo for her part in Harriet. So what explains the glacial pace of change? Guardian arts and culture correspondent Lanre Bakare tells Anushka Asthana that there have been plenty of false dawns over the years in the quest for greater diversity. Also today: Joan E Greve on a hectic week of US politics after Donald Trump was formally acquitted in his impeachment trial and the Democratic party\u2019s Iowa caucuses descended into farce.

And so Manal\u2019s right arm shrank as her left arm grew stronger, and her father started to turn away when she was being bathed or dressed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand the sight of her,\u201d Abdullah Ali Lutfallah said. \u201cIt broke my heart.\u201d After a year and a half of negotiations, five-year-old Manal was among eight children to be evacuated from Sana\u2019a this week for medical treatment in Jordan on the first civilian flight permitted to leave the Yemeni capital in three years. A second aircraft carrying an additional 24 patients was scheduled to leave for Amman on Friday, with a third bound for Egypt expected to follow soon. The \u201cmercy flights\u201d are a rare humanitarian breakthrough in a stagnating five-year conflict between parties used to dealing in the zero-sum logic of war. Even the night before the first aircraft took off on Monday, the Houthis who control most of northern Yemen, including Sana\u2019a, threatened to withdraw permission. Yemen\u2019s internationally recognised government, which enforces a strict air-and-sea blockade on rebel-held territory, also held up the process at earlier stages. \u201cOn at least four occasions, a hard-fought consensus broke down and every time that happened, people who should have been receiving care died,\u201d a person familiar with the matter said. \u201cIt was deeply frustrating for everyone working on the issue because we all knew how many lives were at stake, and the people who needed help the most were the ones being sacrificed.\u201d For the past three months, a hotel in Sana\u2019a became a makeshift waiting room for about 30 families, some trying to keep their children alive long enough for Yemen\u2019s duelling governments to agree to allow them to go abroad for treatment. The Houthi health ministry says 32,000 people in the territory it holds are unable to receive proper medical care due to the blockade, which has been blamed for exacerbating a humanitarian crisis that has displaced 4.3 million people and left 80% of the population without enough food, safe water or sanitation. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it was really happening until the plane took off,\u201d said Majdi Abdulwahab, whose daughter Samira, 10, underwent reconstructive ear surgery at Amman\u2019s Speciality hospital on Wednesday morning, five years after being injured in a motorcycle accident.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus.

      "bodyText": "There is growing concern that the new coronavirus may be going undetected in Indonesia, where officials have not confirmed a single case of infection among the 272 million-strong population despite the country\u2019s close links to China. As of Thursday, Indonesia said it had no confirmed cases of the coronavirus and that 238 people evacuated from Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, had not shown symptoms, although it said they hadn\u2019t been tested. More than 630 people have been killed by the virus in China, while confirmed infections have passed 30,000 globally. Most cases are concentrated in China, though the virus has been recorded in countries across Asia, as well as Europe, Australia and the US. A study by academics from Harvard University analysed the number of passengers taking flights from Wuhan to destinations around the world, and found that the number of cases identified in both Indonesia and Cambodia appeared below what might be expected. The study, published quickly to improve scientists\u2019 understanding of the outbreak, has not been peer reviewed, but adds to mounting fears that cases are not being identified. It also suggested that cases recorded in Thailand, where 25 people have tested positive, were below the number scientists might expect to see. Cambodia has so far confirmed one case of coronavirus. Professor Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland, said that if cases were not being spotted, then there was a risk of further infection and new outbreaks emerging. \u201cYou\u2019d be thinking close contacts \u2013 family, close friends maybe business meetings \u2013 could be then infected by these cases and this could set up a little hotspot of infection.\u201d Scientists do not believe the disease is airborne, he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not really simple to pick up \u2013 you do have to have some face-to-face time with someone in order to pass that virus on.\u201d Hopefully, Mackay added, people will report to a doctor if they are sick, and they will then be quarantined accordingly once their travel history is observed. Reports have questioned the ability of Indonesia, the world\u2019s fourth most populous country, to test for the virus, though the Indonesian health ministry said on Wednesday that it has all the necessary resources. Indonesia, which receives significant Chinese investment, relies heavily on Chinese tourism. The country\u2019s Chinese-Indonesians are estimated to make up roughly 3% of the population. There is also concern over the thousands of Chinese tourists, including 200 people from Wuhan, who are reportedly stranded in Bali after direct flights to mainland China were banned by Indonesia. None of the tourists were showing symptoms, according to officials, but they are not in quarantine. Citizens evacuated evacuated from Wuhan, however, remain under observation at a military base on the remote Natuna island, where residents have protested against their presence.",

      "bodyText": "Well, that wraps up our live coverage of the Matildas\u2019 bumper 7-0 opening Olympic qualifying win over Taiwan. Thanks for joining us, and keep an eye out for Sam Lewis\u2019 take on the game early tomorrow morning AEDT. Ciao for now. There\u2019s some serious high-fiving going on between Kerr and a glut of kids. Just reward for a wet night out. That, and the fact the Matildas sit top of their group ahead of second-placed China. Foord is happy to have \u201cexecuted the game plan\u201d after all the turmoil and constant changes that left the team \u201cfeeling like it was matchday minus five for ages\u201d. More specifically, she\u2019s content her extra finishing training is paying dividends. \u201cI\u2019ve been really working on it personally in front of goal. I felt like that was an area where I wasn\u2019t confident,\u201d she told Fox Sports. \u201cAs a team we\u2019ve always kind of dropped our level against teams like this so we wanted to really play our level of football and keep that at a high intensity.\u201d FT: Australia 7-0 Taiwan The full-time whistle has blown and it marks a sound start for the Matildas\u2019 Tokyo qualification campaign. It wasn\u2019t perfect, and more challenging opposition awaits, but the women in green and gold provided some fine football that will, in turn, spike confidence ahead of clashes with Thailand and China. Take a bow Caitlin Foord, the newly signed Arsenal player who hit a hat-trick, and Steph Catley, Hayley Raso, Sam Kerr and Katrina Gorry who added a goal apiece in style. 92 min Australia 7-0 Taiwan Well, it\u2019s been a long time since Gorry last scored for the Matildas, but just reward for the substitute\u2019s shift tonight. Kellond-Knight floats one forward for Gielnik as Logarzo and co surge into the box. But it\u2019s Raso who steers the ball into the area and hugs the byline before her cutback deflects off the \u2018keeper and flies into the path of Gorry. Mini sticks out her right peg for the volley and picks out the bottom corner with all the precision of somebody who hasn\u2019t scored an international goal in nearly three years and wants a ticket to Tokyo. 90 min Australia 6-0 Taiwan Another brief squiz at the stats tells me Australia have played out this contest with 80 per cent possession. Given the clear discrepancy in quality, the Matildas might - perhaps should - have hit double figures by now. As I type, Gielnik is denied again by Taiwan\u2019s custodian, who has single-handedly saved her team from an even more embarrassing scoreline. 87 min Australia 6-0 Taiwan Logarzo dispatches a delightful ball into the path of Gielnik, who blazes into the area and cuts back for Kerr, but the Chelsea striker\u2019s less-favoured left foot (if that\u2019s possible) isn\u2019t quite particular enough and she diverts agonisingly wide of the net. 84 min: Australia 6-0 Taiwan Taiwan earn a corner after a backpass from McCormick gets Williams into a fumble. No sooner than Chen Yen-Ping has taken the set piece the ball is back in Australian possession at the halfway mark. 80 min Australia 6-0 Taiwan Kerr takes another swipe at goal but it\u2019s collected cleanly, before Gielnik makes her presence known via physical runs in behind. Milicic is on the sideline imploring his side to keep up the intensity. 75 min Australia 6-0 Taiwan The night is over for hat-trick heroine Foord, replaced by Bayern Munich forward Emily Gielnik. As she comes on there\u2019s more concern, this time for Catley, whose knee is being checked. 72 min: Australia 6-0 Taiwan Logarzo is down after landing awkwardly and clutching worryingly at her knee. The midfielder is attended to by officials but appears to pull up okay and looks as if she will continue to play on. Here\u2019s Kerr\u2019s goal ... 65 min: Australia 6-0 Taiwan CHANCE! Kerr very nearly makes it two goals in two minutes but for the offside flag, which was correctly raised. Kerr laughs as if to acknowledge she knew. 64 min: Australia 6-0 Taiwan It takes Kerr three minutes on the field to deliver. A beauty of a through ball from Logarzo provides the foundation but it\u2019s Kerr\u2019s composed first touch and incisive left-footed finish that ensures the chance is not wasted. That\u2019s why she\u2019s global star. 63 min: Australia 5-0 Taiwan Foord plays in Kerr and the poor battered Zhuo Li-Ping gets battered again by Raso as the Everton\u2019s latest signing puts her body on the line. 61 min: Australia 5-0 Taiwan Foord is relentless, this time ambushing two players and squeezing another top-drawer save out of Chen Si Yu. And Kerr is coming, replacing Simon and eliciting a cheer from the fans who have braved the wet to watch their team. 58 min: Australia 5-0 Taiwan Foord is hunting a fourth goal and Catley feeds, but she skews wide. Undoubtedly much to the fans\u2019 delight, Kerr is warming up. 54 min: Australia 5-0 Taiwan The underdogs have a free-kick and Zhuo Li-Ping cops a back-hander from Logarzo as she goes for the ball. And the Matildas are suddenly away on the counter-attack, Gorry with a lovely pass forward and Raso racing at full pelt into the box and around the goalkeeper to deposit the ball into an open net. That missed opportunity in the previous minute will be all but forgotten for now. 53 min: Australia 4-0 Taiwan Missed chance! And it would have been a sitter for Foord had Simon squared the ball to her inside the box. Except that she doesn\u2019t, hungry for a goal of her own, and misses. The Matildas then get a corner and Gorry has opted for a short corner (which rarely seems to have any effect whatsoever) to Raso, who embarks on a one-two with KK before being taken out by a defender. 49 min: Australia 4-0 Taiwan SAVE! Raso draws the save of the match from Chen Si Yu, who somehow gets a glove to it. Simon then has a crack herself and brushes the side netting. The chances are coming thick and fast for Australia in a frenetic start to this second half. The players are back out on the pitch and Milicic has replaced van Egmond with Katrina Gorry. What can \u2018Mini\u2019 do with this opportunity? It also must be said that may have been van Egmond\u2019s best display of the past 12 months. All in all a good half of football from the Matildas. Milicic has to be happy with four goals in 38 minutes. If anything, he\u2019ll want his side to pass more accurately and maintain the intensity - easier said than done against inferior opposition. While there were some errant passes the overall passing accuracy was at 86 per cent in the first half and the Matildas completed 404 passes to Taiwan\u2019s 96, to give you some idea of the way this contest has tilted. Here\u2019s Catley\u2019s goal ICYMI! HT: Australia 4-0 Taiwan Simon embarks on another foray forward and she really is in lovely touch, the striker who\u2019s injury problems ruled her out of last year\u2019s World Cup in France. Raso, meanwhile, is called offside and the referee\u2019s halftime whistle blows. 45 min: Australia 4-0 Taiwan Australia have a throw-in and it\u2019s misplaced by McCormick. The Matildas reset and the backline passes between themselves before van Egmond goes to Roestbakken and then Simon goes for a long-range strike but doesn\u2019t have enough on it. There\u2019ll be two minutes of added time in this first half. 42 min Australia 4-0 Taiwan It\u2019s difficult to ignore Taiwan\u2019s decidedly underwhelming defence in some moments of this game. But tell you what, Foord is thriving in that front wide role. She has been shuffled around throughout her already decorated career and even done defensive shifts, and Milicic tested her at No 10 earlier in his tenure before perhaps fully realising how to balance this squad best. 38 min Australia 4-0 Taiwan Foord has her hat-trick! Simon has her head up as she chips a well-placed long ball forward and the marginally onside van Egmond\u2019s first touch to Foord is equally as delicate. Foord takes it from there, barrelling inside the far post for her second international hat-trick. 34 min: Australia 3-0 Taiwan Logarzo is having beef with defender Zhuo Li-Ping and is pulled up just as the camera closes in on Kerr keeping warm on the sideline. She duly offers a wink. 33 min: Taiwan captain Ting Chi has a massive chance to pull a goal back and keep her side in this contest but her finishes sails marginally wide. 31 min: This time it\u2019s Catley, and the stand-in skipper doesn\u2019t miss. Chloe Logarzo is whipping in and out and passes to van Egmond, who pokes a through ball as Catley runs in behind two defenders and takes on goalkeeper Chen as she does. Chen trips her as she unleashes her finish, and had it not tucked into the net Catley may well have earned a penalty for Australia regardless. But it does, and the 26-year-old is on the turf flying an imaginary aeroplane in celebration of her third international goal. 30 min: Raso cuts inside this time and finds van Egmond, but the midfielder sprays wide. 26 min: Yet another chance goes begging as swathes of gold whir up the field, but Raso is caught out and dispossessed. 24 min: In the very next passage of play Foord has her brace, barely halfway through the first half. Catley finds Simon, who offloads to KK and then forward to Foord. It amounts to nothing but Australia win the ball back quickly and van Egmond is there for the reverse pass. Foord is all quick feet dancing around the \u2018keeper and prodding home right on the line. Life at the Gunners could be very sweet for the former Sydney FC star. Here\u2019s Foord\u2019s earlier effort: 23 min: We\u2019re not seeing much of Lydia Williams tonight, and Milicic will hope it stays that way. She\u2019s briefly called into action as Roestbakken tracks back and delivers a backpass and the Matildas are back up the pitch again. 20 min: Wang Hsiang Huei wins a free-kick and it should be noted that, while having only 22 per cent possession, Taiwan aren\u2019t afraid to get forward themselves, often through Chen Yen-Ping. 17 min: This pitch is clearly wet and heavy but it doesn\u2019t seem to be bothering the green and gold as Raso rinses Yu Chen-Lan inside the box and cuts back but there\u2019s confusion as Simon and Emily van Egmond both go for a shot that never eventuates. 9 min: It only takes nine minutes for Australia\u2019s No 9 to put her country on the board. Foord starts and finishes the move, passing the ball short to Simon and racing into a pocket of space to receive it back before slotting past the onrushing Chen. Solid start for the Matildas and something to build on against a side that haven\u2019t scored in their past five meetings with Australia. Come excellent collective movement helps Polkinghorne finds Raso, who has peeled off to her wide position on the right. Her cross is perfect and Logarzo is waiting at the back post, but her attempt to steer it home on the acute angle is in vain. Caitlin Foord, the ultimate utility, has drifted in from the left to get involved as Simon drops off the frontline and KK makes a lovely turn but it\u2019s tonight\u2019s captain Steph Catley who makes more metres with a pass that forces Taiwan\u2019s defence into action and goalkeeper Chen Si Yu to punch the ball safely away. Peep! And we\u2019re off! Roestbaken looks for an opening but is challenged by Chen Yen-Ping and Taiwan are back in possession. And the Matildas are just pinging the ball around patiently, Elise Kellond-Knight attempting to link up with Kyah Simon but forced to retreat. Expect Australia to dominate possession tonight. Weather update! Well the deluge has well and truly arrived in Sydney and its surrounds (wondering if it has anything to do with the lack of a pre-game show on Fox Sports?), but FFA remained confident with Campbelltown Stadium\u2019s drainage system that we\u2019re told will keep the pitch playable. We\u2019ll know for sure once the ball starts moving, but China have already played on it and made embarrassing work of Thailand to the tune of a 6-1 scoreline. The teams are out there now for the national anthems. Team news ... Sam Kerr\u2019s quad, which this week generated even more media interest than its owner, was deemed niggly enough for Milicic to rest his captain. But the 26-year-old Chelsea star, who has now been injured for three consecutive Olympic qualifiers dating back to 2012, will be a good shot at featuring in the other games, especially after new Football Federation Australia chief executive James Johnson took time out from studying the minutiae of office coffee pods to convince FIFA, the AFC, Chinese Football Association et al to push back the China fixture by 24 hours. Leading the line in her place will be Kyah Simon, who is rediscovering fitness and form at Melbourne City following her own longer-term injury woes, and flanked by two recent UK emigrants in Caitlin Foord (Arsenal) and Hayley Raso (Everton). There are regular defensive faces absent too, with right-back Ellie Carpenter making way for World Cup breakout Karly Roestbakken. Alanna Kennedy is also on the bench, allowing recent debutant Jenna McCormick to slot into central defence alongside Clare Polkinghorne. Good evening, and welcome to live coverage of the Matildas\u2019 first Olympic qualifying clash against Taiwan. Had all proceeded as planned in the land of the Matildas they\u2019d be readying to leave China bound for their respective clubs tomorrow morning, quite possibly with qualification already in the bag. But plans, as we know, are made to be broken. And the coronavirus was made to mutate, making way for a hurried cross-continental hop for the tournament that carries Australia\u2019s Tokyo hopes. Which leads us to tonight\u2019s location: Campbelltown Stadium. The place where, after weeks of uncertainty that included three scheduling changes and the Chinese team\u2019s quarantine at a Brisbane hotel, Ante Milicic\u2019s side will finally kick off their campaign against world No 40 Taiwan, who upset Thailand 1-0 earlier this week. Following that they\u2019ll face Thailand on Monday night in Campbelltown, before heading to Bankwest Stadium for Thursday night\u2019s crucial final showdown with China. For those unaware, the top two from Australia\u2019s Group B will play off against the top two from Group A (hosts South Korea, Vietnam, Myanmar, North Korea), with the two winners of that home-and-away tie qualifying for the Olympics starting in July.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It hopes to increase production to 2m masks by the end of the month.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn this war against the epidemic, every second counts,\u201d the company said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe earlier we take precautionary actions, the earlier we can prevent the virus, the earlier we can save lives, the sooner we can overcome this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Foxconn, which has previously come under scrutiny over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/18/foxconn-life-death-forbidden-city-longhua-suicide-apple-iphone-brian-merchant-one-device-extract\">poor conditions endured by workers making iPhones</a>, said it had already begun a test run of masks at its main manufacturing plant in Shenzhen, southern China.</p> \n<p>They will initially be produced for internal use by its hundreds of thousands of employees, the majority of whom work in factories in mainland China.</p> \n<p>After that, it will begin supplying masks to the wider public, from whom soaring demand has caused shortages as people trying to protect themselves from the virus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the dailyBusinessToday email or follow GuardianBusinesson Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Several other Chinese companies have said they will divert some of their production capacity to mask-making.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>It had felt like something of a no-brainer when the Premier League changed the kick-off of Spurs\u2019 game against last season\u2019s champions, Manchester City, to suit the Sky TV schedules. Why would I want to put myself through the pain of watching my team get annihilated when I also had tickets to see Ermonela Jaho give her debut recital at Wigmore Hall on the same day and there wasn\u2019t enough time to do both?</p> <p>But watching the match on TV (well, all but the last 10 minutes) before we headed off into central London, I began to have my doubts. This was the game in which Spurs managed to concentrate their entire season\u2019s good luck <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/feb/02/tottenham-v-manchester-city-premier-league-live\">into 90 minutes</a>. Man City totally dominated the game, while Spurs, despite playing just as indifferently as they have for most of the season, scored from the only two shots they had in the first 89 minutes. It was the jammiest 2-0 win you will ever see and Spurs now only need another three points to be sure of avoiding relegation. Surely even they can\u2019t screw this up?</p> <p>But once at the concert I knew I had made the right call. Two hours of the most sublime music making. Jaho is the world\u2019s finest soprano.

World King? The PM could be seriously unwell | John Crace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A quick recap. At a lobby briefing on Monday, No 10 had divided the journalists into two sections on either side of the carpet and told one lot that they were being kicked out. After a brief row, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/03/political-journalists-boycott-no-10-briefing-after-reporter-ban\">every journalist present walked out</a>. No 10 then tried to spin the walkout as a misunderstanding: the briefing had been for specialists only \u2013 but the only specialist present was among those who had been refused access.</p> <p>Earlier in the day I had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/03/shapeshifter-world-king-the-pm-boris-johnson-could-be-seriously-unwell\">found myself on the wrong end</a> of a Downing Street exclusion order when I was banned from attending the prime minister\u2019s Brexit speech in Greenwich. The official version was that it was \u201cstrictly one journalist per media outlet\u201d and the Guardian already had someone going. Only the Times was mysteriously allowed two journalists. A colleague who was there took a photo of several rows of empty seats.</p> <p>All governments try to control the media agenda by granting special access to favoured journalists who they trust not to question their side of the story, but Boris and Classic Dom are taking it to new levels. Even when her government was imploding Theresa May never tried to exclude me from anything to which other sketch writers were invited.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Preparations to host COP 26, the UN climate change conference, in Glasgow later this year appear to be in total disarray <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/04/sacked-cop-26-chair-claire-oneill-berates-boris-johnson-over-climate-record\">following the sacking of former Tory minister</a>, Claire O\u2019Neill, as head of the UK\u2019s organisation team. No 10 has claimed O\u2019Neill was not up to the job, while she has told the media that the government was hopelessly disengaged from COP26 and Boris Johnson didn\u2019t really understand the realities of climate change. Since then it has emerged that David Cameron was offered O\u2019Neill\u2019s job but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/05/david-cameron-turns-down-offer-of-cop-26-climate-summit-job\">turned it down on the grounds he was a bit busy</a>. Maybe, too, the money on offer just wasn\u2019t enough for him to rearrange his diary. It\u2019s now emerged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/31/david-cameron-accounts-brexit-vote-2016\">Cameron has made at least \u00a31.6m</a> \u2013 probably a great deal more \u2013 from various well-paid gigs that appear to have required little effort between leaving office in 2016 and April last year. Brexit has certainly been extremely kind to his bank balance. As it has to May. For the current register of interests shows that since stepping down as prime minister in July last year, May has earned \u00a3400,000 in addition to her MP salary. Bizarrely, the bulk of that money has come from public speaking. For one speech to JP Morgan Chase in London that would have taken up a maximum of five hours in preparation, travel and delivery time, May trousered a mere \u00a375K. Since there can\u2019t be anyone who hasn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/21/theresa-may-proves-herself-the-woman-who-has-nothing-for-everyone\">heard her give a speech</a>, one can only assume the former PM was hired as a comedy or curiosity act. There are few people who can lose an audience quite so quickly as May. So, as someone who has done as much anyone to publicise May\u2019s difficulties with sentence construction and absence of meaning, I\u2019m now waiting for my 15% commission. It would be my own Brexit bounce.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>Don Powell, Slade\u2019s drummer for the best part of 60 years, claims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/05/slade-drummer-don-powell-fired-over-email-after-57-year-partnership\">he has been fired from the group by email</a>. You\u2019d have thought the frontman, Dave Hill, might have at least chosen to end such a long relationship by FaceTime but perhaps he only does that for people he has known for 75 years. Presumably, Dave still considered Don to be a relative newcomer to the band. Bizarrely, for someone who was pathologically unreliable and totally disengaged throughout my 20s while doing a series of jobs in which my employers clearly regretted my existence almost as much as I did, I have only ever been sacked once. And that was totally deserved and done face to face. It was during the heatwave of 1976 and I was working an ice cream machine, that would have failed all current health and safety legislation, outside a souvenir shop in Leicester Square. After a couple of months my time-keeping had become increasingly erratic \u2013 principally because I was up most nights taking large quantities of every drug on offer and was finding it harder and harder to fit in a job around my antisocial life. One afternoon I was startled to get a tap on my shoulder. My boss had been doing his rounds \u2013 he owned numerous concessions in the West End \u2013 and had found me passed out while propped up against the ice cream machine. He didn\u2019t even bother to shout at me. He just gave me a weary look of resignation and politely told me it was time I went home and didn\u2019t come back. I could only agree. I\u2019m not sure who was more relieved, him or me.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>It seems hard to believe that it is still only early February as the year seems to be dragging by. Not that I have managed to achieve that much while time has slowed down. Rather, my inner world has been dominated with feelings of acute anxiety, depression and a sense of futility. On many days it has been a real battle to get out of bed. Things that should provide pleasure have felt increasingly transient and out of reach while even my dreams have given me no respite from a feeling of dread. At times I have felt as if I was doing little more than existing. Going through the motions of being John. Or a barely remembered version of John. I\u2019ve been too depressed even to worry about getting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/what-is-coronavirus-wuahn-china-outbreak-doctor\">the coronavirus</a>. As ever, my family have done more than their fair share of holding me together. As have friends and work colleagues, and seeing the garden coming to life each day always gives me a moment\u2019s buzz. If the bananas, palms and echiums can survive the winter, then so can I. But I\u2019ve also had so much support from so many readers. Some have sent random gifts, such as old Spurs photographs from the 60s and 70s, others have written emails of encouragement. Just last week I had dozens of emails telling me where I could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/31/leavers-brexit-night-bash-sounds-like-a-question-time-from-hell\">find a red squirrel</a>. Come the spring, I\u2019m off to either Brownsea Island or the Isle of Wight and will report back. Only last night at a book event in Haslemere, a reader gave me a pot made from the clay under the old White Hart Lane pitch more than 100 years ago. The gift couldn\u2019t have been more perfect, combining my passion for football and ceramics. So a big thank you to all of you for helping keep me sane.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The chief executive, Marco Gobbetti, said: \u201cThe outbreak of coronavirus in mainland China is having a material negative effect on luxury demand.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile we cannot currently predict how long this situation will last, we remain confident in our strategy.

That was much higher than a Reuters poll forecasting a 160k rise, and December number which was revised up from 145k to 147k. Luxury goods group Burberry became the latest company to warn that its business is being knocked by the coronavirus outbreak. Burberry\u2019s finance chief said the virus was having a greater impact on business in Hong Kong than recent anti-government protests. Burberry\u2019s stock price fell as much as 3.2% at the market open but pared losses later in the day. Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam was outsed following what was undoubtedly a tense board meeting on Thursday. It follows a bitter boardroom battle that escalated after a spying scandal that engulfed the Swiss bank last year. The Halifax House Price Index came in higher than expected, with prices up 0.4% month-on-month in January to an average of \u00a3240,054. That\u2019s compared with Reuters forecasts for a flat reading. S&amp;P Global Ratings expects Chinese GDP growth will fall to 5% for 2020, down from previous forecasts for 5.7% growth due to the coronavirus outbreak. A quarter of US firms say the coronavirus will hit revenues by 16%, according to a new survey by the American Chambers of Commerce in Shanghai That\u2019s all from us today. Have a great weekend and we\u2019ll be back on Monday -KM Naeem Aslam, a chief market analyst at online trading platform AVA Trade, says excitement about the bumper US jobs figures won\u2019t last long: The US NFP number rocked the markets. Throughout this week, we have seen investors brushing away all ill thoughts about markets and today\u2019s number has put a final seal on this. The bottom line is that the data has confirmed that the US job market is solid and tight. Having said this, we do have concerns that the positive impact of this jobs report may not last long because the fact that China has delayed its release of economic number, and major warnings coming from Burberry, indicates that investors are likely to see tumultuous time. More details on US jobs figures: The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.6%, versus forecasts for the rate to remain steady at 3.5%. Average earnings have risen year-on-year by 3.1%, which is higher than estimates for 3.0%. US non-farm payrolls have come in at 225k for the month of January. That compares to a Reuters poll forecasting 160k, and is much higher than December\u2019s tally which was revised up from 145k to 147k. Foxconn, the electronics company that supplies Apple, has begun manufacturing its own surgical masks, allowing Chinese workers to churn out iPhones uninterrupted as the coronavirus crisis continues. The Taiwanese company\u2019s production lines have been shut down because of the disruption caused by the outbreak, slowing down the supply chain that feeds Apple\u2019s global retail network. However, in a statement released via the Chinese social media platform WeChat, Foxconn said it hoped to get around the problem by switching some of its own production lines to make masks, for its own staff and to supply the soaring global demand for them. It hopes to ramp up production to 2m masks by the end of the month. \u201cIn this war against the epidemic, every second counts,\u201d the company said. You can read the full story here: Mihir Kapadia, the CEO of Sun Global Investments, says the coronavirus could have a long term effect on the stock market: The short-term rally in global stocks has expectedly began to show signs of slowing as the growing death rate and the economic impact the coronavirus has had has become more understood. Despite the efforts of the Chinese government to contain the virus and its wide spreading impact, the death roll has doubled in a week while more than 31,000 have been infected in what is a sign that the situation is not slowing. He added: Investors have wisely been playing a cautious game, but it will take time for any government action to come into effect. However the fact that much still remains unknown about the coronavirus, and the key question whether it has yet reached his peak, could potentially have a long-lasting effect on the markets even if it is contained and dealt with. Nearly a quarter of US companies in China expect their revenues to fall by at least 16% this year due to the coronavirus. That\u2019s one of the stark statistics from a new American Chambers of Commerce in Shanghai survey released today. The \u201cmini-survey\u201d polled 127 companies including 20 that derive $500m of their revenues from China alone. Here are some of the main findings: Thursday\u2019s bounce didn\u2019t last for European stocks. Today, a mix of profit-taking and coronavirus jitters seem to be weighing on markets. Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.5% while the French Cac is down 0.3%. The FTSE 100 is the worst performer in Europe and is down 0.7%. All eyes are now on US jobs numbers, with non farm payrolls due at 1:30pm UK time. The Financial Conduct Authority has fired a warning shot at insolvency practitioners (read: administrators) after learning that there have been illegal attempts to sell customers\u2019 personal data after a company goes bust. Passing on that data may breach key data protection rules like GDPR. We are aware that some insolvency practitioners and FCA-authorised firms have attempted to sell clients\u2019 personal data to claims management companies (CMCs) unlawfully. This can happen either before or after a firm has gone into administration and where it is likely claims for compensation will be made to FSCS (Financial Services Compensation Scheme). The terms, conditions and clauses within a standard contract are highly unlikely to constitute sufficient legal consent for personal data to be shared with CMCs to market their services, and may not be lawful. Claims management firms have been looking for the next big earner after the deadline for payment protection insurance claims closed last year. The FCA statement also warned CMCs to \u201cact honestly, fairly and professionally\u201d and in the best interest of customers. CMCs using such personal data may not be acting in the customers\u2019 interests. CMCs seeking to rely on legitimate interest grounds for processing such data are highly unlikely to meet the requirements of the GDPR. CMCs that intend to buy and use such personal data must be able to demonstrate how they have considered the fair treatment of customers and how their actions comply with privacy laws. The statement, which was co-signed by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office and FSCS, didn\u2019t name individual companies that may be in breach of data rules. However, it warned that authorities would \u201ctake appropriate action\u201d where they identify illegal sales. Overnight, S&amp;P Global Ratings estimates that Chinese GDP growth will fall to 5% for 2020. That is down from forecasts for 5.7% growth before the outbreak. And this might be a bold prediction, but S&amp;P is also claiming that the virus could be contained by March 2020. It claims most of the impact will be felt in the first quarter, but that a recovery will be in place by the third quarter. China should bounce back in 2021 with 6.4% growth compared to previous forecasts for 5.6%. Shaun Roache, the Asia-Pacific chief economist for S&amp;P Global Ratings, said: We expect the effect to be more drawn out than in SARS given the longer time to reach peak infections and the more vigorous policy response, especially travel restrictions, in this episode. Household consumption will take the main hit, especially spending on discretionary goods and services as individuals avoid public spaces to minimise the risk of infection. One of our readers got in touch with concerns about our post on Halifax house price data for January. He made the point that \u201cbetter than expected\u201d made it sound like higher costs for housing was a positive result, full stop. I agree that it\u2019s more accurate to say \u201chigher than expected\u201d so I\u2019ve made that change. Thanks for making the point, Keith. Burberry\u2019s finance chief Julie Brown has said the impact of the coronavirus on the business has been more significant than recent protests in Hong Kong. Footfall at the 44 stores that are still open in mainland China have dropped by up to 80%, with customers staying home amid the outbreak. Speaking to the FT (\u00a3) this morning, she said: It is more serious in Hong Kong than the protests The story confirms that none of Burberry\u2019s staff have been diagnosed with the virus. One story is rocking the banking world this morning and that\u2019s the surprise resignation of Credit Suisse CEO Tidjan Thiam. It follows a bitter boardroom battle that escalated after a spying scandal that engulfed the Swiss bank last year. With my hands full with the blog today, the banking reigns have been handed to my capable colleague Mark Sweney. He reports: The bank\u2019s board announced on Friday morning that it had \u201cunanimously accepted\u201d the 57-year-old\u2019s resignation and that Thomas Gottstein, the current head of Credit Suisse\u2019s home business in Switzerland, will take over as chief executive. The board also gave its full support to the chairman, Urs Rohner, to complete his term until April 2021. Thiam and Rohner have been in conflict since it emerged that the Zurich-based bank had hired a corporate espionage company to follow Iqbal Khan, the former head of the bank\u2019s wealth management division, shortly after he left for a position at rival UBS. Credit Suisse insisted it was a one-off incident but then months later admitted a second executive had been tracked by private detectives. The full story is here: The Halifax House Price Index has come in higher than expected, with prices rising 0.4% month-on-month compared to Reuters poll for a flat reading. On an annual basis, January house prices were 4.1% higher than the same time last year to reach an average of \u00a3240,054. But Russell Galley, a managing director at Halifax, warned against overblowing the results: A number of important market indicators continue to show signs of improvement. We have seen a pick-up in transactions with more buyer and seller activity consistent with a reduction in uncertainty in the UK economy. However, it\u2019s too early to say if a corner has been turned. The recent positive figures may actually represent activity that would ordinarily have been expected to take place last year, but was delayed by economic uncertainty. So while housing market activity has undoubtedly increased over recent months, the extent to which this persists will be driven by housing policy, the wider political environment and trends in the economy. You can read the full Burberry release here: European markets are back in the red after a bounce yesterday: FTSE 100 down -0.2% French CAC 40 down -0.1% German DAX down -0.3% Spain\u2019s IBEX down -0.25% Burberry\u2019s London-listed shares are down 3.2% at the start of trading, making it the worst performing stock on the FTSE 100. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Luxury goods group Burberry has become the latest company to warn that its business is being knocked by the coronavirus outbreak, which has forced the company to temporarily close more than a third of its 64 stores in mainland China. Its remaining outlets in the country are running with reduced hours and have suffered a significant drop in footfall. In an unexpected update this morning, the British fashion house said the outbreak was having a \u201cmaterial negative effect on luxury demand\u201d, adding: We are taking mitigating actions but the benefit in the current year will be limited given the proximity to our March year end. We also intend to continue our key growth initiatives in preparation for a recovery in luxury demand. We will provide a retail trading update following our financial year end. Burberry assured that while it can\u2019t predict \u201chow long this situation will last\u201d, it was still confident in its strategy. We are extremely grateful for the incredible effort of our teams and our immediate thoughts are with the people directly impacted by this global health emergency. It comes just days after rival luxury group Capri Holdings \u2013 which is behind brands including Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo and Versace \u2013 warned that the disruption could hit revenue by around $100m (\u00a377m). It said estimates \u201ccould materially change if the severity of the situation worsens\u201d. Later today, we are expecting US non-farm payrolls for January. Investec estimates are for the US economy to have added another 180k jobs, which would be an increase from the disappointing 145k logged for December. The agenda 1.30pm GMT: US non-farm payrolls for January, plus average earnings",

Here, one of them, a 32-year-old English teacher who has lived in Wuhan for the last four years, describes what it has been like living under quarantine.</p> \n<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> \n<p>This morning we were all given a note saying that someone on the second evacuation flight fell ill on the plane and was taken straight to hospital for tests. A couple of people asked if they were OK, but it didn\u2019t cause a panic or anything. What did cause a commotion is that \u2013 even though food is being provided for us by the NHS and by local people \u2013 some people are still ordering takeaways (on the taxpayers\u2019 money), and today they announced it would have to stop.</p> \n<p>Up to this point, we\u2019ve been given sandwiches and ready meals. It\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s free. But from tomorrow night, a catering company will be serving us food, so people can\u2019t order any more takeaways. That caused a bit of a stir in the WeChat group we\u2019re all part of \u2013 people weren\u2019t very impressed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e27e66d2c56aa1f10894876d8c813a8327bba45f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e27e66d2c56aa1f10894876d8c813a8327bba45f/0_1144_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A takeaway being delivered to the isolation accommodation at Arrowe Park hospital\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A takeaway being delivered to the isolation accommodation at Arrowe Park hospital before the practice was stopped.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lindsey Parnaby/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Today I\u2019ve been revisiting the TV classics, watching Peep Show on my friend\u2019s laptop, reading JG Ballard, listening to podcasts \u2013 and that is really about it.</p> \n<p>I\u2019ve basically lost one of my friends from Wuhan to his Fifa addiction. I think the people running this place were expecting loads of families, so they bought loads of games consoles, but there are only three or four children here. So suddenly there were all these brand new games consoles up for grabs \u2013 my friend snatched one up and I haven\u2019t really seen him since.</p> \n<p>What happens to these consoles when we get out of here? I don\u2019t think anyone took a record of who\u2019s got one and I really don\u2019t think anyone will be counting them back in. I hope they get donated to children\u2019s wards or something. It would be great if I could have a laptop of my own. If they gave me Football Manager \u2013 or something you can really get your teeth in to \u2013 the time would fly by.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> \n<p>I woke up and had a bath \u2013 I don\u2019t have a bath in China so that\u2019s quite a nice thing.</p> \n<p>Some local people have donated books to us. I\u2019m a big reader but these are rubbish. That sounds really ungrateful but, I mean, they\u2019re terrible. There\u2019s not even a Dan Brown. Say what you like about Dan Brown \u2013 that guy sold a lot of books \u2013 but these are by people you\u2019ve never heard of.</p> \n<p>I think the place is run by a private company on behalf of the NHS. You can email an order to them and two hours later whatever you asked for shows up. There\u2019s a guy who has ordered bottles of wine, spirits and two crates of beer and he\u2019s keeping them in his bedroom. Tonight he offered me some wine. I felt like I was going into a bar. He gave me a paper cup full of wine. I thought: \u201cAre you kidding me? This is ridiculous!\u201d He\u2019s ordered all of it through this company and they\u2019ve given it to him for free, no questions asked. It\u2019s incredible.</p> \n<p>I watched some daytime BBC soap operas today \u2013 Doctors, it was unbelievably stupid. Christ, that was the highlight of the day \u2013 that\u2019s bleak!</p> \n<p>There is a communal area but people don\u2019t seem to be using it. I\u2019m keeping mostly to myself. I sat with one of my colleagues from Wuhan while he watched some old episodes of Oz, but we\u2019re all just doing the same thing.</p> \n<p>This diary isn\u2019t going to be very interesting, unless someone develops symptoms, which you never know. We\u2019re right in the middle of the optimum time to start showing symptoms, assuming that you got infected on the flight \u2013 I think if anyone is infected that\u2019s probably when it happened.</p> \n<p>People are just counting the time, in any way they can.</p> \n<h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> \n<p>I slept for most of the day today. I seem to be sleeping a lot since I got back here. It\u2019s 7.35pm now and I\u2019ll probably be asleep by 10pm. In my whole life it\u2019s very unusual for me to go to sleep before midnight. Maybe it\u2019s the jet lag but we\u2019ve been back almost a week now.</p> \n<p>I\u2019ve got through most of JG Ballard\u2019s short stories now \u2013 I\u2019m reading about seven of those a day \u2013 and I\u2019m watching loads of YouTube videos.</p> \n<p>I\u2019ve also been walking the stairs for exercise. You can go outside. There is a garden, but it\u2019s a stone garden, there\u2019s no grass or anything so I\u2019ve been walking up the stairs to my bedroom on the seventh floor \u2013 it\u2019s the only way I can see of getting any exercise. I don\u2019t exercise normally \u2013 I\u2019m notoriously lazy \u2013 but I do try to walk the hour home from my work in Wuhan if the weather\u2019s not bad, just to say that I did.</p> \n<p>The guy who ordered the booze has got even more now. He\u2019s getting more alcohol delivered than any reasonable person could drink every day, and he doesn\u2019t seem to drink it. I think he\u2019s hoarding it to have a party when he gets back home or something. It\u2019s weird.</p> \n<p>My friend says he\u2019s getting really good at Fifa now and I\u2019m still keeping to myself. Everyone else seems to be fine, nobody seems to be ill, which is the main thing.</p> \n<h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27223d24ff470cb696c410d43780424b6652b67b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27223d24ff470cb696c410d43780424b6652b67b/0_133_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bacon breakfast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No more bacon breakfast</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel Roddis/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Some idiot has complained about the breakfasts. Up until this morning, breakfast has been really good \u2013 a banging bacon and sausage sandwich. That\u2019s the way to start the day, especially when you can\u2019t get good bacon in China. But somebody complained about always having the same thing every day so when I went downstairs for breakfast, there were these dismal-looking Danish pastries, some rubbish-looking Dutch cheese and some salami. I thought: \u201cWhat is this?\u201d When you\u2019re in quarantine, you don\u2019t have much to look forward to. Meals are a big thing \u2013 and then the thing you look forward to has been replaced by a fairly poor effort at a continental breakfast. I don\u2019t know if breakfast is worth going down for anymore.</p> \n<p>We got a release date. As long as nobody\u2019s showing symptoms, we can leave on Thursday morning. I feel good because I was expecting to leave the Saturday after, so that\u2019s two days gained. As of Sunday, it will become very unlikely that anyone will start to show symptoms, so we should know by then if we\u2019ll be leaving on Thursday.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s a huge gender imbalance here. There are far more men than women, and I don\u2019t think there are many single ladies, so as far as I know there are no romances blossoming. But people are organising nightly dinners now. You can\u2019t order takeaways anymore but you can still order food from supermarkets and people have started cooking in their rooms and inviting people to join. As of yet, I haven\u2019t gone because I don\u2019t particularly know them and I want to stay healthy. I\u2019m not worried that I\u2019ll get ill, but it increases the chance. I sit with people I know for half an hour a day to stop me from going insane, but I think it\u2019s best to keep the number of people I interact with small.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"89cc69a6-7caf-46d2-b8e6-1ec5399094b8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qmYoeQGqLas?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> \n<p>Breakfast was back to normal this morning, fortunately. They\u2019ve done a good compromise \u2013 they still had the rubbish, but they put the good stuff back as well. It gets the day off to a flying start.</p> \n<p>I\u2019m 12 hours closer to getting out of here. I have potentially less than a week left in quarantine but it could all go wrong. If somebody develops symptoms between now and Thursday, who knows what\u2019s going to happen. We might all be back to square one \u2013 potentially back to 14 days in quarantine. Nobody\u2019s actually said that but I do know that if anyone displays symptoms we\u2019re not getting out of here on Thursday. And hopefully time goes quickly and they start giving us some ideas of how we get to where we\u2019re going, because I only have Chinese money on me.</p> \n<p>When I do get out, I\u2019m going to see a friend who lives not too far away, and then I\u2019ll travel down south to see my family \u2013 I last saw them a year ago in Hong Kong.</p> \n<p>Going back to Wuhan has not been discussed. The rent is paid on my apartment for a few months, so there\u2019s no rush, but I\u2019ve left my degree and teaching certificates and other things behind, so I will have to go back to Wuhan at some point. I don\u2019t think Wuhan will go back to normal for a while.</p>",

Monday This morning we were all given a note saying that someone on the second evacuation flight fell ill on the plane and was taken straight to hospital for tests. A couple of people asked if they were OK, but it didn\u2019t cause a panic or anything. What did cause a commotion is that \u2013 even though food is being provided for us by the NHS and by local people \u2013 some people are still ordering takeaways (on the taxpayers\u2019 money), and today they announced it would have to stop. Up to this point, we\u2019ve been given sandwiches and ready meals. It\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s free. But from tomorrow night, a catering company will be serving us food, so people can\u2019t order any more takeaways. That caused a bit of a stir in the WeChat group we\u2019re all part of \u2013 people weren\u2019t very impressed. Today I\u2019ve been revisiting the TV classics, watching Peep Show on my friend\u2019s laptop, reading JG Ballard, listening to podcasts \u2013 and that is really about it. I\u2019ve basically lost one of my friends from Wuhan to his Fifa addiction. I think the people running this place were expecting loads of families, so they bought loads of games consoles, but there are only three or four children here. So suddenly there were all these brand new games consoles up for grabs \u2013 my friend snatched one up and I haven\u2019t really seen him since. What happens to these consoles when we get out of here? I don\u2019t think anyone took a record of who\u2019s got one and I really don\u2019t think anyone will be counting them back in. I hope they get donated to children\u2019s wards or something. It would be great if I could have a laptop of my own. If they gave me Football Manager \u2013 or something you can really get your teeth in to \u2013 the time would fly by. Tuesday I woke up and had a bath \u2013 I don\u2019t have a bath in China so that\u2019s quite a nice thing. Some local people have donated books to us. I\u2019m a big reader but these are rubbish. That sounds really ungrateful but, I mean, they\u2019re terrible. There\u2019s not even a Dan Brown. Say what you like about Dan Brown \u2013 that guy sold a lot of books \u2013 but these are by people you\u2019ve never heard of. I think the place is run by a private company on behalf of the NHS. You can email an order to them and two hours later whatever you asked for shows up. There\u2019s a guy who has ordered bottles of wine, spirits and two crates of beer and he\u2019s keeping them in his bedroom. Tonight he offered me some wine. I felt like I was going into a bar. He gave me a paper cup full of wine. I thought: \u201cAre you kidding me? This is ridiculous!\u201d He\u2019s ordered all of it through this company and they\u2019ve given it to him for free, no questions asked. It\u2019s incredible. I watched some daytime BBC soap operas today \u2013 Doctors, it was unbelievably stupid. Christ, that was the highlight of the day \u2013 that\u2019s bleak! There is a communal area but people don\u2019t seem to be using it. I\u2019m keeping mostly to myself. I sat with one of my colleagues from Wuhan while he watched some old episodes of Oz, but we\u2019re all just doing the same thing. This diary isn\u2019t going to be very interesting, unless someone develops symptoms, which you never know. We\u2019re right in the middle of the optimum time to start showing symptoms, assuming that you got infected on the flight \u2013 I think if anyone is infected that\u2019s probably when it happened. People are just counting the time, in any way they can. Wednesday I slept for most of the day today. I seem to be sleeping a lot since I got back here. It\u2019s 7.35pm now and I\u2019ll probably be asleep by 10pm. In my whole life it\u2019s very unusual for me to go to sleep before midnight. Maybe it\u2019s the jet lag but we\u2019ve been back almost a week now. I\u2019ve got through most of JG Ballard\u2019s short stories now \u2013 I\u2019m reading about seven of those a day \u2013 and I\u2019m watching loads of YouTube videos. I\u2019ve also been walking the stairs for exercise. You can go outside. There is a garden, but it\u2019s a stone garden, there\u2019s no grass or anything so I\u2019ve been walking up the stairs to my bedroom on the seventh floor \u2013 it\u2019s the only way I can see of getting any exercise. I don\u2019t exercise normally \u2013 I\u2019m notoriously lazy \u2013 but I do try to walk the hour home from my work in Wuhan if the weather\u2019s not bad, just to say that I did. The guy who ordered the booze has got even more now. He\u2019s getting more alcohol delivered than any reasonable person could drink every day, and he doesn\u2019t seem to drink it. I think he\u2019s hoarding it to have a party when he gets back home or something. It\u2019s weird. My friend says he\u2019s getting really good at Fifa now and I\u2019m still keeping to myself. Everyone else seems to be fine, nobody seems to be ill, which is the main thing. Thursday Some idiot has complained about the breakfasts. Up until this morning, breakfast has been really good \u2013 a banging bacon and sausage sandwich. That\u2019s the way to start the day, especially when you can\u2019t get good bacon in China. But somebody complained about always having the same thing every day so when I went downstairs for breakfast, there were these dismal-looking Danish pastries, some rubbish-looking Dutch cheese and some salami. I thought: \u201cWhat is this?\u201d When you\u2019re in quarantine, you don\u2019t have much to look forward to. Meals are a big thing \u2013 and then the thing you look forward to has been replaced by a fairly poor effort at a continental breakfast. I don\u2019t know if breakfast is worth going down for anymore. We got a release date. As long as nobody\u2019s showing symptoms, we can leave on Thursday morning. I feel good because I was expecting to leave the Saturday after, so that\u2019s two days gained. As of Sunday, it will become very unlikely that anyone will start to show symptoms, so we should know by then if we\u2019ll be leaving on Thursday. There\u2019s a huge gender imbalance here. There are far more men than women, and I don\u2019t think there are many single ladies, so as far as I know there are no romances blossoming. But people are organising nightly dinners now. You can\u2019t order takeaways anymore but you can still order food from supermarkets and people have started cooking in their rooms and inviting people to join. As of yet, I haven\u2019t gone because I don\u2019t particularly know them and I want to stay healthy. I\u2019m not worried that I\u2019ll get ill, but it increases the chance. I sit with people I know for half an hour a day to stop me from going insane, but I think it\u2019s best to keep the number of people I interact with small. Friday Breakfast was back to normal this morning, fortunately. They\u2019ve done a good compromise \u2013 they still had the rubbish, but they put the good stuff back as well. It gets the day off to a flying start. I\u2019m 12 hours closer to getting out of here. I have potentially less than a week left in quarantine but it could all go wrong. If somebody develops symptoms between now and Thursday, who knows what\u2019s going to happen. We might all be back to square one \u2013 potentially back to 14 days in quarantine. Nobody\u2019s actually said that but I do know that if anyone displays symptoms we\u2019re not getting out of here on Thursday. And hopefully time goes quickly and they start giving us some ideas of how we get to where we\u2019re going, because I only have Chinese money on me. When I do get out, I\u2019m going to see a friend who lives not too far away, and then I\u2019ll travel down south to see my family \u2013 I last saw them a year ago in Hong Kong. Going back to Wuhan has not been discussed. The rent is paid on my apartment for a few months, so there\u2019s no rush, but I\u2019ve left my degree and teaching certificates and other things behind, so I will have to go back to Wuhan at some point. I don\u2019t think Wuhan will go back to normal for a while.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Gilead, a company that makes HIV drugs, has announced it will trial its drug remdesivir in the coronavirus outbreak. The drug was tested during the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018, but the Congolese authorities announced it was not sufficiently effective against the virus.</p> \n<p>The new trial of remdesivir will be gold standard, investigating how well it works in both moderately and severely ill patients compared with others given a placebo.</p> \n<p>Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at Oxford University, said it was impossible to predict whether any of the drugs would be effective against the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>\u201cNobody honestly knows. Most drugs that go into trials prove to be not effective. It is the more common outcome.

Trials are absolutely critical or you end up in limbo. The Chinese are really taking that on board.\u201d They could have some answers within three or four months, he said.</p> \n<p>But fear of the coronavirus has prompted many people to seek their own supplies of Kaletra, also known as Aluvia, which is drug company AbbVie\u2019s off-patent version of lopinavir/ritonavir and the only one approved for sale in China \u2013 even though there is no evidence at the moment that it can help treat those who fall sick.</p> \n<p>HIV patients have been offering their pills on Chinese social network Weibo.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe felt like we were organised for a military mission,\u201d said one of them, Andy Li, who has the nickname Brother Squirrel because he hoards stocks of his drugs. Hundreds of messages flooded in when they offered the pills, leaving him barely any time to sleep or eat in the first three days, he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are so many people in need of the drug, and I don\u2019t want to waste time,\u201d Li told Reuters. \u201cTime is life.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/04/coronavirus-sars-preparedness-investment-wuhan\">Coronavirus is a deadly test: did the world learn the lessons of Sars? | Jennifer Rohn</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Others have seen a money-making opportunity, and have been buying stocks from India.

Gilead, a company that makes HIV drugs, has announced it will trial its drug remdesivir in the coronavirus outbreak. The drug was tested during the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018, but the Congolese authorities announced it was not sufficiently effective against the virus. The new trial of remdesivir will be gold standard, investigating how well it works in both moderately and severely ill patients compared with others given a placebo. Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at Oxford University, said it was impossible to predict whether any of the drugs would be effective against the coronavirus. \u201cNobody honestly knows. Most drugs that go into trials prove to be not effective. It is the more common outcome. One should be very cautious,\u201d said Horby, who pioneered drug trials in the massive Ebola outbreak in west Africa. If drugs are not given under strict trial conditions, he said, \u201cwe end up where we were after the 2009 [influenza] pandemic.\u201d More than 40,000 people were treated for influenza by doctors with experimental drugs, mostly oseltamivir, better known as Tamiflu, which is licensed for seasonal flu but not for use in an epidemic. The crucial data on their condition and the difference the drugs made compared with other drugs or no drugs was not collected. \u201cPeople gave it [Tamiflu] because they thought there was no harm, said Horby. \u201cYou end up with large numbers of people being treated without the evidence you could have got. Trials are absolutely critical or you end up in limbo. The Chinese are really taking that on board.\u201d They could have some answers within three or four months, he said. But fear of the coronavirus has prompted many people to seek their own supplies of Kaletra, also known as Aluvia, which is drug company AbbVie\u2019s off-patent version of lopinavir/ritonavir and the only one approved for sale in China \u2013 even though there is no evidence at the moment that it can help treat those who fall sick. HIV patients have been offering their pills on Chinese social network Weibo. \u201cWe felt like we were organised for a military mission,\u201d said one of them, Andy Li, who has the nickname Brother Squirrel because he hoards stocks of his drugs. Hundreds of messages flooded in when they offered the pills, leaving him barely any time to sleep or eat in the first three days, he said. \u201cThere are so many people in need of the drug, and I don\u2019t want to waste time,\u201d Li told Reuters. \u201cTime is life.\u201d Others have seen a money-making opportunity, and have been buying stocks from India. Gatsby Fang, a Chinese cross-border buying agent, said he sold each bottle for 600 yuan (\u00a366) each, earning 200-300 yuan in profit on each. His stock was sold out within two days. Some clients ordered 600 tablets at once, he said. Until the trial results are in, most patients will receive supportive care in hospital, which means fluids and support for their breathing, if they need it, and for other organs if they begin to falter. Most healthy people\u2019s immune systems fight off the virus and they recover. Meanwhile, UNAids, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and Aids, says it is important that people with HIV continue to take their own medication and do not take risks by giving or selling their tablets to other people. \u201cUNAids stresses the importance of people on HIV treatment adhering to treatment and for access to adequate supplies of antiretroviral medicines to continue without interruption. People living with HIV must not be put under any pressure to go without or give up their medication,\u201d it said in a statement.",

The world is running out of masks and other protective gear, with demand increasing 100-fold and prices soaring, the WHO has warned. The test used to diagnose coronavirus is being rolled out to laboratories across the UK from Monday, increasing testing capacity to more than 1,000 people a day. Hong Kong has announced six-month jail terms for breaching quarantine conditions. The 14-day mandatory quarantine for visitors arriving from mainland China is expected to reduce the number of people crossing the border. Art Basel, Asia\u2019s largest annual art fair, has been cancelled. It was scheduled to take place at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre from 19 March. A British man on a Japan cruise ship has tested positive for coronavirus. He is one of 61 passengers diagnosed aboard the Diamond Princess, moored off Yokohama. Singapore reported three more coronavirus cases with no travel history in China. The country moved its disease outbreak response up a level to \u201corange\u201d The first plane carrying Canadian evacuees from Wuhan touched down in Ontario. The 176 to arrive today will be followed by a second group of 39 tomorrow. The cruise line operator Royal Caribbean has said it will refuse any passengers with Chinese, Hong Kong or Macao passports, regardless of when they were last in China. The remarkable statement comes after reports that about two dozen passengers aboard a cruise ship that docked in Bayonne, New Jersey, on Friday morning were screened for coronavirus and four were sent to a local hospital for further screening. In a statement published on its website, Royal Caribbean said that none of the four passengers tested showed clinical signs or symptoms of coronavirus, although one tested positive onboard for flu. However, the company said it would be adopting a number of health screening protocols, including the following: Regardless of nationality, any guest or crew member traveling from, to, or through mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macau less than 15 days prior to their sailing will be unable to board any of our ships. Any guests holding a Chinese, Hong Kong, or Macau passport, regardless of when they were there last, will not be allowed to board our ships. Any guest or crew member that has been in contact (which the CDC defines as 6 feet or 2 meters) with someone that has traveled from, to, or through mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macau less than 15 days. Additionally, there will be mandatory specialized health screenings performed on: a. Guests who are unsure if they have been in contact with individuals who have traveled from, to or through mainland China or Hong Kong in the past 15 days; b. Guests who report feeling unwell or demonstrate any flu-like symptoms; c. Any guest presenting with fever or low blood oximetry in the specialized health screening will be denied boarding. Burberry has said the coronavirus is having a devastating effect on the luxury goods market, as wealthy Chinese consumers stay away from shops, and travel restrictions curb overseas shopping sprees, Zoe Wood reports. The British company closed 24 of its 64 stores in mainland China and those that remained open were operating with reduced hours because shopper numbers had plunged 80%. None of the group\u2019s employees in China had been diagnosed with the illness, it said. The chief executive, Marco Gobbetti, said: \u201cThe outbreak of coronavirus in mainland China is having a material negative effect on luxury demand. \u201cWhile we cannot currently predict how long this situation will last, we remain confident in our strategy. In the meantime, we are taking mitigating actions and every precaution to help ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees.\u201d A plane carrying 176 Canadians repatriated from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the coronavirus epidemic, has touched down in Ontario, Reuters reports. A second group of 39, who left China on a US flight, should arrive later on Friday after switching planes in Vancouver, Francois-Philippe Champagne, minister of foreign affairs, told reporters on Thursday. No one on board the plane, which landed in Trenton airforce base, showed symptoms of the coronavirus or other illness during the flight, health minister Patty Hajdu told CBC Radio. All evacuees will be quarantined on the base for two weeks, separated from each other in a building that resembles a small hotel, with families kept together. There is growing concern that the new coronavirus may be going undetected in Indonesia, where officials have not confirmed a single case of infection among the 272 million-strong population despite the country\u2019s close links to China, reports Rebecca Ratcliffe, the Guardian\u2019s south-east Asia correspondent. As of Thursday, Indonesia said it had no confirmed cases of the coronavirus and that 238 people evacuated from Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, had not shown symptoms of the illness, although it said they hadn\u2019t been tested. More than 630 people have been killed by the virus in China, while confirmed infections have passed 30,000 globally. Most cases are concentrated in China, though the virus has been recorded in countries across Asia, as well as Europe, Australia and the US. China is the workshop of the world. It\u2019s where most of the west\u2019s consumer electronics come from. And if you were worried that supplies of digital goods might run out, fear not. The juggernaut of capitalist production continues. Foxconn, the electronics company that supplies Apple, has begun manufacturing its own surgical masks, allowing Chinese workers to churn out iPhones uninterrupted as the coronavirus crisis continues, Rob Davies reports. The Taiwanese company\u2019s production lines have been shut down because of the disruption caused by the outbreak, slowing down the supply chain that feeds Apple\u2019s global retail network. However, in a statement released via the Chinese social media platform WeChat, Foxconn said it hoped to get around the problem by switching some of its own production lines to make masks, for its own staff and to supply the soaring global demand for them. Demand for masks, gowns, gloves and other protective gear has risen by up to 100 times and prices have soared due to the China coronavirus outbreak, producing a \u201csevere\u201d disruption in supply, the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is reported as saying by Reuters. \u201cThis situation is exacerbated by widespread use of personal protective equipment outside patient care,\u201d he told reporters in Geneva, adding that he had spoken to manufacturers and distributors to ensure supplies for those who need them. He also said he could see practices such as hoarding in order to ensure higher prices, and called for solidarity from the public and private sector. The upgrading of the coronavirus alert level in Singapore has sparked panic-buying of essentials in some shops across the island, Reuters reports. Earlier, we reported that the city state had raised its alert level to orange, after three more cases of the illness were diagnosed. According to Reuters: With the disease reviving memories of Sars, which killed more than 30 people in Singapore and hundreds worldwide, shoppers started clearing shelves of toilet paper, noodles and rice, and formed long queues in supermarkets across the island on Friday evening, videos posted on social media showed. Singapore\u2019s trade minister, Chan Chun Sing, said in a Facebook post: I understand that people are concerned after the announcement this afternoon. However, we must ... not hoard items unnecessarily. This will create undue panic and is unhelpful to the situation at hand. This is Damien Gayle taking over the live blog now for the rest of the afternoon (it\u2019s 3.20pm here in London). As usual you can reach me on email at damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via my Twitter profile, @damiengayle The test used to diagnose coronavirus is being rolled out to laboratories across the UK from Monday, increasing testing capacity to more than 1,000 people a day. Currently coronavirus is tested and diagnosed in one laboratory in London, but testing will be extended to 12 labs across the country over the coming weeks. At its laboratories in London, Public Health England (PHE) has the capacity to process samples from more than 100 people a day. Now, to ensure that the country is prepared for further cases and to speed up the time taken to get results, the test will be carried out by trained scientists across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This will increase testing capacity to more than 1,000 people a day for England. Prof Yvonne Doyle, PHE\u2019s medical director, said: Once China confirmed that they had identified a novel coronavirus, Public Health England was ready to test potential cases in this country. We have now trained scientists in labs across the UK to conduct the specialist test \u2013 ensuring that we are well prepared should we begin to see an increased number of cases across the country. The test, developed by PHE, made the UK one of the first countries outside China to have assured testing capability for the new coronavirus. When a clinician suspects coronavirus in a patient, they take samples from the nose, throat and deeper respiratory tract and send them for laboratory testing. Using the diagnostic test, scientists can look for evidence of the presence of any type of coronavirus and then hone in on specific genetic clues that identify the novel coronavirus associated with this outbreak. The UK-wide roll-out is the fastest deployment of a new test to PHE and NHS labs in recent history, including in the swine flu pandemic in 2009. In addition to processing samples from suspected cases in the UK, PHE is now working as a reference laboratory for WHO, testing samples from countries that do not have assured testing capabilities. Passengers on a cruise ship that docked in New York City on Friday morning are being tested for the coronavirus, it has been confirmed. An official from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told CNN: There are folks on the ship that have a history of travel to China and so CDC and local health officials are going to board the ship when it docks to do an assessment in port for coronavirus. Video footage showed ambulances and stretchers on standby near the port at Bayonne, and personnel boarding the ship. An earlier post said that the first North Korean case had been confirmed. In fact, the North Korean authorities are yet to confirm the South Korean media report on the development. The original post has now been deleted. You can read more about the situation here. Travellers from China face up to six months in jail and a maximum fine of HK$25,000 (\u00a32,491) for breaching quarantine measures, Hong Kong\u2019s government has announced. At a press conference on Friday, the chief secretary, Matthew Cheung, said the 14-day mandatory quarantine for visitors arriving from mainland China is expected to reduce the number of people crossing the border. People involved in cross-border logistics and workers essential to government services would be exempted from quarantine but monitored closely. From Saturday, people entering the city will be required to sign a document consenting to the quarantine measures, while travellers with visas or permits valid for less than 14 days will be barred from entering Hong Kong. Cheung stressed the quarantine policy would not affect the flow of goods from the mainland. He said: I urge these people, especially those quarantined at home, to have a social conscience and civic responsibility, be cooperative and self-disciplined. Any rule breakers will be breaking the law. One person in Hong Kong has died from coronavirus. Communist party investigators in China are looking into issues raised by the public about a whistleblower doctor who was threatened by police for sharing his concerns about the virus, from which he later died. Following an online uproar over the government\u2019s treatment of Dr Li Wenliang, the ruling Communist party said it was sending a team to fully investigate relevant issues raised by the public regarding the case. Li, 34, was one of eight medical professionals in Wuhan who tried to warn colleagues and others about the new virus. He wrote on Weibo that on 3 December he saw a test sample that indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to Sars, which killed nearly 800 people in a 2002-2003 outbreak. After he reported seven patients had contracted the virus, he said he was visited by police on 3 January, who forced him to sign a statement admitting to spreading falsehoods and warning him of punishment if he continued. Li later developed a cough and fever before he was hospitalised on 12 January and began to have trouble breathing. His death was confirmed on Friday, prompting a deluge of mourning and outrage at the way he and the seven others had been treated. Even the staunchly pro-government Global Times newspaper said the eight whistleblowers\u2019 treatment \u201cwas evidence of local authorities\u2019 incompetence to tackle a contagious and deadly virus\u201d. Most of the deaths from the virus have been of older people with existing health problems, but disease specialists said Li\u2019s work may have increased his exposure and made his illness severe. More fall-out to the spread of the coronavirus outside China as Swedish telecoms giant Ericsson has become the latest firm to pull out of an international conference in Barcelona later this month because of the outbreak. The telecoms equipment manufacturer has withdrawn from the Mobile World Congress in the Spanish city, which is scheduled to take place between 24 and 27 February. It comes after South Korean tech firm LG and Chinese mobile firm ZTE also pulled out. The conference attracts more than 100,000 visitors and has come under increased scrutiny since the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus epidemic a public health emergency of international concern, Reuters reports. There has been only one confirmed coronavirus case in Spain to date. In a statement on the conference\u2019s website, organisers confirmed Ericsson\u2019s decision to withdraw, saying: \u201cWe respect their decision and are reassured by their commitment that they will be at MWC Barcelona 2021 in full force and our rebook trends for next year\u2019s event remain high. Ericsson\u2019s cancellation will have some impact on our presence at this time and will potentially have further impact.\u201d The statement adds: The GSMA continues to monitor and assess the potential impact of the coronavirus on MWC Barcelona 2020 as the health and safety of our exhibitors, attendees and staff are of paramount importance... the GSMA has implemented many measures to help to mitigate the spread of the virus and is continuing to add other actions regularly. In particular, there are extensive additional health measures that have been put in place. A leading UK academic who studies infectious diseases says it is difficult to tell whether the levelling off of coronavirus cases in the past two days is due to an actual decline or just difficulties in recording cases. John Edmunds, professor in the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said: I think time will tell - it\u2019s now about the time we would expect to see if there is an impact of the interventions they put in place. We would start to see an effect now if it is having an effect. A drop in the number of new coronavirus cases for two days is good news, says the director general of the World Health Organization. However, he cautions against reading too much into it. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the numbers could go up again, but the last two days were showing a declining trend. There were roughly 3,900 new cases reported worldwide on 5 February, 3,700 on 6 February and 3,200 on 7 February - the vast majority in China, WHO figures show. At the Science Media Centre, Paul Hunter, professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: Over the last two days we have actually seen the first of two consecutive declines in the number of new cases, which is nice, but whether that is sustainable or not we will only know in about a week or so. The infection, like most droplet-spread infections, tend to spread more in winter than in summer, so it\u2019s quite plausible that even if the spread does continue, at least in the northern hemisphere we will see a decline during the summer The big question then will be whether it reappears in November as we move into the traditional flu seasons where these sorts of viruses ... tend to predominate. Ghebreyesus also reported that in response to his appeal earlier this week for more countries to share information about the outbreaks in their countries, not all nations had provided the requested information. \u201cThere are some countries who have yet to send detailed case reports to WHO,\u201d he said. \u201cWe urge those member states to share that information immediately.\u201d The third patient to be diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK is being treated at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in Westminster. The patient is thought to have been diagnosed in Brighton, and brought to St Thomas\u2019, where there is an infectious diseases unit, on Thursday afternoon. The other two patients with the virus in the UK are being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary infectious diseases centre in Newcastle. None of the patients have been identified, but the first two cases are a University of York student and his mother, who had recently travelled from China. The third patient caught the virus in Singapore, and is thought to be a middle-aged man. A passenger quarantined on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan has described the \u201cgreat amount of fear\u201d he feels awaiting results of his coronavirus test. Spencer Fehrenbacher is travelling with three friends and was alarmed when the ship announced another 41 passengers had tested positive for the virus, bringing the total to 61. He told the BBC: When they made the announcement it was a very scary feeling if I\u2019m being honest. I was tested for the virus about three days ago and I have not yet been told whether my results are positive or negative. There is still the unknown that I could be getting a knock on my door at any moment with the news that I\u2019m being taken off the ship. This is one of the best places I can imagine being quarantined. We feel very fortunate but it is in the midst of a great amount of fear. A British passenger on his honeymoon is among the 41 new coronavirus cases. Alan Steele, from Wolverhampton, has been separated from his new wife, Wendy, and taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. In a Facebook post, he said he is not displaying any symptoms. Fellow British passenger, David Abel, described in a video how he felt when he found out his friend had tested positive for the virus. The child who has been tested for coronavirus at a hospital in Northern Ireland is believed to be less than a year old. The baby and his mother are still being held in isolation at Altnagelvin hospital in Derry city. It is understood the child was admitted yesterday to Altnagelvin\u2019s A&amp;E department, only a few days after returning to Northern Ireland from Hong Kong. A source told Belfast Live: The baby and family were met at the hospital by a fully prepared medical team who were wearing medical hazmat gear and masks. The NHS protocol is in place and the child has been placed in isolation while tests are being carried out. It will take a little time to get the results back which would allow the medical team to actively treat for the virus if the tests are positive. For now the child is undergoing tests and being treated along lines of the protocol and the situation is under control. The world is running out of masks and other gear to protect against the new coronavirus, the World Health Organization has warned. The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told the organisation\u2019s executive board in Geneva: We\u2019re sending testing kits, mask, gloves, respirators and gowns to countries in every region. The world is facing a chronic shortage of personal protective equipment. Ghebreyesus added that he will be speaking to the Pandemic Supply Chain Network to identify the bottlenecks, find solutions and \u201cpush with fairness in distribution of equipment\u201d. A woman from China has taken ill at Copenhagen airport, prompting a small area to be cordoned off. The Copenhagen airport press officer Kenni Leth said the woman was transported to hospital by ambulance after arriving from China via Helsinki on Friday morning. The passenger contacted airport staff on arrival and was found to have influenza-like symptoms, leading to fears she could have contracted coronavirus. Leth said: Given that the passenger contacted airport staff with influenza-like symptoms we, in accordance with procedures agreed with authorities, contacted emergency services and the passenger was picked up by ambulance. An area of terminal 3 where the woman contacted staff has been cordoned off and will be sanitised in accordance with procedure. \u201cYou can still easily go to terminal 3 and use most of the terminal. It is not affecting airport traffic,\u201d Leth said. The British luxury fashion brand Burberry said coronavirus was damaging demand for luxury goods in mainland China and Hong Kong. The label said 24 of its 64 stores in mainland China were closed, and remaining stores were operating with reduced hours and with significant declines in footfall. The chief executive, Marco Gobbetti, said: The outbreak of the coronavirus in mainland China is having a material negative effect on luxury demand. While we cannot currently predict how long this situation will last, we remain confident in our strategy. Spending by Chinese tourists in Europe and other locations has been less impacted, but as further travel restrictions are introduced around the globe, the company anticipated the situation would worsen over the coming weeks. Meanwhile Uniqlo will temporarily close about half of its stores in China due to the coronavirus outbreak. A spokesperson for Fast Retailing, the Japanese company that owns Uniqlo, said 370 out of 750 stores had been closed. There is no planned reopening date for the China stores yet, and the company said it was continuing to monitor the situation. Chinese researchers have said the pangolin, an endangered mammal illegally trafficked for its scales and meat, is a potential intermediate host for the coronavirus. \u201cThis latest discovery will be of great significance for the prevention and control of the origin [of the virus],\u201d South China Agricultural University, which led the research, said in a statement on its website. The pangolin is considered the most trafficked animal in the world and an estimated 1 million were smuggled from 2000-13. In January, China ordered a temporary ban on the trade in wild animals until the epidemic was under control. Donald Trump has praised China\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying President Xi Jinping \u201cstrongly leads what will be a very successful operation\u201d. China has previously criticised US restrictions over the outbreak, which include barring entry to most foreign nationals who have visited China in the past two weeks. Hong Kong Airlines is to cut 400 jobs and reduce its operations as coronavirus adds to the company\u2019s financial woes. Reduced travel demand caused by the outbreak has caused the airline to reduce its daily operations from 82 to 30 sectors from 11 February to March. Hong Kong-based ground staff will be asked to take a minimum of two weeks\u2019 unpaid leave a month, or switch to working three days a week between 17 February and 30 June. A spokesman for the airline told Reuters: As uncertainty looms with the evolving nature of this global issue, weak travel demand will likely continue into the summer season and we need to take further action to stay afloat. There has never been a more challenging time in Hong Kong Airlines\u2019 history as of now. These decisions are difficult but had to be made to keep the airline alive. Rival airline Cathay Pacific Airways has also asked employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave to preserve cash, and said the situation caused by the coronavirus outbreak is as severe as the 2009 financial crisis. The British honeymooner who has tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship in Japan is Alan Steele from Wolverhampton, PA Media has reported. He married his wife, Wendy, last month and the couple were celebrating their honeymoon on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is in quarantine. Alan posted on Facebook: Just to let you all know I have been diagnosed as having the virus and am being shipped to hospital. Would also like to say that at the moment I am not showing any symptoms so just possibly a carrier. Will let you know how I am going on when possible. Steele has been separated from his wife and removed from the ship to be treated at a nearby hospital. The Washington Post reported that Wendy was due to celebrate her 52nd birthday on 11 February, and her husband was due to start a new job on 10 February. Singapore is reporting three more coronavirus cases with no links to previous cases or travel history in China. The country moved its disease outbreak response up a level to \u201corange\u201d on Friday as the new cases emerged, according to the Straits Times. This means the outbreak is thought to have moderate to high public health impact. Code orange is one step below red, the most severe category, and this is only the second time it has been activated since the coding system was set up after the Sars outbreak in 2003. It was previously activated for the swine flu outbreak in 2009. The new cases include a 53-year-old man who visited Malaysia in January, a 42-year-old woman who is a teacher at Victoria junior college, and a 39-year-old woman who was also in Malaysia in January. The cases were discovered because hospitals in Singapore had started testing all pneumonia patients for the virus, the health ministry said. The total number of coronavirus cases in Singapore is now 33. Four of these are not connected to previous cases and have no travel connections to China. The health minister, Gan Kim Yong, said at a press conference: We have been preparing for this scenario and we are ready to manage this situation. The key is quick detection and managing the local spread. Art Basel, Asia\u2019s largest annual art fair, has been cancelled due to the outbreak and spread of the coronavirus. The event was scheduled to take place at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre from 19 to 21 March. Marc Spiegler, Art Basel global director, said: The decision to cancel Art Basel Hong Kong was an extremely difficult one for us. We explored every other possible option before doing so. Unfortunately, the sudden outbreak and rapid spread of the novel coronavirus radically changed the situation. Last year the event, a key date on the global arts calendar, attracted almost 90,000 visitors from over 70 countries. Collector Michael Xufu Huang was reported by CNN as saying: \u201cI could see (the decision) coming. \u201cEven if the virus were to be contained by March ... there\u2019s so much organisation that goes into planning beforehand - shipping, traveling. And with travel restrictions it would be impossible for people in the mainland to go.\u201d Medical workers in Hong Kong demanding the government close all borders with mainland China are voting on whether to extend their five-day strike. The Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA), a medical workers\u2019 union, said earlier today it will hold a vote on whether to extend or end the strike. The strike will continue if more than 6,000 members vote in favour of it. Yesterday, more than 6,400 union members went on strike, the HAEA said, and public hospitals have had limited services most of the week. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has introduced mandatory quarantines for travellers coming from mainland China, and closed all but three of the border crossings. A woman in North Korea has become the first person in the country to test positive for the coronavirus, a South Korean newspaper claimed on Friday. The woman, who lives in the capital, Pyongyang, displayed symptoms after returning from a trip to China, the conservative broadsheet the JoongAng Ilbo said, citing an anonymous source in North Korea. The North\u2019s state media has not confirmed any infections. In its most recent update, on 2 February, the state broadcaster said no infections had been confirmed. \u201cAs the chances of coronavirus spreading into North Korea increase, authorities started putting all people who had made overseas trips recently into quarantine for a certain period,\u201d the source was quoted as saying, according to an English translation in the Korea Times. \u201cThe first patient is a woman living in Pyongyang. All people who had contact with her are being quarantined.\u201d The report did not give details of when the woman was diagnosed or her state of health. North Korea has introduced several measures to guard against the disease \u2013 which has affected all of its neighbours \u2013 amid warnings that an epidemic could put an intolerable strain on its poor healthcare infrastructure. It has suspended flights from China and Russia and closed train routes across its borders with those two countries. It has also imposed a ban on foreign tourism and suspended operations at a liaison office it runs with South Korea just north of the demilitarised zone, the heavily armed border dividing the Korean peninsula. The country\u2019s authorities have increased border inspections and health screenings of North Koreans returning from overseas business trips, according to the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the ruling Workers\u2019 party. A British man on his honeymoon is among 41 more passengers to have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship in Japan, taking the total to 61. The man has not been identified but has been removed from the ship and taken to a nearby hospital, according to Japan\u2019s health ministry. The man\u2019s wife will remain onboard the Diamond Princess which is anchored at Yokohama port. In a Facebook video, fellow British passenger David Abel said: 41 additional passengers have been found positive for coronavirus, one of whom is a friend of ours on honeymoon who is going to be split from his wife. He is going to be taken to a medical facility and she is going to remain on board, so that is going to be very very tough indeed. It must be dreadful, I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s going to be like for them. Amnesty International has said the death of whistleblower Chinese doctor Li Wenliang highlights human rights failings in China\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak. Li Wenliang was reprimanded by police for \u201cspreading false rumours\u201d after raising alarm over the virus back in December. Nicholas Bequelin, regional director of Amnesty International, said: The case of Li Wenliang is a tragic reminder of how the Chinese authorities\u2019 preoccupation with maintaining \u2018stability\u2019 drives it to suppress vital information about matters of public interest. China must learn the lesson from Li\u2019s case and adopt a rights-respecting approach to combating the epidemic. Nobody should face harassment or sanctions for speaking out about public dangers, just because it may cause embarrassment to the government. Hyundai has suspended operations at its giant Ulsan complex in South Korea, the most productive car factory in the world, due to a lack of parts caused by the coronavirus lock down in China. According to AFP, Hyundai has ran out of the engine wiring harnesses which are imported from China, and closed the factories on Friday. Hyundai said the supplier\u2019s factory had shut down after a worker tested positive for coronavirus. The five-plant network can make 1.4 million vehicles a year, and the closure puts 25,000 workers on forced leave and partial wages. Analysts estimate closing the factory complex for five days, would cost Hyundai - the world\u2019s fifth-largest car manufacturer - at least six hundred billion South Korean won ($500m). Hyundai is not the only car manufacturer being affected by the outbreak. Renault is considering stopping its factory in South Korea next week and Fiat Chrysler CEO Mike Manley also told the FT his firm could be forced to halt one of its European factories over supply shortages. Hyundai operations in South Korea are expected to resume by early next week. It\u2019s Jessica Murray, taking over the live blog from Alison Rourke. I\u2019ll be following the latest developments of the coronavirus outbreak as the number of cases across the world continues to climb. Italy has just confirmed its third case of the virus, after an Italian national tested positive. The first two confirmed cases in the country were Chinese tourists, so this is the first Italian citizen to contract the virus. The patient travelled back from Wuhan last week, and is being treated at Lazzaro Spallanzani Institute, an infectious disease hospital in Rome, a statement said. Like many countries, Italy has seen rise in prejudice and discrimination against Chinese nationals as a result of the virus outbreak. In a video posted by the Chinese-Italian Youth Union, Massimiliano Martigli Jiang takes a silent protest against this discrimination on the streets of Florence, holding a sign that reads: \u201cI am not a virus. I\u2019m a human. Eradicate the prejudice.\u201d The death toll stands at 636 inside China (up 73 on the previous day), one in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines Infections inside China stand at 31,161 Global infections have passed 280 in 28 countries There\u2019s been an outpouring of anger and grief over the death of the Chinese doctor, Li Wenliang, who first warned about the virus in December China\u2019s National Supervisory Commission has announced a\u201cfull investigation\u201d into the handling of the death of Dr Li There were 41 new cases on the quarantined cruise liner in the port of Yokohama south of Tokyo, bringing the total diagnosed on the ship to 61 Taiwan, which has 16 cases, banned international cruise ships from docking. The ratings agency S&amp;P slashed its forecast of China\u2019s economic growth for this year by 0.75 percentage points, saying the coronavirus will deliver a big temporary hit to the country\u2019s economy that will spill over to the whole world. Its new growth forecast is 5% Chinese President Xi Jinping assured Donald Trump in a phone call that China is doing all it can to contain the virus. Xi also urged the US to respond reasonably to the virus outbreak, a veiled message over quarantine restrictions in America Canadian and US evacuation flights are due to land back in their respective countries on Friday North Korea confirms first case of virus The Chinese city of Xiaogan, around 70km north-west of Wuhan in Hubei province, has become only the second city in China (after Wuhan) to record more than 2,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. The New York Times is reporting on the deteriorating conditions in Wuhan and measures to control the virus, including house-to-house temperature checks, rounding up the sick and mass confinements at quarantine centres. The measures follow the visit of Vice Premier Sun Chunlan to Wuhan on Thursday. She said the country faced \u201cwartime conditions\u201d and \u201cthere must be no deserters, or they will be nailed to the pillar of historical shame forever\u201d. Two groups of evacuees are set to arrive on Friday at a Canadian air force base from Wuhan. One flight of 176 people is expected in the early hours of Friday morning. A second group of evacuees, who left China on a US flight, should arrive later in the day, after switching planes in Vancouver. All the evacuees will be quarantined on the base, in Trenton, Ontario, for two weeks, separated from each other in a building that resembles a small hotel, with families kept together. China\u2019s National Supervisory Commission, which some on twitter are calling the country\u2019s \u201cmuch-feared disciplinary watchdog\u201d, says it is sending a team to Wuhan to conduct a \u201cfull investigation\u201d into the handling of the death of Dr Li Wenliang, the whistleblower who first raised concerns about the coronavirus in December. Chinese state media reported his death, retracted it and then confirmed it. I mentioned earlier about the anger inside China over the death of the whistleblower doctor in Wuhan, Li Wenliang. You can read our full report on it below: \u2018Hero who told the truth\u2019: Chinese rage over coronavirus death of whistleblower doctor Australia has published its first report on the coronavirus cases in the country. The report, covers the first 12 cases diagnosed up to 1 February (there are now 14 cases in the country). The report says: All twelve cases reported a travel history to China, and 92% (11/12) had a travel history to Wuhan The majority of cases (92%, 11/12) developed mild to moderate symptoms, with one case (8%, 1/12) admitted to intensive care The report says: \u201cClinical care of suspected patients with 2019-nCoV should focus on early recognition, immediate isolation, implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control measures and provision of optimised supportive care.\u201d You can read the full report here. We\u2019re getting more details on the two US planes with about 300 passengers, mostly American citizens, took off from the Chinese city of Wuhan on Thursday bound for the United States. It\u2019s the third group of evacuees from the city, the US State Department said. One of the flights had room to accommodate more than 60 Canadians, who will disembark on a stopover in Vancouver, British Columbia, before the remaining passengers continue on to the United States, a State Department spokeswoman told Reuters. The plane stopping in Vancouver will fly on to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in Southern California, the Pentagon said in a separate statement. The second aircraft is headed for Omaha, Nebraska, by way of Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, following a refuelling stop in California, the Defense Department said. Both planes are due to arrive on Friday. We\u2019re getting more on President Xi Jinping\u2019s phone call with Donald Trump from the Associated Press: China\u2019s official news agency says President Xi Jinping has urged the US to respond reasonably to the virus outbreak in a phone call with President Donald Trump. China\u2019s foreign ministry has previously complained that the US was flying its citizens out of the worst-hit city of Wuhan but not providing any assistance to China. More generally, China has said other countries, many of whom have imposed travel bans or quarantines on travellers from China, should follow WHO recommendations on reacting proportionately to the threat. The New York Times reporter in Hong Kong has just posted a video that sums up the concern in the city about the spread of the coronavirus. The ratings agency S&amp;P has slashed its forecast of China\u2019s economic growth for this year by 0.75 percentage points, saying the coronavirus will deliver a big temporary hit to the country\u2019s economy that will spill over to the whole world. S&amp;P said it now forecast Chinese GDP growth of 5%, down from its previous estimate of 5.7%, but cautioned that it was less confident in its figures than usual because of continuing uncertainty over the severity of the outbreak. This will flow through to the global economy because China accounts for a third of worldwide growth, S&amp;P said. \u201cThe global impact will be felt through four real economy channels: sharply reduced tourism revenues, lower exports of consumer and capital goods, lower commodity prices, and industrial supply-chain disruptions,\u201d it said. \u201cIf the virus cannot be contained, a material risk, the economic impact could develop exponentially with significant credit implications.\u201d The agency said it expected a rebound next year that would make up lost ground, increasing its estimate of 2021 GDP growth from 5.6% to 6.4%. S&amp;P said it expected travel restrictions to ease from next month. Here is a global rundown of the latest figures for cases and deaths reported by health authorities around the world so far. China: 636 deaths and 31,161 confirmed cases on the mainland. In addition, Hong Kong has had one death, and 22 cases. Macao has had 10 cases. Japan: 86 cases Singapore: 30 Thailand: 25 South Korea: 24 Australia: 14 Germany: 13 United States: 12 Taiwan: 16 Malaysia: 14 Vietnam: 12 France: 6 United Arab Emirates: 5 Canada: 6 India: 3 Philippines: 3 cases, including 1 death Russia: 2 Italy: 2 Britain: 3 Belgium: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Sweden: 1 Spain: 1 Cambodia: 1 Finland: 1 Reuters has the latest on a phone call between Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, and Donald Trump. It says: The Chinese government has spared no effort in its fight to contain the coronavirus outbreak, having taken the most comprehensive and stringent prevention and containment measures, President Xi Jinping told US President Donald Trump. In its battle against the coronavirus, China is gradually achieving results, Xi told his US counterpart on a phone call on Friday morning, according to state television. China is fully confident and capable of defeating the epidemic, and the long-term trend of the country\u2019s economic development will not change, Xi said. We have been reporting about death in Wuhan of Li Wenliang, the doctor who had tried to raise the alarm about the danger of the virus in December. The 34-year-old became a household name in China, known to hundreds of millions of people as the face and conscience of the spiralling crisis. (You can read our full story about him here.) Li\u2019s initial efforts to raise the alarm about the virus were met by the security forces accusing him of \u201cmaking false comments\u201d. He signed a statement agreeing not to discuss the disease further. The news of his death was muddled by state media, who initially reporting it, then rowed back on their confirmation, only to finally confirm that he died in hospital after having contracted the virus. It\u2019s prompted an outpouring of grief and anger on Chinese social media . Toyota has extended the closure of its 12 factories in China by a week. The Japanese carmaker had planned to reopen its car and component-making plants this weekend but will now keep them shuttered until 16 February \u201cafter considering various factors, including guidelines from local and region governments, parts supply, and logistics\u201d. Officials at the Beijing press conference said they had confidence in the economic system and that the impact on the economy from the outbreak would be \u201ctemporary. It will be limited and will not affect the fundamentals, and the economy is sound and stable\u201d. They added: The outbreak has taken place during the spring festival and the impact on services is notable. The holiday has been extended and the construction sector and other sectors will be affected. There will be an impact on economic performance in Q1 but the economy will return to productivity when the epidemic is over. Look at 2003 Sars outbreak. There was disrupted growth in Q2 but in Q3 it rebounded. When the epidemic is controlled, the economy will rebound and pent-up investment and consumption released. The Chinese econony will have a quick recovery. it is promising and resilient. The funadmentals will not change. There is ample room for macro regulation \u2013 China is one of the few major economies that have normal monetary policy so we have sufficient tools to repsond. Officials also said that the rise in the Chinese stock market since its reopening on Monday proves that it is becoming more mature. The benchmark Shanghai Composite is index lost 8% on Monday but is now off by 4.5% on the week so has regained some ground. Just doubling back on that press conference we have just heard from the Australian PM, Scott Morrison. He has told Australians to get out of China by commercial means if possible and that he cannot guarantee assisted flights out will continue in the future. Australians and immediate family members \u2013 if you are there, then there are still commercial flights coming out of China, mainland China to Australia and I strongly suggest you avail yourself of those. The government cannot guarantee that similar types of assisted flights would be able to be put on in the future either into the mainland or Wuhan On Wednesday, the British government told its citizens \u201cif you are in China and are able to leave, you should do so\u201d. On Thursday, Canada followed suit, telling its citizens who did not have to be in China, that they should get out on commercial flights if possible: \u201cIf your presence in China isn\u2019t essential, you should consider leaving by commercial means,\u201d the advice said. China\u2019s finance ministry has created a special fund of billions of yuan to target lending for companies involved in the manufacture of key medical supplies such as safety goggles, face masks and disinfectant, officials have said at a media conference in Beijing. A list of companies will be drawn up by the government and banks will be expected to hand over cash to them to enable them to keep production flowing. Morrison is asked if he would consider stopping cruise ships coming to Australia, given the infections on the cruise ship that has docked in Japan? \u201cNo. That is not under advice at the moment. No-one has recommended that. But those Australians who are on board that vessel (stuck in Yokohama) and a number of additional cases have been confirmed amongst the Australians on that vessel, which is up in Japan and they are getting consular support. They have been transferred to medical facilities in Japan as the other two were and there are quite a number of other Australians on board this ship that are in quarantine on the vessel.\u201d We are hearing a news conference from the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, on plans for a second evacuation flight from Wuhan. He confirms that the government is looking at a second quarantine facility in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory. The first evacuees were taken to Christmas Island, a former detention centre for refugees and asylum seekers. The site being considered isa a mining camp facility in the NT\u2019s capital city, Darwin. Morrison also has a message for Australians who are still in mainland China \u2013 that they should get out on commercial flights if possible: \u201cAustralians and immediate family members \u2013 if you are there, then there are still commercial flights coming out of China, mainland China to Australia and I strongly suggest you avail yourself of those. The government cannot guarantee that similar types of assisted flights would be able to be put on in the future either into the mainland or Wuhan.\u201d We reported yesterday that clinical trials had begun in China for the drug Remdesivir on coronavirus patients. State media says the first person to receive treatment was a 68-year-old man with serious symptoms in Wuhan\u2019s Jinyintan hospital. More than 750 patients will take part in the trial. The Chinese city of Xiaogan, around 70km north-west of Wuhan in Hubei province, has become only the second city in China (after Wuhan) to record more than 2,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Chinese state media is reporting Beijing\u2019s financial support during the virus outbreak. Hong Kong has cancelled a major a major cultural and business event for the city, amid the virus outbreak. The annual Art Basel Hong Kong, which drew more than 80,000 people last year, had been scheduled to take place on 19-21 March. It\u2019s the latest in a range of cultural, academic and sporting events canceled or postponed in China, Hong Kong and elsewhere because of the outbreak. Hong Kong has reported 22 cases of the virus and has ordered a 14-day quarantine for all travellers entering the city from mainland China from Saturday. On Thursday Hong Kongers faced long queues at some shops as shelves emptied amid concerns over the virus. You can see the South China Morning Post\u2019s front page below. The US State Department said on Thursday that two planes have left Wuhan, China, en route to the United States amid the coronavirus outbreak. The State Department statement did not say how many evacuees were on the flights or where in the United States they were headed. Taiwan and China are embroiled in a new spat over the fate of Taiwanese stranded in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Reuters reports, after Taiwan said one of its citizens sent back on the first flight was infected with coronavirus. Only one flight from China has so far evacuated 247 of the estimated 500 Taiwanese in Wuhan. Beijing has permitted countries from the United States to Japan to send often several flights to Wuhan to collect their nationals. But Taiwan and China have been unable to agree on further flights to take out the Taiwanese. Taiwan\u2019s China policy-making Mainland Affairs Council said the first flight back, on Monday, had one passenger confirmed to be affected and three others who had fevers. All the passengers are now in quarantine in Taiwan. The presence of the sick passenger \u201ccreated a tear in virus prevention\u201d, the council said in a statement on Friday. \u201cThis also caused an overlap infection risk for the people on the same flight, and if there are even more infected people caused by this then the serious consequences don\u2019t bear thinking about.\u201d China should be prioritising the elderly, the young and other vulnerable groups amongst the Taiwanese and those only on short-term visits to Wuhan to send back first, but China ignored this request when it returned the first batch, it added. China has said Taiwan should not be putting up obstacles to evacuate the Taiwanese, and further planned evacuation flights this week had been put off due to Taipei blocking them. \u201cSome people in Taiwan had been bad-mouthing arrangements for the homecoming of Taiwan compatriots, which has fully exposed the vile nature of their ignoring of the Taiwan compatriots\u2019 interests,\u201d China\u2019s Taiwan affairs office said late on Thursday. Taiwan should stop its \u201cpolitical games\u201d and let the flights resume, it added. Taiwan and China are already at loggerheads over the handling of the virus outbreak, especially over Taiwan\u2019s exclusion from the World Health Organization (WHO). Taiwan has 16 cases of the virus. Here are the nationalities of the newly diagnosed passengers onboard the Diamond Princess: 21 from Japan, eight from the US, five from Australia, five from Canada, one from Argentina and one from Britain. Japanese health officials said that none of the newly diagnosed patients was displaying severe symptoms of the virus. Johns Hopkins University has put those updated figures from China into its virus tracker. Let\u2019s have a look at those figures from China\u2019s National Health Commission in a little more detail. The vast number of new cases are in Hubei again. Of 3,143 new cases announced, 2,447 were from Hubei province Of the 73 new deaths, 69 were in Hubei But perhaps the more interesting figures are the suspected cases and their location. On Friday the NHC said there are 4,833 new suspected cases and, of that, 2,622, or 54% of those new cases, are in Hubei province \u2013 the centre of the infection. The commission has given this comparison figure each day since last Saturday (previously it was just a national suspected cases figure). Here\u2019s what they showed: Friday: 4,833 suspected cases; 2,622 or 54% in Hubei Thursday: 5,328 suspected cases; 3,230 or 60% in Hubei Wednesday: 3,971 suspected cases; 1957 or 49% in Hubei Tuesday: 5,072 suspected cases; 3,182 or 63% in Hubei Monday: 5,173 suspected cases; 3,260 or 70% in Hubei Sunday: 4,562 suspected cases; 2,606 or 57% in Hubei Another 41 people quarantined aboard a cruise liner off the coast of Japan have tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the total number of infected passengers to 61. The dramatic jump in fresh cases follows 10 positive diagnoses among Diamond Princess passengers on Wednesday, and a further 10 on Thursday. The new cases were among 171 remaining test results. The results of all 273 tests have now been confirmed. About 3,700 passengers and crew are aboard the ship, but tests were conducted only on people who displayed symptoms or had been in close contact with a Hong Kong man who tested positive after leaving the ship at the end of last month. Twenty-one of the 41 patients are Japanese, the health minister, Katsunobu Kato, told reporters on Friday. The nationalities of the remaining passengers were not immediately available. The age range of the newly diagnosed patients suggests that older passengers are particularly vulnerable. The new cases include three people in their 20s to 40s, three in their 50s, eight in their 60s, 21 in their 70s and six in their 80s, Kato said. The health ministry said the patients would be transferred to hospitals in Tokyo and several other prefectures, according to public broadcaster NHK. Australia\u2019s ABC TV is talking to their reporter on the scene where the Diamond Princess is docked. He says some people onboard the ship have been let out of their rooms for short times, but there are others who he believes are still confined to their room.s Another 41 passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise liner moored in the Japanese port of Yokohama have been diagnosed with coronavirus. This brings the total on the ship to 61. By my calculations also raises Japan\u2019s number of confirmed infections to 86. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, with me, Alison Rourke. The Chinese Health Commission has just released its latest figures for deaths and infections. The headline figures are 636 deaths and more than 31,000 confirmed infections. I\u2019ll bring you some analysis of the figures shortly, but the other key points so far are: Japanese media reports another 41 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed on the stricken cruise ship in Yokohama, bringing the total to 61 The doctor who tried to raise the alarm about the virus in its early days, has died after becoming infected President Xi has declared a \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d on the virus and warned of its global impact on business Singapore has said it will evacuate its citizens from Wuhan New cases have been reported in Germany, Italy and Britain You can stay up-to-date on all of our coronavirus outbreak coverage here, including our latest comment pieces: Small US businesses are falling victim to the coronavirus too China\u2019s response to coronavirus exposes a dangerous obsession with secrecy",
