The university is proposing to survey staff on its three options but the union has instead effectively put forward a fourth option \u2013 no job losses or pay cuts and for the university to use its reserves to get through the crisis. \u201cThe university has run surpluses for the last 10 years,\u201d said Damien Cahill, division assistant secretary of the National Tertiary Education Union. \u201cThe 2019 annual report shows it has $800m in cash and investments.\u201d The University of NSW, meanwhile, faces a $600m shortfall this year in its $2bn budget and a $450m shortfall in 2021. It has established Taskforce 2021 to explore options, including significant restructuring of faculties, more short course offerings and tighter connections with industry as it grapples with how to address the budget crisis. Options will be presented to staff at the end of June or early July but will almost certainly require job losses. The immediate problem facing universities is the high proportion of their budgets that are devoted to employee costs. A study by Melbourne University academics Ian Marshman and Frank Larkins, from the Centre for the Study of Higher Education, found that across the sector, employee costs accounted for 57% of university spending. The issue for universities is that while they have significant assets, they are mainly in buildings and they do not have liquid assets that can be realised in a downturn. The Department of Education requires reporting on the number of weeks\u2019 cash the universities carry to cover expenses. The 2018 report, the most recent, shows some have less than three months\u2019 cover. Some media outlets have highlighted the increased debt that universities have taken on in recent years as they upgraded campuses and built new facilities using the surge in income from international students. Most universities have immediately moved to put construction plans on hold and some are looking at closing campuses. The 2018 analysis by the department found the university sector had $6bn in borrowings, on assets of $82bn. Universities have other substantial liabilities, notably superannuation and staff entitlements. But while debt levels have increased at many universities, they remain relatively lowly geared and some, such as Sydney University and Melbourne University, have significant future funds to support expansion. Those universities that are rated by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s \u2013 mainly Group of Eight universities \u2013 have AA or AA+ ratings. \u201cIf one of the universities were to end up in financial stress, we assume the government would step in to bail them out,\u201d said Anthony Walker, an analyst at S&amp;P, told the Australian. \u201cThe Australian universities have increased their debt at a faster rate than their UK and Canadian peers but they are still relatively lowly geared.\u201d In May S&amp;P left its risk rating for Canadian and Australian universities as \u201cstable\u201d, but said it would keep them under review. La Trobe University, which is not part of the Group of Eight, denied on Thursday that it was facing a crisis after it approached the major banks for a new debt facility. \u201cThe university is in productive and ongoing discussions with its three banks for increased facilities that we believe will meet our funding requirements in the short term,\u201d La Trobe vice-chancellor John Dewar said. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 June 2020. An earlier version was based on a misunderstanding by the journalist of what had been agreed at the Wollongong University meeting. The staff have not supported a small pay cut of 5-10% as previously reported.",

In Minneapolis, where Floyd died last Monday after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, the city agreed to ban chokeholds and neck restraints by police and to require officers to try to stop any other officers they see using improper force. They marked the first concrete steps to remake the city\u2019s police force since Floyd\u2019s death.

In California, Gavin Newsom on Friday ordered the state\u2019s police training program to stop teaching officers how to use a neck hold that blocks the flow of blood to the brain, known as a carotid hold or sleeper hold. Fifteen law enforcement agencies in San Diego county banned the practice earlier this week. The carotid hold \u201chas no place any longer in 21st century practices and policing\u201d, he said. Newsom also had words on the use of teargas and rubber bullets to disperse demonstrators, saying protesters \u201chave the right to protest peacefully \u2013 not be harassed, not be shot at by rubber bullets or teargas\u201d. He also announced plans to create a new \u201cstatewide standard\u201d for police use of force at protests. The mayor of Seattle on Friday banned the use of teargas by police for 30 days. Demonstrations continue coast to coast The nearly two weeks since Floyd\u2019s killing have led to the largest civil unrest since since 1968 and the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. While the momentum has continued, the mood has largely shifted from explosive anger to more peaceful calls for change.

Police scrutiny continues On Friday, California announced an investigation into the police department of Vallejo, a Bay Area city facing intense scrutiny following the shooting of Sean Monterrosa, an unarmed 22-year-old, amid protests this week. Police in Buffalo, New York, were also under fire after video emerged on Thursday of an officer shoving a 75-year-old demonstrator, causing him to fall and gravely injury his head. More than 50 police officers resigned on Friday in a show of support for their colleagues who had been suspended over the incident. Another day of protests in New York City brought more examples of officials downplaying or denying the police department\u2019s rough treatment of protesters. Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday said he had personally seen \u201cno use of force around peaceful protests\u201d and cast doubt on people who had, despite social media posts and witness accounts of officers moving on demonstrators without provocation and bashing them with batons. \u201cWhat an absolute disgrace. This is just not true,\u201d the city councilman Jimmy Van Bramer tweeted following de Blasio\u2019s comments, which were made at a morning news briefing about officers aggressively breaking up a rally in the Bronx as the city\u2019s 8pm curfew kicked in Thursday, leading to scores of arrests and cries of brutality. \u201cYou are gaslighting an entire City.\u201d Meanwhile in Washington, the recent death of Manuel Ellis in police custody faced growing scrutiny. Ellis, 33, died minutes after his arrest while pleading \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, echoing Floyd and Eric Garner. The local medical examiner\u2019s office concluded that Ellis\u2019s death was a homicide. The Washington governor, Jay Inslee, has promised an independent review of Ellis\u2019s death. Dozens of healthcare workers in Seattle lined the streets outside Swedish hospital for a moment of silence on Friday in support of the Floyd protests. Workers, who have spent months battling coronavirus, took a knee in Seattle\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood. Hallie Golden, Joan E Greve and agencies contributed reporting",

      "bodyText": "It was the week that Britain\u2019s young people stood up against racial injustice after watching the brutal killing of George Floyd, declaring in their thousands that Black Lives Matter via a succession of passionate and largely peaceful protests that show no sign of abating. The anti-racism demonstrators, overwhelmingly aged under 30, have largely been part of a movement using the LDNBLM hashtag that has no identifiable leaders and whose events are publicised via word of mouth and social media. It has, almost incidentally, blown apart the lockdown, and some politicians and police are warning against further protests due to physical-distancing rules. \u201cIt\u2019s a very organic response and reaction to what\u2019s happening in the US with the unlawful murder of George Floyd and also challenging the unlawful murder of our brothers and sisters [not only] in the US, but also worldwide,\u201d said a one of the organisers, a 22-year-old man who asked not to be named. Akira, a young organiser of a protest in Brixton, south London, said: \u201cWe wanted to do something to contextualise police brutality and institutional racism in the UK\u201d, adding that people wanted to demonstrate because \u201cthey were feeling really disempowered now by what was going on in social media\u201d. Protests have been organised across the UK for Saturday and Sunday after a week of demonstrations that began with events in London, Manchester and Nottingham and gained momentum when thousands came to Trafalgar Square and outside the US embassy in the capital on Sunday. But it was the unexpected success of Wednesday\u2019s protest, when thousands of multiracial marchers streamed down Park Lane from Hyde Park chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d in reference to Floyd, and took the knee outside the gates of Parliament and Downing Street, that has exemplified the depth of feeling. Almost immediately, the protests took on a British dimension. Demonstrators on Wednesday carried handmade placards listing Mark Duggan, Julian Cole and others killed or left disabled by British police, chanted \u201cno justice, no peace, no racist police\u201d and carried signs that declared \u201cthe UK is not innocent\u201d. Trey Campbell-Simon, the BAME officer for the Chelsea and Fulham Labour party, who went to the rallies this week, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough. George Floyd is [one of] a long line of black males that have died at the hands of police. And the UK is not innocent, as I chanted at the marches I\u2019ve attended, because there is a long history of police abuse here too.\u201d Particularly striking was how many cited the decision by British Transport Police not to bring charges in the case of Belly Mujinga, the ticket inspector at Victoria station who died of coronavirus a few weeks after reporting being spat at while on duty, arguing it was an injustice that demonstrates the reality of Britain today. On Friday, the Crown Prosecution Service was asked to review evidence into her death in recognition of wider public interest. Lusamba Katalay, Mujinga\u2019s husband, thanked protesters for their support and said it inspired him to fight on. \u201cBelly\u2019s life mattered. It mattered to me, to our daughter, our friends and family, to Belly\u2019s colleagues, and now it matters to many thousands of you out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want justice for Belly. Belly didn\u2019t lie about being assaulted.\u201d Florence Eshalomi, a Labour MP whose Vauxhall constituency in south London covers part of Brixton, said people have been brought \u2013 again \u2013 to the point of protest through a long history of police brutality and racism in the UK. \u201cWe need to listen to black people\u2019s lived experience; we have to recognise the structural inequality that exists.\u201d Many believe the coronavirus crisis has exacerbated the deep-seated issue of race. \u201cYoung people are getting angry because black people aren\u2019t being taken care of during the coronavirus,\u201d said Aima, 18, one of the organisers of the LDNBLM hashtag. This week, the government released a long-awaited analysis of coronavirus deaths, which showed BAME groups dying disproportionately from Covid 19. In response to this report and Floyd\u2019s killing, campaigners flooded social media, with one slickly produced TikTok video of Wednesday\u2019s demonstrations viewed 1.4m times, while the LDNBLM site shares legal information for protesters in case they are arrested and links to a host of individual campaigns in the UK and US \u2013 as well as upcoming events. One group invited protesters to download educational materials asking \u201chow can we demand racial justice locally\u201d via a supermarket-style QR code. Eshalomi cited Metropolitan police figures showing that nearly half of fixed penalty notices for breaching lockdown rules in the capital between 27 March and 14 May were levied on BAME people. \u201cPeople are tired of reviews, tired of hashtags, they just want action,\u201d she added. Police have been on alert since the weekend and so far have largely handled the protests with a light touch, knowing it may only take one incident to trigger a stronger reaction. They made no effort to police physical distancing rules as crowds crammed together as Wednesday\u2019s demonstration reached Westminster. Senior officers from the National Police Chiefs Council also held an emergency meeting on Monday to agree a statement saying they were \u201cappalled and horrified by the way George Floyd lost his life\u201d and said \u201cwe know people want to make their voices heard\u201d. But there were limits to the empathy: only occasionally officers heeded calls from protesters to join them in taking a knee to remember Floyd. Clashes that took place in the late afternoon and evening with a tiny minority of protesters led to 13 arrests. On Friday, Laurence Taylor, deputy assistant commissioner at the Met, warned that this weekend\u2019s demonstrations against the death of Floyd would be unlawful unless protesters respected physical distancing \u2013 although it is unclear what this will mean in practice. Nicola Sturgeon and Scotland\u2019s chief constable, Iain Livingstone, urged Black Lives Matter supporters to avoid taking part in large public protests because of the risk of transmitting coronavirus. Politicians have been scrambling to keep up as the movement gathers strength and have avoided joining the marchers. Sir Keir Starmer only briefly raised the topic at prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, before sending a longer letter to Boris Johnson a day after calling on him to urge Donald Trump \u201cto respect human rights\u201d as police contend with the protests in the US. Tim Newburn, a professor of criminology and public policy at the London School of Economics, said the protests showed that Britain had entered a new \u201ctransitionary\u201d phase after a long period where the public largely willingly adhered to the lockdown. \u201cI think the public are less clear about whose interests are being protected now the lockdown is being eased,\u201d he said. \u201cAdd into the mix substantial social inequality in the impact of both the pandemic and the lockdown \u2013 and significant racial inequality in particular \u2013 and the dangers are clear.

To anyone watching the drama as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a> death toll mounted, this felt jarringly familiar. Here was real life, poking its nose in where it wasn\u2019t wanted. Couldn\u2019t we even have an hour\u2019s worth of respite from terrifying global events? Apparently not. And this implied a question. The practical challenges presented to the television industry by the Covid-19 pandemic are self-evident. But what about the creative, emotional challenges?

But the Covid-19 pandemic feels different: an open-ended battle against a faceless adversary. And lockdown has already felt like a nostalgia-laden experience. How many of us have revisited box sets, immersed ourselves in 30-year-old football matches, or compiled social media lists of formative cultural experiences? Surely, soon we\u2019ll be in the mood for something new?</p> <p>Dan Hassler-Forest is assistant professor of cultural theory and transmedia practice at Utrecht University. He has also written extensively on the interplay between culture and politics. He is cautiously excited about the post-lockdown possibilities. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an exciting time in terms of both media and politics,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe we got a chance to be nostalgic until we were sick of it? Do we develop nostalgia for the pre-coronavirus recent past?

Already, Covid-19 has trumped a whole host of overfamiliar TV tropes. What price a new conspiracy drama in a post-virus world? It\u2019s telling that the genre really took hold in the 1990s with shows such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/feb/19/when-good-tv-goes-bad-the-x-files\">The X-Files</a> offering speculative fun during a comparatively tranquil era in real-life current affairs. In 2020, such adventurous speculation may not be quite so welcome \u2013 or feel quite so harmless. \u201cThe wildest theories proliferate so quickly now,\u201d says Hassler-Forest. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard for a screenwriter to keep up in terms of creating something more outrageous than these batshit theories about 5G or Bill Gates. It\u2019s straight out of 1970s science fiction and it might not be interesting as entertainment if it\u2019s part of our daily lives.\u201d</p> <p>So what kind of entertainment might offer solace? In terms of serious drama, there\u2019s increasingly an atmosphere of caution. Charlie Brooker has spoken of \u201crevisiting his comic skillset\u201d, and in a recent interview with the <a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2020-05-04/black-mirror-6-update/\">Radio Times</a> wondered whether there\u2019d really be much appetite for a new series of Black Mirror. ITV, meanwhile, has delayed the broadcast of Honour, a dark drama about so-called \u201chonour\u201d killings starring Keeley Hawes. As Kieron Butler, a course leader in television production at Solent University puts it, by autumn \u201cthe country will need Strictly Come Dancing!\u201d A certain degree of emotional consolidation might be in order. There\u2019ll certainly be a yearning for warmth and familiarity.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>I\u2019d think a response to something like this would be much more along the lines of small, comforting, human television,\u201d says Hassler-Forest. \u201cOne thing we might look back upon as an early precedent is the reunion episode of Parks and Recreation, which was done from isolation. It\u2019s about little moments of human connection, reminding each other to take care of ourselves, resorting to a sense of small-town community and maybe taking a bit of television\u2019s old form as a cultural forum where we discuss contemporary issues rather than flee into fantasy.\u201d</p> <p>This process is happening in the UK, too. Butler speaks admiringly of ITV\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/04/isolation-stories-review-powerful-snapshots-of-lockdown-life\">Isolation Stories</a>, which he describes as \u201cmiraculous inside 45 days\u201d. He\u2019s confident that necessity will prove to be the mother of invention. Isolation and social distancing is provoking lateral thinking. Some of it will be inevitably daft. Like Snoop Dogs, a magnificently absurd-sounding Channel 4 update of Through the Keyhole, featuring inquisitive dogs equipped with GoPro cameras in the Loyd Grossman role. \u201cWhat a brilliant response!\u201d says Butler. \u201cOf course it\u2019s ridiculous, but so was The Masked Singer.\u201d Although whether Zoom will have shown us enough of the insides of celebrities\u2019 homes by the time of broadcast remains to be seen.</p> <p>The omnipresence of the Zoom conversation has interesting implications. Butler points out that the <strong>\u201c</strong>direct address to the audience, that use of low-tech that we use to communicate with each other, is becoming more acceptable on television. Lockdown dramas are informed by the pandemic but the style is written into their fabric.\u201d The visual grammar shares common ground with various forms of reality TV, too: what was Channel 4\u2019s The Circle, for example, if not a prototype lockdown drama? Might long experience of confinement and \u201cdiary room\u201d-style video communication with each other make us slightly wary of such small-screen entertainment once we reach the other side of Covid-19?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e2dbaea976dfa3388bcc79dfd0be230be0cecd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e2dbaea976dfa3388bcc79dfd0be230be0cecd1/49_148_2877_2876/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Griffin in Isolation Stories\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phone/home ... Angela Griffin in Isolation Stories.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Often crises simply accelerate developments that were already under way. It\u2019s not impossible that a combination of empty primetime slots and talented outsiders with time on their hands might lead to a happy coincidence of fresh ideas and opportunity. Hassler-Forest cites the \u201ctremendous skill\u201d evident in video narratives constructed for online platforms.</p> <p>\u201cWe are seeing huge creativity from people who are isolated with their parents\u201d he says. \u201cTeenagers making 30-minute movies, basically. Very few of my students even watch much television. Most of the time they\u2019re on Instagram, TikTok or YouTube. So we might be looking at the wrong thing if we\u2019re still thinking about what television is going to be like in terms of responding to this.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s possible these developments might also dovetail with \u201clockdown brain\u201d, the reduced attention span that, anecdotally, seems to be a product of lockdown. Might we gravitate towards shorter, speedier entertainments with so much else weighing on our minds?</p> <p>Nevertheless, more traditional responses will still be called for. Grand statements will be required in respect of a crisis too all-consuming for television to avoid staring it in the face. As was the case around the time of 9/11, variations on the phrase \u201cit\u2019s just like a movie\u201d have become a cliche. But cliches are cliches for a reason: there is a sense that, from zombie dramas to post-apocalyptic thrillers, television and film have been preparing us for a cataclysm like this. Yet now, they seem somewhat inadequate. <strong>\u201c</strong>It\u2019s like we\u2019d already been told exactly what was going to happen and now it\u2019s happening,\u201d says Hassler-Forest. \u201cAlbeit in a slightly different, slightly more tedious form. It\u2019s familiar but it\u2019s less exciting than a zombie apocalypse.\u201d</p> <p>But will Covid-19 have to be incorporated into the fabric of our favourite shows? Will Succession\u2019s feuds now be conducted through face masks, at two metres\u2019 remove? If the possibility sounds strange, the fact remains that the pandemic is potentially too transformative not to acknowledge. Also, as Hassler-Forest points out, \u201cpeople will be eager to incorporate ideas and motifs that resonate with our recent experience. And watching any film and television today, it\u2019s striking how attentive you are to how close people are to each other.\u201d If social distancing is indeed our new normal, it\u2019s hard to see how television can avoid reflecting it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"633e221097edab0f1c3d5166a8a8d3a070d236c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/633e221097edab0f1c3d5166a8a8d3a070d236c6/0_75_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer in 24\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Circadian with \u2018em ... Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer in 24.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The search for deeper meaning will matter too. Back in 2001, The West Wing famously cobbled together a trite, sanctimonious response to the attacks in which characters lectured students (and by extension, viewers) about terrorism. But really, it was Jack Bauer who caught the mood. The first season of 24 was filmed before (but broadcast after) the Twin Towers fell. But subsequent seasons were happy to accommodate a newly bellicose yet paranoid tone. Various studies after 9/11 showed that psychological recovery from this national trauma was easier for people who felt they had found some sort of meaning in both the attacks and the United States\u2019s response to them.</p> <p>But agency is key. After 9/11, an enemy could be identified (or created) and retribution sought. There was a clear narrative and action to be taken. Covid-19 feels different. Unless you\u2019re a key worker, your best expression of heroism involves leaving the house as little as possible. While having a beer in front of a repeat of Minder is the kind of heroism most of us can get behind, it doesn\u2019t feel quite enough to scratch this emotional itch.</p> <p>The closest we\u2019ve come to heroes in recent months have been the people at the heart of national institutions. Not government but certainly the NHS. Fortunately, television has us covered in this regard. We can expect a response from Casualty. But shows such as Hospital and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/17/24-hours-in-ae-review-trauma-tears-and-triage-in-real-life-casualty\">24 Hours in A&amp;E</a> have probably been slightly ahead of the curve in terms of what they\u2019ve come to mean to viewers. They feel analogous to the weekly doorstep clapping that has punctuated the coronavirus crisis. They are essentially television celebrating, in a passionate yet oddly depoliticised way, the social contract.</p> <p>They are comforting as much for what they say about us \u2013 our sublimated longing for community and our pride at the idea of collective endeavour \u2013 as for what they say about the public servants they celebrate. Are these selfless life-savers in inadequate PPE our Jack Bauers? It would be comforting to think so.</p> <p>Inevitably, aspects of the small-screen reaction to the crisis will be lazy. As Hassler-Forest says, \u201cYou cringe at the certainty that every major series, once it returns, is going to do at least one episode entirely on Zoom. There will be screenwriters knocking those things out as we speak!\u201d And yet something more considered might be possible. The virus has pulled the rug from under us in many ways. But it\u2019s also reminded us of what\u2019s important. Just as, in political terms, the NHS is probably safer than it has been in years, so too is the BBC in particular and the concept of public service broadcasting in general. \u201cMaybe,\u201d says Hassler-Forest, \u201cwe\u2019ll be forced to think about what kind of world we want to build out of the wreckage?\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s not impossible that a combination of empty primetime slots and talented outsiders with time on their hands might lead to a happy coincidence of fresh ideas and opportunity. Hassler-Forest cites the \u201ctremendous skill\u201d evident in video narratives constructed for online platforms. \u201cWe are seeing huge creativity from people who are isolated with their parents\u201d he says. \u201cTeenagers making 30-minute movies, basically. Very few of my students even watch much television. Most of the time they\u2019re on Instagram, TikTok or YouTube. So we might be looking at the wrong thing if we\u2019re still thinking about what television is going to be like in terms of responding to this.\u201d It\u2019s possible these developments might also dovetail with \u201clockdown brain\u201d, the reduced attention span that, anecdotally, seems to be a product of lockdown. Might we gravitate towards shorter, speedier entertainments with so much else weighing on our minds? Nevertheless, more traditional responses will still be called for. Grand statements will be required in respect of a crisis too all-consuming for television to avoid staring it in the face. As was the case around the time of 9/11, variations on the phrase \u201cit\u2019s just like a movie\u201d have become a cliche. But cliches are cliches for a reason: there is a sense that, from zombie dramas to post-apocalyptic thrillers, television and film have been preparing us for a cataclysm like this. Yet now, they seem somewhat inadequate. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019d already been told exactly what was going to happen and now it\u2019s happening,\u201d says Hassler-Forest. \u201cAlbeit in a slightly different, slightly more tedious form. It\u2019s familiar but it\u2019s less exciting than a zombie apocalypse.\u201d But will Covid-19 have to be incorporated into the fabric of our favourite shows? Will Succession\u2019s feuds now be conducted through face masks, at two metres\u2019 remove? If the possibility sounds strange, the fact remains that the pandemic is potentially too transformative not to acknowledge. Also, as Hassler-Forest points out, \u201cpeople will be eager to incorporate ideas and motifs that resonate with our recent experience. And watching any film and television today, it\u2019s striking how attentive you are to how close people are to each other.\u201d If social distancing is indeed our new normal, it\u2019s hard to see how television can avoid reflecting it. The search for deeper meaning will matter too. Back in 2001, The West Wing famously cobbled together a trite, sanctimonious response to the attacks in which characters lectured students (and by extension, viewers) about terrorism. But really, it was Jack Bauer who caught the mood. The first season of 24 was filmed before (but broadcast after) the Twin Towers fell. But subsequent seasons were happy to accommodate a newly bellicose yet paranoid tone. Various studies after 9/11 showed that psychological recovery from this national trauma was easier for people who felt they had found some sort of meaning in both the attacks and the United States\u2019s response to them. But agency is key. After 9/11, an enemy could be identified (or created) and retribution sought. There was a clear narrative and action to be taken. Covid-19 feels different. Unless you\u2019re a key worker, your best expression of heroism involves leaving the house as little as possible. While having a beer in front of a repeat of Minder is the kind of heroism most of us can get behind, it doesn\u2019t feel quite enough to scratch this emotional itch. The closest we\u2019ve come to heroes in recent months have been the people at the heart of national institutions. Not government but certainly the NHS. Fortunately, television has us covered in this regard. We can expect a response from Casualty. But shows such as Hospital and 24 Hours in A&amp;E have probably been slightly ahead of the curve in terms of what they\u2019ve come to mean to viewers. They feel analogous to the weekly doorstep clapping that has punctuated the coronavirus crisis. They are essentially television celebrating, in a passionate yet oddly depoliticised way, the social contract. They are comforting as much for what they say about us \u2013 our sublimated longing for community and our pride at the idea of collective endeavour \u2013 as for what they say about the public servants they celebrate. Are these selfless life-savers in inadequate PPE our Jack Bauers? It would be comforting to think so. Inevitably, aspects of the small-screen reaction to the crisis will be lazy. As Hassler-Forest says, \u201cYou cringe at the certainty that every major series, once it returns, is going to do at least one episode entirely on Zoom. There will be screenwriters knocking those things out as we speak!\u201d And yet something more considered might be possible. The virus has pulled the rug from under us in many ways. But it\u2019s also reminded us of what\u2019s important. Just as, in political terms, the NHS is probably safer than it has been in years, so too is the BBC in particular and the concept of public service broadcasting in general. \u201cMaybe,\u201d says Hassler-Forest, \u201cwe\u2019ll be forced to think about what kind of world we want to build out of the wreckage?\u201d",

Find the will Once somebody\u2019s death has been registered and their funeral arranged, the first thing to do is locate the person\u2019s will (or confirm they did not make one). If you cannot find one in their home, contact the person\u2019s solicitor, accountant or bank to see if any of them holds it. You can check whether a will is stored with the Principal Registry of the Family Division. Ask for a search to be made of the safe custody wills register. 2. Contact banks and other financial providers The executors named in the will, or the people who will inherit if there is no will (called intestacy), should start assembling the financial information. You should notify banks, building societies, mortgage lenders, credit card providers and insurance companies. Your first step should be the deathnotificationservice.co.uk, which allows you to notify several banks and building societies of a person\u2019s death at the same time. Then go to the Tell Us Once service, which lets you report a death to most government organisations in one go. You will be able to notify HMRC, DWP, DVLA, the Passport Office and so on in a few clicks. Co-op Legal Services this week also launched a bereavement notification service, which apart from help in notifying banks also gives guidance on closing social media accounts and informing utility and insurance providers. 3.

If the mortgage lender requires interest payments to continue while you are applying for probate, the executor can pay these bills and reclaim the money from the estate once they have obtained probate. The executor should check if there are any payouts from life insurance policies. 4. Begin the formal probate process The executor should apply for a grant of probate, which is the legal document that enables you to access funds, sort finances and share out assets the deceased accumulated. The government website gov.uk/applying-for-probate sets out the process and whether you actually have to go through it. According to Step, in England and Wales, there is usually no need to apply for probate if the estate is worth less than \u00a35,000.

      "body": "<p>The failure of governments and central banks to set out a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis is threatening to derail vital UN climate talks aimed at staving off global catastrophe, campaigners have warned.</p> <p>On Friday, the UK and the UN attempted to revive the stalled Cop26 climate talks, with a coalition of businesses committing to a Race for Zero, signing up to reduce their emissions to net zero by mid-century. Close to 1,000 businesses have joined the campaign, including household names such as Rolls-Royce and the food and drink majors Nestl\u00e9 and Diageo.</p> <p>Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England and UN special envoy for climate and finance, said: \u201cThe transition to net zero is creating the greatest commercial opportunity of our time. Net zero targets must be underpinned by transition plans so that investors can assess which companies will seize the opportunities in the transition and which will cease to exist.\u201d</p> <p>But rhetoric is not enough while central banks are still pouring money into propping up \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, according to campaigners.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been great to hear the government\u2019s warm words about the green recovery, but what really matters now are the policies and investments needed to make it a reality,\u201d said Morten Thaysen, green recovery campaigner at Greenpeace UK.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK has a chance to lead on the world stage next year with Cop26, and set an example of what building back better actually looks like. Committing to this ahead of the climate talks will show international leadership on what a truly green recovery looks like.\u201d</p> <p>The vast majority of the stimulus money so far announced by governments around the world is set to prop up the fossil fuel economy, according to analyst company Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

      "bodyText": "The failure of governments and central banks to set out a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis is threatening to derail vital UN climate talks aimed at staving off global catastrophe, campaigners have warned. On Friday, the UK and the UN attempted to revive the stalled Cop26 climate talks, with a coalition of businesses committing to a Race for Zero, signing up to reduce their emissions to net zero by mid-century. Close to 1,000 businesses have joined the campaign, including household names such as Rolls-Royce and the food and drink majors Nestl\u00e9 and Diageo. Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England and UN special envoy for climate and finance, said: \u201cThe transition to net zero is creating the greatest commercial opportunity of our time. Net zero targets must be underpinned by transition plans so that investors can assess which companies will seize the opportunities in the transition and which will cease to exist.\u201d But rhetoric is not enough while central banks are still pouring money into propping up \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, according to campaigners. \u201cIt\u2019s been great to hear the government\u2019s warm words about the green recovery, but what really matters now are the policies and investments needed to make it a reality,\u201d said Morten Thaysen, green recovery campaigner at Greenpeace UK. \u201cThe UK has a chance to lead on the world stage next year with Cop26, and set an example of what building back better actually looks like. Committing to this ahead of the climate talks will show international leadership on what a truly green recovery looks like.\u201d The vast majority of the stimulus money so far announced by governments around the world is set to prop up the fossil fuel economy, according to analyst company Bloomberg New Energy Finance. More than half a trillion dollars worldwide \u2013 $509bn (\u00a3395bn) \u2013 is to be poured into high-carbon industries, with no conditions to ensure they reduce their carbon output. Only about $12.3bn is to go towards low-carbon industries, such as renewable energy, and a further $18.5bn into high-carbon industries provided they achieve climate targets. At these rates, the rescue packages would be even less green than the economic stimulus following the 2008 financial crisis, despite government rhetoric on a green recovery, and pressure from economists and campaigners to use the stimulus packages to shift to a low-carbon footing. The current and former governors of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey and Mark Carney, joined Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau, governor of the Bank of France, to write in the Guardian of the need for a green recovery. They said: \u201cThe economic recovery plans being developed today offer the chance to build a sustainable, competitive new economy.\u201d However, the first disclosures from the Bank\u2019s Covid Corporate Financing Facility this week showed that billions of pounds of taxpayer support are being funnelled to fossil fuel companies. Airlines have taken up about \u00a31.8bn of the \u00a316bn already allocated from the funds, which could top \u00a367bn when fully disbursed, while carmakers have benefited by more than \u00a31bn so far and two oil service companies, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger, are taking \u00a3600m and \u00a3150m respectively. \u201cThe Bank of England\u2019s failure to lead by example in greening its activities risks seriously undermining the UK\u2019s efforts to show global leadership on climate through Cop26,\u201d said Fran Boait, executive director of the pressure group Positive Money. \u201cIt would be farcical if the institution underpinning Britain\u2019s financial system is still pumping money towards companies whose business models are utterly incompatible with global emissions targets.\u201d The European Central Bank has also propped up high-carbon industries in its lending, with as much as \u20ac220bn (\u00a3193bn) going to fossil fuel industries, according to analysis by the pressure group Reclaim Finance.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus pandemic has wrought destruction on US workers at a scale and speed that is almost unfathomable. It was only in February that Donald Trump was touting an unemployment level of 3.5%, a 50-year low. The unemployment rate dropped on Friday to 13.3% \u2013 but is still at its highest level since the 1980s \u2013 and many economists fear the real figure is far higher. In just four months 42 million people have filed for unemployment insurance, more people than the population of Canada. Such huge numbers can numb reality \u2013 a reality that will cause suffering and hardship for millions of people for years to come. Trump claimed victory after the latest jobs report and Republicans are pressing for lockdowns to be eased further, threatening a further spike in coronavirus cases. A new round of stimulus cash for struggling people and businesses now looks more unlikely. Over the last few months the Guardian has interviewed Americans who have lost their jobs all across the country. Here we return to some of them to see how they are faring as the US is, nominally, getting back to \u201cnormal\u201d. For many of them \u201cnormal\u201d seems a long way off. \u2018We don\u2019t make any money now\u2019 Aya Rabbaa As the US opens up for business again, Aya Rabbaa, 19, should be one of the success stories. She lost her part-time job at an iHop restaurant in Madison, Wisconsin, in March and waited eight weeks to receive her unemployment check. The restaurant is open after Wisconsin\u2019s supreme court struck down the state\u2019s stay-at-home order, against the wishes of its Democratic governor, Tony Evers. Rabbaa, a college student, relies on her wages to pay her expenses, but the coronavirus pandemic has taken a heavy toll. \u201cWe don\u2019t make any money now,\u201d she says. Despite the court ruling, customers are scared and the tips she relies on have dried up. \u201cI could make $160 to $200 a day before this. Now I leave with $40,\u201d said Rabbaa. \u201cPeople are worried. I can\u2019t see this getting back to normal for a year.\u201d \u2018The inequality and injustice need to stop\u2019 Latasha Johnson Latasha Johnson has been waiting more than two months to get her first unemployment insurance check, but in the past week, her top concern is about what that workplace will look like when she does return. Johnson, 41, has been reflecting on racism she has experienced and witnessed at work amid the protests over the police killing of George Floyd. \u201cNot only does the inequality and injustice need to stop in the police systems, but it also needs to stop within our job sites as well,\u201d she said. In mid-March, Johnson was laid off from her job in dining services at the University of Illinois, where she described what she sees as a pattern of racial discrimination at work. One black supervisor was repeatedly passed over for managerial roles, she said, before a young white student with no experience in food service was promoted above him. A white co-worker repeatedly referred to an older black colleague from the south as \u201cboy\u201d. She said the white worker was forced to take anti-discrimination classes and moved to a different unit, where they still worked with predominantly black people. Meanwhile, she waits for her unemployment insurance claim to be processed \u2013 a problem affecting millions of Americans \u2013 and has had to borrow money to survive. \u201cAll of this stuff, it\u2019s a huge stress,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cIt takes a turn on you, not just as an American and a woman, but a black woman in America.\u201d \u2018I\u2019m squeaking by right now\u2019 Taylor Cox Taylor Cox, 29, has seen the crisis as a call to action. Cox was laid off from an Indiana casino in March, and has used his new free time to fully dedicate himself to union work. Two months later he is still out of work but \u201cbusier now than I was when I was working my job at the casino\u201d, Cox, a member of Unite Here, says. Roughly 95% of Unite Here\u2019s 300,000 members are out of work from industries hardest-hit by lockdowns, such as gaming and food service. Five to six days a week, Cox fields calls from people trying to figure out why they haven\u2019t received unemployment insurance nine weeks after they applied, or want to know what their rights are as businesses reopen. He is worried about what happens when the federal government\u2019s unemployment expansion of $600 a week ends in July. \u201cI\u2019m squeaking by right now with the state unemployment plus the $600 per week, but if it goes down to just the state amount, I don\u2019t know how I am going to be able to do it,\u201d Cox said.

Estate agents are reporting that rich overseas buyers have spent tens of millions on historic central London properties during the pandemic even though they have often only seen the homes over Zoom video calls. A Russian energy industry billionaire bought a five-bedroom, seven-storey townhouse on Old Queen Street overlooking St James\u2019s Park in central London for \u00a315.45m, two days after the government allowed the reopening of the housing market last month. The 6,573 sq ft grade-II listed property at 26 Old Queen Street, close to the Palace of Westminster, had originally been listed for sale at \u00a316.5m. Research by the property consultants Knight Frank shows luxury London house prices fell by 2.1% in April \u2013 the biggest one-month decline since 2009 in the height of the financial crisis. Prime central London prices declined by a further 1.4% in May compared with April, taking the annualised decline to 5.1%. The declines are bigger than for overall property prices, which according to the Nationwide were up 0.9% between March and April and then down 1.7% between April and May.

      "body": "<p>Max Brooks is getting a little tired of being proved right. An author with cult appeal and massive sales, he is regularly referred to as \u201ca soothsayer\u201d and \u201ca genius\u201d. His 2006 novel, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/world-war-z-9780715653739.html\">World War Z</a></em>, was about a deadly virus originating in China that causes global devastation, and his compulsive new one, <em>Devolution: A Firsthand Account of the Sasquatch Massacre</em>, is about people forced into self-isolation, huddling in terror from an unimaginable threat outside. But Brooks, 47, is dismissive of the hyperbole: \u201cEverything I write about has already happened. The history of pandemics tends to come in extremely predictable cycles. So if I\u2019m the smartest guy in the room, we\u2019re in big trouble,\u201d he tells me over Skype from his home in Los Angeles (our interview was in May, before the national protests after the killing of George Floyd, but well after lockdown started.). He has the jittery energy of the chronically anxious, and the easy confidence of one who has been thoroughly validated.</p> <p>He certainly saw the coronavirus coming long before most politicians, and was making preparations in January. On 16 March, when most people in the western world were barely getting to grips with the lockdown, he made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40yPXcMaOw\">a video</a> about the importance of social distancing to protect the elderly. He enlisted the help of the oldest person in his life, his father, comedy god, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/mel-brooks\">Mel Brooks</a>. \u201cIf I get the coronavirus, I\u2019ll probably be OK. But if I give it to him, he could give it to Carl Reiner, who can give it to Dick Van Dyke, and before I know it, I\u2019ve wiped out a whole generation of comedic legends,\u201d says Brooks, pointing to his father behind a glass door and listing his closest friends. The video has been watched more than 16m times. \u201cI wasn\u2019t given some secret information. I got my information from the news. Really deep state: turning on CNN and watching Wuhan getting locked down,\u201d he says dryly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I thought World War Z was a really cool movie that happened to have the same title of a book I once wrote</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nonetheless, he even scared himself when he predicted a day in his own life. Despite its title, <em>Devolution</em> has nothing to do with Scottish political independence, \u201cand I\u2019ll do a Scottish apology tour if it\u2019s a problem, from the Outer Hebrides to Hadrian\u2019s Wall,\u201d he says. It tells the story of an eco-community that is cut off from the outside world after a volcano erupts, and that is only the start of their problems. The novel is largely told through the journal of Kate, one of the community\u2019s inhabitants, and in one scene she warns her partner, Dan, against cleaning the solar panels on their roof, because she\u2019s worried he\u2019ll hurt himself. \u201cInjury turns you from a giver to a taker,\u201d another inhabitant adds.</p> <p>Cut to spring 2020 and Brooks is in lockdown at home with his wife, Michelle Kholos (\u201cthe greatest playwright in the world!\u201d) and their teenage son, Henry. He heads up to clean out the gutters on the roof. \u201cAnd my wife said: \u2018Oh no you don\u2019t! If you fall, you can\u2019t cook, you can\u2019t clean, you just consume resources,\u2019\u201d he recalls. Does it freak him out to live in his own books? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t freak me out, it saddens me. Because I would much rather be wrong,\u201d he says</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"692456b7031b29eae1c48141a6a3275ae8315866\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/692456b7031b29eae1c48141a6a3275ae8315866/0_102_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brad Pitt, left, and Daniella Kertesz in the 2013 film adaptation of World War Z.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brad Pitt, left, and Daniella Kertesz in the 2013 film adaptation of World War Z.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jaap Buitendijk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>World War Z,</em> which uses zombies as a metaphor for the Sars virus, with the infected turning into killer creatures, takes a geopolitical perspective of a pandemic, with each country responding to the crisis in characteristic style: Israel makes brutally pragmatic choices to save itself; the US is overconfident about its exceptionalism. The parallels with today are breathtaking.</p> <p>\u201cBut on a personal level, the day-to-day life of what we\u2019re all going through now, that\u2019s played out in <em>Devolution</em>. And that I did not expect,\u201d says Brooks. And that\u2019s no surprise, given <em>Devolution</em> is a thriller about Big Foot. Yet the novel provides very practical solutions for how to deal with isolation and fear \u2013 growing your own vegetable garden, seeking out small groups of trusted friends \u2013 and it is to Brooks\u2019s credit that his galumphing beasts are genuinely scary, as opposed to laughable. When I make the mistake of mentioning the saccharine 1980s Big Foot family comedy, <em>Harry and the Hendersons</em>, Brooks \u2013 who takes his responsibilities to fans of horror (\u201cmy tribe\u201d) as seriously as any other part of his research \u2013 recoils in disgust: \u201cNoooo!\u201d</p> <p>Brooks has always been a worrier. When I ask if he was an anxious kid, he reels back as if I\u2019d asked if the Pacific Ocean is wet: \u201cOh GAHHHHD. Yes!\u201d he gasps. He researches disasters because it\u2019s when he doesn\u2019t understand something, or what to do about it, that he spins out. \u201cKnowledge calms me down. I can deal with fear, it\u2019s the anxiety I have trouble with,\u201d he says. It\u2019s a testament to the thoroughness of his research that after the publication of <em>World War Z </em>he was invited to join the Modern War Institute at West Point as a <a href=\"https://mwi.usma.edu/max-brooks/\">non-resident fellow</a>. There, he writes articles about \u201cnon-military issues that could turn violent in the future,\u201d he says, such as a recent piece about <a href=\"https://mwi.usma.edu/food-insecurity-the-real-danger-of-monsantos-sale-to-bayer/\">how corporations now control the food chain</a>, and he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgq04T9YOCc\">lectures cadets</a> about how to think creatively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/maxbrooksauthor/status/1239624352305303552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A message from me and my dad, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MelBrooks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Melbrooks</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirus</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DontBeASpreader?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DontBeASpreader</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Hqhc4fFXbe\">pic.twitter.com/Hqhc4fFXbe</a></p>&mdash; Max Brooks (@maxbrooksauthor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxbrooksauthor/status/1239624352305303552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 16, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But how to educate the public? He knows some people don\u2019t listen to lectures, or even the news. So instead he channels his knowledge into popular fiction. \u201cI write about fictional threats, because they\u2019re easier for people to deal with, but I provide factual solutions,\u201d he says. <em>World War Z</em>, which has sold over 1m copies, has been named among the <a href=\"https://www.duckworthbooks.co.uk/horribly-good-books/\">best horror books of all time</a>, alongside Stephen King\u2019s <em>It</em> and Bram Stoker\u2019s <em>Dracula</em>. But Brooks\u2019s writing hero is thriller writer Tom Clancy, famously another fan of research. \u201cThe best way to educate is to entertain. In the second world war, the US government got Hollywood on board to break down the complicated strategic ideas into very simple stories, and America used to be the best at that. But somewhere along the line we gave up,\u201d he says.</p> <p>While stressing that he\u2019s \u201cquite proud to be the child of these two awesome parents\u201d \u2013 his mother was the late, great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jun/08/obituaries.news\">Anne Bancroft</a> \u2013 Brooks has generally kept his parents at arm\u2019s length from his career. Unlike plenty of other Hollywood progeny, he has not wanted to be known as anyone\u2019s junior, because he found out early on that it would only hurt him: his first book, <em>The Zombie Survival Guide</em> (2003), was originally marketed as \u201cMel Brooks Jr writes <em>Young Frankenstein</em> part two!\u201d The book flopped, \u201cand no surprise, because the media looked at it and said: \u2018This is the least funny book ever\u2019, and the horror people thought Mel Brooks\u2019s brat was taking a giant dump on something they loved,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everyone wanted Anne Bancroft to be sexy Mrs Robinson. Nobody cared that her favourite book was about microbes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brooks is not anyone\u2019s image of a Hollywood brat. Yes, his parents had famous friends: Reiner, Van Dyke, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gene-wilder\">Gene Wilder</a>. But when they would all meet up on Sundays, they tended to talk about whether anyone had found a good dentist in Los Angeles, and who knew of a decent car mechanic. \u201cThey were all immigrants to this town \u2013 they were trying to figure out how to live,\u201d Brooks says. The family was comfortable, but his father drove him to school in a Honda Accord 1982 (\u201cbest car ever\u201d) because, he told his son: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to make your fortune. But don\u2019t drive your fortune past people who are starving.\u201d His dad may have written the line, \u201cIf you got it, flaunt it\u201d, for <em>The Producers</em>, but that was very much not how he lived. \u201cBoth my parents came from poverty and most people who are first-generation wealth always worry they\u2019re going to lose their money, because they\u2019re not really sure where it came from,\u201d says Brooks. His father lives close by in Santa Monica and, until the virus started, he would come to Brooks\u2019s house every evening before heading off for his nightly dinner with his best friend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/20/love-and-free-food-mel-brooks-and-carl-reiner-share-the-secrets-of-their-70-year-friendship\">Carl Reiner</a>. These days, Brooks and his son go to his father\u2019s house and wave at him through the glass door, just as he did in the video.</p> <p>Brooks has his mother\u2019s dark Italian colouring and his father\u2019s features as well as his wit. (When I ask if he liked the 2013 movie adaptation of <em>World War Z</em>, starring Brad Pitt, he replies: \u201cI thought it was a really cool movie that happened to have the same title of a book I once wrote.\u201d) He credits his love of science and research to his mother: \u201cIn show business they only ever want one flavour and everyone just wanted her to be sexy Mrs Robinson. Nobody cared that her favourite book was about microbes \u2013 but I did. Everything I am comes from her,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Bancroft was 40 when she was pregnant with Brooks and had long since given up hope of conceiving. She was asked if she wanted a test for Down\u2019s syndrome, but was warned if she had a termination she would never be able to get pregnant again. Bancroft refused, saying she would love this baby whatever. \u201cSo I was very ... appreciated,\u201d says Brooks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>America has the most incompetent, disastrous, captain ever, but the ship has had mechanical problems for some time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a child, he struggled with reading, and although the school dismissed him as another lazy Hollywood kid, his mother suspected he was dyslexic. She was right. There was little help available to dyslexic kids in the early 80s, but in 1959 Bancroft had won an Oscar for her performance in <em>The Miracle Worker </em>as Annie Sullivan, who taught Helen Keller, who was deaf and blind, how to read. So she knew about services available to blind children and she adapted them for her son, such as turning his schoolbooks into audiobooks, so he could read along to the tapes. \u201cPeople assume because of who my parents are that I had this very privileged childhood. And they\u2019re damn right, because I had this incredible mother who understood her son,\u201d he says. His father, he says, \u201cwas busy feeding us. My parents were great partners.\u201d Bancroft died from uterine cancer in 2005, two months after Brooks\u2019s son was born, \u201cso she got to be a grandmother for a bit. Thank God,\u201d he says.</p> <p>After college, Brooks worked briefly at <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, but soon realised he is really more of a solo worker than a collaborator. At 31, he published <em>The Zombie Survival Guide</em>, turning a lifetime of anxiety about existential threats into something potentially productive. For every one hour of writing, he says, he spends up to 100 hours researching, \u201cand that totally comes from my mom\u201d. People often ask if writing about zombies and Big Foot and apocalypses scares him, because they don\u2019t understand that the writing calms him down. But now he has a different problem: he knows too much.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t pacify myself with the ignorant notion that we were caught unaware [by the virus]. I can\u2019t go to bed at night thinking, we didn\u2019t have a plan so all the mistakes are forgivable. Here it is!\u201d he says, brandishing a thick wodge of papers, which is the National Response Framework, the United States\u2019s plan for how to respond to emergencies. \u201cSo there is absolutely a plan.\u201d According to Brooks, if America had fully locked down the country for three weeks, instead of doing it piecemeal state by state, and maintained a strict lockdown, the virus would have gone.</p> <p>I ask if the problem was the incumbent president. \u201cI don\u2019t want to blame everything on Trump. America has the most incompetent, disastrous, dangerous captain that we\u2019ve ever had. But the ship has had mechanical problems for some time,\u201d he says. He launches into an engrossing monologue about how trust in the government has collapsed, after it was attacked first by the left in the 1960s, then by the right in the 80s, eroding public trust to a disastrous effect. \u201cWe have planted a very bitter crop, and now it\u2019s harvest time,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But none of this explains why the UK\u2019s response has been so terrible, I say. He throws his hands in the air, exasperated. \u201cI expected all this from us. But I did not expect it from you. I\u2019m shocked, because you already had a national health service, you\u2019re much more unified than us, you still understand the need for government. So what\u2019s your excuse?\u201d he asks. There are some questions even Max Brooks can\u2019t answer.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Max Brooks is on Twitter @maxbrooksauthor</em></p>",

Unlike plenty of other Hollywood progeny, he has not wanted to be known as anyone\u2019s junior, because he found out early on that it would only hurt him: his first book, The Zombie Survival Guide (2003), was originally marketed as \u201cMel Brooks Jr writes Young Frankenstein part two!\u201d The book flopped, \u201cand no surprise, because the media looked at it and said: \u2018This is the least funny book ever\u2019, and the horror people thought Mel Brooks\u2019s brat was taking a giant dump on something they loved,\u201d he says. Brooks is not anyone\u2019s image of a Hollywood brat. Yes, his parents had famous friends: Reiner, Van Dyke, Gene Wilder. But when they would all meet up on Sundays, they tended to talk about whether anyone had found a good dentist in Los Angeles, and who knew of a decent car mechanic. \u201cThey were all immigrants to this town \u2013 they were trying to figure out how to live,\u201d Brooks says. The family was comfortable, but his father drove him to school in a Honda Accord 1982 (\u201cbest car ever\u201d) because, he told his son: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to make your fortune. But don\u2019t drive your fortune past people who are starving.\u201d His dad may have written the line, \u201cIf you got it, flaunt it\u201d, for The Producers, but that was very much not how he lived. \u201cBoth my parents came from poverty and most people who are first-generation wealth always worry they\u2019re going to lose their money, because they\u2019re not really sure where it came from,\u201d says Brooks. His father lives close by in Santa Monica and, until the virus started, he would come to Brooks\u2019s house every evening before heading off for his nightly dinner with his best friend, Carl Reiner. These days, Brooks and his son go to his father\u2019s house and wave at him through the glass door, just as he did in the video. Brooks has his mother\u2019s dark Italian colouring and his father\u2019s features as well as his wit. (When I ask if he liked the 2013 movie adaptation of World War Z, starring Brad Pitt, he replies: \u201cI thought it was a really cool movie that happened to have the same title of a book I once wrote.\u201d) He credits his love of science and research to his mother: \u201cIn show business they only ever want one flavour and everyone just wanted her to be sexy Mrs Robinson. Nobody cared that her favourite book was about microbes \u2013 but I did. Everything I am comes from her,\u201d he says. Bancroft was 40 when she was pregnant with Brooks and had long since given up hope of conceiving. She was asked if she wanted a test for Down\u2019s syndrome, but was warned if she had a termination she would never be able to get pregnant again. Bancroft refused, saying she would love this baby whatever. \u201cSo I was very ... appreciated,\u201d says Brooks. As a child, he struggled with reading, and although the school dismissed him as another lazy Hollywood kid, his mother suspected he was dyslexic. She was right. There was little help available to dyslexic kids in the early 80s, but in 1959 Bancroft had won an Oscar for her performance in The Miracle Worker as Annie Sullivan, who taught Helen Keller, who was deaf and blind, how to read. So she knew about services available to blind children and she adapted them for her son, such as turning his schoolbooks into audiobooks, so he could read along to the tapes. \u201cPeople assume because of who my parents are that I had this very privileged childhood. And they\u2019re damn right, because I had this incredible mother who understood her son,\u201d he says. His father, he says, \u201cwas busy feeding us. My parents were great partners.\u201d Bancroft died from uterine cancer in 2005, two months after Brooks\u2019s son was born, \u201cso she got to be a grandmother for a bit. Thank God,\u201d he says. After college, Brooks worked briefly at Saturday Night Live, but soon realised he is really more of a solo worker than a collaborator. At 31, he published The Zombie Survival Guide, turning a lifetime of anxiety about existential threats into something potentially productive. For every one hour of writing, he says, he spends up to 100 hours researching, \u201cand that totally comes from my mom\u201d. People often ask if writing about zombies and Big Foot and apocalypses scares him, because they don\u2019t understand that the writing calms him down. But now he has a different problem: he knows too much. \u201cI can\u2019t pacify myself with the ignorant notion that we were caught unaware [by the virus]. I can\u2019t go to bed at night thinking, we didn\u2019t have a plan so all the mistakes are forgivable. Here it is!\u201d he says, brandishing a thick wodge of papers, which is the National Response Framework, the United States\u2019s plan for how to respond to emergencies. \u201cSo there is absolutely a plan.\u201d According to Brooks, if America had fully locked down the country for three weeks, instead of doing it piecemeal state by state, and maintained a strict lockdown, the virus would have gone. I ask if the problem was the incumbent president. \u201cI don\u2019t want to blame everything on Trump. America has the most incompetent, disastrous, dangerous captain that we\u2019ve ever had. But the ship has had mechanical problems for some time,\u201d he says. He launches into an engrossing monologue about how trust in the government has collapsed, after it was attacked first by the left in the 1960s, then by the right in the 80s, eroding public trust to a disastrous effect. \u201cWe have planted a very bitter crop, and now it\u2019s harvest time,\u201d he says. But none of this explains why the UK\u2019s response has been so terrible, I say. He throws his hands in the air, exasperated. \u201cI expected all this from us. But I did not expect it from you. I\u2019m shocked, because you already had a national health service, you\u2019re much more unified than us, you still understand the need for government. So what\u2019s your excuse?\u201d he asks. There are some questions even Max Brooks can\u2019t answer. \u2022 Max Brooks is on Twitter @maxbrooksauthor",

      "body": "<h2>14 February: extreme shivers, extreme sweats</h2> <p>I\u2019m lying in bed, shivering like crazy. My partner, Diane, is asleep, and I burrow deep into her back. I\u2019m sweating like crazy, too. I\u2019m desperate for the loo, and I run there in my shivery sweats and sweaty shivers. It\u2019s only five minutes since I last went. When I sleep, the same obsessive moment plays again and again. It\u2019s to do with numbers. I need to get past number nine, but I can\u2019t. The dream lasts for hours. Finally, I force myself awake. Ten minutes have passed.</p> <p>I felt like this once before, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/22/world-encephalitis-day-horrific-pain-brain-care\" title=\"\">when I had encephalitis</a> as a kid. That lasted more than two years, but it\u2019s one particular night I\u2019m thinking of \u2013 the sweats and shivers, and the fear that I\u2019m not going to make it through till morning. After that, I used to check my pulse every time I woke up to see if I was alive.</p> <p>Last night Diane took me to the emergency GP. The GP was lovely, caring, cautious. But too cautious. Diane told her I\u2019d gone a bit loopy. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cOnly in my sleep. I\u2019m perfectly sane and lucid in the day.\u201d The doctor asked me what day it was, how many fingers she was holding up. Thursday, four fingers. She said to Diane that I may have sepsis. Perhaps I ought to go to hospital, even if only as a precaution. Sepsis can kill, she said. Sepsis my arse, I said to Diane on the way home. I\u2019ve got a urine infection and I just want to go back to bed.</p> <p>I\u2019m still shivering and sweating when Diane wakes up. She says we\u2019re going to the hospital. No, I say, I just want to sweat it out. I want to wrap the duvet around me and turn into a Simon burrito.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to A&amp;E,\u201d Diane says.</p> <p>I tell her I don\u2019t want to go.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so unyielding!\u201d I shout. Diane and I rarely argue. She looks upset. I don\u2019t know where the word unyielding comes from; I\u2019ve certainly never said it to Diane before.</p> <p>A&amp;E is packed. Valentine\u2019s Day, but nothing romantic about it. I am expecting to wait for hours, but as soon as I see the triage nurse, they put me on a bed in a cubicle. Within minutes, they\u2019ve inserted a canula. They test my blood pressure, my oxygen level, temperature. None of it is quite normal, but my temperature is the biggest concern \u2013 over 39C. Ever since the misdiagnosis of my encephalitis (my doctor, who just happened to be my dad\u2019s best friend, told me I was a malingerer, and suggested that Mum had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/aug/19/features11.g21\" title=\"\">Munchausen</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/aug/19/features11.g21\" title=\"\"> syndrome by proxy</a>), I have been terrified of being called a hypochondriac and done my best to stay away from hospital.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Three days of IV antibiotics get rid of my urinary infection and my temperature. The only thing is, I\u2019ve started to cough</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re treating it as sepsis,\u201d the doctor says, more to Diane than me. \u201cIf it\u2019s not sepsis, he\u2019s on the road to sepsis. We\u2019re going to put him on IV antibiotics. It\u2019s the Domestos treatment \u2013 kills all bugs.\u201d I smile. It sounds good. And, best of all, I\u2019m being believed.</p> <p>This small ward (six beds) is where people come when they\u2019re admitted straight from A&amp;E. It isn\u2019t full. Ilias is in agony with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/sickle-cell-disease\" title=\"\">sickle cell anaemia</a>; he\u2019s on morphine to ease the pain, but it makes him horribly itchy. The man next to me is out for the count: heavy, middle-aged, he just collapsed the other day and was rushed in. Barry, the fella closest to the window, is having tests. He\u2019s had an unlucky couple of years during which he\u2019s been in and out of hospital \u2013 a terrible car crash, broken back, urinary infections, and now goodness knows what. There is a spoilt young lad who plays his films and music at top volume. </p> <p>The IV paracetamol brings my temperature right down. Then it whizzes back, to almost 40C. I sit on the edge of my bed hugging my coat. The number game starts again; I still can\u2019t get past nine. They put me back on the IV paracetamol. Again, it does the trick.</p> <p>It\u2019s early evening and Diane and my younger daughter, Maya, have to leave. This is my first night in hospital since I was 11, and I\u2019m weepy. I\u2019ve got my laptop and headphones, and I\u2019m playing the same song on a loop: the medley from the Beatles\u2019 Abbey Road \u2013 Golden Slumbers, Carry That Weight and The End. I feel as if I\u2019m grieving, but I don\u2019t know what for.</p> <p>Saturday, I\u2019m feeling stronger. There\u2019s a camaraderie on the ward. The nurses are beyond wonderful \u2013 endlessly patient with difficult patients, physically strong, kind. Likewise the ancillary staff who keep the place virtually spotless. Sure, there\u2019s a cockroach in the loo, but it\u2019s more pet than threat.</p> <p>I am given three lots of IV antibiotics a day for three days. The nurses wake me gently in the night to test my blood pressure and oxygen levels. I am sent for a chest X-ray. Within a couple of days, I\u2019m feeling human. My appetite is back. Even the food is good: lamb dhansak and chickpeas, jerk chicken with rice and peas, fish and chips with mushy peas.</p> <p>Everybody is talking about the terrible virus that appears to be decimating China. Three weeks ago, a whole city, Wuhan, was placed under quarantine. Unbelievable. Two weeks ago, the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency and named the disease Covid-19, short for \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d. Almost 1,400 people have died in China, and today France has announced the first Covid-19 death in Europe. Thankfully, there\u2019s nothing here yet, though we are being advised to wash our hands regularly for 20 seconds while singing God Save The Queen.</p> <p>Miraculously, three days of IV antibiotics and paracetamol get rid of my urinary tract infection and my temperature. The only thing is, I\u2019ve started to cough, badly. I\u2019ve been susceptible to chest infections since my encephalitis. Back then, I was rushed to hospital with a pneumonia that almost did for me, and ended up staying there for six weeks.</p> <p>My chest feels dreadful by Monday morning. The doctors so far have been lovely \u2013 all women, all good listeners. The doctor who discharges me is a young man, and not a good listener. He says he thinks I\u2019ll be fine to go home today, if that\u2019s OK. It feels like a rhetorical question. I don\u2019t want to say it isn\u2019t fine (who wants to stay in hospital, however good the food?) and I don\u2019t want to sound aggressive. So I tell him I think I have a chest infection, and would perhaps benefit from another chest X-ray. He doesn\u2019t seem to hear. A few minutes later I search him out and say I\u2019m worried, because I have a history of chest infections and pneumonia. He tells me the antibiotics will take care of that.</p> <p>I feel sad to say goodbye to Ilias and Barry, and sad because one infection seems to have been replaced by another. Sure, I\u2019m no longer crazy feverish, but nor would I say I was fixed. Still, they obviously need the beds.</p> <h2>20 February: \u2018That doesn\u2019t sound good\u2019</h2> <p>Yesterday the global death toll from Covid-19 passed 2,000. Meanwhile, my chest is getting rawer and sorer. I head to the GP where a locum really listens \u2013 to me and my chest. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound good at all,\u201d she says. \u201cCould be pneumonia. I think you should get back to the hospital for an X-ray.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc9e8317be15cc35163670213c15e39aa751e0dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc9e8317be15cc35163670213c15e39aa751e0dc/0_0_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Hattenstone, photographed by his daughter in hospital on 20 February with a nebuliser over his nose and mouth\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re going to put you on a nebuliser for 20 minutes\u2019: Simon Hattenstone, photographed by his daughter in hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maya Hattenstone</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I see another young male doctor at A&amp;E.

Afterwards, he takes off my mask. \u201cAny better?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I say. \u201cBut it does feel like I\u2019ve been on a mini break to the seaside.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cOK, we\u2019ll give you another 20 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Asthma asks if I use an inhaler. I tell him I sometimes use a blue Ventolin, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have any effect.</p> <p>\u201cDo you inhale straight from the Ventolin or have you got an AeroChamber?\u201d</p> <p>I look blank.</p> <p>\u201cAh well, that\u2019s it. They\u2019re useless without the chambers. I\u2019m going to give you one to take home.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m beginning to think he may be a salesman rather than a doctor. Then he gives me a packet of steroids, which puts my mind at rest.</p> <p>Eight tiny pills, a few times a day. They make no difference, except for making me feel sick when they stick in my throat. My breathing is getting worse.</p> <h2>Early March: do we cancel our big party?</h2> <p>Diane and I have been together for over 30 years, and in January we got \u201ccivilled\u201d; civil partnerships for mixed-sex relationships had just been introduced. We were only the fourth heterosexual couple to get one in the London borough of Haringey, and were a little bit proud of it. It was a great day \u2013 surprisingly romantic, fun, history-making (if you count fourth). Only immediate family were there, but we are planning a big party in two weeks \u2013 by far the biggest we\u2019ve ever hosted. We\u2019ve invited more than 200 people, and even if I\u2019m not on top form, it\u2019s only one evening. It will be great anyway.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the WHO has just raised the global risk of spread of Covid-19 from \u201chigh\u201d to \u201cvery high\u201d. \u201cThis is a reality check for every government on the planet. Wake up. Get ready,\u201d says Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO\u2019s health emergencies programme.</p> <p>Everybody has started talking about how vulnerable old people are, and the need for social distancing. I am slightly worried about my symptoms. We don\u2019t want to kill off our guests, after all. I phone the GP, hang on for the obligatory 20 minutes before reception passes me to a doctor. \u201cCan I check whether I was tested for coronavirus in hospital?\u201d I ask. They did so many tests, but I haven\u2019t a clue what for. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, and puts down the phone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I promise you, you do not have coronavirus, you\u2019re just getting better from what may have been a little chest infection</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The public are being advised to phone NHS 111 if they are worried they might have coronavirus. After half an hour I get through. If you have symptoms, you go through the process again. Eventually I get through to a helpful nurse. \u201cYes, those sound like Covid-19 symptoms,\u201d she says. \u201cWould you prefer to see your GP or the emergency GP at the hospital?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEmergency GP at the hospital,\u201d I say, too enthusiastically.</p> <p>The hospital GP is charm personified. I tell her I\u2019m worried I may have Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cHave you been abroad recently, to China or Italy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you been in contact with anybody who has had coronavirus?\u201d How on earth do I know, I think.</p> <p>She gets out her stethoscope: \u201cA little bit of wheeziness, maybe.\u201d</p> <p>She asks me to blow into a peak flow meter. I take a mighty breath and reach 450.</p> <p>\u201cWonderful! 500!\u201d she says. \u201cAbsolutely nothing to worry about.\u201d</p> <p>I ask if I can try again because I normally do better on a second go. It\u2019s 350. And the third time. She ignores those readings. \u201c500. Wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s safe to have our party? I\u2019ve heard about this social distancing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely safe. I promise you, you do not have coronavirus, you\u2019re just getting better from what may have been a little chest infection.\u201d</p> <p>I go home relieved. When Diane returns, I tell her I definitely don\u2019t have Covid-19: it\u2019s game on for the party. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you thought you did have it,\u201d she says.</p> <p> On 3 March, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, boasts on telly about shaking hands with the Covid-19 patients he\u2019s just met. In fact, the PM seems to be getting more insouciant by the day. On 5 March he suggests that, rather than locking down the country, \u201cone of the theories is that perhaps you could take it on the chin, take it all in one go and allow the disease, as it were, to move through the population, without taking as many draconian measures\u201d. Apparently, this is known as herd immunity.</p> <h2>10 March: the empty clinic</h2> <p>Nothing is shifting. I am breathless climbing the stairs. The asthma pump makes no difference. I ring the surgery and tell the doctor that I wasn\u2019t given an X-ray at hospital. \u201cOh, poor love,\u201d says Dr Niceynice. \u201cBless you. That\u2019s shocking. I\u2019m booking you in for one right this minute.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Niceynice is magnificent at phone empathy, less good at face-to-face appointments. She sends me to the smaller local hospital up the road. It\u2019s gloriously empty. A man in a mask ushers me to a waiting area, but before I have time to sit down I\u2019m whisked off for the X-ray. In and out.</p> <p>An hour after getting home, I get a call from Dr Niceynice. \u201cYour X-ray\u2019s clear,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, but\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Too late. Dr Niceynice has put the phone down.</p> <h2>12 March: a pandemic</h2> <p>My wheezing sounds like feedback \u2013 a song <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/my-bloody-valentine\" title=\"\">My Bloody Valentine</a> may have written in their heyday. Diane says she\u2019s worried. Yesterday the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic. Everybody seems to be talking about why Britain hasn\u2019t gone into lockdown; why is everything going on as normal?</p> <p>At night I can\u2019t sleep.</p> <p>\u201cWhat d\u2019you think it is?\u201d Diane says.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe a bit of pneumonia, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m getting better.\u201d</p> <p> We tell our guests we\u2019re going ahead with the party. Great, ping back the emails, we need something to celebrate.</p> <p>My sister, Sharon, and I argue for the first time ever. She doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s safe for Mum to come to the party and wants me to tell her not to. I say I\u2019m happy for her not to come, but I\u2019m not going to <em>tell</em> her not to. Mum, an incredibly youthful if shrunken 92-year-old, could stay alive by locking herself away and having a miserable existence, or she could take a few risks and thoroughly enjoy her final years, I say; it\u2019s the difference between living and existing. Ugh. I can\u2019t believe I said that. Smug git.</p> <p>I phone Mum, tell her not to come, and burst out crying to Sharon.</p> <p>Then Ireland announces its lockdown. We decide it\u2019s time to cancel our party, whatever the UK government is or isn\u2019t doing. \u201cWe\u2019re so relieved,\u201d our friends say. \u201cWe would have come, but it would have been so strange not being able to kiss and hug, and dancing at a distance.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I am so relieved we cancelled our party; who wants a party hosted by a horseman of the apocalypse?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By the next day, 10 people in Britain have died and there are nearly 2,000 confirmed cases. Diane is determined to get me seen at A&amp;E before a lockdown. When we get there, it is scarily empty. A couple of minutes later, a doctor calls me into the cubicle.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are your symptoms?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPersistent cough and breathing difficulties.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s young and kindly looking, but sounds angry. \u201cWhy did you come here today?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was told to come back if there was no progress. It\u2019s got worse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut why today?\u201d</p> <p>Stay calm, I tell myself. I\u2019ve been on antibiotics for three weeks and I\u2019m still no better. If it\u2019s a virus, I want to know if it is <em>the</em> virus.</p> <p>He gets out his stethoscope and listens closely. I wheeze in and wheeze out.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound wheezy to me,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Jesus, they\u2019ve moved the goalposts on sickness. Last week the GP suggested it was pneumonia; today I\u2019m worse and the doctor\u2019s telling me I\u2019m fine.</p> <p>\u201cSo why today?\u201d he asks again.</p> <p>\u201cOh bollocks to this,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve not come here to be made to feel like a hypochondriac. I hate hospitals \u2013 this is the last place I want to be. Let\u2019s go.\u201d I get off the bed.</p> <p>My outburst shocks him into politeness, and upsets me. \u201cLook,\u201d I say, \u201cI know it\u2019s not your fault, you\u2019re just doing what you\u2019ve been told to. I\u2019m sorry. If we were allowed to hug, I\u2019d give you a great big hug.\u201d He looks terrified.</p> <p>But he\u2019s started to soften. \u201cI can hear something,\u201d he concedes. \u201cDo you smoke?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI used to, about 14 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve got COPD [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/breakthrough-science/2017/oct/23/the-life-changing-lung-disease-that-often-goes-undiagnosed\" title=\"\">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a>]. I\u2019ll write a report for your GP.\u201d</p> <p>But until a few weeks ago my lungs were fine, I say. I ran six miles, three or four times a week. </p> <p>\u201cYes, COPD,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Back home I discover Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, has just announced that 60% of the country \u2013 40-odd million people \u2013 need to catch the virus for us to build up herd immunity. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to beat coronavirus, Vallance suggests, adding that we don\u2019t want to \u201cswamp and overwhelm NHS services\u201d. Perhaps that\u2019s why Dr Angry had been so upset: I was swamping the empty hospital.</p> <p>Apparently, the NHS has also stopped testing for Covid-19, apart from the most serious cases in hospital. Anybody with a fever or \u201ccontinuous cough\u201d should simply stay at home.</p> <p>Two days after Vallance\u2019s announcement, the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matt-hancock\" title=\"\">Matt</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matt-hancock\" title=\"\"> Hancock</a>, tells us we all misunderstood; herd immunity was never part of the plan. This may have something to do with the outcry that followed \u2013 when everyone did the sums and realised the government was talking about the deaths of 500,000 British people.</p> <h2>14 March: the ambulance</h2> <p>My breathing is deteriorating. In bed at night, I sound like a cattle farm. Diane and my daughters tell me off for using the phone. I can barely get a sentence out without spluttering. I\u2019m dizzy and my head hurts. I\u2019ve also developed a dull, persistent ache in my leg \u2013 the kind you often get with a virus.</p> <p> On Saturday, the day before our non-party, my breathing takes a turn for the worse. I am so relieved we cancelled; who wants a party hosted by a horseman of the apocalypse? Diane says she\u2019ll phone for the ambulance. I tell her not to be daft. A few minutes later, she says gently, \u201cShould I call the ambulance now?\u201d Yes, I nod.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aa5f5fba1da537912e8a1ed3937bc6a6955c1f65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa5f5fba1da537912e8a1ed3937bc6a6955c1f65/0_663_5412_5255/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A thermometer glowing as if it is hot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"971\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The ambulance is here in five minutes. They arrive in space-age blue suits, heavy boots, masks and goggles. They\u2019re certainly not lacking in PPE. Just the sight of them seems to improve my breathing. There are three of them \u2013 warm, likable, funny. They test my oxygen levels and take my blood pressure.</p> <p>\u201cNothing much wrong with your breathing,\u201d says one of them. \u201cMy breathing is worse than yours.\u201d</p> <p>I can see neighbours across the road staring at the ambulance. The three paramedics say they are going to sit in it to write their report. They return and tell me I\u2019ve got Covid-19. I\u2019ll be fine.</p> <p>How d\u2019you know, I wheeze. I mean, on either front.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it seems like Covid-19. Covid-19 symptoms. Try not to call us again. I know it\u2019s tempting when you\u2019re struggling with breathing.\u201d The female paramedic shows me some deep breathing exercises, though I can barely shallow breathe. \u201cAs I say, try not to call again because we\u2019re very busy,\u201d she says to Diane. \u201cBut if his lips turn blue, ring 999.\u201d</p> <h2>15 March: no party, more tests</h2> <p>Giving away \u00a35,000 worth of food isn\u2019t as simple as you\u2019d think \u2013 not now, anyway. Eventually we find two takers: a drop-in for migrants and a homeless shelter. On Monday morning, our older daughter, Alix, delivers the food. She returns elated. Everybody was so happy to get it, she says, and suddenly it doesn\u2019t feel that the money was wasted. The party just took a different form. She brings back a few samples \u2013 mushroom flan, teriyaki salmon, cheesecake, lots of lovely salads.</p> <p>On 17 March the prime minister urges the British public to \u201cavoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues\u201d. Stanley Johnson, his 79-year-old father, is having none of it. \u201cCourse I\u2019ll go to the pub if I need to,\u201d <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KkFJcMnUNyg\" title=\"\">he tells Phil and Holly on This Morning</a>. The Johnson family are good value, they\u2019d make an entertaining reality TV show; I just wish they weren\u2019t in politics.</p> <p>By now, it\u2019s more or less impossible to see a doctor. The GP surgery is closed down; A&amp;E visits are a no-no. We are told to ring NHS 111 if we\u2019re worried, but we can\u2019t get through. Soon enough the government tells us we\u2019re better off going to <a href=\"https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/\" title=\"\">its Covid-19 website</a>, which tells us to self-isolate. It\u2019s a vicious circle of self-isolating helplessness.</p> <p>I tweet Boris Johnson. \u201cDear <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson\" title=\"\">@BorisJohnson</a>, I am sat at home struggling to breathe, as too many people are. You\u2019ve finally got the job you want, and within weeks you have created an NHS that tests for NOTHING &amp; leaves us all gasping for air, helpless in the greatest crisis of our lives. Act now. TEST US.\u201d No response.</p> <p>I decide to go private, for the first time in my life, only it\u2019s near impossible to get an appointment with a respiratory specialist; they\u2019re too busy saving lives for the NHS. Eventually, one agrees to a phone consultation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I tell the doctor we are Guardian journalists. He becomes animated, and tells us there is a desperate shortage of PPE</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dr Lung asks about my history, my symptoms, when the chest complaint developed. He tells me I need a lung scan, but there is a problem \u2013 the private hospital isn\u2019t allowing respiratory patients in. Don\u2019t worry, he says, we can see you on the NHS \u2013 get the tests done, the scan, the works. I\u2019m relieved, but it also makes me feel even worse. So this is how private medicine works in a pandemic: I\u2019m using a private referral to queue-jump, and not even paying for it. Morally queasy doesn\u2019t begin to cover it, but I am desperate. \u201cGo to the hospital and my colleague will see you,\u201d he says.</p> <p>There\u2019s something postapocalyptic about the hospital. Deadly silent. Security on the front door. They block our way in: why are we here? \u201cI\u2019ve got a persistent cough. Breathing problems. I\u2019ve been sent here by Dr Lung.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cOK, follow me.\u201d The man leads us to a side entrance usually reserved for ambulance arrivals. There is one other person here \u2013 a chatty woman with asthma who takes off her mask to eat her KFC when the staff aren\u2019t looking. There is a different kind of intensity to the hospital today; the bonhomie of my last visit has gone. Then, it felt the hospital was just preparing; now, it\u2019s the real thing.</p> <p>A red-haired doctor examines me. Halfway through, he apologises and says he has to rush to a meeting. Then he returns, listens to my chest, asks what I do. I tell him Diane and I are Guardian journalists. He becomes animated, and tells us there is a desperate shortage of PPE. Meanwhile, he says, they are short-staffed because so many people have had to take time off with symptoms, because they can\u2019t be tested. </p> <p>The only people who <em>do</em> seem to be getting tested are celebrities, footballers and politicians. Tell me about it, he says. I say that I want a test because, if it\u2019s not coronavirus, then I can start looking for other conditions \u2013 hopefully treatable ones. He says he\u2019s happy to admit me, but if he were me he\u2019d steer well clear. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have Covid-19 now, you probably will by the time you leave.\u201d I decide to go home without the test. They do the regular tests instead \u2013 blood oxygen, blood pressure, then one swab up a nostril and another in my mouth \u2013 and book me in for a lung scan in a few days. The doctor tells me he thinks I\u2019ve made the right decision and pats me on the arm affectionately. </p> <p>\u201cOi,\u201d I say: I thought we weren\u2019t supposed to be touching. He smiles. I hope he\u2019s going to be OK.</p> <h2>20 March: a new perspective</h2> <p>It\u2019s so quiet and peaceful in the night, give or take my wheezing. Everything starts to make sense. Of course it\u2019s terrible that all these people are dying, but the world is renewing itself. This always happens at some point, when things get out of control. Today the sky was a cloudless blue, there were hardly any cars on the road, the air felt pure and you could hear the birds making whoopee. The dawn chorus makes the silence even more profound. If this is the planet renewing itself, then we\u2019ve all got to do our bit.</p> <p>The world is beginning to feel unrecognisable. On 20 March the chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">Rishi Sunak</a>, announces that a rightwing Brexiteering government will pay 80% of a salary up to \u00a32,500 a month for those not working during the coronavirus crisis, if their companies agree to keep them on. Bankers are an irrelevance now. The key workers are the same doctors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-hunt\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt</a> was so critical of when he was health secretary; the same nurses for whom the Tories gleefully blocked a pay rise; the same supermarket workers whom the government contemptuously dismissed as unskilled.</p> <p>Every issue is illustrated in curves these days. There\u2019s the curve for those who don\u2019t know they have it; the curve for those who have a mild illness; and the curve for those who die. But what about the inbetweeny curve \u2013 for those who have been chronically ill for ages but are going to get better without ventilators and admission to the Covid-19 wards? The curve for those who happen to get a terrible chest condition while a pandemic is raging, but feel they don\u2019t have the right to complain because others are suffering far worse? The curve for those who go on to live long, fulfilled lives. I want to be on one of those.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"450d727d2a53a619f089e36decabaf129574ff4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/450d727d2a53a619f089e36decabaf129574ff4a/0_2191_5412_3247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A packet of tablets with three out\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Later, I head back to the hospital for my lung scan. The roads are clear and I walk into the empty hospital. There\u2019s one older man in a mask waiting for a scan. A computerised voice tells me to hold my breath while the scanner closes in.</p> <p>A couple of days later, I meet my urologist on the phone. I started seeing him for a urinary tract infection a few months ago, but I\u2019ve always had my doubts about him; I suspect he\u2019s keen to whip my prostate out before I\u2019m ready.</p> <p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, actually, I had another infection that turned into sepsis and I was hospitalised.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. Really?\u201d says Dr Piss. \u201cWell, perhaps it\u2019s time for the operation.\u201d He finds my notes and is quickly up to speed. He even has my chest X-ray. \u201cI see you\u2019ve got an area of pneumonia on the X-ray.\u201d</p> <p>No, I say, it was clear.</p> <p>No, he says, there\u2019s an area: not full-blown, but pneumonia.</p> <p>When was it taken, I ask.</p> <p>\u201cMid-February, in hospital,\u201d he says. This was a couple of days before my chest got bad. It must have already been on its way.</p> <h2>24 March: lockdown</h2> <p>The government finally orders all non-essential workers to stay at home in their \u201cprimary residence\u201d. I love the presumption that we have more than one. </p> <p>My right leg ache has extended into the left now. If I\u2019m lying in bed, it\u2019s agony, so I get up every few minutes \u2013 walk around, make myself some hot water as a treat. Jesus, what\u2019s become of me? All my life, I\u2019ve drunk coffee by the gallon, finishing off the day with a 1am cuppa. But less coffee means less urinary infections means less sepsis means less weird chest infections that may or may not be Covid-19 means more life.</p> <h2>27 March: Boris Johnson takes it on the chin</h2> <p>Two days after the start of lockdown, I stand by the front door in my purple dressing gown, giving NHS workers a good whoop. It\u2019s not good for my chest, but it\u2019s worth it. I start to well up, though anything makes me cry these days.</p> <p>A day later, it is announced that the prime minister has Covid-19. So he really is taking it on the chin, as he suggested we all do. NHS workers are becoming more vocal about the lack of testing. I tweet Johnson again, saying we need tests for all, and hoping he gets better. No reply, but I do get a surprise phone call.</p> <p>\u201cMr Hattenstone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou tested negative.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHold on,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve not been tested.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you were. Last week in hospital, and it\u2019s negative.\u201d I ask questions, but the woman on the other end apologises, says she\u2019s in a call centre and has no more information.</p> <p>My friends are getting ill. Everybody\u2019s friends are getting ill. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s the dreaded\u2026 ?\u201d we ask each other. Most of us think it is, but we can\u2019t say for definite. Only I have been tested \u2013 apparently. But should I believe that, when I was categorically told I hadn\u2019t been? We also know the test gives false negatives, though there is no data as to how often.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I hear a mosquito buzzing. It\u2019s my chest. I hear sheep baa-ing. It\u2019s my chest. I hear a motorcycle revving up.

Everybody\u2019s sending me lists of great box sets and movies to watch, but I can\u2019t focus. Weirdly, the one thing I can concentrate on is Hilary Mantel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/24/the-mirror-and-the-light-hilary-mantel-review\" title=\"\">The Mirror</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/24/the-mirror-and-the-light-hilary-mantel-review\" title=\"\">&amp; The Light</a>, longer than anything I\u2019ve ever read. It may be set 500 years ago, but so much resonates as Thomas Cromwell battles his own version of coronavirus: sweating sickness.</p> <p>I prop myself up in bed, pull my legs up, and try to sleep with my eyes open; I find it hard to shut my eyes while sitting up. In the silence I hear a mosquito buzzing. It\u2019s my chest. I hear sheep baa-ing. It\u2019s my chest. I hear a motorcycle revving up, loud and antisocial. It\u2019s my chest. Sod this for a game of soldiers.</p> <p>Dr Lung phones to say my scan is back. He says there doesn\u2019t seem much to worry about. There is inflammation on my lungs, and secretions, but no sign of active infection. He wants me to have another lung test in three months to make sure they\u2019ve not solidified into something nastier. I phone my cousin \u2013 a retired GP who looked after me brilliantly 47 years ago when I had encephalitis. \u201cInflammation \u2013 yep, that\u2019s good. A bit of pneumonia will leave you with that. Secretions \u2013 yep, you get them after an infection. They are a positive sign \u2013 that you\u2019re over the infection.\u201d</p> <h2>6 April: precautionary measures</h2> <p>Boris Johnson is in hospital. We are told it is just a precautionary measure; that he\u2019s having tests after 10 days of symptoms including a high fever. A day later he is moved into intensive care \u2013 again, a precautionary measure. </p> <p>\u201cDo you think he will die?\u201d Diane asks.</p> <p>\u201cNah,\u201d I say with a certainty I don\u2019t feel.</p> <p>The number of Covid-19 deaths is rising relentlessly. My mum phones to tell me one of her oldest friends, Lydia, has died from coronavirus. Ten bus drivers have died in London alone. The first three doctors to die in the UK are all BAME Muslims. There are so many heartbreaking stories: 28-year-old pregnant nurse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/pregnant-healthcare-workers-pressured-into-covid-19-frontline\" title=\"\">Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapon dies</a>, but they manage to save her baby. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/boy-13-die-london-after-testing-positive-for-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab</a>, a 13-year-old with no previous underlying conditions, dies without his family around him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9100336bdab34adaab3646f2a03bdd51649be072\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9100336bdab34adaab3646f2a03bdd51649be072/0_2177_5412_3247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A medicine spoon with red medicine in it\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>By now we\u2019ve passed 10,000 deaths with little fanfare or shock \u2013 just a hushed acceptance and numb inevitability. We are tracking France, we\u2019re told. But we\u2019re not: France includes deaths in care homes in its daily figures. Pound for pound, euro for euro, death for death, we are way ahead of France.</p> <p>On 12 April Johnson is released from hospital. The country breathes a collective sigh of relief \u2013 even those who say he\u2019s never knowingly told the truth in his life. He heads to Chequers to recuperate, while the rest of us remain in our primary residences. During this time of national crisis, the government has never seemed more determined to show there is one rule for some, another for others.</p> <p>It\u2019s not all misery. Far from it. Wonderful, uplifting things are happening. The Thursday night clap for carers is getting louder by the week. Ninety-nine-year-old war veteran <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/hes-just-a-wonderful-man-how-captain-tom-became-a-superstar-fundraiser\" title=\"\">Tom Moore</a> pledges to complete 100 laps of his garden in a bid to raise \u00a31,000. So far he has raised more than \u00a332m, clocked up his centenary and been awarded a knighthood. As we edge towards the end of April, the UK soars past 20,000 hospital deaths, and gets barely any nearer the promised 100,000 tests a day. Meanwhile the latest figures from the ONS, which incorporate Covid-19 deaths outside hospital, are horrifying: for the week to 10 April, the number of deaths is 41% higher than the official government figures.</p> <p>The aches come, the aches go, the aches return. As for the wheeze, I sound like an emphysemic canary. I phone the GP. Another locum, this time not so good. </p> <p>\u201cSo my chest is still bad. A lung scan shows inflammation and secretions, and I\u2019m worried about getting another urinary infection. I\u2019d like more antibiotics for my chest, just to see one last time if they make a difference.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUhum. I\u2019ll send the prescription to the chemist.\u201d</p> <p>Perfectly efficient, until it turns out I\u2019ve been prescribed an antibiotic that has not been in production for years.</p> <h2>May: songs of recovery</h2> <p>The weeks pass quickly. The government magically hits its testing target at the end of April, though it soon emerges that 100,000 tests a day is very different from 100,000 people tested in a day. By mid-May new figures will reveal that there have been more than 55,000 excess deaths (the number above the five-year average) during the pandemic \u2013 the highest total in Europe. Meanwhile, the number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths will top 36,000 \u2013 the second highest in the world.</p> <p>As for me, I\u2019m just trundling on. I\u2019m much better than I was at my worst, but I\u2019m not fully well. Symptoms disappear and occasionally new ones emerge. For the past few weeks I\u2019ve been dehydrated by night and rasping like Joe Pesci in Goodfellas by day. I feel embarrassed to tell people I\u2019m not fixed yet, so I say I\u2019m getting there.</p> <p>Our daughter Maya is autistic and a brilliant researcher. For weeks she\u2019s been nagging me to see a respiratory physiotherapist. She finds the number for one who lives nearby, rings it and puts the phone in my hand.</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t come round,\u201d I say. \u201cNobody does face to face these days. It\u2019s pointless.\u201d</p> <p>Leo, the physio, says he can pop round in an hour. Everybody gets a bit uptight. Can he be for real if he\u2019s willing to do a house visit \u2013 and in an hour?</p> <p>\u201cIf he\u2019s not wearing a mask, I don\u2019t want him to come in the house,\u201d Diane says. The others agree.</p> <p>Leo, a likable Antipodean, arrives in full PPE with a spare mask for me. He tells me my breathing sounds awful. I want to cry with gratitude. He gives me tips \u2013 breathe through a straw as if you\u2019re smoking, to open the airways; steam your head over a bowl of boiling water for five minutes, then huff (as if trying to steam up windows). But, most important, he clap-massages my back and chest to drain the lungs. Nothing comes up. He says that\u2019s probably because it\u2019s all solid, and will take ages to come up. He shows the family how to do the massage.</p> <p>None of the 10-plus doctors I have seen suggested respiratory physio. Perhaps that\u2019s the Covid-19 mindset: they either tell people to go away or treat them as if they are dying. </p> <p>A letter arrives from Dr Lung about the scan. \u201cThere was a 10mm pure ground glass opacity within left upper lobe and this is non-specific appearance.\u201d I Google it and discover a new academic paper on Covid-19. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that GGOs aren\u2019t specific to Covid-19 and can be seen in so many different settings\u2026 in terms of Covid-19\u2026 GGOs on a CT scan are indicative of Covid-19-related pneumonia, or lung inflammation caused by the viral infection.\u201d</p> <p>Since Leo\u2019s visit, I have been wearing a mask. Three days later, in the middle of a furious massage-beating by Jimmy, who lives with us and is like a son, the first bit of mucus pops into it. It is thick, gluey and green. Just one globule, but it\u2019s a start. I show Alix the drop of mucus with pride. \u201cBrilliant!\u201d she says supportively. \u201cUgh. I feel sick.\u201d</p> <p>I send Leo a photo of what looks like a tiny alien, an ET of the lungs. He says it\u2019s good that it\u2019s come up, but it\u2019s bad mucus; the lighter the better. \u201cIf the colour doesn\u2019t lighten, you need to see your chest specialist,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Even so, I feel triumphant. I\u2019m sitting on the front doorstep, writing, the crazy spring sun beating down, and I\u2019m thinking of my little green alien and singing myself songs of recovery: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjD3EVC1-zU\" title=\"\">The Only Way</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjD3EVC1-zU\" title=\"\">Is Up</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jun/05/how-we-made-d-ream-things-can-only-get-better-tony-blair-election-alistair-campbell-\" title=\"\">Things Can Only Get Better</a>. Songs for myself, the country, the world. I\u2019m going to beat this fucker, whatever it is. </p>",

      "bodyText": "14 February: extreme shivers, extreme sweats I\u2019m lying in bed, shivering like crazy. My partner, Diane, is asleep, and I burrow deep into her back. I\u2019m sweating like crazy, too. I\u2019m desperate for the loo, and I run there in my shivery sweats and sweaty shivers. It\u2019s only five minutes since I last went. When I sleep, the same obsessive moment plays again and again. It\u2019s to do with numbers. I need to get past number nine, but I can\u2019t. The dream lasts for hours. Finally, I force myself awake. Ten minutes have passed. I felt like this once before, when I had encephalitis as a kid. That lasted more than two years, but it\u2019s one particular night I\u2019m thinking of \u2013 the sweats and shivers, and the fear that I\u2019m not going to make it through till morning. After that, I used to check my pulse every time I woke up to see if I was alive. Last night Diane took me to the emergency GP. The GP was lovely, caring, cautious. But too cautious. Diane told her I\u2019d gone a bit loopy. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cOnly in my sleep. I\u2019m perfectly sane and lucid in the day.\u201d The doctor asked me what day it was, how many fingers she was holding up. Thursday, four fingers. She said to Diane that I may have sepsis. Perhaps I ought to go to hospital, even if only as a precaution. Sepsis can kill, she said. Sepsis my arse, I said to Diane on the way home. I\u2019ve got a urine infection and I just want to go back to bed. I\u2019m still shivering and sweating when Diane wakes up. She says we\u2019re going to the hospital. No, I say, I just want to sweat it out. I want to wrap the duvet around me and turn into a Simon burrito. \u201cWe\u2019re going to A&amp;E,\u201d Diane says. I tell her I don\u2019t want to go. \u201cWe\u2019re going,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re so unyielding!\u201d I shout. Diane and I rarely argue. She looks upset. I don\u2019t know where the word unyielding comes from; I\u2019ve certainly never said it to Diane before. A&amp;E is packed. Valentine\u2019s Day, but nothing romantic about it. I am expecting to wait for hours, but as soon as I see the triage nurse, they put me on a bed in a cubicle. Within minutes, they\u2019ve inserted a canula. They test my blood pressure, my oxygen level, temperature. None of it is quite normal, but my temperature is the biggest concern \u2013 over 39C. Ever since the misdiagnosis of my encephalitis (my doctor, who just happened to be my dad\u2019s best friend, told me I was a malingerer, and suggested that Mum had Munchausen syndrome by proxy), I have been terrified of being called a hypochondriac and done my best to stay away from hospital. \u201cWe\u2019re treating it as sepsis,\u201d the doctor says, more to Diane than me. \u201cIf it\u2019s not sepsis, he\u2019s on the road to sepsis. We\u2019re going to put him on IV antibiotics. It\u2019s the Domestos treatment \u2013 kills all bugs.\u201d I smile. It sounds good. And, best of all, I\u2019m being believed. This small ward (six beds) is where people come when they\u2019re admitted straight from A&amp;E. It isn\u2019t full. Ilias is in agony with sickle cell anaemia; he\u2019s on morphine to ease the pain, but it makes him horribly itchy. The man next to me is out for the count: heavy, middle-aged, he just collapsed the other day and was rushed in. Barry, the fella closest to the window, is having tests. He\u2019s had an unlucky couple of years during which he\u2019s been in and out of hospital \u2013 a terrible car crash, broken back, urinary infections, and now goodness knows what. There is a spoilt young lad who plays his films and music at top volume. The IV paracetamol brings my temperature right down. Then it whizzes back, to almost 40C. I sit on the edge of my bed hugging my coat. The number game starts again; I still can\u2019t get past nine. They put me back on the IV paracetamol. Again, it does the trick. It\u2019s early evening and Diane and my younger daughter, Maya, have to leave. This is my first night in hospital since I was 11, and I\u2019m weepy. I\u2019ve got my laptop and headphones, and I\u2019m playing the same song on a loop: the medley from the Beatles\u2019 Abbey Road \u2013 Golden Slumbers, Carry That Weight and The End. I feel as if I\u2019m grieving, but I don\u2019t know what for. Saturday, I\u2019m feeling stronger. There\u2019s a camaraderie on the ward. The nurses are beyond wonderful \u2013 endlessly patient with difficult patients, physically strong, kind. Likewise the ancillary staff who keep the place virtually spotless. Sure, there\u2019s a cockroach in the loo, but it\u2019s more pet than threat. I am given three lots of IV antibiotics a day for three days. The nurses wake me gently in the night to test my blood pressure and oxygen levels. I am sent for a chest X-ray. Within a couple of days, I\u2019m feeling human. My appetite is back. Even the food is good: lamb dhansak and chickpeas, jerk chicken with rice and peas, fish and chips with mushy peas. Everybody is talking about the terrible virus that appears to be decimating China. Three weeks ago, a whole city, Wuhan, was placed under quarantine. Unbelievable. Two weeks ago, the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency and named the disease Covid-19, short for \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d. Almost 1,400 people have died in China, and today France has announced the first Covid-19 death in Europe. Thankfully, there\u2019s nothing here yet, though we are being advised to wash our hands regularly for 20 seconds while singing God Save The Queen. Miraculously, three days of IV antibiotics and paracetamol get rid of my urinary tract infection and my temperature. The only thing is, I\u2019ve started to cough, badly. I\u2019ve been susceptible to chest infections since my encephalitis. Back then, I was rushed to hospital with a pneumonia that almost did for me, and ended up staying there for six weeks. My chest feels dreadful by Monday morning. The doctors so far have been lovely \u2013 all women, all good listeners. The doctor who discharges me is a young man, and not a good listener. He says he thinks I\u2019ll be fine to go home today, if that\u2019s OK. It feels like a rhetorical question. I don\u2019t want to say it isn\u2019t fine (who wants to stay in hospital, however good the food?) and I don\u2019t want to sound aggressive. So I tell him I think I have a chest infection, and would perhaps benefit from another chest X-ray. He doesn\u2019t seem to hear. A few minutes later I search him out and say I\u2019m worried, because I have a history of chest infections and pneumonia. He tells me the antibiotics will take care of that. I feel sad to say goodbye to Ilias and Barry, and sad because one infection seems to have been replaced by another. Sure, I\u2019m no longer crazy feverish, but nor would I say I was fixed. Still, they obviously need the beds. 20 February: \u2018That doesn\u2019t sound good\u2019 Yesterday the global death toll from Covid-19 passed 2,000. Meanwhile, my chest is getting rawer and sorer. I head to the GP where a locum really listens \u2013 to me and my chest. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound good at all,\u201d she says. \u201cCould be pneumonia. I think you should get back to the hospital for an X-ray.\u201d I see another young male doctor at A&amp;E. He asks me if I get asthma attacks. Occasionally, I say, but this doesn\u2019t feel anything like asthma. \u201cIt\u2019s asthma,\u201d he says. \u201cI think I need an X-ray.\u201d \u201cYou had an X-ray last week. It was clear and we don\u2019t want to irradiate you.\u201d But there was no reason it shouldn\u2019t have been clear; it didn\u2019t feel infected at that point. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put you on a nebuliser for 20 minutes,\u201d he says. Afterwards, he takes off my mask. \u201cAny better?\u201d he asks. \u201cNot really,\u201d I say. \u201cBut it does feel like I\u2019ve been on a mini break to the seaside.\u201d \u201cOK, we\u2019ll give you another 20 minutes.\u201d Dr Asthma asks if I use an inhaler. I tell him I sometimes use a blue Ventolin, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have any effect. \u201cDo you inhale straight from the Ventolin or have you got an AeroChamber?\u201d I look blank. \u201cAh well, that\u2019s it. They\u2019re useless without the chambers. I\u2019m going to give you one to take home.\u201d I\u2019m beginning to think he may be a salesman rather than a doctor. Then he gives me a packet of steroids, which puts my mind at rest. Eight tiny pills, a few times a day. They make no difference, except for making me feel sick when they stick in my throat. My breathing is getting worse. Early March: do we cancel our big party? Diane and I have been together for over 30 years, and in January we got \u201ccivilled\u201d; civil partnerships for mixed-sex relationships had just been introduced. We were only the fourth heterosexual couple to get one in the London borough of Haringey, and were a little bit proud of it. It was a great day \u2013 surprisingly romantic, fun, history-making (if you count fourth). Only immediate family were there, but we are planning a big party in two weeks \u2013 by far the biggest we\u2019ve ever hosted. We\u2019ve invited more than 200 people, and even if I\u2019m not on top form, it\u2019s only one evening. It will be great anyway. Meanwhile, the WHO has just raised the global risk of spread of Covid-19 from \u201chigh\u201d to \u201cvery high\u201d. \u201cThis is a reality check for every government on the planet. Wake up. Get ready,\u201d says Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO\u2019s health emergencies programme. Everybody has started talking about how vulnerable old people are, and the need for social distancing. I am slightly worried about my symptoms. We don\u2019t want to kill off our guests, after all. I phone the GP, hang on for the obligatory 20 minutes before reception passes me to a doctor. \u201cCan I check whether I was tested for coronavirus in hospital?\u201d I ask. They did so many tests, but I haven\u2019t a clue what for. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, and puts down the phone. The public are being advised to phone NHS 111 if they are worried they might have coronavirus. After half an hour I get through. If you have symptoms, you go through the process again. Eventually I get through to a helpful nurse. \u201cYes, those sound like Covid-19 symptoms,\u201d she says. \u201cWould you prefer to see your GP or the emergency GP at the hospital?\u201d \u201cEmergency GP at the hospital,\u201d I say, too enthusiastically. The hospital GP is charm personified. I tell her I\u2019m worried I may have Covid-19. \u201cHave you been abroad recently, to China or Italy?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cHave you been in contact with anybody who has had coronavirus?\u201d How on earth do I know, I think. She gets out her stethoscope: \u201cA little bit of wheeziness, maybe.\u201d She asks me to blow into a peak flow meter. I take a mighty breath and reach 450. \u201cWonderful! 500!\u201d she says. \u201cAbsolutely nothing to worry about.\u201d I ask if I can try again because I normally do better on a second go. It\u2019s 350. And the third time. She ignores those readings. \u201c500. Wonderful.\u201d \u201cDo you think it\u2019s safe to have our party? I\u2019ve heard about this social distancing.\u201d \u201cAbsolutely safe. I promise you, you do not have coronavirus, you\u2019re just getting better from what may have been a little chest infection.\u201d I go home relieved. When Diane returns, I tell her I definitely don\u2019t have Covid-19: it\u2019s game on for the party. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you thought you did have it,\u201d she says. On 3 March, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, boasts on telly about shaking hands with the Covid-19 patients he\u2019s just met. In fact, the PM seems to be getting more insouciant by the day. On 5 March he suggests that, rather than locking down the country, \u201cone of the theories is that perhaps you could take it on the chin, take it all in one go and allow the disease, as it were, to move through the population, without taking as many draconian measures\u201d. Apparently, this is known as herd immunity. 10 March: the empty clinic Nothing is shifting. I am breathless climbing the stairs. The asthma pump makes no difference. I ring the surgery and tell the doctor that I wasn\u2019t given an X-ray at hospital. \u201cOh, poor love,\u201d says Dr Niceynice. \u201cBless you. That\u2019s shocking. I\u2019m booking you in for one right this minute.\u201d Dr Niceynice is magnificent at phone empathy, less good at face-to-face appointments. She sends me to the smaller local hospital up the road. It\u2019s gloriously empty. A man in a mask ushers me to a waiting area, but before I have time to sit down I\u2019m whisked off for the X-ray. In and out. An hour after getting home, I get a call from Dr Niceynice. \u201cYour X-ray\u2019s clear,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s great, but\u2026\u201d Too late. Dr Niceynice has put the phone down. 12 March: a pandemic My wheezing sounds like feedback \u2013 a song My Bloody Valentine may have written in their heyday. Diane says she\u2019s worried. Yesterday the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic. Everybody seems to be talking about why Britain hasn\u2019t gone into lockdown; why is everything going on as normal? At night I can\u2019t sleep. \u201cWhat d\u2019you think it is?\u201d Diane says. \u201cMaybe a bit of pneumonia, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m getting better.\u201d We tell our guests we\u2019re going ahead with the party. Great, ping back the emails, we need something to celebrate. My sister, Sharon, and I argue for the first time ever. She doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s safe for Mum to come to the party and wants me to tell her not to. I say I\u2019m happy for her not to come, but I\u2019m not going to tell her not to. Mum, an incredibly youthful if shrunken 92-year-old, could stay alive by locking herself away and having a miserable existence, or she could take a few risks and thoroughly enjoy her final years, I say; it\u2019s the difference between living and existing. Ugh. I can\u2019t believe I said that. Smug git. I phone Mum, tell her not to come, and burst out crying to Sharon. Then Ireland announces its lockdown. We decide it\u2019s time to cancel our party, whatever the UK government is or isn\u2019t doing. \u201cWe\u2019re so relieved,\u201d our friends say. \u201cWe would have come, but it would have been so strange not being able to kiss and hug, and dancing at a distance.\u201d By the next day, 10 people in Britain have died and there are nearly 2,000 confirmed cases. Diane is determined to get me seen at A&amp;E before a lockdown. When we get there, it is scarily empty. A couple of minutes later, a doctor calls me into the cubicle. \u201cWhat are your symptoms?\u201d \u201cPersistent cough and breathing difficulties.\u201d He\u2019s young and kindly looking, but sounds angry. \u201cWhy did you come here today?\u201d \u201cI was told to come back if there was no progress. It\u2019s got worse.\u201d \u201cBut why today?\u201d Stay calm, I tell myself. I\u2019ve been on antibiotics for three weeks and I\u2019m still no better. If it\u2019s a virus, I want to know if it is the virus. He gets out his stethoscope and listens closely. I wheeze in and wheeze out. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound wheezy to me,\u201d he says. Jesus, they\u2019ve moved the goalposts on sickness. Last week the GP suggested it was pneumonia; today I\u2019m worse and the doctor\u2019s telling me I\u2019m fine. \u201cSo why today?\u201d he asks again. \u201cOh bollocks to this,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve not come here to be made to feel like a hypochondriac. I hate hospitals \u2013 this is the last place I want to be. Let\u2019s go.\u201d I get off the bed. My outburst shocks him into politeness, and upsets me. \u201cLook,\u201d I say, \u201cI know it\u2019s not your fault, you\u2019re just doing what you\u2019ve been told to. I\u2019m sorry. If we were allowed to hug, I\u2019d give you a great big hug.\u201d He looks terrified. But he\u2019s started to soften. \u201cI can hear something,\u201d he concedes. \u201cDo you smoke?\u201d \u201cI used to, about 14 years ago.\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019ve got COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]. I\u2019ll write a report for your GP.\u201d But until a few weeks ago my lungs were fine, I say. I ran six miles, three or four times a week. \u201cYes, COPD,\u201d he says. Back home I discover Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, has just announced that 60% of the country \u2013 40-odd million people \u2013 need to catch the virus for us to build up herd immunity. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to beat coronavirus, Vallance suggests, adding that we don\u2019t want to \u201cswamp and overwhelm NHS services\u201d. Perhaps that\u2019s why Dr Angry had been so upset: I was swamping the empty hospital. Apparently, the NHS has also stopped testing for Covid-19, apart from the most serious cases in hospital. Anybody with a fever or \u201ccontinuous cough\u201d should simply stay at home. Two days after Vallance\u2019s announcement, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, tells us we all misunderstood; herd immunity was never part of the plan. This may have something to do with the outcry that followed \u2013 when everyone did the sums and realised the government was talking about the deaths of 500,000 British people. 14 March: the ambulance My breathing is deteriorating. In bed at night, I sound like a cattle farm. Diane and my daughters tell me off for using the phone. I can barely get a sentence out without spluttering. I\u2019m dizzy and my head hurts. I\u2019ve also developed a dull, persistent ache in my leg \u2013 the kind you often get with a virus. On Saturday, the day before our non-party, my breathing takes a turn for the worse. I am so relieved we cancelled; who wants a party hosted by a horseman of the apocalypse? Diane says she\u2019ll phone for the ambulance. I tell her not to be daft. A few minutes later, she says gently, \u201cShould I call the ambulance now?\u201d Yes, I nod. The ambulance is here in five minutes. They arrive in space-age blue suits, heavy boots, masks and goggles. They\u2019re certainly not lacking in PPE. Just the sight of them seems to improve my breathing. There are three of them \u2013 warm, likable, funny. They test my oxygen levels and take my blood pressure. \u201cNothing much wrong with your breathing,\u201d says one of them. \u201cMy breathing is worse than yours.\u201d I can see neighbours across the road staring at the ambulance. The three paramedics say they are going to sit in it to write their report. They return and tell me I\u2019ve got Covid-19. I\u2019ll be fine. How d\u2019you know, I wheeze. I mean, on either front. \u201cWell, it seems like Covid-19. Covid-19 symptoms. Try not to call us again. I know it\u2019s tempting when you\u2019re struggling with breathing.\u201d The female paramedic shows me some deep breathing exercises, though I can barely shallow breathe. \u201cAs I say, try not to call again because we\u2019re very busy,\u201d she says to Diane. \u201cBut if his lips turn blue, ring 999.\u201d 15 March: no party, more tests Giving away \u00a35,000 worth of food isn\u2019t as simple as you\u2019d think \u2013 not now, anyway. Eventually we find two takers: a drop-in for migrants and a homeless shelter. On Monday morning, our older daughter, Alix, delivers the food. She returns elated. Everybody was so happy to get it, she says, and suddenly it doesn\u2019t feel that the money was wasted. The party just took a different form. She brings back a few samples \u2013 mushroom flan, teriyaki salmon, cheesecake, lots of lovely salads. On 17 March the prime minister urges the British public to \u201cavoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues\u201d. Stanley Johnson, his 79-year-old father, is having none of it. \u201cCourse I\u2019ll go to the pub if I need to,\u201d he tells Phil and Holly on This Morning. The Johnson family are good value, they\u2019d make an entertaining reality TV show; I just wish they weren\u2019t in politics. By now, it\u2019s more or less impossible to see a doctor. The GP surgery is closed down; A&amp;E visits are a no-no. We are told to ring NHS 111 if we\u2019re worried, but we can\u2019t get through. Soon enough the government tells us we\u2019re better off going to its Covid-19 website, which tells us to self-isolate. It\u2019s a vicious circle of self-isolating helplessness. I tweet Boris Johnson. \u201cDear @BorisJohnson, I am sat at home struggling to breathe, as too many people are. You\u2019ve finally got the job you want, and within weeks you have created an NHS that tests for NOTHING &amp; leaves us all gasping for air, helpless in the greatest crisis of our lives. Act now. TEST US.\u201d No response. I decide to go private, for the first time in my life, only it\u2019s near impossible to get an appointment with a respiratory specialist; they\u2019re too busy saving lives for the NHS. Eventually, one agrees to a phone consultation. Dr Lung asks about my history, my symptoms, when the chest complaint developed. He tells me I need a lung scan, but there is a problem \u2013 the private hospital isn\u2019t allowing respiratory patients in. Don\u2019t worry, he says, we can see you on the NHS \u2013 get the tests done, the scan, the works. I\u2019m relieved, but it also makes me feel even worse. So this is how private medicine works in a pandemic: I\u2019m using a private referral to queue-jump, and not even paying for it. Morally queasy doesn\u2019t begin to cover it, but I am desperate. \u201cGo to the hospital and my colleague will see you,\u201d he says. There\u2019s something postapocalyptic about the hospital. Deadly silent. Security on the front door. They block our way in: why are we here? \u201cI\u2019ve got a persistent cough. Breathing problems. I\u2019ve been sent here by Dr Lung.\u201d \u201cOK, follow me.\u201d The man leads us to a side entrance usually reserved for ambulance arrivals. There is one other person here \u2013 a chatty woman with asthma who takes off her mask to eat her KFC when the staff aren\u2019t looking. There is a different kind of intensity to the hospital today; the bonhomie of my last visit has gone. Then, it felt the hospital was just preparing; now, it\u2019s the real thing. A red-haired doctor examines me. Halfway through, he apologises and says he has to rush to a meeting. Then he returns, listens to my chest, asks what I do. I tell him Diane and I are Guardian journalists. He becomes animated, and tells us there is a desperate shortage of PPE. Meanwhile, he says, they are short-staffed because so many people have had to take time off with symptoms, because they can\u2019t be tested. The only people who do seem to be getting tested are celebrities, footballers and politicians. Tell me about it, he says. I say that I want a test because, if it\u2019s not coronavirus, then I can start looking for other conditions \u2013 hopefully treatable ones. He says he\u2019s happy to admit me, but if he were me he\u2019d steer well clear. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have Covid-19 now, you probably will by the time you leave.\u201d I decide to go home without the test. They do the regular tests instead \u2013 blood oxygen, blood pressure, then one swab up a nostril and another in my mouth \u2013 and book me in for a lung scan in a few days. The doctor tells me he thinks I\u2019ve made the right decision and pats me on the arm affectionately. \u201cOi,\u201d I say: I thought we weren\u2019t supposed to be touching. He smiles. I hope he\u2019s going to be OK. 20 March: a new perspective It\u2019s so quiet and peaceful in the night, give or take my wheezing. Everything starts to make sense. Of course it\u2019s terrible that all these people are dying, but the world is renewing itself. This always happens at some point, when things get out of control. Today the sky was a cloudless blue, there were hardly any cars on the road, the air felt pure and you could hear the birds making whoopee. The dawn chorus makes the silence even more profound. If this is the planet renewing itself, then we\u2019ve all got to do our bit. The world is beginning to feel unrecognisable. On 20 March the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announces that a rightwing Brexiteering government will pay 80% of a salary up to \u00a32,500 a month for those not working during the coronavirus crisis, if their companies agree to keep them on. Bankers are an irrelevance now. The key workers are the same doctors Jeremy Hunt was so critical of when he was health secretary; the same nurses for whom the Tories gleefully blocked a pay rise; the same supermarket workers whom the government contemptuously dismissed as unskilled. Every issue is illustrated in curves these days. There\u2019s the curve for those who don\u2019t know they have it; the curve for those who have a mild illness; and the curve for those who die. But what about the inbetweeny curve \u2013 for those who have been chronically ill for ages but are going to get better without ventilators and admission to the Covid-19 wards? The curve for those who happen to get a terrible chest condition while a pandemic is raging, but feel they don\u2019t have the right to complain because others are suffering far worse? The curve for those who go on to live long, fulfilled lives. I want to be on one of those. Later, I head back to the hospital for my lung scan. The roads are clear and I walk into the empty hospital. There\u2019s one older man in a mask waiting for a scan. A computerised voice tells me to hold my breath while the scanner closes in. A couple of days later, I meet my urologist on the phone. I started seeing him for a urinary tract infection a few months ago, but I\u2019ve always had my doubts about him; I suspect he\u2019s keen to whip my prostate out before I\u2019m ready. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d \u201cWell, actually, I had another infection that turned into sepsis and I was hospitalised.\u201d \u201cOh. Really?\u201d says Dr Piss. \u201cWell, perhaps it\u2019s time for the operation.\u201d He finds my notes and is quickly up to speed. He even has my chest X-ray. \u201cI see you\u2019ve got an area of pneumonia on the X-ray.\u201d No, I say, it was clear. No, he says, there\u2019s an area: not full-blown, but pneumonia. When was it taken, I ask. \u201cMid-February, in hospital,\u201d he says. This was a couple of days before my chest got bad. It must have already been on its way. 24 March: lockdown The government finally orders all non-essential workers to stay at home in their \u201cprimary residence\u201d. I love the presumption that we have more than one. My right leg ache has extended into the left now. If I\u2019m lying in bed, it\u2019s agony, so I get up every few minutes \u2013 walk around, make myself some hot water as a treat. Jesus, what\u2019s become of me? All my life, I\u2019ve drunk coffee by the gallon, finishing off the day with a 1am cuppa. But less coffee means less urinary infections means less sepsis means less weird chest infections that may or may not be Covid-19 means more life. 27 March: Boris Johnson takes it on the chin Two days after the start of lockdown, I stand by the front door in my purple dressing gown, giving NHS workers a good whoop. It\u2019s not good for my chest, but it\u2019s worth it. I start to well up, though anything makes me cry these days. A day later, it is announced that the prime minister has Covid-19. So he really is taking it on the chin, as he suggested we all do. NHS workers are becoming more vocal about the lack of testing. I tweet Johnson again, saying we need tests for all, and hoping he gets better. No reply, but I do get a surprise phone call. \u201cMr Hattenstone?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cYou tested negative.\u201d \u201cHold on,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve not been tested.\u201d \u201cYes, you were. Last week in hospital, and it\u2019s negative.\u201d I ask questions, but the woman on the other end apologises, says she\u2019s in a call centre and has no more information. My friends are getting ill. Everybody\u2019s friends are getting ill. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s the dreaded\u2026 ?\u201d we ask each other. Most of us think it is, but we can\u2019t say for definite. Only I have been tested \u2013 apparently. But should I believe that, when I was categorically told I hadn\u2019t been? We also know the test gives false negatives, though there is no data as to how often. My legs are aching so much, I can hardly bear to sit down. Everybody\u2019s sending me lists of great box sets and movies to watch, but I can\u2019t focus. Weirdly, the one thing I can concentrate on is Hilary Mantel\u2019s The Mirror &amp; The Light, longer than anything I\u2019ve ever read. It may be set 500 years ago, but so much resonates as Thomas Cromwell battles his own version of coronavirus: sweating sickness. I prop myself up in bed, pull my legs up, and try to sleep with my eyes open; I find it hard to shut my eyes while sitting up. In the silence I hear a mosquito buzzing. It\u2019s my chest. I hear sheep baa-ing. It\u2019s my chest. I hear a motorcycle revving up, loud and antisocial. It\u2019s my chest. Sod this for a game of soldiers. Dr Lung phones to say my scan is back. He says there doesn\u2019t seem much to worry about. There is inflammation on my lungs, and secretions, but no sign of active infection. He wants me to have another lung test in three months to make sure they\u2019ve not solidified into something nastier. I phone my cousin \u2013 a retired GP who looked after me brilliantly 47 years ago when I had encephalitis. \u201cInflammation \u2013 yep, that\u2019s good. A bit of pneumonia will leave you with that. Secretions \u2013 yep, you get them after an infection. They are a positive sign \u2013 that you\u2019re over the infection.\u201d 6 April: precautionary measures Boris Johnson is in hospital. We are told it is just a precautionary measure; that he\u2019s having tests after 10 days of symptoms including a high fever. A day later he is moved into intensive care \u2013 again, a precautionary measure. \u201cDo you think he will die?\u201d Diane asks. \u201cNah,\u201d I say with a certainty I don\u2019t feel. The number of Covid-19 deaths is rising relentlessly. My mum phones to tell me one of her oldest friends, Lydia, has died from coronavirus. Ten bus drivers have died in London alone. The first three doctors to die in the UK are all BAME Muslims. There are so many heartbreaking stories: 28-year-old pregnant nurse Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapon dies, but they manage to save her baby. Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, a 13-year-old with no previous underlying conditions, dies without his family around him. By now we\u2019ve passed 10,000 deaths with little fanfare or shock \u2013 just a hushed acceptance and numb inevitability. We are tracking France, we\u2019re told. But we\u2019re not: France includes deaths in care homes in its daily figures. Pound for pound, euro for euro, death for death, we are way ahead of France. On 12 April Johnson is released from hospital. The country breathes a collective sigh of relief \u2013 even those who say he\u2019s never knowingly told the truth in his life. He heads to Chequers to recuperate, while the rest of us remain in our primary residences. During this time of national crisis, the government has never seemed more determined to show there is one rule for some, another for others. It\u2019s not all misery. Far from it. Wonderful, uplifting things are happening. The Thursday night clap for carers is getting louder by the week. Ninety-nine-year-old war veteran Tom Moore pledges to complete 100 laps of his garden in a bid to raise \u00a31,000. So far he has raised more than \u00a332m, clocked up his centenary and been awarded a knighthood. As we edge towards the end of April, the UK soars past 20,000 hospital deaths, and gets barely any nearer the promised 100,000 tests a day. Meanwhile the latest figures from the ONS, which incorporate Covid-19 deaths outside hospital, are horrifying: for the week to 10 April, the number of deaths is 41% higher than the official government figures. The aches come, the aches go, the aches return. As for the wheeze, I sound like an emphysemic canary. I phone the GP. Another locum, this time not so good. \u201cSo my chest is still bad. A lung scan shows inflammation and secretions, and I\u2019m worried about getting another urinary infection. I\u2019d like more antibiotics for my chest, just to see one last time if they make a difference.\u201d \u201cUhum. I\u2019ll send the prescription to the chemist.\u201d Perfectly efficient, until it turns out I\u2019ve been prescribed an antibiotic that has not been in production for years. May: songs of recovery The weeks pass quickly. The government magically hits its testing target at the end of April, though it soon emerges that 100,000 tests a day is very different from 100,000 people tested in a day. By mid-May new figures will reveal that there have been more than 55,000 excess deaths (the number above the five-year average) during the pandemic \u2013 the highest total in Europe. Meanwhile, the number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths will top 36,000 \u2013 the second highest in the world. As for me, I\u2019m just trundling on. I\u2019m much better than I was at my worst, but I\u2019m not fully well. Symptoms disappear and occasionally new ones emerge. For the past few weeks I\u2019ve been dehydrated by night and rasping like Joe Pesci in Goodfellas by day. I feel embarrassed to tell people I\u2019m not fixed yet, so I say I\u2019m getting there. Our daughter Maya is autistic and a brilliant researcher. For weeks she\u2019s been nagging me to see a respiratory physiotherapist. She finds the number for one who lives nearby, rings it and puts the phone in my hand. \u201cHe won\u2019t come round,\u201d I say. \u201cNobody does face to face these days. It\u2019s pointless.\u201d Leo, the physio, says he can pop round in an hour. Everybody gets a bit uptight. Can he be for real if he\u2019s willing to do a house visit \u2013 and in an hour? \u201cIf he\u2019s not wearing a mask, I don\u2019t want him to come in the house,\u201d Diane says. The others agree. Leo, a likable Antipodean, arrives in full PPE with a spare mask for me. He tells me my breathing sounds awful. I want to cry with gratitude. He gives me tips \u2013 breathe through a straw as if you\u2019re smoking, to open the airways; steam your head over a bowl of boiling water for five minutes, then huff (as if trying to steam up windows). But, most important, he clap-massages my back and chest to drain the lungs. Nothing comes up. He says that\u2019s probably because it\u2019s all solid, and will take ages to come up. He shows the family how to do the massage. None of the 10-plus doctors I have seen suggested respiratory physio. Perhaps that\u2019s the Covid-19 mindset: they either tell people to go away or treat them as if they are dying. A letter arrives from Dr Lung about the scan. \u201cThere was a 10mm pure ground glass opacity within left upper lobe and this is non-specific appearance.\u201d I Google it and discover a new academic paper on Covid-19. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that GGOs aren\u2019t specific to Covid-19 and can be seen in so many different settings\u2026 in terms of Covid-19\u2026 GGOs on a CT scan are indicative of Covid-19-related pneumonia, or lung inflammation caused by the viral infection.\u201d Since Leo\u2019s visit, I have been wearing a mask. Three days later, in the middle of a furious massage-beating by Jimmy, who lives with us and is like a son, the first bit of mucus pops into it. It is thick, gluey and green. Just one globule, but it\u2019s a start. I show Alix the drop of mucus with pride. \u201cBrilliant!\u201d she says supportively. \u201cUgh. I feel sick.\u201d I send Leo a photo of what looks like a tiny alien, an ET of the lungs. He says it\u2019s good that it\u2019s come up, but it\u2019s bad mucus; the lighter the better. \u201cIf the colour doesn\u2019t lighten, you need to see your chest specialist,\u201d he says. Even so, I feel triumphant. I\u2019m sitting on the front doorstep, writing, the crazy spring sun beating down, and I\u2019m thinking of my little green alien and singing myself songs of recovery: The Only Way Is Up, Things Can Only Get Better. Songs for myself, the country, the world. I\u2019m going to beat this fucker, whatever it is.",

      "bodyText": "The Sydney \u201cStop All Black Deaths in Custody\u201d rally has been declared an authorised public assembly after a late decision by the court of appeal as tens of thousands of protesters rallied in cities and towns across Australia to march against Indigenous deaths in custody and the killing of unarmed US man George Floyd. The decision came minutes before the rally\u2019s scheduled start at 3pm outside Town Hall on Saturday. Thousands of people marched along the route from Town Hall to Belmore Park, clapping and yelling \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2013 the latter among Floyd\u2019s final words \u2013 before being led in chants of \u201cWhose lives matter? Black lives matter\u201d. Town Hall railway station was closed and there was a large police presence in the city monitoring the rally. Several protesters climbed on top of a glass entrance to Town Hall station before police asked them to get down. Organisers of Sydney\u2019s Black Lives Matter protest had lodged a last-ditch appeal after the New South Wales supreme court ruled their Saturday demonstration would be unlawful under Covid-19 restrictions. Protesters had vowed to push ahead with the Sydney rally in defiance of the court ruling, with thousands having gathered outside Town Hall by 2.30pm, half an hour before the protest was due to begin. The Greens MP David Shoebridge confirmed only a few hours before the rally was due to begin that organisers would file an urgent appeal. \u201cThe organisers have received strong advice from lawyers across the legal community that the decision has significant flaws that amount to jurisdictional error,\u201d he said. \u201cTaking the legal jargon away, the case will be that the judge got it wrong. That rally is in fact authorised and was agreed to by police.\u201d At Melbourne\u2019s protest on Saturday afternoon, there was a strong police presence with a helicopter overhead and police lining parliament\u2019s steps on foot and horseback. Thousands of protesters held up banners with slogans such as \u201cwe all bleed the same colour\u201d, \u201cinjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere\u201d and \u201ctolerating racism is racism\u201d. Protesters wore face masks and organisers offered hand sanitiser, after authorities urged people to avoid the mass gathering because of Covid-19 fears. Wurundjeri leaders led protesters in mourning for Aboriginal lives lost in police custody at the demonstration. In Brisbane, crowds spilled from King George Square to neighbouring blocks, with people packing stairwells and balconies, brandishing signs calling for reform in Queensland and across the globe. Speakers, including elders and traditional owners, detailed police brutality against members of their own families. \u201cWe rise together and we speak in one voice against racism ... and legislation that takes away our freedom in this country ... our right to have a voice, our right to be free,\u201d the Wangan and Jagalingou man Adrian Burragubba said. At Adelaide\u2019s protest, many of those attending wore masks and made some effort to socially distance, though large groups appeared to be in close contact. The rally and march through the city was watched by a large police presence after the commissioner, Grant Stevens, gave it his blessing on Friday. The hardest line was taken in NSW, where the supreme court attempted to ban the rally. The late-night sitting on Friday came only after NSW police applied to the court for order to make the protest unlawful. The NSW police minister, David Elliott, seized on the development on Saturday morning, arguing people must \u201cacknowledge and recognise the supreme court ruling\u201d. \u201cPolice are prepared for anyone who just wants to flout the law,\u201d Elliott said. Asked if police had capacity to arrest 5,000 people, he declined to comment on \u201cpolice operational procedures\u201d. Politicians and health officials have argued the protests risk a \u201csecond wave\u201d of coronavirus cases, which could harm the Indigenous community, but protesters were resolute in their desire to push ahead with the events. The marches came as reports emerged from WA that a 40-year-old Aboriginal man had died after collapsing at the privately run Acacia prison. A WA Department of Justice statement said the man was found on Friday but could not be revived. He was pronounced dead in hospital. Police said the death did not appear to be suspicious, although they would investigate and an inquest and internal department review would be held. The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service said early on Saturday that people could not be \u201csilent while police violence is unchecked and continues to kill our people\u201d. The Natsils co-chair, Nerita Waight, called on police not to issue fines to protesters on Saturday. \u201cUpholding freedom of expression and assembly at times like this is critical and we encourage governments to ensure that people attending the peaceful protests are doing so in the safest way possible,\u201d she said. \u201cWe strongly encourage governments to use methods that do not result in the further criminalisation of, or violence to, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people \u2013 including fines.\u201d Organisers of the demonstrations had said protesters should wear face masks, adhere to social distancing where possible and stay home if they are sick. Police in NSW pledged to issue fines to protesters, while in Victoria the protest organisers have been threatened with $1,600 fines and the force did not rule out penalties for individuals. The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, late on Friday said police would have a \u201cstrong presence\u201d at the rally \u201cto ensure the law is obeyed\u201d. \u201cIf people choose to disobey the supreme court ruling and attend the planned protest regardless, they need to be aware they are doing so unlawfully and police will respond accordingly,\u201d he said in a statement. Leetona Dungay, whose son David died in Long Bay jail after shouting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d while being restrained, said she would march in Sydney regardless of court approval. \u201cI\u2019m marching for my son and nothing is stopping me,\u201d she said before the court\u2019s decision on Friday. \u201cIf we don\u2019t march tomorrow that means they\u2019ll keep killing people.\u201d On Saturday, Guardian Australia released an update to its groundbreaking Deaths Inside project, confirming there have now been at least 434 Aboriginal deaths in custody since a royal commission into the issue in 1991. The rally in central Melbourne was expected to begin with a Welcome To Country by the Wurundjeri senior elder Aunty Diane Kerr and a chant led by the Wurundjeri woman Mandy Nicholson. Nicholson called on protesters to paint white ochre across their forehead in keeping with an Indigenous sign of mourning. Non-Indigenous protesters were encouraged to have an Indigenous person paint it for them. Protesters also gathered in smaller Australian towns, including Wagga Wagga in NSW and Cairns in Queensland.",

In January, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jan/18/monzo-account-freeze-app-fraud\" title=\"\">we reported on how the company was freezing and shutting accounts</a> for no apparent reason \u2013 but the problem appears to have grown.</p> <p>Monzo, which uses automated systems to track its 4.3 million customers\u2019 transactions, says it has a legal obligation to investigate suspicious activity and has \u201creturned millions of pounds to victims of fraud in this way\u201d.</p> <p>However, it appears innocent customers have been caught out in recent weeks.</p> <p>Some customers caught by the policy have claimed the only unusual activity on their accounts were desperately needed Covid payments sent to the self-employed by HMRC, or universal credit claims.</p> <p>Guardian reader Jack Smith had his Monzo account frozen four weeks ago \u2013 it contained all of his savings and furloughed wages. He and his wife, who have been forced to use a credit card to buy food and other essentials, are furious.</p> <p>\u201cLiterally nothing has changed on my account, which was frozen out of the blue, without any warning or explanation. The whole thing has been a nightmare as it is impossible to find out any information from the company,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cMonzo appears to think that is perfectly OK to just shut an account down for weeks at a time when people desperately need access to their accounts.\u201d Smith adds: \u201cThey refused to say when it would be unfrozen or why it had happened. Regulators really need to look into the way the bank has behaved.\u201d</p> <p>Almost 3,500 people have joined a private Facebook group titled \u201cMonzo stole our money\u201d. Some customers posting on it report having up to \u00a330,000 stuck in frozen business accounts and say they are unable to pay suppliers.</p> <p>Many have shared messages from Monzo telling them their account has been frozen or shut; there are some desperate tales.</p> <p>\u201cYesterday Monzo froze my account with all my son\u2019s money in there for child benefit and all the remaining money I had left to last me a month before payday again,\u201d wrote one poster. \u201cI feel like I am at the lowest point of my life and I can\u2019t see this ending. How am I meant to tell a three-year-old child I can\u2019t get shopping in the house because the bank has taken the money?\u201d</p> <p>Others report that they have been waiting six weeks or longer for balances in closed accounts to be returned. The lack of information and the use of robots in online correspondence appears to be a huge source of frustration.</p> <p>On<a href=\"https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.monzo.com?page=2&amp;stars=1\" title=\"\"> reviews website Trustpilot</a>, where someone has posted a report of a frozen or closed account almost every day in recent weeks, one customer who has been self-isolating describes having his account frozen seemingly because they were sent money by a relative to keep the family going.</p> <p>Monzo did not comment on how many accounts it has frozen or closed since the start of the crisis.</p> <p>However, Resolver, the independent online complaints resolution service, told Guardian Money it had seen a 153% increase in complaints about the company in May compared with April\u2019s figure \u2013 with at least a third explicitly<em> </em>about account freezing or closure.</p> <p>Monzo, which has boasted in the past about the superiority of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jul/07/heres-how-scammers-get-away-with-it\" title=\"\">its anti-fraud technology</a>, told Guardian Money in January that when it investigates its frozen accounts, it finds it made the correct decision in 95% of cases.</p> <p>Asked about the current wave of complaints, a Monzo spokesman says supporting customers \u201cis always our top priority\u201d. He says: \u201cWe already have a number of ways to help those who find themselves in financial difficulty as a result of coronavirus.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We will apologise to any legitimate customers who\u2019ve been left out of pocket for a period of time</p> <footer> <cite>Monzo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen we see suspicious activity we have a legal obligation to investigate it thoroughly and have returned millions of pounds to victims of fraud in this way. We have a set of automated rules that flag any activity that might be suspicious and sometimes block the account. We aim to have a person review the account within 10 minutes.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of customers of the online bank Monzo say they were left without access to money at the height of the Covid-19 lockdown after the company froze their accounts without warning. Despite the Financial Conduct Authority telling banks it expected them to help consumers get through the crisis, Monzo has been freezing accounts without notice. In a message seen by Guardian Money, it told a customer that it has the right to close accounts and that it could not provide any further information on its decision. It is not the first time the UK\u2019s fastest growing bank has been criticised for this. In January, we reported on how the company was freezing and shutting accounts for no apparent reason \u2013 but the problem appears to have grown. Monzo, which uses automated systems to track its 4.3 million customers\u2019 transactions, says it has a legal obligation to investigate suspicious activity and has \u201creturned millions of pounds to victims of fraud in this way\u201d. However, it appears innocent customers have been caught out in recent weeks. Some customers caught by the policy have claimed the only unusual activity on their accounts were desperately needed Covid payments sent to the self-employed by HMRC, or universal credit claims. Guardian reader Jack Smith had his Monzo account frozen four weeks ago \u2013 it contained all of his savings and furloughed wages. He and his wife, who have been forced to use a credit card to buy food and other essentials, are furious. \u201cLiterally nothing has changed on my account, which was frozen out of the blue, without any warning or explanation. The whole thing has been a nightmare as it is impossible to find out any information from the company,\u201d he says. \u201cMonzo appears to think that is perfectly OK to just shut an account down for weeks at a time when people desperately need access to their accounts.\u201d Smith adds: \u201cThey refused to say when it would be unfrozen or why it had happened. Regulators really need to look into the way the bank has behaved.\u201d Almost 3,500 people have joined a private Facebook group titled \u201cMonzo stole our money\u201d. Some customers posting on it report having up to \u00a330,000 stuck in frozen business accounts and say they are unable to pay suppliers. Many have shared messages from Monzo telling them their account has been frozen or shut; there are some desperate tales. \u201cYesterday Monzo froze my account with all my son\u2019s money in there for child benefit and all the remaining money I had left to last me a month before payday again,\u201d wrote one poster. \u201cI feel like I am at the lowest point of my life and I can\u2019t see this ending. How am I meant to tell a three-year-old child I can\u2019t get shopping in the house because the bank has taken the money?\u201d Others report that they have been waiting six weeks or longer for balances in closed accounts to be returned. The lack of information and the use of robots in online correspondence appears to be a huge source of frustration. On reviews website Trustpilot, where someone has posted a report of a frozen or closed account almost every day in recent weeks, one customer who has been self-isolating describes having his account frozen seemingly because they were sent money by a relative to keep the family going. Monzo did not comment on how many accounts it has frozen or closed since the start of the crisis. However, Resolver, the independent online complaints resolution service, told Guardian Money it had seen a 153% increase in complaints about the company in May compared with April\u2019s figure \u2013 with at least a third explicitly about account freezing or closure. Monzo, which has boasted in the past about the superiority of its anti-fraud technology, told Guardian Money in January that when it investigates its frozen accounts, it finds it made the correct decision in 95% of cases. Asked about the current wave of complaints, a Monzo spokesman says supporting customers \u201cis always our top priority\u201d. He says: \u201cWe already have a number of ways to help those who find themselves in financial difficulty as a result of coronavirus. \u201cWhen we see suspicious activity we have a legal obligation to investigate it thoroughly and have returned millions of pounds to victims of fraud in this way. We have a set of automated rules that flag any activity that might be suspicious and sometimes block the account. We aim to have a person review the account within 10 minutes. If we discover that it\u2019s not suspicious, we immediately reactivate the account.\u201d The bank reviewed Jack Smith\u2019s case at Guardian Money\u2019s request. It says: \u201cWe hold ourselves to the highest standards and unfortunately in this particular case we fell short. We\u2019ve unbanned this account and have apologised to the customer. We won\u2019t always get this right and will apologise to any legitimate customers who\u2019ve been left out of pocket for a period of time.\u201d Martyn James of Resolver says: \u201cFreezing an account takes barely a second but has a devastating impact on the people affected. \u201cTime and time again, not having enough human beings to apply some common sense when \u2018the computer says no\u2019 is a recipe for disaster. Technology advances can be a great thing but only alongside effective customer service.\u201d What are the rules for closing accounts? Banks are only allowed to close accounts without giving notice if they have good reasons to suspect fraud \u2013 and even in that case they still have to treat customers fairly. The Financial Ombudsman Service says that when a bank intends to close a personal account it should usually give the customer at least 30 days\u2019 notice \u2013 ideally two months for a business account \u2013 to make other arrangements, unless the bank has a good reason to suspect fraud. Prior to March, the ombudsman service used to receive about 60 complaints a week from customers saying their account had been closed unreasonably \u2013 although this looks set to rise given that many of the banks have been \u201cderisking\u201d their account portfolios. The ombudsman says most of the complaints it sees about account closures or freezes involve the bank not giving enough notice, giving conflicting information or advice, or showing unlawful discrimination. Lots of people whose accounts were frozen or closed by Monzo have served the bank with a subject access request to allow them to see the file held by the bank in a bid to get to the bottom of the decision. When a request is filed with a company, it has a month to respond and provide details of what information it holds on you and how it has handled it. If you are unhappy with how your bank has treated you, you should complain to it first. The ombudsman is your next port of call if you are not satisfied with the bank\u2019s response. Those who have had an account closed by a bank following a suspected fraud often find it difficult to open a new one elsewhere. Opt for a basic account that offers a debit card and the ability to pay direct debits. These accounts are designed for those who have got into financial difficulties, in that there is no overdraft facility. Users can only spend what they have in their account. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 June 2020. An earlier version stated incorrectly that Monzo had 3.2 million customers.",

But ocean experts caution that the rollback to the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine national monument will hurt the environment and won\u2019t help fishermen who are struggling during the Covid-19 pandemic and economic downturn to find buyers for what they already catch. \u201cThis rollback essentially sells off the future of the ocean and the future of the ecosystem for almost no present economic benefit,\u201d said Miriam Goldstein, the ocean policy director at the Center for American Progress (Cap). \u201c[That\u2019s] why it\u2019s so puzzling to do it at all and even more puzzling that the president is doing it now, in the middle of the pandemic and with police riots going on around the country.\u201d Trump\u2019s announcement follows several others by the administration to weaken environment rules during the pandemic, including an executive order he signed yesterday to bypass reviews of big infrastructure projects that could threaten public health. The president unveiled the decision in Bangor, Maine, at a roundtable discussion with commercial fisheries companies. The White House said Trump\u2019s proclamation would allow commercial fishing within the monument but would not alter its boundaries. The protected area is about 130 miles from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and it contains endangered right whales and sensitive deep sea corals. It is one of five marine monuments in the country. The other four are in the western Pacific Ocean. After this rollback, less than .1% of the US waters outside the western Pacific Ocean will be protected from commercial fishing, according to an analysis by Cap based on federal data. \u201cEven fishing done well still has an impact, so for that reason it\u2019s important to have special areas of the ocean set aside. And this has been shown through a lot of science, that it is beneficial to ocean ecosystems, to biodiversity, to threatened and endangered species \u2013 and beneficial to those fisheries themselves,\u201d Goldstein said. Environment groups quickly responded that they plan to sue. The Natural Resources Defense Council is undertaking a similar lawsuit against the administration for opening up two Utah monuments, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, to mining. The Utah monuments and the marine monument were established at the end of the Barack Obama administration. Goldstein acknowledged that fishermen and aquaculture growers in coastal communities have been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic and economic downturn, but she said there are other actions the administration could take that would help. The US Regional Fishery Management Councils on 29 May sent a letter to the commerce department arguing that \u201cthe ban on commercial fishing within Marine national monument waters is a regulatory burden on domestic fisheries\u201d. The group had been making that same argument since 2016. Rip Cunningham, the conservation editor at Saltwater Sportsman and former chair of the New England Fishery Management Council, criticized the move. \u201cAs a recreational fisherman, it troubles me to see the monument opened to commercial fishing,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cThese are fragile and vulnerable resources, and I am concerned for their future health.\u201d",

Antagonizing and brutalizing protestors could also further erode a community\u2019s trust, posing challenges for health officials seeking to track and trace those who are infected with coronavirus, and warn those who may have been exposed. \u201cAfter these protests, people may be mistrustful of giving names and addresses of people they were with to health officials, if they\u2019re worried about their friends getting arrested,\u201d Chin-Hong said. Although medical experts worry about the spread of coronavirus during large demonstrations, the letter asks officials to \u201cnot disband protests under the guise of maintaining public health\u201d. As an infectious disease specialist, Chin-Hong and his colleagues are acutely aware that coronavirus disproportionately kills black and brown Americans, he said. The same communities that are at increased risk of dying from the virus are also most at risk from dying at the hands of police officers. \u201cAs much as coronavirus is a risk, racism is an infectious disease. Racism is a public health threat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to affirm people\u2019s right to be heard right now.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In 2016, when I finished writing <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/14/the-return-father-sons-and-the-land-in-between-hisham-matar-review\">The Return</a></em>, a book about my journey back to Libya after 33 years of not being able to go there for political reasons, and my failed search for my father, a Libyan political dissident who was imprisoned and made to disappear by the Gaddafi dictatorship, I went to Siena. I spent a month in the Tuscan city looking at paintings from the Sienese School, which covers the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. Works from this period have interested me ever since I first saw them at the National Gallery in London, some quarter of a century before, when I was 19, the very year my father was abducted. Something about their availability and vitality appealed to me. The time I spent in Siena provided a space to consider the connections between love and loss, death and art.</p> <p>The Sienese School, which sits between the waning influence of the eastern church and the Renaissance, was dramatically changed by the 1348 plague, the Black Death. That pandemic was the most devastating incident in human history. It altered not only human society but the imagination itself. Its traces can be perceived today, and perhaps more lucidly during these difficult days. With their lack of modern technology, the 14th-century Sienese were even more incredulous than we have shown ourselves to be in the early days of the coronavirus crisis. The speed of the Black Death was so staggering that in just over a year it had conquered the known medieval world, reducing the population of each country by an average of 45%. To the Sienese artists, who were engaged in a fruitful competitive collaboration with one another and had established a supportive infrastructure of apprenticeships to train young artists, the carnage seemed very far away and the reports were so wild and grotesque that they could scarcely be believed. But then when they heard that Sicily had fallen, it became obvious that there would be no escape. Fear and hysteria gripped Siena. Some people ran into the countryside; others, believing themselves safer inside the metropolis, rushed to enter through one of the many gates that surrounded the city like open mouths.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Vermeer were all threatened by the Black Death. It is thought that Titian died of it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Before Italy became a nation, it was made up of a collection of city-states governed by <em>un\u2019autorit\u00e0 superior</em>, in the form of a powerful noble family or a bishop. Siena was an exception in that it favoured civic rule. This partly accounts for the unique character of its art. It produced Ambrogio Lorenzetti\u2019s <em>The Allegory of Good and Bad Government,</em> a series of frescos housed in the Palazzo Pubblico, the civic heart of the city. It is one of the earliest and most significant secular paintings we have. If civic rule were a church, this would be its altarpiece. Siena also imbued its artists with a rare and humanist curiosity that, even in their depictions of religious scenes, involved them in meditations on human psychology and ideas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78247d5eed9924459535bd866e2e0875e7b71b03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78247d5eed9924459535bd866e2e0875e7b71b03/442_0_6259_3759/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Excerpt from The Allegory of the Good and Bad Government.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A detail from The Allegory of the Good and Bad Government.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heritage Image Partnership Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This changed with the arrival of the Black Death.<em> </em>The Sienese, like their medieval European Christian counterparts, suffered under the conviction that all diseases came from God. They took the Black Death as proof of their guilt. In the 14th-century Middle English narrative poem<em> Piers Plowman,</em> William Langland puts the matter succinctly: \u201cThese pestilences were for pure sin.\u201d The Tuscan poet Petrarch, observing the abandoned bodies of the dead, wrote: \u201cOh happy people of the future, who have not known these miseries and perchance will class our testimony with the fables. We have, indeed, deserved these [punishments] and even greater.\u201d The church encouraged such supernatural explanations. Many priests refused to bless the infected on the grounds that they were receiving God\u2019s punishment. Most of the believers devoted themselves to prayer and penitential practices, repairing churches and setting up religious houses. The papacy became more powerful. Ideas and the very structure of people\u2019s values shifted.</p> <p>The 1348 Black Death and its various proceeding reoccurrences, shaped our attitudes to death and dying and, by implication, to life and living across the world. Ibn Khald\u016bn, the Tunisian historian and historiographer credited with pioneering the field of sociology, lost his parents to the plague. To him it was an event of immense global importance, but also a personal affront. It drove him to conclude that the Black Death exposed profound weaknesses in human civilisation. His was a pre-Darwinian Darwinian view, and he wanted to see the opportunities in the tragedy. It made life seem, he wrote, \u201cas if it were a pristine and repeated creation, a world brought into existence anew\u201d. Indeed, the plague was destructive but also generative. The flowering of the Renaissance and the baroque took place in its shadow. Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Vermeer were all periodically threatened by it. It is thought that Titian died of it. And it entered their minds, tinged their thinking, and made death a familiar and inescapable guest, the silent companion who will inevitably have the last word. The imagination began to focus on the end of things. \u201cNo thought is born in me which has not \u2018Death\u2019 engraved upon it,\u201d Michelangelo wrote in a letter to Vasari.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3c5a2e8a689e68d81f7015a9550098df64d90a29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c5a2e8a689e68d81f7015a9550098df64d90a29/0_204_4252_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I thought I had gone to Siena simply to look at art\u2019 \u2026 Hisham Matar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I thought I had gone to Siena simply to look at art\u2019 \u2026 Hisham Matar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The religious fervour the Black Death inspired in Siena instilled a powerful commitment to the church. Barely seven years had passed when, in 1355, the city\u2019s civic rule ended. The clergy now were the principal clients. They had a great deal of money and influence. They determined what was painted. They commissioned a new chapel down the corridor from Ambrogio Lorenzetti\u2019s <em>The Allegory of Good and Bad Government</em>. Taddeo di Bartolo, the artist assigned to decorate the walls of the chapel, had a big task to fulfil. He needed to revive and carry forth the Sienese tradition as well as reinvent it and make it more adaptable to the tastes of the new patron. His depictions of the death of the Virgin, pictures concerned with the end of things, is a register that was not up to then central to Sienese art. It is impossible to look at <em>The Funeral of the Virgin </em>and not think of it as containing the memory of the dead of Siena, the bodies piled high on pavements because there was no place to bury them. Each of the Apostles carrying the Virgin as well as the onlookers seem utterly alone, as though touched by the thought of death. The whole chapel is a fabulous and contradictory performance of repentance and excess. Every surface \u2013 every centimetre of floor, wall and ceiling space \u2013 is decorated. It is an anxious space. Through its grandiose certainty, its sheer assertiveness, it manages to satisfy the clergy while at the same time expressing the problem with faith: that faith, any kind of faith, and regardless of how adamant it might appear, is a space of doubt. It was as though Bartolo was echoing that mischievous statement of Boccaccio\u2019s, the Florentine poet and Petrarch\u2019s friend and correspondent, who had also witnessed the Black Death: \u201cA seemly thing it is \u2026 that whatever we do, it be begun in the holy and awful name of Him who was the maker of all.\u201d An element of that sardonic rebellion is here in the chapel, albeit faintly, perhaps even unintentionally, through the double-edged gesture of assertive magnificence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e412b1d847efb007334955598d36aca4e0b4116d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e412b1d847efb007334955598d36aca4e0b4116d/127_549_2374_1425/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A detail from The Funeral of the Virgin by Taddeo di Bartolo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A detail from The Funeral of the Virgin by Taddeo di Bartolo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Picture Art Collection/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/19/hisham-matar-month-in-siena-books-interview\">Hisham Matar: \u2018Writing is both the easiest and the most difficult thing\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I thought I had gone to Siena simply to look at art. It turned out that I had also gone to mourn, to consider the new terrain and to work out how I might continue from here. In writing <em>A Month in Siena, </em>I had to think about all of this and about how death changes things. It is uncanny then to emerge from that to find our own world captured by a pandemic. And in thinking about all of this I find myself remembering the 20th-century Italian poet and novelist Cesare Pavese\u2019s statement that art is \u201ca defence against life\u2019s offenses\u201d. Although that may be too ambitious a role to assign to it, true art is always a symptom and a revelation. It may delight or offer solace, but it is also a tool for considering the present and our place in it.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>A Month in Siena by Hisham Matar is published by Viking</em><em>. </em><em>Matar is taking part in the Coronet theatre\u2019s Inside Out series of free online presentations of film, dance, art, installations, theatre, poetry and seminars.

It was as though Bartolo was echoing that mischievous statement of Boccaccio\u2019s, the Florentine poet and Petrarch\u2019s friend and correspondent, who had also witnessed the Black Death: \u201cA seemly thing it is \u2026 that whatever we do, it be begun in the holy and awful name of Him who was the maker of all.\u201d An element of that sardonic rebellion is here in the chapel, albeit faintly, perhaps even unintentionally, through the double-edged gesture of assertive magnificence. I thought I had gone to Siena simply to look at art. It turned out that I had also gone to mourn, to consider the new terrain and to work out how I might continue from here. In writing A Month in Siena, I had to think about all of this and about how death changes things. It is uncanny then to emerge from that to find our own world captured by a pandemic. And in thinking about all of this I find myself remembering the 20th-century Italian poet and novelist Cesare Pavese\u2019s statement that art is \u201ca defence against life\u2019s offenses\u201d. Although that may be too ambitious a role to assign to it, true art is always a symptom and a revelation. It may delight or offer solace, but it is also a tool for considering the present and our place in it. \u2022 A Month in Siena by Hisham Matar is published by Viking. Matar is taking part in the Coronet theatre\u2019s Inside Out series of free online presentations of film, dance, art, installations, theatre, poetry and seminars. See thecoronettheatre.com.",

He labelled the argument \u201cfutile\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Justice Fagan also acknowledged the right to protest and the importance of the Black Lives Matter protest in drawing attention to the treatment of Indigenous Australians at the hands of police, but reasoned that many Australians had had to forfeit rights during the pandemic, including to attend church and forfeiting their livelihoods.</p> \n  <p>Organisers had previously indicated they and supporters would attend the protest regardless of the legal decision, and it has been noted that last week in Sydney some 3,000 people gathered to join a protest based on conspiracy theories over 5G and police took no action.</p> \n  <p>Amnesty International UK had called for the protest to be allowed, saying that \u201cPeaceful protest is a fundamental human right, and the New South Wales police should work with organisers to ensure that attendees can social distance, and protests can be carried out in a safe manner.

      "bodyText": "This live blog is now closing. You can follow our continuing coverage of the protests in our new live blog: Guardian US reporter Kenya Evelyn explains why the unrest sparked by the police killing of George Floyd could be a defining moment for racial politics in America, and how the coronavirus pandemic set the backdrop for the protests. A black reporter from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was told she could not cover the city\u2019s protests over the death of George Floyd because of a tweet, and now dozens of her colleagues, fellow journalists, her union and the city\u2019s mayor are speaking out in support of her. On Friday the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh and many of her fellow reporters at the Post-Gazette were demanding that Alexis Johnson be allowed cover the protests, sending identical versions of the tweet themselves and using the hashtag #IStandWithAlexis. On Sunday, Johnson posted four photos that show trashed public spaces in the aftermath of a crowd. \u201cHorrifying scenes and aftermath from selfish LOOTERS who dont care about this city!!!!!\u201d the tweets text says. \u201c.... oh wait sorry. No, these are pictures from a Kenny Chesney concert tailgate. Whoops.\u201d It has since been retweeted over 50,000 times. Johnson confirmed to The Associated Press on Friday that she was told the tweet and the apparent bias it showed were the reasons she would no longer be covering the protests. She declined further comment, deferring to her guild. Guild president, Michael A. Fuoco, who is also a Post-Gazette reporter, told the AP that guild leaders were appalled by the move. Fuoco said We feel taking a black woman off the most monumental national story about civil rights in the last 50 years is punishment. We have very few black journalists. Someone who has the contacts and the insights for this story, that is what you want. Karen Kane, managing editor of the Post-Gazette, said in an email that the paper\u2019s editors cannot comment on personnel matters. Journalists from other outlets around the country and other unions were also speaking out in favor of Johnson, as did Pittsburgh mayor, Bill Peduto, who said on Twitter that her reporting \u201chas been professional in journalistic accepted practices and integrity\u201d. The Pittsburgh Black Media Federation released a statement saying that to deny the African American reporter the opportunity to cover this news removes an opportunity for the Post-Gazette to present a more fair, nuanced, and informed portrait of what is happening in local communities. Johnson on Friday thanked her union for going to bat for her and said she was crying from the solidarity that has been shown for her. \u201cThank you everyone for your support and your words of encouragement, your actions\u201d, she tweeted. \u201cI am just ... wow.\u201d Johnson\u2019s removal from protest coverage was first reported by Pittsburgh City Paper. The co-founder of social media site Reddit resigned from the board of the company yesterday, urging board members to replace him with a black candidate. Alexis Ohanian linked his decision to the anti-racist actions taking place across the globe in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, and said, \u201cI\u2019m doing this for me, for my family, and for my country.\u201d Ohanian, who is married to tennis star Serena Williams, said: \u201cI\u2019m saying this as a father who needs to be able to answer his black daughter when she asks: \u2018What did you do?\u2019\u201d. I believe resignation can actually be an act of leadership from people in power right now. To everyone fighting to fix our broken nation: do not stop. He also said he would use future gains on his Reddit stock to \u201cserve the black community, chiefly to curb racial hate\u201d. He added that he was pledging one million US dollars (\u00a3790,000) to Colin Kaepernick\u2019s Know Your Rights Camp, a youth campaign around self-empowerment and interacting with law enforcement. Ohanian, who co-founded Reddit 15 years ago, said he believes the board will follow through on his call to action. \u201cThe Reddit community is also asking for it and more. Exciting times seeing this level of energy asking for change (including from community itself asking for a hate speech policy).\u201d After a day of protests across Australia, Guardian staff have compiled some of the most striking images. Tens of thousands rallied in state capital cities and towns to march against Indigenous deaths in custody and the killing of George Floyd. The nationwide anti-police brutality protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd in the US have been marked by widespread incidents of police violence, including punching, kicking, gassing, pepper-spraying and driving vehicles at often peaceful protesters in states across the country. The actions have left thousands of protesters in jail and injured many others, leaving some with life-threatening injuries. From Minnesota to New York, Texas, California, Washington DC and many places beyond, from small towns to big cities, police officers have demonstrated just how problematic law enforcement is in the US, drawing condemnation from international groups as well as domestic civil rights organizations. The International Crisis Group, which monitors unrest around the world, said the police had used \u201cexcessive force\u201d. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, said: \u201cAll police officers who resort to excessive use of force should be charged and convicted for the crimes committed.\u201d Numerous incidents of police violence have been exposed in disturbing videos and press accounts in recent days, with little sign that police are adjusting their tactics. Authorities in the US capital are expecting Saturday to be the largest demonstration against police brutality in the city since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Washington has seen daily protests for the past week and they have largely been peaceful, with people marching back and forth from the White House to the Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial. Those numbers are expected to swell. Army secretary Ryan McCarthy told reporters on Friday that local officials were projecting between 100,000 and 200,000 protesters. Metropolitan police department chief Peter Newsham wouldn\u2019t commit to a number but predicted it would be smaller than the one million people who attended the Women\u2019s March in 2017. It comes as authorities have sought to reduce tensions by having National Guard troops not carry weapons. There were zero arrests during demonstrations on Thursday and Friday and DC mayor Muriel Bowser canceled the curfew that had been in place since Monday. She said she will decide on Saturday morning if it will be reinstated. A number of DC churches and theaters have said they will open their lobbies so people can cool off. Civil rights activists Rev. Al Sharpton said the Washington rally he announced this week was being planned for 28 August, the anniversary of the day Martin Luther King gave his I Have a Dream speech. He said the August event would be a way of maintaining momentum as the legal process against the men charged in Floyd\u2019s death is underway. It\u2019s going to be months, if not a year, before you even go to trial. So you can\u2019t let this peter out ... otherwise you\u2019ll end up in a year and people will go on to another story, and you will not have the public notice and pressure that you need. Police have banned a third protest in Paris that had been planned for Saturday to condemn the action of police in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death. Police cited a risk of spreading Covid-19 and fears of public unrest. The police decree noted that social distancing regulations ban gatherings of more than 10 people. Online posts called for people to gather on Saturday afternoon in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. Paris police previously also banned two other planned gatherings on Saturday outside the US Embassy. Protests have now spread right across the globe, with people marching in solidarity with those in the US and to call out issues of systemic racism in their own countries. The rolling, global protests reflect rising anger over police treatment of ethnic minorities, sparked by the 25 May killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Demonstrations, however, have been limited by social-distancing curbs aiming at stopping the spread of Covid-19. People are starting to take to the streets in Seoul, South Korea - it looks like all are wearing face masks and staying socially distanced. In Tokyo, Japan people marched in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, while also protesting against police treatment of a Kurdish man in the city who says he was stopped while driving and shoved to the ground, leaving him with bruises. \u201cI want to show that there\u2019s racism in Japan now,\u201d said 17-year-old high school student Wakaba, who declined to give her family name. She and her friend, Moe, held a sign saying: \u201cIf you\u2019re not angry, you\u2019re not paying attention\u201d. \u201cNo justice, no peace, no racist police,\u201d the crowd chanted. With pandemic restrictions in Bangkok, Thailand, activists were going online, asking for video and photos of people wearing black, raising their fists and holding signs, and explaining why they \u201cstand united behind Black Lives Matter\u201d. The Thai protesters plan to gather on the video-meeting platform Zoom on Sunday and observe 8 minutes 46 seconds of silence - the period that George Floyd was filmed pinned under the officer\u2019s knee. In Brisbane, police estimated 10,000 people joined a peaceful protest, with many wrapping themselves in indigenous flags, calling for an end to police mistreatment of indigenous Australians. In Sydney, a last-minute court decision overruled a coronavirus ban as several thousand people marched, amid a heavy police presence, chanting: \u201cWhose lives matter? Black Lives matter.\u201d Rallies were also held in Melbourne, Adelaide and other Australian cities. There has been a huge turnout at the Black Lives Matter rally in Brisbane, the capital of Queensland in Australia. It is estimated tens of thousands marched through the streets protesting against the over-representation of First Nations people dying in police custody, and racism towards black people. This is Jessica Murray, I\u2019ll be steering the blog for the next few hours as the protests following George Floyd\u2019s killing head into their second weekend - with action now taking place across the globe. If you would like to get in touch to share your thoughts, stories or experiences, then please do: Email: jessica.murray@theguardian.com Twitter: @journojess_ Ben Doherty, signing off for the evening (I\u2019m in Australia). But our coverage continues on its peripatetic way around the world. I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Jessica Murray in London. Thanks all for your comments and contributions. Be well all of you, and stay safe. As this man\u2019s friend says: \u201cMagnifique!\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Laura Murphy-Oates, a Ngiyampaa Wailwan woman, is on the streets of Sydney. For those internationally struggling with the Australian accents, the call-and-response chant is: What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now. This is a powerful piece from Nina Robinson in Minneapolis. In their own words: the protestors at the heart of America\u2019s uprising. Stacey Ray How are you feeling? Angry, disappointed, exhausted \u2026 but more than anything, just hurt. Because we all know somebody who\u2019s been through the same thing, or we know somebody who could possibly go through the same thing. I have two teenage sons, I have a brother, I have a boyfriend, a father. It just has to stop. This is home for me and seeing what happened to Jamar Clark [who was fatally shot in Minneapolis in 2015], seeing Philando Castile [who was fatally shot in St Paul, Minnesota, in 2019], and now seeing this right here \u2013 where we\u2019re supposed to be \u201cMinnesota nice\u201d. Jonathan McNeil Hardy Did you participate in the protests? I just got back to Minneapolis last night. You leave your city in one condition and then, you come back and it\u2019s in two different conditions: one that you\u2019re not used to but you don\u2019t like seeing, and the other, which is just destruction. I\u2019m frustrated. I just don\u2019t want this to end, I don\u2019t want it to go away \u2013 I want people to fight. I want people to fight responsibly, fight safely and fight without violence if necessary. Kiyai Dorsey (left) How are you healing? This is our reality every day, whether people want to face that or not. And it\u2019s felt worldwide this time. It\u2019s just beautiful to see that solidarity everywhere else. It means a lot, for real. We just want to be heard. We want our lives to matter. You know, we want to be treated like everyone else. Keta Daniel (right) What is a message that you want to give to your community? I want to give a personal message to all of my black community at this time: to take care of themselves and to take care of each other. This is really tough for all of us mentally. So don\u2019t be pressured to be out on the frontlines, as much as we want to. Make sure to take time to rejuvenate and recollect. No matter what\u2019s going on outside, it\u2019s so important to do what makes you happy. Don\u2019t lose that. For all of its First Amendment proclamations, this is freedom of the press in the United States today. Poppy Noor reports. Lanre Bakare reports that some of the UK\u2019s most prestigious drama schools have apologised for not doing enough to combat racism on their campuses after being accused of hypocrisy over social media posts in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Some extraordinary examples of institutional racism cited in this piece. Actor Dipo Ola, studying at the Oxford School of Drama, said there was a uniform experience for students of colour in drama schools: \u201csystemic racism, from the top down\u201d. Ola said he was asked if he was \u201cplaying a slave\u201d by another student when he appeared as Egeon in Shakespeare\u2019s The Comedy of Errors; was regularly mistaken for another black student who attended the school years before; and had his concerns dismissed when he drew attention to the lack of BAME staff and dearth of plays written by playwrights of colour. \u201cWhen you brought it up, you feel like a burden,\u201d he said. \u201cYou felt like you were causing trouble. When we talk about race we\u2019re seen as overreacting. There\u2019s always that tinge.\u201d The call to \u201cdefund the police\u201d has become a rallying cry at protests across America this week, and some lawmakers appear to be listening. Activists who have long fought to cut law enforcement budgets say they are seeing an unprecedented wave of support for their ideas, with some elected officials for the first time proposing budget reductions and divestments from police. Here\u2019s what we know about the movement, and how cities and states are responding. As nationwide protests hurtled toward a second weekend following the police killing of George Floyd, several cities and states are taking steps to reform controversial policing tactics, Maanvi Singh and Mario Koran report. In Minneapolis, where Floyd died last Monday after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, the city agreed to ban chokeholds and neck restraints by police and to require officers to try to stop any other officers they see using improper force. They marked the first concrete steps to remake the city\u2019s police force since Floyd\u2019s death. The state human rights commissioner, Rebecca Lucero, said the changes were necessary to stop continuing harm to people of color \u201cwho have suffered generational pain and trauma as a result of systemic and institutional racism\u201d. \u201cThis is just a start,\u201d Lucero said. \u201cThere is a lot more work to do here, and that work must and will be done with speed and community engagement.\u201d In breaking news, the Black Lives Matter protest in Sydney has been authorised by the NSW Court of Appeals. It is now legal (it was going ahead anyway). On the streets of Sydney. The tweeter here is the local mayor: Good afternoon/evening/morning, wherever this coverage finds you. Ben Doherty with you in Sydney. My thanks to Maanvi Singh (and the roll-call of earlier colleagues) for their comprehensive work. I can be contacted by email ben.doherty@theguardian.com or on twitter @BenDohertyCorro. In Australia, where your correspondent currently sits, dozens of protests in solidarity with the US Black Lives Matter movement are underway across the country. Senior politicians, including the prime minister, have asked Australians not to \u201cimport\u201d issues from overseas, but the movement here is seen as one not only in support of American demonstrators, but in protest at institutional racism towards indigenous Australians. Indigenous Australians are grossly over-represented in Australia\u2019s criminal justice system: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults make up just 2% of the national population, they constitute 27% of the national prison population. There have been 432 Aboriginal deaths in custody since a royal commission into black deaths in custody in 1991, the Guardian\u2019s Deaths Inside project shows. Just this week, a NSW police constable was put on leave for slamming a teenaged indigenous boy - who was not threatening the officer - into the ground, by sweeping his legs from under him. At the Melbourne protest today, 17-year-old Kyah Nicholson-Ward told The Guardian of the US and Australia: \u201cit\u2019s the same story on different soil\u201d. In Australia\u2019s most populous state, New South Wales, the state government went to the Supreme Court on Friday and won a late-night injunction banning a planned protest in Sydney. The government argued a protest would be in breach of social distancing regulations imposed to halt the spread of coronavirus. But protest organisers said they were going to march anyway, and a sizeable crowd has arrived at Sydney Town Hall in defiance of the court order. Guardian reporter Elias Visontay is in Sydney. In Brisbane, the capital of the state of Queensland. Protests continued across the country. Medical professionals rallied in New York, demonstrators gathered at the shores of the Mississippi River in New Orleans, and knelt outside the Walgreens where police killed a 22-year-old amid protests this week in Vallejo, California. The NFL commissioner Roger Goodell admitted that the organization was wrong for not letting players peacefully protest. Calls mounted for the orgnaization to formally apologize to Colin Kaepernick, who was sidelined after leading protests against police brutality in 2016. Seattle has temporarily banned the use of teargas. A federal judge in Denver has blocked the police department from indiscriminately deploying chemical weapons and projectiles against peaceful protestors. And California\u2019s governor has called for a statewide standard for law enforcement crowd control. Minneapolis agreed to ban the use of police chokeholds in response to the killing of Floyd. The Minneapolis city council approved an agreement today with the state\u2019s department of human rights, which also requires officers to intervene anytime they seen an unauthorized use of force. The DC mayor renamed the section of 16th Street in front of the White House \u201cBlack Lives Matter Plaza,\u201d as tensions escalate between the administration and the DC government. Mayor Muriel Bowser has also asked Trump to remove all \u201cextraordinary\u201d law enforcement officers. But Black Lives Matters called on Bowser to do more to address the issue of overpolicing \u2014 her current proposed budget increases funding for traditional policing and cuts funds from community programs to reduce violence. The entire Buffalo police department\u2019s emergency response team has reportedly resigned from the team after two colleagues were suspended without pay for pushing a 75-year-old man who was protesting the killing of Floyd. The 57 officers will still by employed by BPD but will no longer serve on the emergency response team. The elderly protester has been hospitalized and is said to be in stable condition. Trump\u2019s comment that this is a \u201cgreat day\u201d for George Floyd sparked outrage. Trump made the comment during a nearly hour-long event in the Rose Garden this afternoon, which mainly consisted of him boasting about the new jobs report. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said the remark, which came less than two weeks after Floyd was killed while in police custody, was \u201cdespicable.\u201d The US unemployment rate surprisingly dropped to 13.3% in May, according to the jobs report released this morning.But the actual number may be higher due to an error. I\u2019m signing off, but my colleague Ben Doherty will continue providing live updates. Earlier, it seemed the unemployment rate in the US had dropped to 13.3% in May according to the jobs report released this morning, which seemed to be a hopeful sign. But the actual rate may be higher. The official jobs report included a note at the bottom saying there had been an \u201cerror\u201d. \u201cBLS and the Census Bureau are investigating why this misclassification error continues to occur and are taking additional steps to address the issue,\u201d the note reads. Donald Trump appears to have crossed a new milestone in his presidency: In the ruling, judge R Brooke Jackson called the actions of some law enforcement officers in Denver and across the nation \u201cdisgusting\u201d. \u201cThe Denver Police Department has failed in its duty to police its own,\u201d Jackson wrote. The order asks law enforcement to warn protesters to disperse before firing teargas and pepper spray and ceasing the indiscriminate use of non- or less-lethal projectiles. Among the most striking lines in the order: \u201cIf a store\u2019s windows must be broken to prevent a protestor\u2019s facial bones from being broken or eye being permanently damaged, that is more than a fair trade. If a building must be graffiti-ed to prevent the suppression of free speech, that is a fair trade.\u201d The ruling came after protesters filed a lawsuit asking for a temporary restraining order against aggressive police crowd control. In Vallejo, California, where a police officer shot and killed Sean Monterrosa, an unarmed 22-year-old, amid protests this week, demonstrators gathered at the Walgreens where Monterrosa died. Read more about Monterrosa, and the Vallejo police department, which activists have long described as out of control, from my colleague Sam Levin: Joe Biden\u2019s statement as he clinches the nomination: This is a difficult time in America\u2019s history. And Donald Trump\u2019s angry, divisive politics is no answer. The country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us. Leadership that can bring us together. We need an economy that works for everyone \u2014 now. We need jobs that bring dignity \u2014 now. We need equal justice \u2014 and equal opportunities \u2014 for every American now. We need a president who cares about helping us heal \u2014 now It was an honor to compete alongside one of the most talented groups of candidates the Democratic party has ever fielded \u2014 and I am proud to say that we are going into this general election a united party. I am going to spend every day between now and November 3rd fighting to earn the votes of Americans all across this great country so that, together, we can win the battle for the soul of this nation, and make sure that as we rebuild our economy, everyone comes along. The spat between Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey and the president continues, with the president claiming that it was illegal for the social media company to take down a Trump campaign video. Twitter said the video was taken down due to copyright infingement issues. DC\u2019s Muriel Bowser had this tweet, quite clearly aimed at Trump: For days, Bowser said she opposed the stationing of federal law enforcement and the military in and around the district. This morning, local artist Rose Jaffe joined city work crews to paint a giant Black Lives Matter slogan across two blocks. Later, Bowser watched as a city worker hung a sign at the street corner just north of the White House: Black Lives Matter Plz NW. But activists said Bowser needed to to more than rename a street. The mayor\u2019s proposed budget increases funding for policing and cuts funds for community-based interventions to reduce violence. In Brooklyn, a reporter filmed police officers hitting a man with batons and shoving a journalist. Later, a man who said he was a staffer for a state senator Julia Salazar or Brooklyn was arrested after he filmed officers. Some more scenes from around the country: In Columbia, South Carolina, protesters gathered outside the governor\u2019s mansion. In Washington, DC, hundreds marched in the rain, in the area near the White House that Mayor Muriel Bowser today renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza. Although Biden has been the presumptive nominee since Bernie Sanders dropped out of the primaries in April, the former vice-president had yet to win the 1,991 delegates needed to formally claim the nomination. Biden now has 1,993 delegates, according to the Associated Press. Demonstrations continued on Friday in San Francisco. A major rally earlier in the week drew thousands of participants who marched from the Mission District to City Hall. Many walked on foot, others on horseback. This time, it appears many have arrived on two wheels ... A coalition of criminal justice activists and homeless advocates have sued Los Angeles over how the police have responded to protesters following the killing of George Floyd. The suit accuses the police of shooting a homeless man in the eye with rubber bullets and detaining people for more than 12 hours for curfew violations, the Los Angeles Times reports. From the LA Times: The suit \u2014 filed late Friday by the Los Angeles chapter of the National Lawyers Guild, Black Lives Matter and Los Angeles Community Action Network \u2014 accused the L.A. Police Department of violating many protesters\u2019 right to assemble and using excessive force. The complaint also provided new information about an image of a homeless man bleeding from the eye in downtown Los Angeles that had gone viral and been shared by many critical of the department over the last week. Protests over the death of Floyd, who was killed while in Minneapolis police custody on May 25, have led to unrest that Los Angeles has not seen since the 1992 riots sparked by the acquittal of four LAPD officers in the beating Rodney King. While businesses were looted and buildings were damaged and burned in downtown, Van Nuys and the Fairfax District, activists said protests have been largely peaceful and police have focused most of their attention on arresting demonstrators instead of looters. In New Orleans, demonstrators have gathered at the banks of the Mississippi River, as depicted here by a reporter for the city\u2019s public radio station: Although many local governments have lifted curfews ahead of this weekend, curfews remain in place in cities across the US in an attempt to quell the unrest over the killing of George Floyd in police custody. The Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho reports: The selective enforcement of the curfew orders only underscores the demonstrators\u2019 message about law enforcement abuses, civil liberties experts warn. The vague, broad language in these orders gives law enforcement leeway to pick and choose when to arrest someone for violating curfew, allowing for situations that are ripe for abuse, experts said. In some cities, this has worked in protesters\u2019 favor when police chose not to arrest them. But when police enforce an order in some cases and not others, the order becomes an arbitrary tool of control that often appears to violate protesters\u2019 constitutional rights to assembly and free speech. \u201cThe amount of discretion and the ways these laws are written are perpetuating the same injustices that our communities are out there protesting right now,\u201d Shilpi Agarwal, a senior attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of northern California, told the Guardian. \u201cThe thing that has inspired these protests and triggered this pain in folks is this flagrant abuse of power by police. The response to that should not be to further empower the police.\u201d In some locations, police have appeared to give certain people a free pass. In Salem, Oregon, the police chief was forced to issue a public apology after an officer was filmed Monday telling armed white men to duck into businesses or vehicles once curfew hits so \u201cwe don\u2019t look like we\u2019re playing favorites\u201d. Elsewhere, police have treated curfew deadlines as a \u201cflexible tool\u201d. Here are some images of demonstrations around the country. Medical professionals rallied in New York\u2019s Union Square. In Los Angeles, activists displayed the names of 1,000 people killed by LA county law enforcement since 2000. Protestors placed roses next to the posters, which were placed in front of thr Hall of Justice. At least 100 cars joined a \u201cCaravan for Justice\u201d in Racine, Wisconsin, and protestors gathered near the county courthouse for a rally against police brutality. In Washington, DC, demonstrators sang happy birthday to Breonna Taylor, who would have turned 27 today if she had not been killed. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said officers who taped over their badges or turned off their body-worn cameras would be stripped of their police powers. At a news conference, she said: We will not tolerate people who cross the line. We will not tolerate excessive force. We will not tolerate profanity and homophobic comments. Officers who choose to do those things or to tape over their badges, or to turn off their body-worn cameras \u2013 all things that violate very clear directives of the Chicago Police Department.\u201d Her message to officers who use excessive force: \u201cShame on you, shame on you.\u201d Prior to being elected mayor, Lightfoot served as chair of the Chicago Police Accountability Task Force. Lightfoot also announced that Chicago would open the city\u2019s Grant Park and Union Park to accommodate demonstrators, and deploy 300 trucks to provide traffic support. Attorney general William Barr said he did not give the order to have peaceful protesters dispersed with chemical agents to clear the way for Trump to pose for a photo in front of a church near the White House, though he supports the decision. In an interview with the AP, Barr said law enforcement was already clearing the crowd from a park near the White House on Monday evening when he arrived at the scene. The episode has received widespread criticism, including from senior military figures outside the administration and church leaders. Earlier this week, White House spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany said it was Barr who decided to push back protesters and expand the perimeter around the White House. In the AP interview, Barr indicated that the call to have protesters pushed back was unconnected to the presidential photoshoot. He said he had wanted the protesters moved, but he hadn\u2019t directly given the tactical order. Administration officials have been playing hot potato, passing responsibility for the choice to have peaceful protesters moved with force. Washington governor Jay Inslee has promised an independent review of Manuel Ellis\u2019 death. Ellis, who was 33, died minutes after his arrest after pleading, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, echoing George Floyd and Eric Garner. The local medical examiner\u2019s office concluded that Ellis\u2019 death was a homicide. Sara McDowell, a bystander who filmed parts of Ellis\u2019 fatal encounter with the police, said she saw him approach a police car on 3 March. An officer threw open the car door and knocked Ellis down. In brief video clips, McDowell\u2019s voice can be heard calling out to police officers: \u201cStop. Oh my God, stop hitting him.\u201d Police provided a different account, saying that Ellis initiated the confrontation, which prompted officers to restrain him. The mayor of Tacoma, Washington, has called for the police officers involved to be fired and prosecuted. \u201cWe know that Manuel Ellis is one of far, far too many Black men who died while in police custody in America,\u201d Inslee said in a statement promising an \u201cindependent review of the investigation and any charging decisions related to the death of Manuel Ellis.\u201d Hallie Golden writes for The Guardian: Dozens of healthcare workers in Seattle lined the streets outside Swedish Hospital for a moment of silence Friday in support of the George Floyd protests. A reporter for local news station Kiro 7 captured the moment the workers, who have spent months battling coronavirus, took a knee in Seattle\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood. A group of 66 United Nations human rights monitors issued a devastating critique of what they call modern-day \u201cracial terror\u201d lynchings in the US in the form of state-sponsored police violence against black Americans. The group released two joint statements on Friday, prompted by the wave of protests against police brutality that has swept the nation in the wake of the deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky. The action marks an almost unparalleled outpouring of criticism by the UN\u2019s independent body of human rights experts. Rarely have so many come together to speak as one voice. The language they deploy is also highly unusual in its excoriating critique of what the monitors state is the \u201cfundamental racial inequality and discrimination that characterize life in the United States for black people\u201d. Most piercingly, the experts make a direct link between police killings of unarmed African American men today with the spate of thousands of racial lynchings that terrorized black communities in the era of segregation. \u201cAfrican Americans continue to experience racial terror in state-sponsored and privately organized violence \u2026 In the US, this legacy of racial terror remains evident in modern-day policing.\u201d Earlier today, Drew Brees, the New Orleans Saints quarterback, apologized for comments implying that NFL players who kneel during the national anthem were unpatriotic, a common mischaracterization of the protest against police violence launched by Kaepernick in 2016. But at least one person was unhappy with Brees\u2019s decision to change the play at the line. Trump took aim at the future Hall of Fame signal-caller on Friday afternoon, saying on Twitter: \u201cI am a big fan of Drew Brees. I think he\u2019s truly one of the greatest quarterbacks, but he should not have taken back his original stance on honoring our magnificent American Flag. OLD GLORY is to be revered, cherished, and flown high... We should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart. There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag - NO KNEELING!\u201d Calls for the NFL to formally apologize to Colin Kaepernick, who was sidelined after he protested police brutality in 2016, are gaining steam. So are calls to give him back his job \u2013 with a significant promotion. Fox News is drawing rebuke after airing a graphic tracking stock market gains following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr, the acquittal of Los Angeles police officers who savagely beat Rodney King, and the police killings of Michael Brown and George Floyd. Representative Bobby Rush, a Democrat of Illinois and prominent civil rights activist, wrote on Twitter: \u201cThis is absolutely outrageous and disgusting. This graphic tells every single @FoxNews viewer that Black lives can be exchanged for market gain.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Ankita Rao reports from New York: Hundreds of people gathered in Union Square this evening once more in New York City. But this gathering, organized in part by Frontlines for Frontlines, called for health workers to show solidarity with the movement against police brutality. Amid a nationwide, politicized dialogue about why public health professionals are supporting the protests during a pandemic, the doctors and nurses here said systemic racism is a public health crisis that existed before Covid-19 and will continue to after. This evening, they knelt in silence, chanted the names of people who had died at the hands of police, and marched down the main route on Broadway toward City Hall. Many of the nurses and doctors here have been treating Covid-19 patients in the city, and said they saw the protest as essential for the wellbeing of their patients. The New York gathering was one of many that happened across hospitals and cities in the country, where healthcare workers knelt or observed silence for victims of police brutality. The New York Times added an editor\u2019s note to a piece by Republican senator Tom Cotton, which received widespread rebuke. The note maintains that \u201cThe basic arguments advanced by Senator Cotton \u2014 however objectionable people may find them \u2014 represent a newsworthy part of the current debate.\u201d But it continues: But given the life-and-death importance of the topic, the senator\u2019s influential position and the gravity of the steps he advocates, the essay should have undergone the highest level of scrutiny. Instead, the editing process was rushed and flawed, and senior editors were not sufficiently involved. While Senator Cotton and his staff cooperated fully in our editing process, the Op-Ed should have been subject to further substantial revisions \u2014 as is frequently the case with such essays \u2014 or rejected. Cotton responded that the paper is \u201cnow run by a woke mob\u2019. Here\u2019s the scene in Columbus, Ohio, captured by a reporter for WOSU, the local public radio station: The NFL commissioner Roger Goodell admitted that the organization was wrong for not letting players peacefully protest. \u201cWe, the NFL, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,\u201d Goodell said in a video posted to social media. \u201cWe, the NFL, believe Black Lives Matter.\u201d The statement is a huge reversal for the NFL. After former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, Colin Kaepernick began kneeling before games to protest police brutality, no team offered him a contract. Yesterday, a group of NFL players called on the league to \u201ccondemn racism and the systematic oppression of black people\u201d in a video. \u201cHow many times do we need to ask you to listen to your players?\u201d Tyrann Mathieu of the Kansas City Chiefs asked in the video, which was shared widely yesterday. Here are some scenes from Detroit, where a huge showing of protesters has shut down a bridge: Trump has rolled back yet another Obama-era environmental protection. The president signed a proclamation today that opened the Atlantic Ocean\u2019s only fully protected marine sanctuary to commercial fishing. Trump\u2019s proclamation allows fishing to resume at the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, reversing a policy from the Obama era banning crabbing and fishing in the monument in order to protect endangered whales and other marine life. Obama had blocked off 5,000 miles of the monument off the coast of New England in 2016 over opposition from crabbers and lobster catchers. The city\u2019s mayor announced the policy at a press conference amid growing concern over the use of chemical agents against protesters. Nearly 1,300 public health providers and experts have signed a letter this week, warning that dousing crowds with teargas and pepper spray will accelerate the spread of coronavirus. Public health experts and civil rights advocates have long advocated against the use of teargas, a chemical weapon that can be lethal, especially to the elderly and those with underlying conditions like asthma. Various international treaties and the Geneva Convention have banned its use in international warfare. Kanye West will provide financial support to the families of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor. The Guardian\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Wheeler reports: West will fund the entire college education of George Floyd\u2019s six-old-daughter, representatives for the rapper confirmed late Friday afternoon to PEOPLE. In addition, the rapper will donate $2 million to support the \u201clegal defenses and families\u201d of the late Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. The news comes after West was seen participating in a South Side Chicago protest Thursday. The appearance came after a notable silence from West, as many in the hip-hop community, including Jay-Z, Drake, and Ludacris, issued calls for justice. West is a noted supporter of President Trump, who has threatened violence and military action against protesters repeatedly. While West has not publicly commented on the deaths of Floyd, Arbery, or Taylor, his wife, Kim Kardashian West, wrote she was \u201cinfuriated and disgusted.\u201d Previously, the couple have worked closely with President Trump on criminal justice reform and freeing inmates. Another dispatch from our West Coast bureau\u2026 Earlier today, California governor Gavin Newsom called for an end to police chokeholds, a technique that has been controversial for decades. The Los Angeles Times notes that the Los Angeles police department limited the use of the carotid neck holds \u2013 where officers apply pressure to a detainee\u2019s neck \u2013 after 1982, after the then LAPD chief Daryl Gates notoriously said blacks die from the technique at disproportionate rates because the \u201cveins or arteries of blacks do not open up as fast as they do in normal people\u201d. The carotid neck hold was not used by the officer in Minneapolis who kneeled on George Floyd\u2019s neck. Newsom also had words on the approach police have used to disperse crowds of demonstrators, which has included the use of tear gas and rubber bullets. \u201cProtesters have the right to protest peacefully \u2013 not be harassed. Not be shot at by rubber bullets or tear gas,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cToday I am calling for the creation of a new statewide standard for use of force in protests. Acts of violence against peaceful protestors will not be tolerated.\u201d Aside from force targeted at protestors, public health experts have warned that the use of tear gas, which causes people to sneeze, gag and cough, could accelerate the spread of coronavirus in the middle of the pandemic. Newsom addressed the need for larger and more consistent efforts to change what he described as a two-tier justice system that treats people who \u201care rich and guilty a hell of a lot better than it treats people that are poor and innocent\u201d. \u201cOne thing we know about our criminal justice system, it\u2019s not blind,\u201d Newsom said. The governor called on Californians to reject the sense of \u201cnormalcy\u201d that has resulted in an unequal justice system. \u201cWe\u2019ve accepted that as normal. Normalcy created the conditions that led to this moment. If you want to go back to normalcy \u2013 I\u2019m not going there with you\u201d, he said. News from Canada, where prime minister Justin Trudeau this afternoon took a knee with protesters at an event in memory of George Floyd. According to Reuters, Trudeau was \u201cwearing a black mask and surrounded by bodyguards [when he] made a surprise appearance at the \u201cNo justice = No peace\u201d rally in front of parliament in Ottawa. His appearance came a day after police shot and killed an indigenous woman during a wellness check in eastern Canada.\u201d When Trudeau kneeled, protesters chanted \u201cStand up to Trump!\u201d More from Reuters: \u201cDemonstrations were held in other Canadian cities on Friday, including Toronto, where hundreds walked downtown. \u201cTrudeau three times took a knee alongside other protesters, a gesture used to protest against police brutality and the treatment of African-Americans by police. Afterward, several people thanked Trudeau for kneeling.\u201d Our west coast tech reporter sends the following report about the Washington Post\u2019s big story on internal dissent at Facebook\u2026 Internal documents from Facebook show thousands of employees oppose chief executive Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s choice not to remove inflammatory speech posted on the platform by Donald Trump, a Washington Post report shows. Employees have criticized Zuckerberg over his decision to leave live on the site a post made by Trump that seemingly encouraged the shooting of protesters. Social media rival Twitter chose to hide the message behind a warning. According to a report the Post published on Friday, in response to growing unrest among employees, Zuckerberg held an emergency town hall meeting this week, during which 5,500 workers voted on which questions should be put to him. The one that got the highest number of votes asked: \u201cCan we please change our policies around political free speech? Fact checking and removal of hate speech shouldn\u2019t be exempt for politicians.\u201d One internal message board at Facebook with hundreds of participants questioned whether the social media giant has an \u201cabusive relationship\u201d with the president, the Post reported. The Post report is the latest to uncover growing unrest within Facebook and among the company\u2019s partners surrounding Zuckerberg\u2019s content moderation decisions. Criticism has come from former employees and current employees at all levels of the company, including senior staff. Also this week, nearly three-dozen founding Facebook employees wrote an open letter to Zuckerberg opposing the decision to leave the Trump post up. Current employees staged a virtual walkout, and online therapy company Talkspace cut ties with Facebook over the issue. Facebook did not respond to request for comment. Reports and footage are coming in from across the US of crowds gathering for more protests this afternoon and tonight, as the killing in Minneapolis of George Floyd \u2013 and other deaths of African Americans at the hands of police, including those of Breonna Taylor and David McAtee in Louisville, Kentucky \u2013 fuel lasting civil unrest, the worst since 1968 and the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Hre\u2019s Josh Wood\u2019s report from Louisville about the death of McAtee. And here\u2019s a Guardian video, in which Kenya Evelyn, one of our Washington reporters, explains what the George Floyd protests says about America: From New York, meanwhile, the Associated Press reports that arrests from a week of protests have started to put a strain on the city\u2019s justice system: There have been well over 2,000 arrests as police seek to impose order across the city. Public defenders say too many of those arrested have been detained for too long in cramped and unsanitary conditions while authorities figure who should receive summonses for minor violations and go free, or be charged in criminal complaints and face arraignments remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic. The backlog prompted The Legal Aid Society to file a lawsuit demanding the New York police department release people held in violation of a requirement to get them in front of a judge within 24 hours, a situation that one defense lawyer said \u201cappears to be designed to retaliate against New Yorkers protesting police brutality.\u201d Patricia Miller, who heads the city\u2019s Special Federal Litigation Division, called the allegation \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and \u201cexceptionally unfair\u201d. The NYPD and court system are \u201cworking within the confines of a pandemic and now suddenly called upon not only to secure orderly protesting, but also to address rioters who are committing burglaries, destroying private property, and assaulting fellow New Yorkers,\u201d Miller said. Good evening from New York \u2013 I\u2019m here to take you through the next couple of hours, until Maanvi Singh logs on from Oakland to close out the day in America. The Washington Post has an in-depth and fascinating report about troubles at Facebook, over Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s refusal to check or question posts by Donald Trump about the George Floyd protests seen by most observers to encourage violence and division. The Post editors have like good editors everywhere gone for the grabby headline: \u201cFacebook employees said they were \u2018caught in an abusive relationship\u2019 with Trump as internal debates raged\u201d. On Twitter this afternoon \u2013 Twitter being a platform that has attempted to censor or censure Trump\u2019s outbursts, and has in return felt the full blast of Trumpian invective and executive orders of dubious utility \u2013 Trump went there on the subject of what he deems to be legitimate protest. \u201cI am a big fan of Drew Brees,\u201d he said of the New Orleans Saints star who waded into huge controversy this week by saying he did not agree with NFL protests against police brutality during the pre-game anthem. \u201cI think he\u2019s truly one of the greatest quarterbacks,\u201d Trump continued, \u201cbut he should not have taken back his original stance on honoring our magnificent American Flag. OLD GLORY is to be revered, cherished, and flown high. We should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart. There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag \u2013 NO KNEELING!\u201d Two things. One, protesting, even burning the US flag is a right protected by the US constitution. And two, if Trump says kneeling in front of the flag is not OK, pictorial evidence suggests he thinks groping it is perfectly OK. Which, of course, it is. Like Trump\u2019s regular love-ins with the Stars and Stripes at CPAC and other events, his outrage today is purely performative politics. That\u2019s it from me today. My colleagues, Martin Pengelly and Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump\u2019s comment that this is a \u201cgreat day\u201d for George Floyd sparked outrage. Trump made the comment during a nearly hour-long event in the Rose Garden this afternoon, which mainly consisted of him boasting about the new jobs report. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said the remark, which came less than two weeks after Floyd was killed while in police custody, was \u201cdespicable.\u201d The US unemployment rate surprisingly dropped to 13.3% in May, according to the jobs report released this morning. The news was a welcome surprise, considering economists had predicted the rate could climb to as high as 20%, but the figure is still far from the 3.5% unemployment rate recorded in February. Minneapolis agreed to ban the use of police chokeholds in response to the killing of Floyd. The Minneapolis city council approved an agreement today with the state\u2019s department of human rights, which also requires officers to intervene anytime they seen an unauthorized use of force. The DC mayor renamed the section of 16th Street in front of the White House \u201cBlack Lives Matter Plaza,\u201d as tensions escalate between the administration and the DC government. Mayor Muriel Bowser has also asked Trump to remove all \u201cextraordinary\u201d law enforcement officers who were sent to the city in response to the Floyd protests, and the president responded by calling Bowser \u201cincompetent.\u201d The entire Buffalo police department\u2019s emergency response team has reportedly resigned from the team after two colleagues were suspended without pay for pushing a 75-year-old man who was protesting the killing of Floyd. The 57 officers will still by employed by BPD but will no longer serve on the emergency response team. The elderly protester has been hospitalized and is said to be in stable condition. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports from California: California governor Gavin Newsom is calling on law enforcement to end the use of a certain kind of chokehold that can block the flow of blood to the brain, after George Floyd was killed while in police custody. Newsom announced the news in an afternoon press conference at the California Museum in Sacramento, where he signed a law last year that specified police can use lethal force \u201conly when necessary in defense of human life\u201d. Newsom said he would immediately direct the use of carotid hold be removed from the state police training programs, a practice that 15 law enforcement agencies in San Diego County banned earlier this week. The carotid hold \u201chas no place any longer in 21st century practices and policing,\u201d Newsom said. The entire Buffalo police department\u2019s emergency response team has resigned from the team in response to the suspensions of two colleagues, according to a local reporter. The 57 officers will still be employed by BDP, but they will no longer work on the emergency response team. The news comes after two officers were suspended without pay for shoving a 75-year-old man who was protesting the police killing of George Floyd. The elderly man had to be hospitalized but is said to be in stable condition. Buffalor mayor Byron Brown said he was aware of the resignations, adding that \u201ccontingency plans are in place to maintain police services and ensure public safety within our community.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Kari Paul reports from California: Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian resigned from his board position at the social media company on Friday in an effort to \u201ccurb racial hate,\u201d urging his colleagues to fill his seat with a black candidate. Ohanian, who is married to tennis star Serena Williams, said in a blog post he was making the move as \u201ca father who needs to be able to answer his black daughter when she asks: \u2018What did you do?\u2019\u201d \u201cI believe resignation can actually be an act of leadership from people in power right now,\u201d he said. \u201cTo everyone fighting to fix our broken nation: do not stop.\u201d The executive and investor also pledged any future gains on his Reddit stocks to \u201cserve the black community\u201d and donated $1m to football player and activist Colin Kaepernick\u2019s Know Your Rights camp, which aims to \u201cadvance the liberation and well-being of Black and Brown communities.\u201d Ohanian\u2019s resignation is the latest example of a tech executive taking a public stand against racism and police violence. On Wednesday, Twitter chief executive officer Jack Dorsey also donated to Kaepernick\u2019s non-profit. Google will donate $12m in funding to organizations working to address racial inequalities, chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said on Wednesday. Reddit has been criticized for its role in stoking hatred and harassment in the past. On Tuesday, former CEO Ellen Pao accused the site of \u201camplifying\u201d racism and hate. DC may see its largest protest yet tomorrow, with secretary of the army Ryan McCarthy saying as many as 200,000 people may participate in the city\u2019s demonstrations to protest the police killing of George Floyd. The DC police department has announced that a number of streets will be closed tomorrow to allow the protesters to march. DC police chief Peter Newsham said during a briefing yesterday, \u201cWe have a lot of public, open-source information to suggest that the event on this upcoming Saturday may be one of the largest that we\u2019ve had in the city.\u201d He added, \u201cWe expect that Saturday\u2019s demonstration will, like I said, be more of the same peaceful demonstrators coming to exercise their First Amendment right in Washington, DC.\u201d Ohio\u2019s governor said an Ohio national guard member was removed from a mission in DC for expressing white supremacist ideology online. Republican governor Mike DeWine said the FBI had uncovered information on the member\u2019s online activity prior to the assignment to DC, where thousands of national guard troops have been sent in response to the city\u2019s George Floyd protests. \u201cWhile I fully support everyone\u2019s right to free speech, guardsmen and women are sworn to protect all of us, regardless of race, ethnic background or religion,\u201d DeWine said. \u201cAnyone who displays a malice toward specific groups of Americans has no place in the Ohio national guard.\u201d DeWine said it was \u201chighly likely\u201d the person would be permanently removed from the guard once the FBI concludes its investigation. The governor noted Ohio sent 100 of its national guard members to DC to help respond to the protests, although local officials have complained of federal overreach as several states have sent national guard troops to the nation\u2019s capital. Trump has ordered the removal of thousands of US troops from Germany by September, according to reports. The Wall Street Journal reports: The move would reduce the U.S. troop presence in Germany by 9,500 troops from the 34,500 troops that are permanently assigned there. The move also caps the number of U.S. service members who are in Germany at any one time at a total of 25,000 troops, including permanently assigned and rotational or temporary forces. Under current practice, overall troop levels can rise to as high as 52,000 as units rotate in and out or take part in training exercises. The change was ordered by the White House in a memorandum signed recently by White House National Security Advisor Robert O\u2019Brien, the officials said Friday. The news comes one week after German chancellor Angela Merkel said she would not attend the G7 summit planned for June out of concern about coronavirus, but a White House official told the Journal that the decision on a troop reduction was unrelatd to Merkel\u2019s announcement. A day after Merkel said she would not attend, Trump announced he was delaying the G7 summit until September and planned to extend invitations to several other countries, including Russia, which sparked intense criticism. The US park police acknowledged it was a \u201cmistake\u201d to say no tear gas was used on protesters near the White House on Monday, an incident that sparked international criticism of the federal government. The US park police had confirmed in a statement earlier this week that officers deployed pepper balls against the peaceful protesters, but the agency claimed that weapon was not considered tear gas. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines tear gas as \u201cchemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin,\u201d including pepper spray. In an interview with Vox, US park police spokesperson Sgt. Eduardo Delgado said, \u201cThe point is we admitted to using what we used.\u201d Delgado continued, \u201cI think the term \u2018tear gas\u2019 doesn\u2019t even matter anymore. It was a mistake on our part for using \u2018tear gas\u2019 because we just assumed people would think CS or CN,\u201d referring to two common forms of tear gas. DC mayor Muriel Bowser responded to Trump calling her \u201cincompetent\u201d by criticizing the president\u2019s response to the George Floyd protests. \u201cYou know the thing about the pot and the kettle?\u201d Bowser said of Trump\u2019s tweet, during a press conference on the coronavirus crisis. The Democratic mayor added, \u201cWe all have to just refocus on what\u2019s in front of us, and that is that our nation is hurting. It\u2019s in need of healing and leadership at all levels, all the way from the top to mayors like me, to all of us, to focus on how we bring people together.\u201d Trump is lashing out against the mayor of DC, after Muriel Bowser sent a letter to the president requesting that all additional law enforcement officials brought to the city in response to the George Floyd protests be removed. In a tweet, Trump described Bowser as \u201cincompetent\u201d and said the National Guard troops sent to DC had \u201csaved her from great embarrassment.\u201d The president ominously concluded, \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t treat these men and women well, then we\u2019ll bring in a different group of men and women!\u201d The tweet seemed to indicate Trump was considering sending active-duty troops to the city, even though defense secretary Mark Esper has reportedly ordered home several hundred troops from the 82nd Airborne Division who were brought to the capital region in case they needed to support local law enforcement. Hallie Golden reports for the Guardian from Seattle: The mayor of Tacoma, Washington, is calling for the police officers involved in the death of an African American man in March to be fired and prosecuted after cellphone footage surfaced of him being beaten while lying on the ground. Mayor Victoria Woodards said the video made her even more \u201cangered and disappointed\u201d about the death of Manuel Ellis, 33, who died in police custody of respiratory arrest on 3 March after calling out \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d She instructed the Pierce County Sheriff to reviewall of the actions taken by the officers on the scene. \u201cThe officers who committed this crime should be fired and prosecuted to the full extent of the law,\u201d said Woodards. The video, captured by a woman whose name has not been released, appears to show two officers repeatedly punching a man lying on the ground. The woman can be heard screaming from her car, \u201cStop. Oh my god, stop hitting him. Just arrest him.\u201d The death of Ellis, a musician and father of two, has been ruled a homicide and is being investigated by the Pierce county sheriff\u2019s department. The county medical examiner\u2019s officer reported that he died due to hypoxia and physical restraint. Other factors that may have contributed to his death included methamphetamine intoxication and heart disease. The four officers involved were placed on administrative leave following the arrest. The Tacoma Police Department said in a statement that they were then returned to full duty once it was determined \u201cthere were no known departmental violations.\u201d Earlier this week they were placed again on administrative leave. Ed Troyer, the Pierce county sheriff\u2019s spokesman, told the Guardian that the Tacoma police officers had noticed Ellis banging on car windows. When he came up to their car asking for help and saying there were warrants out for his arrest, an officer got out of the car. Ellis grabbed him by his vest and threw him to the ground, according to Troyer. The second officer then came out of the car and wrestled him into handcuffs. Troyer said he was lying on the ground when he started saying he couldn\u2019t breathe. The officers turned him onto his side and called for medical units. The White House Correspondents\u2019 Association released a scathing statement about Trump\u2019s press conference this morning, where the president took no questions from reporters. WHCA president Jonathan Karl, an ABC News reporter, noted that the White House set up reporters\u2019 chairs in a way that violated guidelines on physical distancing. \u201cThe chairs were initially positioned in a way that was consistent with social distancing guidelines but were moved closer together by White House staff shortly before the event started,\u201d Karl said in the statement. \u201cWhen we asked for an explanation, the White House press office told us the decision to move the chairs close together was made because \u2018It looks better.\u2019\u201d Karl concluded, \u201cThe health of the press corps should not be put in jeopardy because the White House wants reporters to be a prop for a \u2018news conference\u2019 where the president refused to answer any questions.\u201d Trump boasted about the Rose Garden set-up during his remarks, saying to reporters, \u201cEven you, I notice you\u2019re starting to get much closer together, looks much better, not all the way there yet, but you\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d The president did not note that White House officials had made the decision on the set-up. Minneapolis officials have agreed to ban the use of police chokeholds and require officers to intervene anytime they see an unauthorized use of force in reaction to the killing of George Floyd. The AP reports: The moves are part of a stipulation between the city and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, which launched a civil rights investigation this week in response to the death of George Floyd in police custody. The City Council is expected to approve the agreement Friday. The agreement, which will be enforceable in court, would require any officer, regardless of tenure or rank, to immediately report the use of any neck restraint or choke hold from the scene to their commander or their commander\u2019s superiors. Similarly, any officer who sees another officer commit any unauthorized use of force, including any choke hold or neck restraint, must try to intervene verbally and even physically. If they don\u2019t, they\u2019d be subject to discipline as severe as if they themselves had used the prohibited force. The agreement also requires authorization from the police chief or a designated deputy chief to use crowd control weapons, including chemical agents, rubber bullets, flash-bangs, batons, and marking rounds. And it requires more timely decisions on disciplining officers. The announcement of the agreement comes a week and a half after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was caught on camera putting his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes. Chauvin has since been charged with second-degree murder, and three other former officers have been charged with aiding and abetting the murder. Joe Biden said he was \u201ctruly glad to see that two and a half million Americans have gotten their jobs back,\u201d as reflected in this morning\u2019s jobs report. However, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee chastized Trump for taking a victory lap after the unemployment rate fell slightly to a still-high 13.3%. \u201cI was disturbed, however, to see the president crowing this morning, basically hanging a \u2018Mission Accomplished\u2019 banner out there, where there\u2019s so much more work to be done,\u201d Biden said. The former vice president noted that more than 20 million Americans are still out of work. \u201cFor an enormous swath of this country, their dreams are still on hold, and they\u2019re still struggling to put food on the table,\u201d Biden said. Joe Biden argued Trump deserved no credit for this morning\u2019s jobs report, which showed unemployment had dropped slightly to 13.3% from 14.7% a month earlier. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said Trump had still failed to reckon with how his response to the coronavirus pandemic had hampered the country\u2019s economy. \u201cHe has no idea the depth of the pain that so many people are still enduring. He remains completely oblivious to the human toll of his indifference,\u201d the former vice president said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for him to step out of his own bunker, take a look around the consequences of his words and his actions.\u201d Biden continued, \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: a president who takes no responsibility for costing millions and millions of American their jobs deserves no credit when a fraction of them return.\u201d Joe Biden has reacted to the president\u2019s comment this morning that this was a \u201cgreat day\u201d for George Floyd, who was killed while in police custody last week. \u201cGeorge Floyd\u2019s last words, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t breathe,\u2019 have echoed all across this nation and quite frankly around the world,\u201d Biden said while delivering remarkson the jobs report in Dover, Delaware. \u201cFor the president to try to put any other words in the mouth of George Floyd, I frankly think is despicable.\u201d The presumptive Democratic nominee noted Trump made the comment on the same day that the jobs report showed black unemployment rose last month, even though overall unemployment fell. Biden said Trump\u2019s decision to make the Floyd comment following that disheartening news \u201ctells you everything you need to know about this man.\u201d The US has been downgraded from a \u201cmedium risk\u201d to a \u201chigh risk\u201d country in a civil unrest index by the global risk analysis company Verik Maplecroft. As nationwide protests continue over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the firm finds that the \u201cmarginalisation of racial and religious minorities\u201d is the single biggest driver of the unrest \u201cbecause of the profound impact on the living standards of entire communities.\u201d The conditions mean that direct acts of violence to express discontent \u201cappeal to a broad range of community members.\u201d The unrest is expected to grow -- it has a 64.9% chance of getting worse by early next year, the analysis said. The report said the US government has \u201cfailed to eradicate the impunity with which the police act or address the lack of accountability for its actions.\u201d \u201cFor instance, Officer Derek Chauvin, charged with the murder of Floyd, had 18 prior complaints made against him.\u201d The company had identified Minnesota as the highest-risk state in the US even before Floyd\u2019s killing, by assessing the risk of violations by police and military. This is only the second time the US has dropped into the \u201chigh risk\u201d category. The first was when Trump was elected and took office in 2017. \u201cThe ongoing protests reveal the high degree of political polarisation, particularly around social issues like race and gender discrimination, and structural socio-economic inequalities that have become evident once more under the Trump administration,\u201d the report said. The US now ranks 78th among highest=risk nations, having fallen 13 places since the last quarterly report. \u201cEroding freedom of speech and judicial independence\u201d could stoke more protests that hamper social distancing and slow the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, the company said. Military deployments will worsen the public perception that the government is seeking to restrict freedom of expression. Covid cases are already expected to continue to rise in central and southern states in the coming weeks, where some of the most intense protests are happening, according to Verisk Maplecroft\u2019s sister company AIR. The findings follow a similar warning from the International Crisis Group, an international security thinktank based in Brussels. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump sparked outrage by saying this was a \u201cgreat day\u201d for George Floyd, who was killed in police custody last week. During a White House event where the president boasted about the country\u2019s job gains and downplayed the protests continuing across the country, Trump said, \u201cHopefully George is looking down right now and saying, \u2018This is a great thing that\u2019s happening for our country.\u2019 This is a great day for him. It\u2019s a great day for everbody.\u201d The US unemployment rate surprisingly dropped to 13.3% in May, according to the latest jobs report released this morning. The news was a welcome surprise, considering economists had predicted the rate could climb to as high as 20%, but the figure is still far from the 3.5% unemployment rate recorded in February. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser renamed the section of 16th Street in front of the White House \u201cBlack Lives Matter Plaza.\u201d The announcement came as tensions escalate between the White House and the DC government after Trump sent thousands of additional law enforcement officers to patrol the city\u2019s streets in response to the Floyd protests. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Two-thirds of Americans think Trump has increased racial tensions in the country, a new poll found as protests over the killing of George Floyd continue across the US. According to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, 67% of Americans say Trump has mostly increased racial tensions. That number includes 92% of Democrats, 73% of independents and 29% of Republicans. In comparison, 18% of Americans said the president has decreased racial tensions, including 41% of Republicans. Another 30% of Republicans said they weren\u2019t sure. Lee Miringoff, the director of the institute that conducted the poll, said of the numbers, \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual to see Republicans break when the name Trump is presented, but that is the case here.\u201d The DC chapter of Black Lives Matter is unimpressed with Muriel Bowser after the mayor painted a \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d message on 16th Street near the White House. The BLM chapter described the painted message as a \u201cperformative distraction from real policy changes,\u201d calling on Bowser to defund the police. Trump has retweeted a clip that his camapign shared of the president saying this was a \u201cgreat day\u201d for George Floyd, who died last week after a police officer put his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes. Trump said during his Rose Garden event this morning, \u201cEqual justice under the law must mean every American receives equal treatment in every encounter with law enforcement regardless of race, color, gender or creed. They have to receive fair treatment from law enforcement.\u201d The president then appeared to veer from his prepared remarks, saying, \u201cWe all saw what happened last week. We can\u2019t let that happen. Hopefully George is looking down right now and saying, \u2018This is a great thing that\u2019s happening for our country.\u2019 This is a great day for him. It\u2019s a great day for everbody. This is a great day for everybody. This a great, great day in terms of equality.\u201d Trump then swerved back into talking about the economy, boasting about the coronavirus relief packages he has signed into law. The president\u2019s comments about Floyd came less than two weeks after the unarmed black man was killed in police custody and just one day after Floyd\u2019s family held a memorial service for him in Minneapolis. Reactions continue to pour in after Trump said this was a \u201cgreat day\u201d for George Floyd, who was killed in police custody last week. From Democratic senator Mark Warner: From a former Democratic senator: From a Democratic strategist: From the research director for the watchdog group CREW: DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has just announced that the section of 16th Street NW in front of the White House has been renamed \u201cBlack Lives Matter Plaza.\u201d A crowd cheered as a city employee installed a sign reading \u201cBlack Lives Matter Plz\u201d on a street light. The announcement comes as Bowser has sought to assert the city\u2019s autonomy amid the George Floyd protests, despite Trump\u2019s decision to send thousands of additional law enforcment officers to patrol DC. Bowser sent a letter to Trump today asking him to remove the additional forces from the city, although defense secretary Mark Esper reversed a decision to do just that earlier this week. Trump has just concluded his nearly hour-long \u201cpress conference\u201d at the White House without taking any questions from the reporters there. This is the second consecutive time that the president has called a \u201cpress conference\u201d only to make a statement, which reporters argued defied the definition of a press conference. Instead, the president spent the hour making celebratory and seemingly unscripted remarks about the jobs report and the George Floyd protests that have continued across the country. As the president left the event, reporters shouted questions about Trump\u2019s comment that this was a \u201cgreat day\u201d for Floyd, who was killed in police custody last week, but he ignored them. Trump\u2019s comment moments ago about this being a \u201cgreat day\u201d for George Floyd is already sparking outrage among the president\u2019s critics. \u201cHopefully, George is looking down right now and saying, \u2018This is a great thing happening for our country,\u2019\u201d Trump said of Floyd, who was killed in police custody last week. \u201cA great day for him, a great day for everybody. This is a great day for everybody.\u201d The liberal organization CAP Action said the president\u2019s comment was \u201cdespicable\u201d: Trump wrapped up his prepared remarks (which seemed largely improvised) and signed legislation related to the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses. Reporters shouted questions at him as he signed the bill, but the president only responded by continuing to brag about this morning\u2019s jobs report. One reporter asked how the economic growth could have helped George Floyd, after the president said this was a \u201cgreat day\u201d for Floyd, who was killed in police custody last week. Another reporter, Yamiche Alcindor of PBS NewsHour, asked Trump to comment on how unemployment actually rose among African Americans and Asian Americans. Trump responded by dismissively waving his hand and telling Alcindor, \u201cYou are something.\u201d Trump just said hospitality and leisure gained 1.2m jobs last month - that\u2019s true. Those jobs accounted for most of this months surprise gains, But hospitality and leisure lost 8.4m jobs in the previous two months. While it\u2019s true the reopening has brought people back to work, the unemployment rate at 13.3% is still at heights unseen since the worst days of the 1980s. As Trump celebrates the country\u2019s job gains and downplays the ongiong George Floyd protests, the street near the White House has been painted with the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d DC mayor Muriel Bowser said she had signed off on painting the message near the White House to emphasize the street belonged to the city after Trump sent thousands of additional law enforcement officials to the nation\u2019s capital in response to the protests. Trump is apparently using his press conference to declare both the coronavirus crisis and the George Floyd protests to be over. \u201cHopefully, George is looking down right now and saying, \u2018This is a great thing happening for our country,\u201d Trump said of Floyd, who was killed in police custody last week. \u201cA great day for him, a great day for everybody. This is great day for everybody.\u201d However, protests against police brutality are continuing across the country, and Democrats have called for a number of policy changes, including a national ban on chokeholds, that have not been enacted. In terms of the coronavirus crisis, this morning\u2019s jobs report showed unemployment had dropped to 13.3%, so the US economy still needs to recover much more before reaching pre-pandemic levels. Here\u2019s video of Trump\u2019s mention of Floyd: Trump appears to have abandoned his prepared remarks, assuming he had any to begin with. The president has celebrated the jobs report, while mocking his critics. Trump described those who have criticized his response to the coronavirus pandemic as his \u201cenemies,\u201d and he characterized the policy goals of the Green New Deal as \u201cbaby talk.\u201d The president also enocuraged governors to allow him to send National Guard troops amid the George Floyd protests, saying he would send troops \u201cso fast it\u2019ll make their heads spin.\u201d Trump predicted this morning\u2019s jobs report would be a sign of sustained economic growth, insisting unemployment would continue to fall. \u201cThis is better than a V,\u201d Trump said of the shape of the country\u2019s recovery curve. \u201cThis is a rocket ship.\u201d The president also describe the drop in unemployment as \u201ca tremendous tribute to equality,\u201d even though black unemployment actually rose slightly last month while white unemployment fell. Trump claimed the country was \u201clargely through\u201d the coronavirus pandemic as states start the process of reopening their economies. However, public health experts have warned that the country could see a second wave of infections later this year, which could require another round of social distancing. The president has consistently downplayed the possibility of a second wave. Trump has started his White House press conference, and the president opened the event by quickly veering from the jobs numbers to the George Floyd protests then back to the jobs numbers. The president called this morning\u2019s jobs report, which showed unemployment had dropped last month but remained high at 13.3%, an \u201caffirmation of all the work we\u2019ve been doing. Trump then said that, before the coronavirus pandemic, the US had the \u201cgreatest economy in the history of the world,\u201d although that oft-repeated claim is not accurate. The president called on states that have been more slowly reopening to ramp up that process, saying the states that reopened quickly have been \u201cdoing tremendous business.\u201d However, the president unexpectedly shifted from the jobs numbers to the protests, bragging about the progress seen in Minneapolis this week after demonstrations last week turned violent. Trump\u2019s press conference is running behind schedule, but the president may be asked about the DC mayor\u2019s request this morning to remove all additional federal law enforcement officers from the city. In a letter to the president, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said she was ending the city\u2019s state of emergency in connection to the George Floyd protests, noting the demonstrations have been peaceful in recent days and no arrests were made yesterday. Bowser insisted the city is \u201cwell equipped to handle large demonstrations,\u201d and she said having additional federal law enforcement officers in Washington (some of whom have not worn identifying insignia in the past few days) would only intensify tensions. Despite the mayor\u2019s request, Trump may not easily agree to the removal of the forces from DC, considering governors across the country have not agreed with his suggestion to send active-duty troops to states that have seen George Floyd protests. This is Joan Greve, taking over for Joanna Walters. Trump is expected to hold a press conference at any moment, where he will likely tout the unexpected drop in the unemployment rate that was announced this morning. However, many reporters\u2019 questions will almost certainly focus on the George Floyd protests that have played out across the country in recent days and the president\u2019s less-than-flattering words about the demonstrators. Stay tuned. Markets are taking off after the latest US jobs figures were upbeat, the opposite of what was expected from the figures for the last month. Donald Trump will take to a podium at the White House in a few minutes after rejoicing via Twitter. His briefing is due at 10am ET. He\u2019s been running incredibly late for briefings recently, so stay tuned. It\u2019s a piece of good news for the president, who has been battered in the polls of late over his response to the major crises rocking the country. Nationwide protests continue, demanding and end to systemic racism in society, but specifically in policing, after the death of George Floyd. The latest debate on reforms needed is only just getting started. And the coronavirus pandemic, which cratered the economy, is far from under control. Experts worry that protesters, who are often not social distancing or wearing masks properly, are at fresh risk of catching Covid, which has already disproportionately battered communities of color across the US. Ailing congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis has spoken out all week, however, to say he is optimistic that this really could be a turning point towards greater fairness in US policing. \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d is currently being painted in huge lettering on one of the roads very near the White House. Apparently with the nod from the Washington authorities. Short film: Police in Paris have banned an anti-racism demonstration in front of the US Embassy in the French capital tomorrow, citing the risk of social disorder and health dangers amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. But protests in solidarity with the strong wave of action across the US amid anger and grief at the killing of yet another black man by police are scheduled to take place this weekend in Britain, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Hungary, Brazil, South Korea, Australia and more. Demonstrations have taken place this past week in those countries and Mexico, Liberia, Canada, Italy, Norway, Greece and many other places. The protests in US cities large and small, coast to coast and north to south, have been massive and mostly peaceful, despite bouts of violent unrest and some aggressive policing tactics - and would have been, or would be, much, much larger if people were not still bound by caution over catching Covid-19. We have all the details and reactions to the latest US jobs numbers in our Guardian business blog, here. Donald Trump is not just pleased, he is ecstatic. And: The dire numbers expected in the latest jobs report this morning did not happen - at all. Covid-19\u2019s devastating assault on the US economy waned in May as the unemployment rate dipped to 13.3% and the US added another 2.5m jobs. The latest tally follows the loss of 20m jobs in April when unemployment hit 14.7%. In February the unemployment rate was just 3.5%. A decade\u2019s worth of gains made in the labor market since the last recession have been erased in just three months. All 50 states have now begun easing quarantine restrictions and the pace of this unprecedented hollowing has now slowed as some have returned to work but uncertainties remain, my business colleague Dominic Rushe reports. The president has taken to Twitter and in about an hour will take to a podium at the White House. Jim Mattis lit into Trump this week and has accrued both condemnation (and withering, personal counterpoint by the president, albeit containing untruths) and support from many quarters. As my colleague Julian Borger noted: Mattis, Donald Trump\u2019s first defense secretary, accused him of abusing executive authority in his response to the anti-racism protests that have convulsed cities across the US, and called for the president to be held accountable. Mattis\u2019s broadside broke a near silence from the ex-marine general since he resigned in December 2018. He expressed outrage at the militarisation of the administration\u2019s response to mass protests over the police killing of George Floyd. \u201cI have watched this week\u2019s unfolding events, angry and appalled,\u201d he said. His statement, published by the Atlantic magazine, came on a day of confusion and discord in the Trump administration over the role of the military. Mattis\u2019s successor as defence secretary, Mark Esper, had contradicted Trump over the president\u2019s threatened invocation of the 1807 Insurrection Act to deploy active duty troops on US streets. Esper had ordered elite airborne troops, flown to the Washington outskirts on Monday, back to their bases on Wednesday, but then reversed that order hours later after a visit to the White House. Joanna Walters here in New York, taking over from my colleagues in London, it was another busy night and there\u2019s a full-on day ahead in US political news. The president has tweeted a copy of a letter that appears to have been written by one of his former attorneys, John Dowd, to former defense secretary Jim Mattis, after Mattis heavily criticized Trump on Wednesday for dividing America. The tweet shows the text of the letter, which supports the violent clearing earlier in the week of the small Lafayette park area between the White House and St John\u2019s church nearby, where protesters were gathered, so that Trump could hold a photo op outside the so-called \u201cChurch of the Presidents\u201d. The letter says: \u201cThe phony protesters in Lafayette park were not peaceful and are not real. They are terrorists using idle hate-filled students to burn and destroy.\u201d It warns Mattis: \u201cThis is the new nihilism\u201d. Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon and Scotland\u2019s chief constable, Iain Livingstone, have urged Black Lives Matter supporters to avoid taking part in large public protests in Scotland this weekend because of the risk of transmitting the coronavirus. Livingstone said during the Scottish government\u2019s daily press briefing he recognised people were \u201cshocked and distressed\u201d by the death of George Floyd. \u201cI understand the desire of people to make their voices heard,\u201d he added. But attending the mass rallies planned in various cities in Scotland would be dangerous, he said. Police were liaising with the event organisers to urge them to avoid breaching Scotland\u2019s strict lockdown and social-distancing rules, which prohibits gatherings of more than eight people and requires those groups to stay at least two metres apart. \u2018Because the threat of coronavirus is still with us, people shouldn\u2019t attend mass gatherings which pose a very clear risk to public health,\u201d Livingstone said. \u201cit is essential everyone sticks to the rules\u201d. The first minister said protestors should heed the appeal from prominent BAME politicians on Thursday, including Hamza Yousaf, the Scottish justice secretary, and Anas Sarwar, a senior Scottish Labour MSP, to find different ways to protest. More racism trouble for the Republican party on the horizon, as the Texas Tribune has been reporting overnight that a fourth Republican leader had shared racist posts on Facebook in the last few days, some of which also floated conspiracy theories. Governor Greg Abbott has called for two of them to resign. It is reported that the Republican chairs in Bexar and Nueces counties shared on social media a conspiracy theory that Floyd\u2019s death was a \u201cstaged event\u201d. Another Republican leader had shared an image of a Dr. Martin Luther King Jr quote juxtaposed with a banana. A statement by Republican chairman-elect in Harris County, Keith Nielsen fell short of an apology, saying \u201cIt is unfortunate that the sentiment of the quote and my admiration for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. has been overshadowed by people\u2019s misinterpretation of an image.\u201d Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, the eldest son of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, posted on Twitter late last night to say that the party should not tolerate racism of any kind. Tom Perkins has been out for us in St Clair Shores, Michigan. It\u2019s a largely white middle-class suburb about 17 miles north-east of downtown Detroit. And while the centre of Detroit has erupted in emotional protests and thousands of protesters have marched nightly through the city\u2019s streets demanding justice, the view in St Clair Shores is very different. Many in St Clair Shores share the president\u2019s world view that the police and national guard are heroically battling violent agitators, not brutally suppressing largely peaceful protesters. Several men who were part of a construction crew called the protests \u201cstupid\u201d and a \u201cwaste of time and energy\u201d. Some even suggested Floyd was at fault for his death because he allegedly committed a crime, despite general worldwide outrage at the brutal manner of his killing and the criminal charges it has now brought against the officers involved. You can read more of the report here: Detroit\u2019s largely peaceful protests seen very differently from white suburb Just a heads up on what we are expecting politics-wise today. As mentioned in the intro, Donald Trump will be visiting Maine today - his first visit to the state since becoming president. He will be attending roundtable on supporting commercial fishermen and signing a proclamation in Bangor at 2pm. He then goes on to tour Puritan Medical Products in Guilford at 3:30pm. It is a facility that makes swabs to test for coronavirus, and it is receiving significant sums from the government to ramp up production. We are expecting Trump to talk around 4pm, and to return to the freshly fenced-in White House at around 7.30pm. Joe Biden is sort of on the campaign trail - there is still an election on - and we are expecting him to talk about the economy and the new jobless figures around noon in Dover, Delaware. Those jobless figures will be out this morning. There\u2019s also some interest in John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff, who\u2019ll be taking part in a discussion chaired by notoriously short-serving White House director of communications Anthony Scaramucci at the SALT talks. The George Floyd protests take place against the backdrop of the ever-worsening numbers of coronavirus outbreak in the US. The Johns Hopkins University currently puts the figures at more than 1.8m cases in the US, with over 108,000 fatalities. Bloomberg have a fascinating piece this morning asking one very crucial question: Whatever happened to the coronavirus task-force? The task force is now reduced to weekly closed-door meetings with Vice President Mike Pence. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the government, hasn\u2019t spoken publicly at the White House since 29 April. In his last task force news conference, a week earlier, he cautioned that the country must \u201cproceed in a very careful, measured way\u201d to reopen. Similarly, task force coordinator Deborah Birx no longer appears in public as frequently as she did. Her voice is mostly mediated through being quoted by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. It\u2019s an interesting read by Josh Wingrove about the current state of play: Fauci, Virus Task Force Sidelined With Trump All-In on Reopening The way the Minneapolis Police force reacts to the death of George Floyd is going to place huge scrutiny on Medaria Arrandondo, the chief of police. He\u2019s the first African American to hold the role in the city. But if you think that might make it easier to reform the force responsible for the death of Floyd, you might need to think again. My colleague Chris McGreal has been in Minneapolis, looking at one of the other key figures in local policing - Bob Kroll, leader of the Minneapolis police union. Kroll wrote to his members this week describing Floyd as a \u201cviolent criminal\u201d, because he did prison time, in an apparent attempt to imply Chauvin\u2019s treatment of the unarmed man being arrested on suspicion of a non-violent minor crime was legitimate. The union chief also described those protesting over Floyd\u2019s death as terrorists, and the dismissal of Chauvin and three other officers facing charges as depriving them of their rights. You can read McGreal\u2019s full and worrying report here: Hopeful that Minneapolis policing will change? Meet the police union\u2019s chief ... There\u2019s been an ongoing row about whether a Black Lives Matter protest would be allowed to take place in Sydney, Australia at the weekend, which has been resolved in a last-ditch court case - and the protest remains banned because of coronavirus fears. My Australian office colleague Elias Visontay has been following the case in the New South Wales Supreme Court where Justice Desmond Fagan ultimately assessed there would be a public safety risk in allowing the protest to go ahead, likening it to a \u201cdefiance\u201d of decisions made by ministers and the expert health advice those decisions were based on. Justice Fagan said he did not accept the argument of lawyers representing the protest organisers that people would attend the rally regardless of the legal decision, and that in that case, it would be safest for the public to have the cooperation of police to close of streets and allow for greater space for social distancing. He labelled the argument \u201cfutile\u201d. Justice Fagan also acknowledged the right to protest and the importance of the Black Lives Matter protest in drawing attention to the treatment of Indigenous Australians at the hands of police, but reasoned that many Australians had had to forfeit rights during the pandemic, including to attend church and forfeiting their livelihoods. Organisers had previously indicated they and supporters would attend the protest regardless of the legal decision, and it has been noted that last week in Sydney some 3,000 people gathered to join a protest based on conspiracy theories over 5G and police took no action. Amnesty International UK had called for the protest to be allowed, saying that \u201cPeaceful protest is a fundamental human right, and the New South Wales police should work with organisers to ensure that attendees can social distance, and protests can be carried out in a safe manner. Police must also commit to not fine anyone inadvertently breaking a COVID-19 guideline.\u201d This story is going to run and run. Yesterday was the tenth day of protests following the killing of George Floyd, and it was marked by the solemn occasion of a memorial service in Minneapolis for the 46 year old. We\u2019ll be bringing you ongoing coverage of the protest movement and today\u2019s politics. Here are the key points so far: Civil rights groups are to sue Trump over the assault on peaceful protesters near White House Twitter has disabled a Trump campaign video tribute to George Floyd, they say due to copyright complaint. It will no doubt add to tensions between the president and the social media platform Police officers in Buffalo have been suspended for pushing a 75-year-old to the ground during the protests The New York Times has dropped its initial defence of a \u2018Send in the troops\u2019 article and now says Tom Cotton\u2019s opinion piece did not meet editorial standards Ukrainian prosecutors find no evidence against Hunter Biden Donald Trump is travelling rural Maine today, where he will be visiting a factory making swabs used in coronavirus testing. He might also mention Hydroxychloroquine along the way, the controversial drug at the heart of the scandal of the Lancet withdrawing a study saying it was dangerous to Covid-19 patients. And Trump might get a frosty reception - even the Republican senator for the state, Susan Collins, has been critical of Trump\u2019s handling of the Floyd protests. On the economic front, we are also expecting more grim US jobless figures to be announced later this morning.

Campaigners had warned that hundreds of thousands of tenants in the private and social sectors faced court action from the end of this month because they had gone into rent arrears after losing work or shielding during the coronavirus pandemic. The government\u2019s original eviction moratorium, announced in March, was due to end on 25 June, at which point landlords would have been able to continue or institute legal proceedings to remove tenants. The government said it was working with the judiciary to draw up new legal guidance which would ensure the courts were \u201cbetter able to address the need for appropriate protection of all parties, including those shielding from coronavirus\u201d. The extension \u2013 which will take the moratorium to five months in total \u2013 means eviction proceedings will in effect not be able to start up before 1 September. The government said it wanted court to be a last resort; it wanted landlords to \u201cexhaust all possible options\u201d, such as agreeing flexible rent payment plans with tenants, to minimise the likelihood of eviction proceedings. The housing charity Shelter said the extension merely delayed the eviction problem until the end of August, and that the government should act quickly to change the law to prevent a \u201ctidal wave of homelessness after the end of August\u201d.

Even if they have a plan to pay them back, these debts will throw struggling renters straight back into the firing line of an automatic eviction as soon as the ban does lift.\u201d Amina Gichinga, of the London Renters Union, said: \u201cUnless it takes action to cancel the debt that hundreds of thousands of renters are in because of the coronavirus pandemic, today\u2019s announcement simply kicks the can down the road. \u201cWe are still heading for a chaotic rent debt and eviction crisis this summer unless the government cancels rent debt and makes the eviction ban permanent.\u201d Dame Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the pause was a welcome breathing space, but added: \u201cSimply extending the pause of repossession is a sticking plaster not a cure. People who have fallen behind on rent arrears and those who have been furloughed or lost their jobs will need the security of proper reform to the rules governing evictions.\u201d Dan Wilson-Craw of the campaign group Generation Rent said: \u201cThe government must use the time it has bought itself to develop a long term solution to provide rent relief and end unfair evictions for good.\u201d Campaigners are sceptical that many landlords will voluntarily agree to rent renegotiations with tenants in arrears. Some surveys show approximately half of tenants who asked their landlord for a rent holiday in recent weeks have been refused. There are about 8 million renters in the UK, of whom 4.5 million have private landlords, with the remainder renting from social landlords such as councils and housing associations. This article was amended on 6 June 2020 to make clear that the story refers to England and Wales, not the whole of the UK.",

      "body": "<h2>Chris McGreal, Guardian US reporter, in Minneapolis</h2> <p>This has been by far the most serious unrest I\u2019ve covered in the US.&nbsp;<br>I was in Ferguson six years ago where the protests looked more dramatic on the television than they actually were, with a few buildings looted and burned, and confrontations with the police a staged nightly ritual over the same few blocks.&nbsp;<br>Minneapolis was on a different scale, both in the depth of anger and the levels of protest and destruction. Many thousands turned out to lay siege to the police station in the precinct where George Floyd was killed before they stormed and burned it. Many thousands more marched in different parts of Minneapolis and St Paul before the protests spread across the country.&nbsp;<br><br>For two nights in a row, the police evaporated \u2013 leaving a huge area around about three miles of a main shopping thoroughfare, Lake Street, under the control of protesters, looters and arsonists. Hundreds of businesses had their windows smashed, were looted, or were burned.&nbsp;<br><br>The scale of the demonstrations and destruction reflected the scale of the anger.&nbsp;<br>That seemed to me in part because of the video of George Floyd\u2019s death was so clear-cut and painful. It\u2019s telling that so few people have tried to justify the former police officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes as the life drains out of him, unlike the many who spoke up in support of the officer who shot Michael Brown in Ferguson.&nbsp;<br><br>But that video also added to a sense of the frustration at yet another killing of an African American man by the police, and that so little seems to change even with the rise of Black Lives Matter. The way that Chauvin looks into the phone cameras, knowing he is being filmed, and kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck regardless of his pleas and cries for his mother seemed to symbolise the contempt of the police for the movement.&nbsp;<br><br>As a result, the more peaceful demonstrations drew people who do not normally protest. I even met a few Republicans who were horrified by what they saw on the video and thought the time had come to stand up.<br><br>Through all of this, social distancing broke down completely. Riots in different times usually meant protesters tied bandanas or T-shirts around their faces to shield their identities. In 2020 everyone had a mask readily to hand.

      "bodyText": "Chris McGreal, Guardian US reporter, in Minneapolis This has been by far the most serious unrest I\u2019ve covered in the US. I was in Ferguson six years ago where the protests looked more dramatic on the television than they actually were, with a few buildings looted and burned, and confrontations with the police a staged nightly ritual over the same few blocks. Minneapolis was on a different scale, both in the depth of anger and the levels of protest and destruction. Many thousands turned out to lay siege to the police station in the precinct where George Floyd was killed before they stormed and burned it. Many thousands more marched in different parts of Minneapolis and St Paul before the protests spread across the country. For two nights in a row, the police evaporated \u2013 leaving a huge area around about three miles of a main shopping thoroughfare, Lake Street, under the control of protesters, looters and arsonists. Hundreds of businesses had their windows smashed, were looted, or were burned. The scale of the demonstrations and destruction reflected the scale of the anger. That seemed to me in part because of the video of George Floyd\u2019s death was so clear-cut and painful. It\u2019s telling that so few people have tried to justify the former police officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes as the life drains out of him, unlike the many who spoke up in support of the officer who shot Michael Brown in Ferguson. But that video also added to a sense of the frustration at yet another killing of an African American man by the police, and that so little seems to change even with the rise of Black Lives Matter. The way that Chauvin looks into the phone cameras, knowing he is being filmed, and kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck regardless of his pleas and cries for his mother seemed to symbolise the contempt of the police for the movement. As a result, the more peaceful demonstrations drew people who do not normally protest. I even met a few Republicans who were horrified by what they saw on the video and thought the time had come to stand up. Through all of this, social distancing broke down completely. Riots in different times usually meant protesters tied bandanas or T-shirts around their faces to shield their identities. In 2020 everyone had a mask readily to hand. There were times when it looked as if the local medical school was charging the police accompanied by particularly fashionable rioters in designer masks. In a sign of our times, reporters found themselves not only hit with baton rounds and teargas by the police when it was clear they were shooting at journalists, but facing physical threats from some among the protesters. These tended to be young men, both white and black, who see the media as part of the conspiracy. And if you look like me (ageing, no hair), there\u2019s the occasional person who imagines you are a police spy and lets you know with varying degrees of hostility. Although this was pretty easily dealt with the moment they heard my accent. Aamna Mohdin, Guardian reporter, in London The killing of George Floyd took place thousands of miles from the UK, but the anger and pain that sparked mass protests in the US has resonated deeply across the Atlantic. Last weekend, protests sprung up sporadically in Cardiff, London, Manchester, and Nottingham to state clearly that \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d in the UK as well. The protesters, the vast majority of whom were under 30, chanted: \u201cNo justice, no peace, no racist police\u201d and \u201cthe UK is not innocent\u201d, in a demonstration that was largely organised through word of mouth and social media away from established anti-racism groups. Teenagers, who said they had grown up with videos of black people dying on their timelines, shouted: \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d They carried hundreds of handmade signs and called out the names of those in the UK that have died at the hands of the police, including Mark Duggan. Though coronavirus is invisible, the disproportionate impact the pandemic has had on the black and minority ethnic community in the UK was another source of anger and frustration among demonstrators. Julian Borger, world affairs editor, in Washington DC There were different currents inside the crowds outside the White House. The great majority were there for a protest, but there were small groups weaving in and out looking break and burn things. As long as they were in the body of the crowd, they were mostly contained, shouted down when they threw water bottles at the police. The discipline only really collapsed when the police started to break up the protest, with short charges, flash-bang grenades and gas canisters. There is some doubt about what kind of gas it was. The police deny using CS (tear gas) but canisters of OC gas (Oleoresins Capiscum) were found at the scene, and that has very similar effects - a burning sensation in the eyes and throat. When the crowd scattered things really fell apart. One group started to smash the entrance to the AFL-CIO union federation headquarters, while a handful tried to talk them out of it, but the vandals carried the day. They set light to one car and ran along I Street, a thoroughfare running through the commercial centre, with baseball bats, smashing every car they came to.

Even leaders seen as having managed Covid-19 the most successfully, such as Germany\u2019s chancellor Angela Merkel and Denmark\u2019s prime minister Mette Frederiksen, have suffered slight dips in popular satisfaction as the weeks have worn on. Others, such as the French president Emmanuel Macron, have seen more significant, potentially worrying declines, but have since recovered. Compared with Britain, no other European government in YouGov\u2019s Covid-19 perception tracker has seen public trust plunge by 30 points. As the coronavirus crisis gathered pace in Europe three months ago, the personal approval ratings of the continent\u2019s leaders, including Boris Johnson, surged under the common effect in times of crisis familiar to political scientists as \u201crally round the flag\u201d. As much of continental Europe endured strict lockdowns from mid-March onwards, YouGov\u2019s rolling perception poll \u2013 which monitors the percentage of people who think their government is handling the crisis \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d well \u2013 showed parallel levels of public satisfaction.

      "body": "<p>When Jessica Harrington was named Ireland\u2019s sportswoman of the year in 2017, a couple of months before her 71st birthday, she listed three ambitions for her training career that remained unfulfilled: a Classic winner on the Flat, a winner at Royal Ascot and a Grand National triumph at Aintree. Within six months, she had crossed off one and two, and while the National continues to elude her, Harrington\u2019s mare <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/06/tiger-roll-emulates-red-rum-back-to-back-grand-national-aintree-horse-racing\" title=\"\">Magic Of Light finished second to Tiger Roll</a> in 2019 and was one of the favourites for this year\u2019s race before it was abandoned due to the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n<p>It is just the way things have been going for Harrington over the past few years: one fresh achievement after another, at a point in her career, and in life, when many might be considering easing down a little. Instead, and in the space of three or four seasons, she has turned her yard in Moone in County Kildare into the most successful dual-purpose stable in the game.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/06/kameko-shocks-pinatubo-2000-guineas-derby-favourite-horse-racing\">Kameko shocks Pinatubo in 2,000 Guineas to become Derby favourite</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Since March 2017, Harrington has won the Cheltenham Gold Cup with Sizing John, her first runner in the race, and the Irish Grand National with Our Duke. She has also saddled half a dozen Group One winners on the Flat and could record another landmark achievement on Sunday afternoon when Millisle, last year\u2019s Cheveley Park Stakes winner, will start at around 5-1 to give Harrington a first English Classic success in the 1,000 Guineas.</p> \n<p>The sudden ascent of Harrington\u2019s yard to challenge, and beat, the most successful Flat operations in the business was not, she says, the result of careful planning. \u201cNothing\u2019s a conscious decision with me,\u201d Harrington says. \u201cI just train what\u2019s put in front of me and it\u2019s always been like that. I\u2019ve just been lucky that I\u2019ve been sent some very nice horses. I\u2019ve always had a few Flat horses and I had Pathfork [a Group One winning juvenile in 2010], which was great, but I just didn\u2019t have top-class Flat horses, which can happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>The suspension of racing in Britain and Ireland from March means Harrington is working entirely on instinct as she prepares for a delayed start to a 2020 campaign that has the potential to be her best yet on the Flat. Millisle and Albigna, who will start favourite for the Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh next weekend, were Group One winners at two, while Harrington also trains an Oaks contender in Cayenne Pepper, an unlucky fourth behind Quadrilateral, the 1,000 Guineas favourite, in last season\u2019s Fillies\u2019 Mile.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe [Millisle] has done very well and we\u2019re very happy with her, but we\u2019ve got no yardstick on what form the yard is in or anything because I haven\u2019t had a runner since the end of March,\u201d Harrington says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things, you\u2019re taking a stab in the unknown and hoping the yard is in form. She\u2019s by [the sprinter] Starspangledbanner but she\u2019s got stamina on the dam\u2019s side, she\u2019s got Group One form on the track and she\u2019s a very relaxed horse in her races, so that will help her as well.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe worst thing was not knowing when we were going to start. There were rumours we\u2019d be back on the 18th of May or the 28th, and it kept getting pushed back, so you\u2019d think, I\u2019d better give these a bit of work this week, just in case we\u2019re coming back.

Concerns about censorship mounted this week after third-party submissions, which reportedly highlighted structural racism and social inequality, were left out of the government-commissioned report on the disproportionate effects of Covid-19 on BAME people. People of Bangladeshi heritage in England are twice as likely to die if they contract the virus than white people, while other BAME groups face an increased risk of up to 50%, the Public Health England (PHE) report found, after claims it was due to be delayed because of fears it could stoke racial tensions. On Saturday the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, demanded the report be published in full. \u201cWe know BAME people are more likely to die from Covid and more likely to fall seriously ill with Covid,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cThis report needs to be published in full. \u201cCovering up vital recommendations is completely unacceptable.

      "bodyText": "Michael Rosen, the writer, poet and broadcaster who spent 47 days in intensive care with coronavirus has taken his first steps since beginning his recovery. Rosen, 74, the author of children\u2019s books including We\u2019re Going on a Bear Hunt and Little Rabbit Foo Foo, charted the initial stages of his illness on Twitter before he deteriorated at the height of the pandemic. His wife, Emma-Louise Williams, confirmed that the former children\u2019s laureate had had Covid-19 and that he was gradually recuperating at Whittington hospital in north London. \u201cVery pleased to say Michael is recovering steadily in a rehabilitation hospital,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cHe has been making really good progress this week and has been able to take his first steps today thanks to the great NHS physios who are keeping him busy!\u201d Rosen was keeping off social media to rest his body and mind while he deals with the physical and psychological trauma of his extended stay in hospital, she said. In response to a letter from a 12-year-old wellwisher thanking Rosen for his poem These Are the Hands in which he celebrates the work of nurses and doctors, Williams tweeted: The author Philip Pullman tweeted his delighted at the news of Rosen\u2019s progress. Rosen was admitted to hospital in the week of 23 March and spend his first night in intensive care on 29 March, before being placed on a ward. He returned to intensive care in early April. He described his illness on 22 March: \u201cCan\u2019t stop my thermostat from crashing: icy hands, hot head. Freezing cold sweats. Under the covers for bed-breaking shakes. Image of war hero biting on a hankie, while best mate plunges live charcoal into the wound to cauterise it.\u201d The next day he wondered whether he was suffering from heavy flu rather than coronavirus. \u201cHave had no chest pains. No persistent cough. So all along it could have been a heavy flu and not corona. Today the fevers are ebbing. In their place a deep muscle exhaustion. In every corner.\u201d His updates then became sporadic and were posted by Williams soon after. On 20 April she wrote: \u201cThanks v much for all the love. I\u2019m not updating regularly because when someone is very poorly things can change daily &amp; details of Michael\u2019s ongoing care from fantastic NHS staff are private. So please be patient, no news is good news.\u201d After more than a fortnight without updates about his health, Williams tweeted on her own account on 23 May: \u201cToday Michael has been in hospital for 8 weeks &amp; I\u2019m v happy to say he left ICU yesterday after a long &amp; difficult 47 days. His recovery is continuing on the ward &amp; will take time. He has done so well to get through this but please don\u2019t expect him back here yet.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Trafficked and unaccompanied children are going missing in \u201csignificant\u201d numbers from the UK\u2019s care system following a government move to dramatically reduce protection for youngsters, the Observer can reveal. Three charities have documented an \u201calarming\u201d series of cases since the beginning of lockdown and following legislation introduced in April that stripped most legal safeguards for vulnerable children during the coronavirus pandemic. In one case, a teenage victim of human slavery appears to have been \u201cretrafficked\u201d back into the hands of criminals. Another 16-year-old vanished from care in London last month after their support package during lockdown was reduced. Evidence has also emerged that younger children are being targeted by criminals with one 15-year-old in foster care among those approached by \u201cgroups of men\u201d and asked to deliver packages in exchange for small sums of money. Campaigners say concern over underfunded children\u2019s services has escalated after the government introduced statutory instrument 445 on 23 April without parliamentary debate or public consultation. The move removed or weakened 65 vital legal protections for youngsters in care, leaving already vulnerable children at risk of becoming destitute and exploited or retrafficked. Even before the new legislation, trafficked and unaccompanied children were 30 times more likely to go missing than other children their age. It remains too early to calculate how many trafficked children or child refugees have already gone missing, but charities believe the numbers could be sizeable. Previous research by Ecpat (Every Child Protected Against Trafficking) UK, which campaigns to end child exploitation, reveals that one in six unaccompanied or trafficked children goes missing from care. Last year 3,651 unaccompanied children made applications for asylum with 4,550 children identified by UK authorities as potential victims of trafficking. Patricia Durr, chief executive of Ecpat UK, said: \u201cThe young people we\u2019ve identified have only come to light because charities like ours are plugging gaps in support and contact and could be just the tip of the iceberg. \u201cThis has taken place against a backdrop of government underfunding of local authority children\u2019s services, lack of mandatory training on child trafficking for professionals and changes to children\u2019s social care regulations during the pandemic.\u201d A spokesperson for the the Department for Education said the government\u2019s intervention was \u201cabout safeguarding and protecting the welfare of vulnerable children\u201d during the pandemic. They added: \u201cIt is especially important that these children continue to receive the services and support they need, although the way in which this is delivered may need to change and adapt to reflect the current circumstances.\u201d Eleanor Brown, managing director of Caras, which supports south London asylum seekers, said: \u201cWe have seen a notable increase in the number of young people who have gone missing or experienced homelessness as a result of the lack of contact they have had with statutory services. We are seeing some alarming outcomes.\u201d One case involves an unaccompanied child who arrived in the UK 12 months ago but whose face-to-face support was ended following the government\u2019s new legislation. The 17-year-old has been missing from care for more than a month. \u201cHe is not accessing payments from social care, leading to serious concerns about how he is surviving. He is not in touch with any statutory or support services,\u201d said Brown. Another, a 16-year-old, went missing at the end of last month after not receiving any visits from his social worker and becoming unhappy in foster care. When informed there were no alternatives available, the teenager disappeared to stay with \u201cunknown friends\u201d. Another case involves a 20-year-old Albanian victim of trafficking whose weekly allowance was stopped shortly before lockdown and after surviving with no money to live on for three weeks disappeared. \u201cAny young person going missing from care is deeply troubling, but his history of trafficking coupled with the lack of basic means and reduced interaction of the local authority heightens the urgency of our concerns,\u201d said Shpresa, a charity working with the Albanian community. Esme Madil, from the Migrant and Refugee Children\u2019s Legal Unit (MiCLU) which works with Shpresa, said: \u201cProtecting children and young people should be a statutory duty. A child\u2019s sanity and very survival should not depend on whether they are lucky enough to come toour attention.\u2019 One Albanian teenager, now 19 but who was trafficked into the UK aged 15, said he was struggling to with no support and just \u00a345 a week to live on.

Administrators of both universities, which are affiliated, said Saturday\u2019s graduation for the technical university would be \u201crefocused\u201d on students, with a nursing graduate as the only speaker</p> <p>The move clearly angered Ivanka Trump, who is a top adviser in the White House and whose husband, Jared Kushner, is one of the most influential figures in the Trump administration.</p> <p>She responded in a tweet, saying: \u201cOur nation\u2019s campuses should be bastions of free speech.

      "bodyText": "Ivanka Trump has hit out at \u201ccancel culture and viewpoint discrimination\u201d after plans for her to give a virtual commencement speech to students in Kansas were canceled amid criticism of Donald Trump\u2019s response to anti-police brutality protests in the wake of the killing of George Floyd. Administrators at Wichita State University and WSU Tech announced their decision just hours after they had said the US president\u2019s daughter would be speaking to WSU Tech graduates. Administrators of both universities, which are affiliated, said Saturday\u2019s graduation for the technical university would be \u201crefocused\u201d on students, with a nursing graduate as the only speaker The move clearly angered Ivanka Trump, who is a top adviser in the White House and whose husband, Jared Kushner, is one of the most influential figures in the Trump administration. She responded in a tweet, saying: \u201cOur nation\u2019s campuses should be bastions of free speech. Cancel culture and viewpoint discrimination are antithetical to academia. Listening to one another is important now more than ever!\u201d She also released the video of the speech, in which she did not mention the Floyd protests but did acknowledge the challenges of graduating amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has cratered the US economy. Seeking to reassure students now facing mass unemployment triggered by widespread shutdowns to curb the virus, the daughter of a New York real estate billionaire opined: \u201cIn my own life, I have found that my greatest personal growth has arisen from times of discomfort and uncertainty.\u201d The announcement of her speech drew immediate criticism, led by Jennifer Ray, an associate professor of photo media at Wichita State, who sent a letter asking school administrators to cancel it. It circulated on social media and garnered 488 signatures from faculty, students and alumni before the speech was canceled, the Wichita Eagle reported. But others said the event should not have been canceled. Republican congressman Ron Estes said in a statement he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d and added: \u201cAs Kansas faces many challenges recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic to get back to our booming economy, now is the time for us to be working together.\u201d Protests have broken out around the world since Floyd, who was black, died in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Much of the response to the protests by American police has been brutal and acts of violence against demonstrators and media have been common. Trump has refashioned his election campaign as a \u201claw and order\u201d president but came in for widespread condemnation after police attacked a peaceful protest in Washington in order to clear a path to have a photo op at a church, where he held aloft a Bible. Ivanka Trump was part of the procession that made its way to the church and reportedly carried the Bible that her father used in her purse.",

The officers were executing a no-knock search warrant and broke down a door to get in; Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, says he didn\u2019t hear officers announce themselves and thought it was a home invasion. Walker, a licensed gun owner, responded by shooting an officer in the leg; they fired more than 20 rounds in return and Taylor was hit at least eight times.</p> <p>Taylor would have turned 27 on Friday.

For a while, it looked like pop\u2019s high priestess of serious silliness was being sucked into the Slough of Authenticity \u2013 first with her supposedly stripped-back, country-inspired 2016 album <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/23/lady-gaga-joanne-album-review-a-yo-million-reasons\">Joanne</a></em> (in truth, about as stripped back as Universal Studios is when compared with Disney World), then with her garlanded turn in <em>A Star Is Born</em> and its painfully earnest soundtrack album.&nbsp;</p> <p>Being real is a look every artist has to try on at least once, but it was never going to become Gaga\u2019s signature style. <em>Chromatica</em>, her sixth album, brings back the spectacle, manifesting a parallel reality she\u2019s had one foot in since childhood, centred on colour, kindness and connection. \u201cEarth is cancelled,\u201d she declared. \u201cI live on Chromatica.\u201d Coronavirus temporarily put a halt to the world-building begun in the <em>Star Trek</em>-flavoured video for lead single Stupid Love, forcing her to delay the album (she curated the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/20/one-world-together-at-home-concert-lady-gaga-raises-127m-coronavirus-relief\">One World: Together </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/20/one-world-together-at-home-concert-lady-gaga-raises-127m-coronavirus-relief\">at Home</a> concerts in the meantime) and leaving her summer tour up in the air. The songs, though, are more than vivid enough to conjure Planet Chromatica by themselves: Gaga\u2019s always tended to overstuff her records, but the hit rate on these 16 tracks is her highest since the gothic techno cabaret of 2011\u2019s <em>Born This Way</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Where that album was all glossy black, blood red and chrome, <em>Chromatica</em> is rainbow-bright, its colours lovingly painted with US producer BloodPop and a <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/listen-to-lady-gagas-new-album-chromatica/\">host of bit players</a>. The opening track, Alice, takes her down a new rabbit hole, recalling the best of 90s chart house \u2013 Ken Doh\u2019s Nakasaki, Ultra Nat\u00e9\u2019s Free \u2013 as she promises: \u201cI\u2019ll keep looking, keep looking for Wonderland.\u201d In the past, she\u2019s generally gravitated more towards techno, beats rigid and clunking; her surrender to the exhilarating, erotic pulse of funky and handbag house feels like a delicious release. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAm4om0wTs\">Rain on Me</a> exults in radiant piano stabs, her throaty roar and Ariana Grande\u2019s airy flourishes bouncing off each other beautifully, while Plastic Doll takes the classic pop conceit of woman-as-mannequin to new heights, with a paradigm of a chorus that recalls the roots of world-conquering 00s pop in Swedish clubland. The rush only wears a tiny bit thin on 1,000 Doves, Enigma and Replay, which are fine but no more, and Sour Candy, a bubbling collaboration with Korean group Blackpink which, though probably the most modern sound here, seems a little too anodyne for Gaga.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Chromatica</em>\u2019s burst of light is set off all the more vividly by a darker backdrop. Gaga has spoken about how making the album helped her begin to deal with the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8iNYY7YV04\">post-traumatic stress disorder</a> that resulted from being raped repeatedly at 19, and also with the dissociative, objectifying double-edged sword of celebrity (\u201cyour monsters torture me\u201d, she wails on Replay \u2013 hard not to read that as an allusion to her most fervent fans, the Little Monsters, much as she undoubtedly loves them). Meanwhile, 911, a tribute to her antipsychotic medication, conjures the claustrophobia of compulsive thoughts with a more familiar technoid throb and a nervy robotic vocal: \u201cTurning up emotional faders/Keep repeating self-hating phrases.\u201d The beat jackhammers, driving her up to a Donna Summer trill, then slows to a more comfortable groove as she regains perspective and control: \u201cmy biggest enemy is me, pop a 911\u201d.&nbsp;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAm4om0wTs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AoAm4om0wTs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/AoAm4om0wTs\">Watch the video for Lady Gaga\u2019s Rain on Me</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><em>Chromatica</em>\u2019s frank grappling with the vagaries of Gaga\u2019s brain \u2013 and the way fame exacerbates them \u2013 ends up feeling much more real than touring dive bars with a guitar and a Stetson ever did.

Sure, it might be a rollercoaster ride, they conceded, but the republic would pull through. Well, if my transatlantic email is anything to go by, some of that cheery confidence seems to have evaporated.</p> <p>The thing that keeps my friends going, though, is the fact that Trump, despite his frantic, violent flailings, and despite his apparently rock-solid hold on a third of the electorate, is <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html#!\">trailing Joe Biden in the polls</a>. So, the thinking goes, if we all hold our nerve, the nightmare will end on 20 January 2021, when Trump has to hand over power to his victorious opponent.</p> <p>At which point my mind goes back to this time in 2016, when similar sentiments were the conventional wisdom about the chances of Trump defeating Hillary Clinton. And one of the most agonising questions in the aftermath of that election was: how could <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nate-silver/\">Nate Silver and co</a> have got it so wrong?</p> <p>The answer is simple: nobody, including opinion pollsters, knew about the Trump campaign\u2019s astonishing <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/11/facebook-won-trump-election-not-just-fake-news/\">mastery of social media</a>, especially Facebook.

Trump knows that if things continue as they are \u2013 with no party conventions or mass rallies and if the election is held in November (a sizable \u201cif\u201d IMHO) \u2013 then Biden will win. The only thing that could change that is \u2013 you guessed it! \u2013 Facebook.</p> <p>This thought is now informing everything he does.

And, as a warning shot, it worked a treat.

We should remember that this idea of framing everything in terms of the economy is a new thing in human history. The pandemic has shown us the economy is a very narrow and limited way of organising life and deciding who is important and who is not important. If I could change one thing, it would be to get out of the system of production and instead build a political ecology.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Has the pandemic response made you more or less optimistic about humanity\u2019s ability to tackle the climate and nature crisis?<br></strong>The bad guys are better organised and clearer in knowing what they want. The war we are engaged in is a difficult one. It is not that we are powerless; it is that many of us don\u2019t know how to react. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We cannot endlessly extract resources and discard our waste. In the critical zone, we must maintain what we have</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>In your latest <a href=\"https://zkm.de/en/exhibition/2020/05/critical-zones\">art collaboration</a> at </strong><strong>ZKM Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany</strong><strong>, you define the scope of human existence as the \u201ccritical zone\u201d, a narrow band of Earth that can support life. What is the purpose of this approach?<br></strong>It is a redefinition of our landscape. The idea of the \u201ccritical zone\u201d is useful because it gets you out of nature. Nature is very big. It covers everything from the big bang to microbes. Conceptually, that makes it a complete mess. The critical zone is limited. It is just a few kilometres thick \u2013 above and below the surface of the Earth. But all discovered life is within it. This brings us inside in a way that nature does not. It is very different from the way of thinking that makes people such as Elon Musk think they should go on a mission to Mars. That is escapist. But when you think in terms of a critical zone, you are locked in, you cannot escape. What does it mean for politics if we are locked in and not in the infinite cosmology opened by Galileo? It means we cannot behave in the same way. It means we cannot just endlessly extract resources and discard our waste. In the critical zone, we must maintain what we have because it is finite, it\u2019s local, it\u2019s at risk and it\u2019s the object of conflict.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>This seems to add a political edge to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/27/james-lovelock-gaia\">James Lovelock\u2019s Gaia </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/27/james-lovelock-gaia\">hypothesis</a>, which explains how \u201cLife\u201d acts to maintain habitable conditions for itself. You have long been a champion of this theory\u2026<br></strong>Lovelock locked us in! While Galileo used a telescope to reveal that the Earth is part of an infinite universe, Lovelock used his electron capture detector to reveal that the Earth is completely different from any other planet because it has life. He and [Lynn] Margulis spotted Gaia. Lovelock from space, taking the question as globally as possible; Margulis from bacteria, taking the question from the other end, both realising that Life, capital L, has managed to engineer its own conditions of existence. For me that is the greatest discovery of this period, though it is still not very much accepted by mainstream science. This may be because we do not yet have the tools to receive it.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Why do you think scientists are still wary?<br></strong>That such an important concept is still so marginal in the history of science is extraordinary. I have done everything I can to make it accepted. But scientists are reflexively cautious. The cosmological shift from Aristotle to Galileo is the same as that from Galileo to Gaia. With Galileo, our understanding moved outwards to an infinite universe. Grasping that took a century and a half and faced resistance. Gaia is not just one more concept. It is not just about physics and energy. It is Life.</p> <p><strong>Your work has often challenged the </strong><strong>objective, </strong><strong>God\u2019s-eye view of science. You argue convincingly that humanity cannot be so detached. But the political right have twisted this approach to undermine all expert knowledge on the climate and nature crises. Any regrets?<br></strong>A critique of how science is produced is very different from the post-truth argument that there are alternative truths that you can choose from. Post-truth is a defensive posture. If you have to defend yourself against climate change, economic change, coronavirus change, then you grab at any alternative. If those alternatives are fed to you by thousands of fake news farms in Siberia, they are hard to resist, especially if they look vaguely empirical. If you have enough of them and they are contradictory enough, they allow you to stick to your old beliefs. But this should not be confused with rational scepticism. </p> <p><strong>Has the Covid-19 crisis affected our belief in science?<br></strong>The virus has revealed the number of things you need to know to decide what is factual and what\u2019s not. The public are learning a great deal about the difficulty of statistics, about experiment, about epidemiology. In everyday life, people are talking about degrees of confidence and margin of error. I think that\u2019s good. If you want people to have some grasp of science, you must show how it is produced.&nbsp;</p>",

Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said trusts were not consulted or given notice on government plans for all hospital visitors and outpatients in England to be required to wear face coverings from 15 June and all hospital staff to need to wear surgical masks. Schools in parts of the north-west of England are being \u2018strongly advised\u2019 not to reopen amid fears the R value is above 1 in the region. Both Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, and the Liverpool city region metro mayor, Steve Rotheram, have questioned whether lockdown relaxation was being lifted too soon, driven from London, with the regions and the north not being listened to. Sunday trading laws could be suspended for a year in a bid to stimulate the economy post-lockdown. Unions said the move was \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d and \u201cmisguided\u201d as it would disrupt the lives of retail workers by increasing workloads and pressure from working longer hours. The plans could also see cafes and pubs given fast-tracked approval to serve food and drink outside. The UK death toll rose by 204 to 40,465. That\u2019s it from us on the UK side. If you would like to continue following the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. Thousands of people have joined rallies across the country in solidarity with protests in the US demanding justice for George Floyd and an end to systemic racism. From London to Sheffield, Glasgow to Cardiff, Leicester to Manchester, protesters have donned face coverings and gloves and ignored the home and health secretaries\u2019 warnings not to attend large gatherings over virus fears. Here are some more images from the movement. \u201cThis is not an American issue. It\u2019s a worldwide issue,\u201d said a protester at the Black Lives Matter demonstration in London. Another 204 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus as of 5pm on Friday, the Department of Health and Social Care said. This takes the DHSC death toll to 40,465 but does not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which is thought to have passed 50,000. The DHSC said that as of 9am on Saturday there had been 5,438,712 tests, including 218,187 tests on 5 June, of which 1,557 were positive. The department said a total of 284,868 people had tested positive. The figure for the number of people tested has been \u201ctemporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting\u201d across all methods of testing. NHS England has confirmed a further 75 people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 27,359. The number of deaths of patients with Covid-19 by region are as follows: East of England 6 London 5 Midlands 15 North East &amp; Yorkshire 19 North West 17 South East 12 South West 1 Total: 75 Any effort to relax Sunday trading laws have been condemned as \u201cmisguided\u201d and \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d to key workers by union leaders. Any change would ignore the childcare challenges that many shop workers face while also stopping them from having a much-needed break on Sundays during the highly-pressurised coronavirus crisis, they said. In contrast, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) argues that \u201cbusinesses need to be given every possible opportunity to start to generate sales again\u201d. Paddy Lillis, general secretary of Usdaw (Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers), said: The last thing the retail industry needs is longer trading hours, there is no economic case for this and it will put extra pressure on the retail workers who have worked so hard throughout this crisis. His comments come after reports of government plans to suspend Sunday trading laws for a year to try and stimulate the economy amid the coronavirus crisis. Larger supermarkets could open for more than six hours on Sundays while cafes and pubs would be given fast-track approval to serve food and drink outside, doing away with the need for the 28-day minimum statutory consultation period, according to the Times. Lillis said: Opening for longer will increase overheads but not necessarily take any more cash through the tills. The fact is that customers will not have more to spend just because the shops are open for longer. Our members in retail are working long hours, in difficult circumstances and under a great deal of pressure, they need a break. It isn\u2019t too much to ask for a shorter day on Sundays. Deregulating trading hours will put more pressure on shop workers to work longer and cause further problems with finding childcare. Unite national officer Bev Clarkson said that retail workers, who have played a key frontline role in keeping the UK fed and supplied during lockdown, are \u201cexhausted and deserve to spend time with their families\u201d. The government must understand that many retail workers have to work around childcare and by extending Sunday opening hours it will create additional stress and make it impossible for many workers to juggle work and their caring duties. The Sunday Trading Act of 1994 allows large stores to open for no more than six consecutive hours between 10am and 6pm. The former prime minister David Cameron was forced to drop plans to extend Sunday trading hours in 2016 after suffering a humiliating Commons defeat which saw 27 Tories joining forces with opposition parties. The BCC director general, Adam Marshall, said: If there are rules that can be relaxed to give more companies a fighting chance to trade their way through this crisis without compromising safety, ministers should do everything in their power to make it happen. This is from the Guardian\u2019s Mattha Busby Hundreds of protesters have gathered in Parliament Square in Westminster for an anti-racism rally, which began at 1pm. A group of drummers is playing for the crowds, many of whom are carrying placards and dancing in time with the beat. Streams of demonstrators continue to cross Westminster Bridge to join the protest despite the rainy conditions. The majority of the demonstrators are wearing masks and face coverings, with some also opting for gloves. Placards carried by demonstrators reference the coronavirus crisis, with one that says: There is a virus greater than Covid-19 and it\u2019s called racism. Protesters were reminded to try and keep a 2-metre distance from others where possible and to be mindful of the pandemic. Last night the home secretary, Priti Patel, appealed to people: Of course, I completely understand people\u2019s desire to express their views and to have that right to protest. But the fact of the matter is we are in a health pandemic across the United Kingdom and coronavirus is a deadly virus. I\u2019d say to those that want to protest: please don\u2019t. The regulations are very clear in terms of gatherings and mass gatherings in particular. We must put public health first at this particular time. While lockdown is eased for shops and beaches from 15 June, zoos are struggling to stay afloat after being told they must remain closed \u201cindefinitely\u201d, Helen Pidd reports. This was despite the fact that zoo chiefs across the UK insist they are able to make their attractions, which are huge outdoor spaces, far more \u201cCovid-secure\u201d than non-essential shops. With revenue from visitors making up 97% of the Chester Zoo\u2019s income and running costs of \u00a31.6m a month, its chief operating officer says the long period of closure is having a \u201cdevastating impact\u201d and the zoo may never reopen its doors again. The Welsh Mountain zoo, Wales\u2019 national zoo, has also been \u201chaemorrhaging\u201d funds. It would have made at least \u00a3500,000 in the past two months, and that even with closed doors and staff furloughed, a zoo is a very expensive endeavour. It\u2019s director of operations and administration said: While we have cut expenditure, we cannot furlough our dedicated keepers. You cannot, basically, \u2018switch off\u2019 a zoo. More schools have shelved plans to reopen on Monday, after new data suggested coronavirus could still be spreading in the north-west of England. Health officials at Blackburn and Darwen council, which runs 85 schools in Lancashire, reportedly emailed local schools on Friday evening advising them not to reopen to more pupils on Monday morning. The same advice has been given by officials in Tameside, Greater Manchester (see 10.46am.). It comes after new data showed the reproductive rate, known as the R value, is higher than the crucial threshold of 1, in the north-west region. The R value refers to the average number of people that will contract coronavirus from an infected person. If it is 1 or higher, the virus will spread exponentially through the population, while a value less than 1 indicates the virus is in decline. A street market which has been operating for more than 600 years has reopened more than two months after closing in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Traders at the Saturday market in Lymington, Hampshire, last sold their wares on 21 March. Lymington and Pennington town council, which runs the market, gave them the go-ahead to set up stalls again on Saturday. Fewer stalls than usual were open, while customers were urged to stay apart when queuing and to sanitise their hands. The Duke of Cambridge has revealed that he secretly worked on a crisis helpline. The duke said he had been working as a volunteer supporting people contacting a crisis helpline developed by his Royal Foundation. William\u2019s work with Shout 85258 \u2013 a round-the-clock text messaging helpline \u2013 was announced to mark Volunteers Week. Last month, the duke and duchess marked the service\u2019s first anniversary by speaking to some of its volunteers via video call, and William said: \u201cI\u2019m going to share a little secret with you guys, but I\u2019m actually on the platform volunteering.\u201d His wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, has also taken part in \u201ccheck in and chat\u201d calls with those self-isolating or vulnerable as part of the Royal Voluntary Service\u2019s NHS Volunteer Responders scheme. The government is understood to be on track to meet its 6 June care home coronavirus test target, despite a survey finding some had not received testing kits. More than a tenth of homes surveyed by the National Care Forum (NCF), which represents 120 not-for-profit care organisations, reported they had not received testing kits at the start of the week, according to PA Media. However, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) believes it is on track to have offered testing to all care homes with residents over 65 in England by Saturday, it is understood. The DHSC is expected to announce whether it has hit its target in the coming days. A letter from the DHSC sent to care providers on Friday revealed plans to expand testing to all remaining adult care homes for those under the age of 65 from 7 June. Tests will be available to all residents and asymptomatic staff, the letter said, adding that 919,321 testing kits had so far been provided to care homes in England and that it is able to send out 50,000 test kits a day. \u201cWe expect these to be adult care homes catering for adults with learning disabilities or mental health issues, physical disabilities, acquired brain injuries and other categories for younger adults under 65 years,\u201d the letter said. Responding to the announcement of expanded care home testing, the Voluntary Organisations Disability Group (VODG) said it was concerned the government was \u201ccontinuing to overlook\u201d other parts of the sector, including those in supported living. Rhidian Hughes, VODG chief executive, said: We have serious concerns about the lack of parity in government\u2019s approach to testing. Government must protect all citizens and we are concerned that its current programme continues to overlook some types of support for disabled people and the staff and carers. Testing needs to be made available immediately for disabled people using care services whether living in their own home or supported living and whether symptomatic or not. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced his pledge for universal care home testing on 15 May, saying \u201cevery resident and every member of staff in our elderly care homes in England\u201d would be tested \u201cbetween now and early June\u201d. Hello, I\u2019m taking over briefly from my colleague Lucy Campbell. Please feel free to flag updates either via Twitter or via email. Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan police commissioner, has told officers not to take the knee as an act of solidarity during Black Lives Matter protests in the UK, for safety reasons, and advised people to protest without gathering in large groups because of the pandemic. \u201cWe encourage our officers to talk to people,\u201d Dick said during an interview on LBC, adding that a main function of the police was \u201cto engage in a positive manner with people\u201d. Dick said that although she understands the sentiment, \u201cwe won\u2019t be kneeling during protests\u201d in the UK. \u201cHowever heartfelt something like that might be, I don\u2019t think it is likely to be safe,\u201d she said. Dick said that she would ask people to share solidarity with Black Lives Matter \u201cin any other way than gathering on the streets\u201d. \u201cWe are fighting a deadly virus, it can get spread in gatherings,\u201d she added. The government should halve the 2-metre social distancing rule if businesses in the hospitality industry are to survive when they finally reopen, trade organisations have warned. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) and UK Hospitality fear that many venues such as pubs and restaurants will not be able to make enough money if the rule, which restricts customer numbers, stays in place. The BBPA chief executive, Emma McClarkin, said: It must be recognised that no two pubs are the same and for many, ensuring a distance of two metres will be impossible, keeping them closed for much longer. Actioning advice from the WHO for example to use one metre for social distancing from July would enable many more pubs to viably reopen and serve their communities again. The UK Hospitality chief executive, Kate Nicholls, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: At 2 metres you are receiving 30% of your normal revenues, at 1 metre it gets up to 70% - so it is the difference between success and failure for many of those businesses. They will need support if two-metre social distancing is in place. If that is what the science says and if that is what our public health needs, that is what we will maintain. We just need to have the additional government support to make that workable. Added support through grants, loans or VAT cuts may be needed, it has been suggested. Reopening of venues is expected to begin from 4 July in England and the government is soon expected to publish its guidelines on how pubs, restaurants and hotels can begin to welcome customers again. Shrinking the 2-metre social distance to a 1-metre limit would boost the number of the UK\u2019s 47,000 pubs that could safely reopen from one third to three quarters, according to the BBPA. This would enable more pub staff to return to work as the government\u2019s furlough scheme tapers off, reducing the risk of job losses. The sector has also had to dispose of the equivalent of 70 million pints of beer that had gone stale. The lockdown and good weather have seen the industry count its losses with the BBPA, which tracks sales of beer in pubs and shops, estimating that a total of 745 million pints could have been sold throughout April. The hot late May bank holiday weekend, when Brits may have typically flocked to their local pub beer garden to soak up the sun, could have boosted sales by up to 10 million pints. The FA Cup final alone, which was due to take place that weekend, would have contributed two million pints to the overall 10 million boost. The calls from the hospitality sector come amid reports that Sunday trading laws could be suspended for a year under government plans to stimulate the economy amid the coronavirus crisis. Downing Street is said to be drawing up legislation to enable larger supermarkets to open for more than six hours on Sundays, according to the Times (paywall). The paper also said cafes and pubs would be given fast-track approval to serve food and drink outside, doing away with the need for the 28-day minimum statutory consultation period. This is from the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford. He reports that the summer recess*, and possibly conference recess, could be cut back to make up for lost time in getting Brexit and coronavirus legislation through parliament before the end of the transition period (31 December). *It\u2019s worth noting that parliamentary recess is not a \u201choliday\u201d for MPs; they continue working for most of it back in their constituencies, particularly on casework. Schools are being \u201cstrongly advised\u201d not to admit more pupils after new data suggested coronavirus could still be spreading in the north-west of England. Headteachers in Tameside, east of Manchester, have been told to delay the wider reopening of schools beyond the children of key workers and vulnerablepupils, planned for Monday, \u201cuntil there is further assurance\u201d, the council\u2019s director of public health, Dr Jeanelle de Gruchy, said in a letter to schools. The north-west has the highest rate of Covid-19 infections in England according to Public Health England (PHE), and data has suggested the reproductive rate, known as the R value, is higher than 1 in the region, a crucial marker for public health. The R value refers to the average number of people that will contract coronavirus from an infected person. If it is 1 or higher, the virus will spread exponentially through the population, while a value less than 1 indicates the virus is in decline. Data from PHE released on Friday gave an R value of 1.01 for the north-west and 1.0 for the south-west, with all other regions below 1. Other local councils in the region are understood to be monitoring the situation with Tameside postponing the reopening of schools until 22 June. The government has suggested a strategy of \u201clocal lockdown\u201d measures being introduced to fight any flare-up of the virus in particular areas. But Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has questioned whether such measures are workable, calling them a \u201crecipe for chaos\u201d. Both he and the Liverpool city region metro mayor, Steve Rotheram, have questioned whether lockdown relaxation was being lifted too soon, driven from London, with the regions and the north not being listened to. Council bosses in Liverpool and Gateshead led a northern backlash against the government announcement last month advising schools to reopen for Years 1 and 6 from 1 June. Many councils have instead only partially reopened to pupils other than vulnerable children or those of key workers. The health secretary Matt Hancock, speaking at the Downing Street briefing on Friday, said experts on Sage believe the UK\u2019s overall R number is below 1, but added that local lockdowns would be used when outbreaks are spotted. He said the PHE data needed to be looked at \u201cin the round\u201d with other data. Hancock added: The discussion of the higher R in the north-west and the south-west that\u2019s estimated compared to the rest of the country is an important part of moving towards a more localised approach rather than a national approach to the lockdown. The home secretary, Priti Patel, tweeted last night that people should not attend protests this weekend as coronavirus remains \u201ca real threat\u201d as lockdown measures as eased. Her words echo those of Matt Hancock when he used the Downing Street news briefing to implore people to avoid large gatherings \u201cfor the safety of your loved ones\u201d. Protests have been organised across the UK for Saturday and Sunday, following a week of huge, impassioned demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in police custody in the US. Police have been on alert all week and so far have largely handled the protests with a light touch, knowing any missteps could trigger a stronger reaction, making no effort to police physical distancing rules as crowds crammed together in solidarity with Black Lives Matter. On Friday, Laurence Taylor, the deputy assistant commissioner at the Met, warned that this weekend\u2019s demonstrations would be unlawful unless protesters respected physical distancing, but it remains unclear what this will mean in practice. People attending anti-racism protests planned across the UK this weekend should be \u201cvery careful\u201d, wear face masks and observe social distancing rules, an infectious diseases expert has said. Prof John Edmunds, who attends meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) supporting the government, told Today: I can understand why people would want to protest but on the other hand I think people need to be careful - very careful. If you think about it, overall the infection rate in the community is about 1 in 600, 1 in 700 maybe, so in large groups of individuals you would expect there to be some individuals in a large group who would be infectious. He said people can transmit coronavirus before displaying symptoms, and added: Mask wearing would reduce the risk to some extent from individuals who may be infectious. It\u2019s a different tone to that of the health secretary, who urged the public on Friday to avoid large gatherings of more than six people, including protests, over the weekend \u201cfor the safety of your loved ones\u201d. Matt Hancock said he understood why people are appalled at the death of George Floyd but warned that coronavirus remains a \u201creal threat\u201d in the UK as lockdown easing measures come into effect. This is a really useful thread from Nick Stripe, the head of health analysis at the Office for National Statistics, on \u201cnon-Covid excess deaths\u201d. One tweet reads: The balance of evidence so far points to undiagnosed Covid-19 in the elderly being the most likely explanation for a majority of excess deaths that did not mention coronavirus on certificates. Stripe also highlights that the data shows very significant increases in deaths due to dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s and for deaths due to old age and frailty. He writes: Dementia increases are so sharp it\u2019s implausible that they are unrelated to Covid. I\u2019m grateful to Andrew on Twitter for flagging this to me. The government is under pressure to bring in tougher local lockdowns in some areas, as a new study showed the R value was rising across England and had tipped above 1 in the north-west for the first time since the peak of the pandemic. The model, from scientists at Public Health England and the University of Cambridge, puts the R value at 1.01 for the north-west and 1 for the south-west. The north-west \u2013 including Liverpool and Manchester \u2013 is viewed as particularly concerning due to higher numbers of infections there, which would be projected to continue at the current rate. Regional leaders said they feared the prospect of a second spike in deaths and that the decision to ease lockdown based on the national picture \u2013 ignoring regional hotspots \u2013 had been a mistake. Care home residents are being asked to pay a steep and unexpected \u201ccoronavirus bill\u201d on top of existing fees to help social care providers stay afloat, Amelia Hill reports. Some older people and their families who fund their own care home fees are being forced to pay more than \u00a3100 a week, on top of their usual care home fees, with homes saying the cost of PPE and staff absences could push their finances into the red, threatening their sustainability. \u201cOlder people living in care homes and their families have been through the mill these last few months,\u201d said Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK. It is adding insult to injury that after going through so much, some residents who pay for their own care are now facing a big extra bill \u2013 on top of already expensive fees. Abrahams said that central government should meet care homes\u2019 extra costs. \u201cOtherwise there\u2019s a risk that some homes could fold, leaving their residents homeless,\u201d she warned. Good morning. NHS trusts were not consulted or given notice on government plans for all hospital visitors and outpatients in England to be required to wear face coverings from 15 June and all hospital staff to need to wear surgical masks, the chief executive of NHS Providers has said. Chris Hopson told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme they had been \u201cleft completely in the dark\u201d. He said: Two major changes on the use of personal protection equipment and on visiting policy were announced late yesterday afternoon at the end of what to be frank was a very busy, difficult and hard week for our trust leaders, with absolutely no notice or consultation. I think it\u2019s the latest in a long line of announcements that have had a major impact on the way the NHS operates in which those frontline organisations feel they have been left completely in the dark and they are then expected to make significant and complex operational changes either immediately or with very little notice. Hopson said trust leaders were worried there was not enough strategy or planning and that it feels like \u201clast-minute decisions are being made on the hoof that seem overly influenced by politics and also the need to fill the space at the Downing Street press conferences\u201d. He added: We really need to get into a proper, sensible forward plan and forward strategy on what we\u2019re trying to do where trusts are given the time and the space they need to do complex and difficult things. Our political leaders need to understand that running these organisations is a complex and difficult task and what you can\u2019t do is turn on a sixpence and do stuff like give every single member of staff a face mask without being prepared for it, and also without being sure that you\u2019ve got the masks that you need to ensure that that requirement is met. Elsewhere, Sunday trading laws could be suspended for a year under government plans to stimulate the economy as lockdown measures are eased. The Times (paywall) reports that cafes and pubs could also be given fast-tracked approval to serve food and drink outside.

The notoriously frugal ministry of finance has agreed to spend \u20ac130bn \u2013 a sum equal to 4% of national income \u2013 on more than 50 initiatives to promote growth across the country. This breathtaking investment programme comes on top of the almost 30% of GDP the government has so far spent on rescuing businesses and protecting jobs during the coronavirus crisis. The sums have shocked onlookers, dwarfing as they do the funds Germany deployed in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. Yet they are consistent with a broader push by European institutions to co-ordinate more than ever the recovery from recession of the EU economy. The effort was already under way last year, aimed at counteracting a slowdown in GDP growth: after accelerating through 2017 and 2018, it had started fizzling out. The pandemic has turbocharged the response and brought the EU\u2019s main actors together in a way not seen since the days of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl. German chancellor Angela Merkel has buried her grievances with French premier Emmanuel Macron to produce \u20ac500bn of grants for hard-pressed business across the EU. The move circumvented the Bundestag\u2019s refusal to countenance debt sharing across the euro area and, said Macron, overcame the bloc\u2019s failure earlier in the pandemic to show sufficient solidarity. He said: \u201cWhat is sure is that this \u20ac500bn will not be repaid by the beneficiaries \u2026 We are proposing to do real transfers [of money] ... that\u2019s a major step.\u201d Macron, who, to the annoyance of many in Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democratic party, is a supporter of greater financial integration, has seen his tepid relationship with Germany\u2019s chancellor revived somewhat in the past few months. Last Thursday, the European Central Bank stirred the pot with a generous increase in lending to sovereign nations and the banking sector, joining the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England in making sure the cost of borrowing remains at all-time lows for years to come. Stock markets climbed on news of the combined funding packages, and analysts said they expected the financial markets to accelerate back to pre-pandemic levels during the rest of this month. The German Dax was among several European stock markets to make notable gains. The Dax jumped 3.4% last Friday, taking the week\u2019s increase to more than 10%, and more than a quarter since mid-March. Helped by surprisingly positive US jobs data last Friday, this jump in stock prices was nevertheless underpinned by an announcement from EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson that travel restrictions were about to be eased. \u201cI personally believe that we will return to a full functioning of the Schengen area and freedom of movement of citizens no later than the end of the month of June,\u201d she said. Some countries, such as Austria, are ahead of the pack: after cutting the number of coronavirus cases and deaths dramatically, it has now eased its lockdown so far as to include travel to and from neighbouring Germany and Hungary. The Schengen security area, which allows free movement among its 26 member states, is often cited as the cornerstone of European economic activity, so the prospect of it reopening was always going to excite investors. All eyes, though, are on Merkel\u2019s Germany, which is the first to go beyond the rescue phase and bring forward a fistful of measures to aid the recovery. The \u20ac130bn package, far from inciting either a rightwing backlash or condemnation from the left for being too weak, has received unexpected praise.

She added: \u201cIt also had to be done with an eye to the future, so that is what we especially emphasised.\u201d Across Germany, the recovery package is seen as a defeat for the once all-powerful car lobby, which had reportedly spent weeks urging the government to include a subsidy not just for electric vehicles but also for those with internal combustion engines. In 2016, Germany launched an inventive scheme that was meant to drive up demand for electric cars: with each purchase of an electric vehicle the buyer would get a \u20ac4,000 rebate, half of which was paid for by the government, with the rest funded by carmakers. Instead of extending the scheme to diesel and petrol cars, as lobbyists had demanded, Merkel\u2019s government decided to increase the rebate for electric vehicles to up to \u20ac9,000. News magazine Der Spiegel cited industry insiders calling the package a paradigm change: \u201cTruth is, the times in which the government fulfils every wish of the car sector are over\u201d, it added.

Europe was born out of the ashes of destruction and conflict. It learned the lessons of history and understood something very simple: if we don\u2019t all win, in the end, we all lose.\u201d 6 April Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, warned that the EU faced the biggest challenge since its foundation as she spoke about the economic and political consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cEveryone has been hit equally by this and it must be in the interest of everyone, and of Germany, that Europe emerges stronger from this test,\u201d she said. 16 April In an interview with the Financial Times, the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, said: \u201cWe are at a moment of truth, which is to decide whether the EU is a political project or just a market project. I think it\u2019s a political project\u2009\u2026\u2009We need financial transfers and solidarity, if only so that Europe holds on.\u201d 13 May Paolo Gentiloni, a former Italian prime minister and now the EU\u2019s economy commissioner, said that an uneven economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis posed an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the EU. He said: \u201cWhat is clear is the uneven level of the recovery and the risks this creates to our single market and the necessary convergence, especially within the euro area. This is something that I could even define as an existential threat to the building of the union,\u201d he told a group of European newspapers, including the Guardian. 27 May Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, called on EU countries to back a \u20ac750bn (\u00a3671bn) recovery plan, saying the union was facing a moment such as it had never seen in its 70-year history. \u201cThe crisis has huge externalities and spillovers across all countries and none of that can be fixed by any single country alone.\u201d",

This number does not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which is thought to have passed 50,000. So far, a total of 284,868 people in the UK have tested positive for coronavirus. The Department of Health and Social Care said that as of 9am on Saturday, there had been 5,438,712 tests, including 218,187 tests on 5 June, of which 1,557 were positive. Among the dead were 75 people in England who died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number in England to 27,359. The patients were aged between 43 and 100 and all had underlying health conditions, NHS England announced on Saturday. Six of the deaths occurred in Scotland, where the number of deaths among people who have tested positive for coronavirus rose to 2,415. Scottish government figures show 15,603 people have now tested positive for Covid-19 across the country, an increase of 21. As of Friday evening, 1,019 patients were in hospital with confirmed or suspected coronavirus, with 20 in intensive care. Friday also had the highest number of NHS workers in Scotland being absent in June, with 5,317 staff off for reasons related to Covid-19. And 406 Scottish adult care homes, 38% of the total, were reported to have a current case of suspected Covid-19 \u2013 where a resident has shown symptoms within the past fortnight. One more person with coronavirus has died in Northern Ireland, taking the total number recorded by the Department of Health, primarily accounting for hospital deaths, to 537. Another 14 cases of the virus were confirmed in Northern Ireland, bringing the total since the outbreak began to 4,790. The figures came as Scotland\u2019s former chief scientific adviser, Anne Glover, called for an inquiry to identify failures in the UK government\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Glover said the inquiry must be delivered within months to prepare for a second wave of the disease. She said it would be \u201cinexcusable\u201d for ministers to repeat \u201cmistakes that have already been made\u201d should there be a second spike of coronavirus cases this winter. On Friday, 27 medical and scientific experts signed a letter published in the Guardian warning that many more Britons may die if the government does not come up with solutions to \u201csome of the structural problems that have made implementing an effective response so difficult\u201d. Glover, who is now president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, told the PA news agency: \u201cGiven that second wave is likely to come at a time that is likely to coincide with seasonal influenza, and that would give us serious problems, we really need to understand what the failings have been in our apparent inability to be able to deal with this pandemic appropriately.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of anti-racism protesters have gathered across the UK, defying calls from ministers and police chiefs to avoid mass gatherings. Crowds of mostly young people on Saturday heard speeches in Parliament Square, London, declaring the beginning of the end of institutional racism, and observed a minute\u2019s silence on one knee to commemorate black people killed by police in the UK. \u201cInstitutional racism is rooted in housing, healthcare, the education system, the media, in fashion and beauty,\u201d Imarn Ayton, 29, told the crowd through a megaphone. \u201cIt is rooted in recruitment and employment, in politics, in policing, in immigration, and the criminal justice system. \u201cIt is seen but you cannot see it. It is everywhere but it is nowhere \u2026 Today is the day where we say goodbye to institutional racism.\u201d However, as the day wore on, tensions began to flare after a white man made racist remarks, prompting a person to throw a drink at him. He was led away by police following a tense standoff in which police pushed protesters back after one officer was hit in the face with a plastic bottle. Soon after, police guarding Downing Street were jeered, taunted and pelted with glass bottles and flares, leading riot police to replace them and officers on horseback advanced on protesters at about 6pm amid sudden downpours of rain. One officer was taken to hospital with non life-threatening injuries after her horse panicked and hit a traffic light as the unrest grew. Police were reinforced, with more than 150 officers standing off with a crowd of up to 500 who chanted choruses of \u201cBoris Johnson is a racist\u201d and also accused police of racism as they were kettled. Further flashpoints erupted and officers brawled with protesters, with at least 14 arrests in total throughout the day and another nine officers injured, as glass bottles and flares continued to be thrown, while dozens of protesters danced to music played from a powerful speaker before some joined in prayer. Many opposed violence and discouraged the throwing of projectiles, but numerous others were determined to oppose officers and those remaining were reportedly kettled into Sunday, with legal observers reporting protesters had to say their names if they wanted to leave. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, praised those who protested peacefully but said the \u201ctiny majority\u201d who became violent undermined the cause. \u201cTo the thousands of Londoners who protested peacefully today, I stand with you and I share your anger and your pain. George Floyd\u2019s brutal killing must be a catalyst for change worldwide,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the tiny minority who were violent and threw glass bottles and lit flares \u2013 you endangered a safe and peaceful protest and let down this important cause.\u201d Earlier in the day, demonstrators had splintered, with some marching to the Home Office, led by a number of drummers, to demand justice for the Windrush generation. A larger group including Madonna and Rio Ferdinand remained in Westminster, while others converged on the US embassy, with physical distancing mostly impossible because of the depth of the crowds throughout the capital. Holding banners reading \u201cthere is a virus greater than Covid-19 and it\u2019s called racism\u201d and \u201cthe UK is not innocent\u201d, protesters called for education at an early age about colonialism and an end to the disproportionate use of stop and search as the drizzle cleared and a festival atmosphere permeated the crowds. \u201cPolice mentality needs to change, they need to be educated that this is not okay, stop and search is a prime example of how racist the UK is,\u201d said a 24-year-old demonstrator who preferred to remain anonymous. \u201cThey target black people, they target minorities, they know what they\u2019re doing \u2026 And we need to teach children how the UK was funded by racism, [just like] America.\u201d Alex Kouam, 29, from west London, led chants calling for justice as a group of protesters passed Buckingham Palace. \u201cEvidently the UK is not innocent,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Lammy report highlighted a number of discrepancies in the criminal justice system relating to black and minority ethnic people. But of course the government hasn\u2019t acted upon it. This is a clear indication of institutional racism in the UK.\u201d A couple of officers had knelt before protesters in an act of solidarity on Wednesday, but the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, publicly warned told officers not to do so again and they seemingly abided by the order. Supt Jo Edwards announced late on Saturday that a post-event investigation would be carried out following the unrest. \u201cWe understand people\u2019s passion to come and let their voice be heard, they protested largely without incident,\u201d she said. \u201cOur officers have been professional and very restrained but there was a smaller group intent on violence towards police officers. \u201cTwenty-three officers have received injuries, doing their job, policing protest over the last few days, and that is totally unacceptable.\u201d Elsewhere, about 15,000 people were estimated to have demonstrated in Manchester, while thousands more attended protests in Cardiff, Glasgow, Leicester, Milton Keynes and Sheffield, and in many other towns and cities in the UK to demand an end to systemic racism and in solidarity with George Floyd, the black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck in Minneapolis almost a fortnight ago. Chanting, clapping in unison and holding homemade placards saying \u201cblack lives matter\u201d, a crowd filled Piccadilly Square in Manchester to listen to speakers. They fell silent at 1.45pm and knelt to pay their respects to Floyd. The world heavyweight champion boxer Anthony Joshua joined the protest in his hometown of Watford. \u201cWe can no longer sit back and remain silent on this senseless, unlawful killings and sly racism on another human being \u2013 based on what? Only their skin colour,\u201d the 30-year-old said, standing with crutches. \u201cWe need to speak out in peaceful demonstrations \u2013 just like today, so, well done, Watford. We must not use a demonstration for selfish motives and turn it into rioting and looting.\u201d Several hundred marchers gathered in Newcastle while thousands more watched an online protest organised in the north-east. Dr Christina Mobley, a history lecturer who came to Newcastle University from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, attended with her five-year-old daughter. The historian, who is leading a project to decolonise the university curriculum, said: \u201cI absolutely felt the need to be here today. The organisers have done an amazing job. It is really powerful to see such a young, motivated crowd coming out and organising themselves, handing out masks and working with the police.\u201d In Belfast and Londonderry, police said organisers of protests attended by a total of about 1,000 people would be reported to the Public Prosecution Service \u201cwith a view to prosecution\u201d for violating coronavirus lockdown regulations \u2013 a decision that could cause controversy. \u201cThe health protection regulations are in place to protect us all during this pandemic and it is everyone\u2019s responsibility to adhere to them to protect our society,\u201d said assistant chief constable Alan Todd. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said on Saturday that although she understood the right to protest, the UK was in the midst of a pandemic. \u201cI\u2019d say to those that want to protest: please don\u2019t,\u201d she said, echoing the health secretary, Matt Hancock. \u201cThe regulations are very clear in terms of gatherings and mass gatherings in particular.

It started off lonely, but it\u2019s so amazing to see so many people standing up for her, just saying her name. And trust: if it was anybody else, Breonna would be out here doing the same thing. And that\u2019s what I want people to understand about her.\u201d</p> <p>It has been nearly three months since&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Taylor was killed in her home</a>. Plainclothes cops had been serving a no-knock search warrant in a narcotics investigation when they burst through her door in the first hour of 13 March while Taylor was sleeping. Her boyfriend Kenneth Walker, a licensed gun owner, grabbed his gun and fired off a shot, thinking they were witnessing a home invasion. He hit an officer in the leg.</p> <p>Police fired back more than 20 times, killing Taylor and sending bullets flying into a neighboring apartment. No drugs were found.</p> <p>Yet after her killing, Louisville metro police department described her as a suspect. Her boyfriend was charged with attempted murder of a police officer, and a police union called him an \u201cattempted cop killer\u201d. The cops involved in the incident were not wearing body cameras.</p> <p>Charges against Walker have since been dropped, but the officers still have their freedom and their jobs, driving anger in Louisville. That anger has been compounded by the death of McAtee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/david-mcatee-louisville-protests-family\">who was shot and killed at his barbecue stand</a> far from the center of protests early Monday morning as LMPD officers and national guard troops tried to clear a crowd violating curfew.</p> <p>Police say McAtee fired a shot, prompting them to open fire. In violation of policy, officers involved were either not wearing body cameras or did not activate them. The killings \u2013 combined with nationwide rage over Floyd\u2019s death and police brutality \u2013 have prompted widespread protests in Louisville over the past nine days.</p> <p>On a sweltering Friday afternoon in downtown Louisville, businesses were busy boarding up windows, but the mood at the park was calm, hopeful and welcoming. People signed a large banner wishing Taylor a happy birthday while others wrote birthday cards and letters to the city. A woman painted a portrait of Taylor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"199e994f20cc52608229d4e8e3363b39d0e37e8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/199e994f20cc52608229d4e8e3363b39d0e37e8a/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aleah Cohen and Destiny Hancock hold up signs across the street from Louisville\u2019s Metro Hall. \u2018We shouldn\u2019t be scared to leave our houses.

      "bodyText": "Breonna Taylor would have been 27 on Friday, but most of the people who showed up in downtown Louisville to mark that milestone did not know her. A lot probably wish they had never heard her name. If Taylor had not been shot dead by police in March, her mother believes she would have been out here on the streets herself, protesting against the deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis and David McAtee here, and demanding reform and an end to police brutality, just like the protesters who had shown up for her. As an emergency medical technician (EMT), maybe she would have been be a volunteer medic at the mass demonstrations that have convulsed the city over the course of almost two weeks. Or maybe \u2013 having risked her own health to work in the emergency room through the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 she\u2019d be handing out protective masks. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful to everybody,\u201d said Tamika Palmer, Taylor\u2019s mother, as she gave brief remarks at a gathering that was half celebration of life, half protest. \u201cY\u2019all don\u2019t understand. It started off lonely, but it\u2019s so amazing to see so many people standing up for her, just saying her name. And trust: if it was anybody else, Breonna would be out here doing the same thing. And that\u2019s what I want people to understand about her.\u201d It has been nearly three months since Taylor was killed in her home. Plainclothes cops had been serving a no-knock search warrant in a narcotics investigation when they burst through her door in the first hour of 13 March while Taylor was sleeping. Her boyfriend Kenneth Walker, a licensed gun owner, grabbed his gun and fired off a shot, thinking they were witnessing a home invasion. He hit an officer in the leg. Police fired back more than 20 times, killing Taylor and sending bullets flying into a neighboring apartment. No drugs were found. Yet after her killing, Louisville metro police department described her as a suspect. Her boyfriend was charged with attempted murder of a police officer, and a police union called him an \u201cattempted cop killer\u201d. The cops involved in the incident were not wearing body cameras. Charges against Walker have since been dropped, but the officers still have their freedom and their jobs, driving anger in Louisville. That anger has been compounded by the death of McAtee, who was shot and killed at his barbecue stand far from the center of protests early Monday morning as LMPD officers and national guard troops tried to clear a crowd violating curfew. Police say McAtee fired a shot, prompting them to open fire. In violation of policy, officers involved were either not wearing body cameras or did not activate them. The killings \u2013 combined with nationwide rage over Floyd\u2019s death and police brutality \u2013 have prompted widespread protests in Louisville over the past nine days. On a sweltering Friday afternoon in downtown Louisville, businesses were busy boarding up windows, but the mood at the park was calm, hopeful and welcoming. People signed a large banner wishing Taylor a happy birthday while others wrote birthday cards and letters to the city. A woman painted a portrait of Taylor. \u201cI\u2019d just like to tell her: happy heavenly birthday,\u201d said Tamba Foyah, a 32-year-old artist. \u201cThat\u2019s really sad that we have to say heavenly birthday, because she should be here. She should be here celebrating her birthday. I mean, she should be here protesting with us over what happened to George Floyd. She should be with us.\u201d As he walked through the crowd, Foyah was holding an artwork he\u2019d made showing black bodies hanging in nooses from the barrel of a pistol. \u201cNothing has really changed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just we\u2019re not hanging from trees any more. We\u2019re just hanging from their weapons,\u201d he said, referring to the police. A 22-year-old who identified himself as Bam Bam was signing a long banner wishing Taylor a happy birthday. \u201cWhat I did was, I told Breonna happy b-day, and we want her to look over us,\u201d he said. \u201cMan, it\u2019s hard, and it\u2019s crazy that we have to lightweight turn half the city up so people can hear our voices. It\u2019s not right and it\u2019s not cool. And Breonna, baby, if you hear us: we love you, we sorry that this BS happened to you and we all here for you.\u201d He added: \u201cWe letting the world know what it really is, what it\u2019s like to be a black person in America. We letting you know what it\u2019s like that we fearing for our life every time we get pulled over by the police.\u201d Aleah Cohen, 23, was holding a \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d sign for passing cars to see across the street from Metro Hall with her friend Destiny Hancock, 22. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond scary. It\u2019s something that could literally happen to any of us, especially because she\u2019s at home, in her bedroom,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t be safe at home in bed asleep, where can you be safe?\u201d Cohen says she has experienced racism as a young black woman in Louisville. At an old job, her and a friend got called the N-word and she was accused of stealing. She says HR told her to suck it up. On the night Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016 she says a guy chased her around her neighborhood in a pickup truck. She\u2019s moved since, but one of her neighbors is a cop who she says has pulled her over for no reason and asked if she had a weapon. \u201cLike: we shouldn\u2019t be scared to leave our houses. I shouldn\u2019t be scared to drive around at night,\u201d she said. Hancock said the protest response to Taylor\u2019s death now goes much further than just getting justice for her. \u201cIt\u2019s for Breonna to make it about more than Breonna,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about more than just Breonna \u2013 it\u2019s about change long-term.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Lachlan Beel, 17, was just over a year into his four-year apprenticeship as an engineering machinist when he got some bad news. His employer, which runs a machine shop and foundry in the Ipswich region of south-east Queensland, told him his apprenticeship was being cancelled because work had dried up amid the coronavirus crisis and it was likely to stay sluggish for at least six to 12 months. Hearing the news from the HR rep last month was a blow because Lachlan had really enjoyed learning new skills and making friends at the work site. He had hoped the training would eventually pave the way for him and his brother to start their own motor reconditioning business \u2013 but now he has to try to find a new employer. \u201cI\u2019m currently looking for another apprenticeship, but it\u2019s just really hard right now. No one\u2019s really employing \u2013 everyone\u2019s scared,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be too far between jobs \u2013 people look at you funny, wondering why you haven\u2019t got a job yet.\u201d \u2018We will lose a generation\u2019 Experts fear Lachlan\u2019s case is just the tip of the iceberg.

That equates to about 130,000 fewer new apprentices and trainees between the start of the pandemic and mid-2023. The number of currently enrolled apprentices and trainees is also tipped to go down. The Mitchell Institute education policy fellow, Peter Hurley, says apprentices are highly affected by what\u2019s happening in the wider economy, because employers are reluctant to commit to a three- or four-year placement at a time of economic uncertainty. This trend could see young people drop out of the workforce or training system altogether and lead to skills shortages down the track. \u201cThese are really quite disastrous, cascading effects,\u201d Hurley says.

I just didn\u2019t think that vaccines were necessary.\u201d She was hardly alone. While teams around the world race to create a vaccine for Covid-19, the anti-vaxxers are racing to convince people that it will be dangerous. Australia has an excellent record on immunisation. The national coverage rates in children are above 90%, on average, with some concerning pockets of lower coverage. But the adult rate is lower \u2013 fewer than one in five got the swine flu vaccination in 2009 \u2013 and adults are more susceptible to this novel coronavirus. So there is a genuine concern that if and when the vaccine \u201cticket out\u201d is found, efforts to get people to take it will flounder. While the pandemic that has infected millions and killed hundreds of thousands of people continues to rage, the anti-vaccination movement has capitalised on the fear and confusion created to spread viral propaganda. Some of the widely discredited conspiracy theories to reach the mainstream include that Microsoft founder Bill Gates is part of a global cabal, including the World Health Organisation and big pharma, that started the coronavirus as a method of social control, and that 5G is responsible for Covid-19 \u2013 claims that have been comprehensively debunked. A film called Plandemic featuring discredited scientist Judy Mikovits wove together several anti-vaccination and far right conspiracy theories to claim that a group of elites was using Covid-19 and its potential vaccine to make a profit and control people.

And despite her positive streak she doesn\u2019t let the government off the hook for the handling of the fires.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe warnings signs were all there, months before the bushfire season

bushfires and longer, hotter summers: a long history of downplaying the human contribution to climate change.</p> \n<p>Kotvojs, a development expert and small business owner, wants everybody to know that her farm is solar-powered and off-grid, and that she believes humans are contributing to climate change.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve always held that belief,\u201d Kotvojs says, arguing that her \u201cwhole career\u201d is consistent with that claim.</p> \n<p>But does she stand by her previous statements that <a href=\"https://www.yasstribune.com.au/story/6092321/the-greens-to-preference-labor-in-federal-election/\">\u201csolar activity\u201d is the primary driver of climate change</a>, that it\u2019s <a

Murrumbateman on 24 May, Kotvojs dodged a question about whether she supports a zero-emissions target by 2050.</p> \n<p>\u201cHumans contribute to that changing climate and I believe that we need to have a reduction in emissions, that we need to look at approaches to be adaptive and to have our communities resilient,\u201d she said instead.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\"

campaigning more in the context of economic development than climate change.</p> \n<p>Kotvojs has told her Facebook followers that \u201cred tape\u201d and \u201cgreen tape\u201d are some of the things holding farmers and small businesses back.</p> \n<p>Kotvojs tells Guardian Australia the native grassland laws \u201ccontradict in various areas\u201d and that inconsistencies have \u201ca perverse effect in relation to the native grasslands and the environment\u201d.</p> \n<p>Kotvojs wants to be a \u201cstrong voice in government to drive those discussions\u201d including to call for \u201cfaster development applications\u201d and also believes it is \u201cincredibly complex\u201d for employers to hire.</p> \n<p>\u201cWorking out what award [potential employees] are under and what

particular form of power production\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI believe in a market-driven approach \u2013 the only way to get prices down for people is to ensure that there are not subsidies, because people who can least afford it are having to pay.\u201d</p> \n<p>With Australia in the greatest economic contraction since the Great Depression and most supports due to expire by September \u2013 the role of government is front of mind in the campaign.</p> \n<p>McBain argues that some industries have been left out of government assistance, and many missed out on the $1,500 fortnightly wage subsidy, jobkeeper.</p> \n<p>In a Facebook Q&amp;A, McBain says the jobseeker unemployment benefit cannot \u201csnap back\u201d to its old rate of $40 a day, which she labels \u201cclearly inadequate\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8fbf7b091953d05265215fc869a614f865fb4269\"> \n <img

      "bodyText": "Fiona Kotvojs\u2019s farm was burned in the Black Summer bushfires, and she\u2019s still waiting on money for a new fence. \u201cBasically the fires came through our farm on 23 January and damaged or burned a lot of the fences,\u201d the Liberal candidate for Eden-Monaro says. \u201cThere\u2019s a fencing grant that\u2019s available, which we\u2019ve applied for. \u201cAnd we fall through, my dad falls through, the gaps for the other $75,000 grant,\u201d she says, in reference to a federal program for primary producers. It\u2019s an awkward anecdote for the Liberal candidate hoping to achieve what would be a once-in-a-century win for a government candidate in a byelection, when the electorate goes to the polls on 4 July. A key part of the Labor pitch is that Eden-Monaro \u2013 which covers Canberra commuter towns Yass and Queanbeyan and stretches down to Eden near the Victorian border and up to Braidwood in the Southern Tablelands \u2013 has been forgotten by the Coalition. And it\u2019s not the first time Kotvojs has called for help. This correspondent recalls an exchange on the sidelines of the third leaders\u2019 debate between Scott Morrison and Bill Shorten that gave insight into the 2019 campaign. As the leaders made their pitch to voters, Kotvojs told Mathias Cormann \u2013 one of the most senior members of the government in the crowd \u2013 how well she was performing, in the hope her party would throw more at the seat. Eden-Monaro is the quintessential bellwether seat, but since Mike Kelly had a 3% buffer and a strong personal vote, all the attention was on the battle for neighbouring Gilmore. \u201cGood, good Fiona \u2013 you have them shaking in their boots,\u201d Cormann replied. Kotvojs \u2013 preselected again as the Liberal candidate before the byelection triggered by Kelly\u2019s resignation \u2013 rejects this correspondent\u2019s recollection. \u201cI think you\u2019ve probably got the wrong person \u2026 That wasn\u2019t me,\u201d she says, bristling at the suggestion Eden-Monaro was overlooked. The sense the seat was winnable was vindicated \u2013 on election night, Kotvojs pulled off a 2% swing and came within 1,685 votes of knocking off Kelly. When NSW transport minister Andrew Constance briefly entered but then withdrew from the race to replace Kelly, Kotvojs clinched Liberal preselection on 24 May, six weeks out from polling day on 4 July. Labor\u2019s star recruit the Bega Valley Shire mayor, Kristy McBain, has had the inside running throughout most of May. The Nationals have selected Queanbeyan deputy mayor Trevor Hicks as their candidate; the Greens and Shooters, Farmers and Fishers have also put their hand up to contest. \u201cAt this stage I\u2019m not concentrating on any of the opponents in Eden-Monaro,\u201d McBain says. \u201cI\u2019ve been the Labor candidate for over a month now \u2013 I\u2019ve been out speaking to people and businesses about their concerns. \u201cWhen the other major parties eventually got around \u2013 or are still getting around to getting a candidate \u2013 we\u2019ve actually been talking to people to understand the things they need most.\u201d McBain has a positive streak and her campaign pitch is to people who are \u201csick of politics\u201d and don\u2019t want their MP to \u201cget dragged down in negativity\u201d. She seeks to embody the leader Anthony Albanese\u2019s belief that voters are suffering \u201cconflict fatigue\u201d, so McBain stresses her ability to cooperate and work with anyone \u2013 including a Coalition government. But McBain is seeking to represent an electorate that she says has \u201cfallen through the cracks\u201d \u2013 especially after it was \u201csubstantially impacted\u201d by the Black Summer bushfires. Kotvojs says the government has not forgotten Eden-Monaro, citing funding to remove mobile phone blackspots and the level of support after the bushfires. Kotvojs suggests that Covid-19 may have slowed government processes, but concedes \u201cmany people are concerned\u201d about the speed with which the $2bn set aside for bushfire relief is being spent. \u201cMany people tell me how fantastic it is, where they have found it straightforward \u2013 I hear both messages.\u201d The electorate includes the town of Cobargo, made famous for its hostile reception to Scott Morrison when the prime minister visited some of the communities hit hardest by bushfire after an ill-advised holiday to Hawaii. There is a lot of territory to cover in Eden-Monaro, a difficulty that was influential in triggering Kelly\u2019s retirement for health reasons. The campaign is the first since Morrison tanked in popularity after the Black Summer fires only to bounce back just as sharply due to the Australian governments\u2019 handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. McBain says streamlining the bushfire recovery process and helping businesses shut down due to coronavirus \u201cis definitely going to be a huge part of this campaign\u201d. And despite her positive streak she doesn\u2019t let the government off the hook for the handling of the fires. \u201cThe warnings signs were all there, months before the bushfire season started,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had the former emergency services commissioner wanting to meet with the government about the impact they saw coming, [NSW Rural Fire Service] put out a prediction map in August 2019 \u2013 which was basically, almost spot on, [about] the amount of area under threat, and could potentially burn during the summer season. \u201cThere should\u2019ve been better preparation and planing on behalf of the federal government \u2026 There was no preparation. \u201cWe we\u2019re asking for help and assistance for small business for weeks and months before it was implemented \u2026 and we were told it wasn\u2019t in the domain of federal government \u2013 and that\u2019s really disappointing for communities that are struggling.\u201d Kotvojs has a weakness among voters who join the dots between bushfires and longer, hotter summers: a long history of downplaying the human contribution to climate change. Kotvojs, a development expert and small business owner, wants everybody to know that her farm is solar-powered and off-grid, and that she believes humans are contributing to climate change. \u201cI\u2019ve always held that belief,\u201d Kotvojs says, arguing that her \u201cwhole career\u201d is consistent with that claim. But does she stand by her previous statements that \u201csolar activity\u201d is the primary driver of climate change, that it\u2019s a \u201cmyth\u201d it increases cyclones and the risk to Pacific nations is overstated? \u201cYes \u2026 I cannot deny the facts,\u201d she says, citing a University of Auckland study on Tuvalu\u2019s growing land mass. \u201cMy background is in the environment \u2013 in the early 1990s I set up sea level monitoring stations across the Pacific. \u201cI\u2019ve written environmental impact statements and been part of teams that won Australia-wide environmental awards \u2013 my approach is always evidence-based.\u201d Standing alongside Morrison in Murrumbateman on 24 May, Kotvojs dodged a question about whether she supports a zero-emissions target by 2050. \u201cHumans contribute to that changing climate and I believe that we need to have a reduction in emissions, that we need to look at approaches to be adaptive and to have our communities resilient,\u201d she said instead. McBain is unconvinced. \u201cMy view has been clear, it hasn\u2019t changed from one year to the next dependent on a byelection and people should be aware perhaps my opponent\u2019s views have changed or she\u2019s [just] saying they\u2019re changed.\u201d Other than the usual Coalition lines about reducing emissions through \u201ctechnology, not taxes\u201d \u2013 environmental policy has so far come up in Kotvojs\u2019s online campaigning more in the context of economic development than climate change. Kotvojs has told her Facebook followers that \u201cred tape\u201d and \u201cgreen tape\u201d are some of the things holding farmers and small businesses back. Kotvojs tells Guardian Australia the native grassland laws \u201ccontradict in various areas\u201d and that inconsistencies have \u201ca perverse effect in relation to the native grasslands and the environment\u201d. Kotvojs wants to be a \u201cstrong voice in government to drive those discussions\u201d including to call for \u201cfaster development applications\u201d and also believes it is \u201cincredibly complex\u201d for employers to hire. \u201cWorking out what award [potential employees] are under and what they should be paying \u2026 It needs to be easier to do all those things.\u201d Asked if she supports new coal or nuclear power stations, Kotvojs says she is \u201cnot wedded to any particular form of power production\u201d. \u201cI believe in a market-driven approach \u2013 the only way to get prices down for people is to ensure that there are not subsidies, because people who can least afford it are having to pay.\u201d With Australia in the greatest economic contraction since the Great Depression and most supports due to expire by September \u2013 the role of government is front of mind in the campaign. McBain argues that some industries have been left out of government assistance, and many missed out on the $1,500 fortnightly wage subsidy, jobkeeper. In a Facebook Q&amp;A, McBain says the jobseeker unemployment benefit cannot \u201csnap back\u201d to its old rate of $40 a day, which she labels \u201cclearly inadequate\u201d. \u201cI would challenge anybody to live off that. It is too low, it does prevent people getting back into the workforce and getting a job.\u201d But two years out from a general election, McBain puts the onus back on the government to provide \u201csome certainty\u201d and explain what will happen to the payments after September. Kotvojs praises the jobkeeper program, noting it has helped employees stay in work, but toes the party line that both the wage subsidy and the coronavirus supplement on unemployment benefits were temporary. As restrictions ease, businesses aim to get \u201cback to being resilient and independent\u201d, she says. The coronavirus\u2019 most visible impact is not on policy but the means of campaigning. Both candidates have the difficulty of traversing the varied terrain from the Snowy Mountains down to the coast, without the usual fixtures of an election campaign along the way. McBain is best known on the south coast but points to 10 years in Canberra, work in Queanbeyan and Yass as a lawyer, and on the Canberra Region Joint Organisation which covers all the councils in the electorate as evidence of broader exposure. Kissing babies and supermarket walk-throughs have been replaced by Zoom meetings and phone banking, she says. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be huge town hall debates because of social distancing, it\u2019s going to be very different campaign.\u201d Kotvojs said she campaigned at shows, rodeos and shopping centres through the 2019 campaign and \u201cthis year that\u2019s not going to be possible\u201d due to Covid-19. McBain\u2019s pitch is that she is the \u201cbest possible local representative\u201d and that \u2013 like Mike Kelly \u2013 she can \u201cget a lot done from opposition\u201d. Kotvojs default solution to most problems is to call for better coordination between different levels of government, and simpler presentation of grants and recovery programs already on offer. It helps her sympathise with those who haven\u2019t been given what they need without criticising the NSW or federal Coalition governments. It holds out the possibility that help was there if only they knew where to look. Kotvojs knew how to apply, and she\u2019s still waiting on that fence. \u201cI got an email last night in regards to the fencing grant \u2013 I need to give someone from the department a call about that. So hopefully that one will be progressing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A 70-year-old Australian democracy activist has \u201cdisappeared\u201d inside Vietnam\u2019s prison system: no one from his family or the Australian government has been allowed to see or speak with him for nearly four months. Human rights advocates, lawyers and Chau Van Kham\u2019s family said the charges against him are baseless and politically motivated, his single-day multiple-defendant trial was grossly unfair, and his failing health means his 12-year prison sentence is \u201ceffectively a death sentence\u201d. Vietnamese-born Chau was arrested in January 2019 and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment on \u201cfinancing terrorism\u201d charges over his membership of pro-democracy group Viet Tan. His sister was last able to see him in February, giving him money and critical medications for a series of potentially life-threatening conditions, including high blood pressure and cholesterol levels, glaucoma, and kidney stones. Chau\u2019s son Dennis told the Guardian his family feared his failing health will be exacerbated by his isolation. \u201cMy father is of old age now without any forms of communication to the outside world, I worry not only for his health but his mental state \u2026 it frightens me how he\u2019s doing inside. \u201cHe\u2019s now on a long journey until his release with no support from the Australian government at all, it seems like they\u2019ve forgotten about him.\u201d Chau\u2019s sister, who lives in Vietnam, had previously been allowed to visit once a month to give her brother money, medicine and letters from home. But she has been refused access and phone calls to him since 10 February. On her most recent visit she was told her brother was no longer in the B34 Detention Centre in Ho Chi Minh City where he\u2019d been held, but officials would not tell her to where he had been moved. Weeks later \u2013 after government and media inquiries into his whereabouts \u2013 Chau\u2019s family was informed he\u2019d been moved to a prison more than three hours away. There has still been no contact with him. Officials from Australia\u2019s consulate have had no contact with Chau since 17 January. He has not been allowed to telephone anyone or write any letters. Consular visits scheduled for February, March, April and May were all cancelled out of concerns over the spread of Covid-19. Permission for a visit in June is pending. But Vietnam has successfully suppressed the spread of the virus \u2013 the country has reported zero deaths \u2013 and lifted pandemic restrictions. \u201cHe has literally disappeared,\u201d Australian lawyer Dan Phuong Nguyen, who is acting pro bono for the Chau family, told the Guardian. \u201cHe\u2019s just vanished. I hold grave fears for his safety. Vietnam has opened up now, there are no more coronavirus restrictions. There is no reason why prison officials can\u2019t allow us some sort of contact to let us know he is well and safe. \u201cHis family is distraught.\u201d Chau, an Australian citizen, was born in Vietnam and served in the army of the Republic of Vietnam before 1975. After the war, he was sent to a re-education camp for three years before he fled Vietnam by boat, arriving in Australia in 1983. In Sydney, he worked as a baker for decades, rising before dawn to work at a modest suburban bakery. In 2010, he became a member of the Viet Tan pro-democracy organisation, and became a key Australian organiser of pro-reform rallies and an outspoken advocate for democratisation in Vietnam. The United Nations describes Viet Tan as \u201ca peaceful organisation advocating for democratic reform\u201d, but it was formally proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the Vietnamese government in 2016, which said it was \u201ca reactionary and terrorist organisation, always silently carrying out activities against Vietnam\u201d. Chau sought to return to Vietnam in 2019 to meet fellow pro-democracy advocates but was refused a visa. He crossed into Vietnam via a land border with Cambodia in January, carrying a false identity document. He was arrested after meeting a democracy activist who, it is believed, was under surveillance, along with Vietnamese nationals Nguyen Van Vien and Tran Van Quyen, who were sentenced to 11 and 10 years prison respectively. Chau was convicted and sentenced at his first appearance in the people\u2019s court of Ho Chi Minh City after more than 10 months in detention. The single-day judge-only trial, held simultaneously with four other people, saw him tried and convicted on charges of \u201cfinancing terrorism\u201d, and sentenced to 12 years in jail, all within four hours. The court was effectively closed \u2013 open only for approved people, his family was excluded \u2013 for the entirety of the trial. Viet Tan condemned Chau\u2019s hearing as a \u201csham trial\u201d and said it would \u201ccontinue to support human rights defenders on the ground\u201d. Chau\u2019s appeal was dismissed in March. Dennis Chau told a human rights summit in Geneva this year: \u201cWith a 12-year sentence, [my father will] be 82 when he is released ... I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll ever see him alive, a free man. It\u2019s effectively a death sentence.\u201d He said the family felt it was a \u201ccat and mouse game\u201d with the prison officials. \u201cNo communication of any sort, and now to make things even harder for us, moving him further away.\u201d For Chau\u2019s wife, Trang, his imprisonment has brought immense stress, and \u201ca lot of sadness\u201d. \u201cMy mother is handling as best she can [but] I know she misses him and would like him back as soon as possible.\u201d Elaine Pearson, Australia director of Human Rights Watch, said it was extremely concerning that in the midst of a pandemic, no one from the Australian consulate or Chau\u2019s family had been allowed to visit to check on his welfare; even to speak by phone, if public health measures meant visits were not possible. \u201cEspecially given his age and health needs, he should be released from prison as soon as possible and the Australian government needs to press harder for that. We have seen other examples of Vietnamese political prisoners released into exile in the US, France and Germany so it can be done.\u201d Pearson said Chau\u2019s arrest was part of a broader crackdown on freedom of expression across Vietnam, and that repressive governments around the world had used the cover of Covid-19 to target perceived opponents. \u201cThe Australian government might be reluctant to criticise Vietnam because it wants friends in Southeast Asia to counter China\u2019s growing influence, yet any friendship with those countries should be accompanied by firmly standing up for human rights.\u201d The Guardian put a series of questions about Chau Van Kham\u2019s imprisonment and wellbeing to the Vietnam embassy in Canberra. It has not received a response. Phone calls were not returned. Australia\u2019s department of foreign affairs and trade said it continued to seek access to Chau. \u201cVietnamese authorities understand our strong interest in Mr Chau\u2019s health and welfare,\u201d a spokesperson said.",

He has previously worked for the Guardian and the Independent and local newspapers in the north of England, where he still lives, the only Evertonian in a family of Liverpool and Wigan Athletic supporters. No awards, books or television career to speak of, but he once saw a bloke on the tube laughing out loud while reading his column. He lives in hope that in another five years or so he might spot another one. Or even the same one</p>",

      "bodyText": "The number of deaths from the coronavirus pandemic in America has reached 109,497, with confirmed cases in this country now totaling 1,909,077, according to Johns Hopkins University data. New deaths have been curving downward in the US, but Covid-19 continues to spread across the country, with thousands of confirmed diagnoses daily. The increase comes as officials \u2013 grappling with a 13.3% unemployment rate \u2013 take more steps to reopen local economies. Meanwhile, social-distancing guidelines have been increasingly challenged by nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd, prompting concerns that cases could soon surge. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, recently expanded reopening efforts following dramatic declines in deaths and diagnoses in his state, which has been the most ravaged in the country. Cuomo said that New York City, which has been the center of the pandemic in the US, is on track to enter \u201cphase one\u201d of re-opening on 8 June. It permits construction and manufacturing, as well as retail conducted on the curbside or trhough in-store drop-off and pick-up.

Actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/04/john-boyega-challenged-racism-movie-star-hyde-park-speech\">John Boyega</a>\u2019s heartfelt speech to the demonstrators on Wednesday made those links explicit: \u201cWe are a physical representation of our support for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> \u2026 We are a physical representation of our support for Stephen Lawrence.\u201d His words were carried on many of the cardboard signs held aloft: \u201cNow is the time.

The loose network of Black Lives Matter activists who have coordinated last week\u2019s protests across the UK did their best to mitigate the risks in the crowd. They came equipped here with stocks of free masks and sanitiser. Imarn Ayton, 29, one of those coordinators, kicked off proceedings through a loudhailer: \u201cWe are not here for violence. If you commit violence today you are not for the cause. I don\u2019t want to see no alcohol. I don\u2019t want to see no weed. This is not a carnival. And keep your distance. You don\u2019t need me to say that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-racial-disparities-african-americans\">coronavirus is killing black people</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>For many hours her hopes for a peaceful protest were realised, but&nbsp;in late afternoon there were clashes between protesters and police and one officer appeared to be knocked off their horse, which then bolted \u2013 sending crowds of people scattering [see footnote].&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9489d50ddc1604810cd7c6625732eabab4442ca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9489d50ddc1604810cd7c6625732eabab4442ca/138_0_4053_2434/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protester\u2019s face mask in London echoes the final words of George Floyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester\u2019s face mask in London echoes the final words of George Floyd.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Augstein/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When I spoke to Ayton, 29, she said they had expected 20,000 to come. The eventual number appeared several times greater. What was not in doubt was that last week had marked a new phase of momentum in a long campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve always been involved,\u201d she said of a movement that has its genesis in the protest against the decision not to prosecute the killer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trayvon-martin\">Trayvon Martin</a> in 2013. \u201cTo be honest anyone who is black and passionate is involved. But it feels like a different moment. The death of George Floyd and the protest has inspired many more people to speak up, black, white, everyone. The difference we are seeing is people are no longer prepared to be ignorant; they want to educate themselves.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5f1ed2beb04f5172159ab102509e2158f5ae796\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5f1ed2beb04f5172159ab102509e2158f5ae796/756_0_2773_2788/995.jpg\" alt=\"Da Vinci, a DJ from Brixton\" width=\"995\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Da Vinci, a DJ from Brixton.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A lot of the people I spoke to suggested that this was their first march. They acknowledged the risks of the crowd, but felt they had no real choice. A young black woman from north London, who didn\u2019t wish to give her name was holding a sign saying \u201cYour silence is violence\u201d and sitting at the foot of Gandhi\u2019s statue. \u201cThe facts haven\u2019t changed,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the difference is more people are listening. I see it on social media, everyone that I know has been posting about this. And if you are young and you are not speaking up now, then it definitely says who you are. They don\u2019t have to be here physically because we are in the middle of a pandemic, but if they are not here mentally and in spirit, well fuck \u2019em.\u201d</p> \n<p>Terence Niemi, 28, from Colchester was also a first-time protester. \u201cI felt like I should be here, there was no real choice this time. But it shouldn\u2019t take losing another person\u2019s life for us to form together. Hopefully in future we can make these kind of movements without this situation going down.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You only have to look at the images on the internet to know why people are enraged</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Fatima Abdulrahman</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Da Vinci, a DJ from Brixton, said: \u201cAsking people \u2018stop oppressing us\u2019 doesn\u2019t really make much sense to me. But when you see people coming out together all around the world hopefully we can unite around that and find something positive out of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fatima Abdulrahman had been on two previous protests last week. \u201cYou only have to look at the images on the internet to know why people are enraged,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a lot of anger; people are not OK with how things are and there is a lot of pain to process.\u201d She suggested the grimness of the last few weeks has also motivated that change; isolation itself has sharpened the issues. \u201cPeople have been at home, often alone for several months hearing about people dying, and a disproportionate number of them have been black people. And a disproportionate amount of black people have been suffering economically. That is another reason why we are here.\u201d</p> \n<p>The summer looks likely to pitch those demands for social justice squarely against public health. The first test of that clash will be on Sunday afternoon when marchers have been invited to reassemble outside the US embassy in Vauxhall.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This footnote was added on 8 June 2020 to note that the police officer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/06/coronavirus-live-news-china-warns-of-covid-linked-racial-violence-overseas?page=with:block-5edbfbc78f083999a26db50f#block-5edbfbc78f083999a26db50f\">fell from her horse after hitting a traffic light</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Actor John Boyega\u2019s heartfelt speech to the demonstrators on Wednesday made those links explicit: \u201cWe are a physical representation of our support for George Floyd \u2026 We are a physical representation of our support for Stephen Lawrence.\u201d His words were carried on many of the cardboard signs held aloft: \u201cNow is the time. I ain\u2019t waiting.\u201d That sentiment, which has spread through cities across the world, was never likely to be postponed by demands for physical distancing. The loose network of Black Lives Matter activists who have coordinated last week\u2019s protests across the UK did their best to mitigate the risks in the crowd. They came equipped here with stocks of free masks and sanitiser. Imarn Ayton, 29, one of those coordinators, kicked off proceedings through a loudhailer: \u201cWe are not here for violence. If you commit violence today you are not for the cause. I don\u2019t want to see no alcohol. I don\u2019t want to see no weed. This is not a carnival. And keep your distance. You don\u2019t need me to say that coronavirus is killing black people.\u201d For many hours her hopes for a peaceful protest were realised, but in late afternoon there were clashes between protesters and police and one officer appeared to be knocked off their horse, which then bolted \u2013 sending crowds of people scattering [see footnote]. When I spoke to Ayton, 29, she said they had expected 20,000 to come. The eventual number appeared several times greater. What was not in doubt was that last week had marked a new phase of momentum in a long campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve always been involved,\u201d she said of a movement that has its genesis in the protest against the decision not to prosecute the killer of Trayvon Martin in 2013. \u201cTo be honest anyone who is black and passionate is involved. But it feels like a different moment. The death of George Floyd and the protest has inspired many more people to speak up, black, white, everyone. The difference we are seeing is people are no longer prepared to be ignorant; they want to educate themselves.\u201d A lot of the people I spoke to suggested that this was their first march. They acknowledged the risks of the crowd, but felt they had no real choice. A young black woman from north London, who didn\u2019t wish to give her name was holding a sign saying \u201cYour silence is violence\u201d and sitting at the foot of Gandhi\u2019s statue. \u201cThe facts haven\u2019t changed,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the difference is more people are listening. I see it on social media, everyone that I know has been posting about this. And if you are young and you are not speaking up now, then it definitely says who you are. They don\u2019t have to be here physically because we are in the middle of a pandemic, but if they are not here mentally and in spirit, well fuck \u2019em.\u201d Terence Niemi, 28, from Colchester was also a first-time protester. \u201cI felt like I should be here, there was no real choice this time. But it shouldn\u2019t take losing another person\u2019s life for us to form together. Hopefully in future we can make these kind of movements without this situation going down.\u201d Da Vinci, a DJ from Brixton, said: \u201cAsking people \u2018stop oppressing us\u2019 doesn\u2019t really make much sense to me. But when you see people coming out together all around the world hopefully we can unite around that and find something positive out of it.\u201d Fatima Abdulrahman had been on two previous protests last week. \u201cYou only have to look at the images on the internet to know why people are enraged,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a lot of anger; people are not OK with how things are and there is a lot of pain to process.\u201d She suggested the grimness of the last few weeks has also motivated that change; isolation itself has sharpened the issues. \u201cPeople have been at home, often alone for several months hearing about people dying, and a disproportionate number of them have been black people. And a disproportionate amount of black people have been suffering economically. That is another reason why we are here.\u201d The summer looks likely to pitch those demands for social justice squarely against public health. The first test of that clash will be on Sunday afternoon when marchers have been invited to reassemble outside the US embassy in Vauxhall. \u2022 This footnote was added on 8 June 2020 to note that the police officer fell from her horse after hitting a traffic light.",

      "bodyText": "This blog is now closed \u2013 coverage continues here The number of coronavirus cases recorded globally now stands at 6,852,810, according to the Johns Hopkins University dashboard. The US is hardest hit, with 1,917,080 cases, followed by Brazil (645,771 cases) and Russia (458,102 cases). Victoria Bekiempis reports from New York: New deaths have been curving downward in the US, but Covid-19 continues to spread across the country, with thousands of confirmed diagnoses daily. The increase comes as officials \u2013 grappling with a 13.3% unemployment rate \u2013 take more steps to reopen local economies. Meanwhile, social-distancing guidelines have been increasingly challenged by nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd, prompting concerns that cases could soon surge. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, recently expanded reopening efforts following dramatic declines in deaths and diagnoses in his state, which has been the most ravaged in the country. Cuomo said that New York City, which has been the center of the pandemic in the US, is on track to enter \u201cphase one\u201d of re-opening on 8 June. It permits construction and manufacturing, as well as retail conducted on the curbside or trhough in-store drop-off and pick-up. In some regions of New York state, houses of worship will be permitted to reopen at 25% occupancy with \u201call social distancing protocols\u201d on 7 June. Across the US, some tourist hubs are reopening. Universal Orlando reopened theme parks on 5 June after being closed for nearly three months, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Most guests sported masks and followed safety procedures such as temperature checks at the lightly attended parks. Las Vegas\u2019s famed casinos also re-opened this week Public health officials have voiced concern that demonstrators and police at anti-police brutality protests could spur Covid-19\u2019s spread. Social distancing is virtually impossible at heavily attended protests and shouting could spread droplets containing COVID-19. The sheer number of attendees renders contact tracing virtually impossible. Heavily criticized police techniques, such as using teargas and pepper spray on protesters, intensify this risk The substances cause coughing and oil-based pepper spray prompts mucus, saliva, and tears to leave the nose, mouth, and eyes.

If you have contributions for the coronavirus global live blog please do email me rebecca.ratcliffe@theguardian.com, or I\u2019m @rebeccarat on Twitter. I\u2019ll be handing over to my colleagues in Australia shortly. Thank you to everyone who read the blog or followed live, and particular thanks to those who sent in tips and pointers. I hope you\u2019re all staying safe and well, wherever in the world you\u2019re reading from. Before I go, here\u2019s a summary of key events to bring you up to speed on the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic: OPEC members and other oil producing nations have agreed to extend their output cuts through July. World number one tennis player Novak Djokovic has shed doubt on whether the US Open tournament will go ahead as planned in September, saying coronavirus restrictions would make it impossible. The organisers of anti-racism demonstrations in Northern Ireland will be reported to the public prosecution service for breaking coronavirus locked rules, police have said. It comes after thousands turned out for protests across the UK following the death of George Floyd. Places of worship in the UK will reopen for individual prayer on June 15. California is planning to allow film, television and music production to resume from June 12, depending on coronavirus conditions at that time. Brazil\u2019s president Jai Bolsonaro has defended his decision to withhold some of the official data on country\u2019s coronavirus pandemic. The Johns Hopkins University tracker has since removed Brazil\u2019s tallies, although the reason for this remains unclear. Brazil\u2019s coronavirus tallies have been removed from the Johns Hopkins university tracker, which has been a key monitor of the spread of the pandemic since its the early days of outbreak. The reasons for this are unclear, but it follows the Brazilian president\u2019s decision to withhold some official statistics on the country\u2019s coronavirus spread. France\u2019s Palace of Versailles, one of the country\u2019s biggest tourist attractions, reopened today, with face masks mandatory, and a one way route imposed. 80% of the palace\u2019s visitors generally come from abroad. \u201cThis financial model has been devastated. We have to start again,\u201d Catherine Pegard, who runs the palace, told Reuters. \u201cWe\u2019re not the only ones.\u201d The Louvre has also reopened. The UK\u2019s housing and communities minister Robert Jenrick has announced that places of worship will reopen for individual prayer on June 15. Young clubbers in the Netherlands have been trialling clubbing during the coronavirus era - complete with chairs, social distancing, and afternoon sets. As the country races to save its night life, clubs are trying a number of measures to encourage a safe return to business. Clubbers at Doornroosje in the eastern city of Nijmegen booked in advance to attend short sets of electronic dance music in the afternoon, and were restricted to chairs. Promoter Jonatan Brand said the original plan had been to have the guests dance while standing in place 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart, but local authorities had instructed them to sit in chairs. A maximum of 30 guests were allowed in the building at a time, with plans to expand to 100 in July. The event cost 10 euros, which included a drink. Shows did not sell out, and the event was also streamed online. UK prime minister Boris Johnson may be planning to relax measures on outdoor dining and weddings, and to speed up government investment plans, reports from Sunday newspapers suggest. According to the Sunday Times, Johnson is keen to relax planning restrictions that prevent many pubs, cafes and restaurants from using outside areas, and also to make it legal to hold weddings outside. This is currently limited to Jews and Quakers. The newspaper also said that indoor weddings and funerals with up to 10 people attending would also be permitted from early July, while places of worship would be allowed to reopen for private prayer from June 15. The plans will be announced in the coming week, the publication said. \u201cBoris wants us back to normal, or as near to it as possible, before the summer,\u201d the newspaper quoted a senior source as saying, adding the prime minister was concerned about forecasts of a sharp rise in unemployment. A Downing Street spokesperson declined to comment. Meanwhile, the Sunday Telegraph said Johnson planned to announce a speeding up of road improvements, and the construction of 40 new hospitals it had promised before last December\u2019s election. They said they announcement would come in coming weeks. \u201cNow is the time to be even more ambitious with his plans to unite and level up the country,\u201d a government source was quoted as telling the Sunday Telegraph. Thanks to all those getting in touch with tips and pointers, it\u2019s very useful and much appreciated. If you spot anything you think we should be covering in this blog, feel free to drop me a direct message on Twitter. I won\u2019t be able to respond to everything but I will endeavour to read it all. The death toll in France has risen to 29,142 from 29,111 yesterday. The number in people in hospital with Covid-19 has decreased from 12,696 on Friday to 12,479 today. The number of people in intensive care units has also decreased to 1,059, from 1,094 on Friday. The overall number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country has risen to 153,634 from 153,055 on Friday. California is planning to allow film, television and music production to resume from June 12, the governor\u2019s office says. However, this is contingent on specific \u201cconditions\u201d, seemingly surrounding the spread of coronavirus at that time. However, Los Angeles county remains one of the main epicentres in California, recording about half the infections and deaths in the state. OPEC members, led by Saudi Arabia, and other key oil producers have agreed to extend their output cuts through July, as oil prices begin to recover and coronavirus lockdowns ease. Algerian oil minister Mohamed Arkab, who currently holds OPEC\u2019s rotating presidency, told AFP that the agreed cut for July was 9.6m barrels per day, just slightly below the 9.7 mbpd cut for May and June. Here are some of the most powerful photographs from todays anti-racism demonstrations around the world, which continued despite coronavirus regulations: London\u2019s Metropolitan Police said there were four arrests at the Black Lives Matter protests in London and that all of the suspects were in custody. The arrests were for assault on police, criminal damage, making threats and calling for violence and an incident of dangerous driving near the US Embassy. London\u2019s metropolitan police force have said that the officer who was knocked off her horse by a traffic light is receiving treatment in hospital. Her injuries are not life threatening, and the horse, which subsequently bolted, was uninjured and made its own way back to the stables. The incident happened while mounted officers charged at protesters at an anti-racism demonstration in London. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has praised the peaceful protesters in today\u2019s anti-racism demonstration in London, but but said people who became violent \u201clet down the cause\u201d. He said: \u201cTo the thousands of Londoners who protested peacefully today, I stand with you and I share your anger and your pain. \u201cGeorge Floyd\u2019s brutal killing must be a catalyst for change worldwide. \u201cNo country, city, police service or institution can absolve itself of the responsibility to do better. We must stand together and root out racism wherever it is found. Black Lives Matter. \u201cTo the tiny minority who were violent and threw glass bottles and lit flares - you endangered a safe and peaceful protest and let down this important cause,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Priti Patel said violence towards police at protests was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and gave officers her \u201cfull support in tackling disorderly behaviour\u201d. Writing on Twitter, she said: \u201cProtests must be peaceful and in accordance with social distancing rules.\u201d \u201cViolence towards a police officer is completely unacceptable at any time. The police have our full support in tackling any violence, vandalism or disorderly behaviour. There is no justification for it.\u201d She added: \u201cWe have made specific enforcement powers available to them during the pandemic to help protect the entire public.\u201d Thousands of anti-racism protesters around the world have continued to demonstrate in a wave of protests triggered by the death of George Floyd in police custody in the US, despite bans on mass gatherings. You can read more about the UK protests here, and follow US developments live here. Protest organisers in Northern Ireland will be reported to the public prosecution service for the flouting of coronavirus rules. Italy reported 72 new coronavirus deaths on Saturday, down from 85 yesterday, as the country appears to be emerging from the throes of the pandemic, while the number of coronavirus cases in Canada has reached 94,335. World number one Novak Djokovic has shed doubt on whether the US Open tournament will go ahead in September as planned, saying coronavirus restrictions would make it impossible. Brazil\u2019s president Jai Bolsonaro has defended his decision to withhold some of the official data on country\u2019s coronavirus pandemic. The spokesman of Kazakh president has been hospitalised after testing positive for coronavirus, but insists there is no risk to the president. Here is more footage of the shocking moment a police horse bolted through crowds of protesters at an anti-racism demonstration in London. It occurred after a police officer was knocked off their horse by a traffic light. Some reports on social media are suggesting they were knocked off by protesters - videos and reporters at the scene appear to confirm this is not the case, but London\u2019s metropolitan police force said they were investigating the incident. Protesters and police have clashed in London during the last couple of hours, with videos on social media showing bottles being thrown at the police, and some allegations that missiles were also thrown - it\u2019s not yet clear exactly what those were. Graffiti has also been painted on buildings, and allegedly some monuments around the city centre. However, many protesters have been condemning these actions. Support for UK prime minister Boris Johnson is falling due to concerns about his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, three British opinion polls released today have shown. The sharpest decline came in a poll conducted by Survation on 3 June, which showed support for Conservatives falling to 41% from 45% in the previous poll from the period between 22-26 May. Meanwhile, support for the opposition Labour party increased by five points to 39%. Surveys for Deltapoll and Opinium, both conducted on June 4-5, showed the Conservative lead narrowing to three percentage points. Opinium said 47% of people surveyed disapproved of the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis while 34% approved. This marks a continuation of a steady decline in confidence in the government since the pandemic began. The UK has experienced the highest coronavirus death toll in Europe. Just a reminder that if you see something you think we should be reporting on in this blog, you can drop me a message on Twitter. Thanks in advance! You can read more on the anti-racism demonstrations taking place across the UK here: There have been clashes between police and protesters at anti-racism demonstrations in London. While my colleague Mattha Busby, who is at the scene, says it has since calmed down, here is some remarkable footage from about 45 minutes ago. Police on horseback have been kettling protesters and charging into the crowd. Organisers of anti-racism protests in Northern Ireland will be reported to be Public Prosecution Service over the breaking of coronavirus restrictions, police have said. Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd had urged organisers to call off the rallies sparked by the death of George Floyd in police custody in the US, but hundreds attended in spite of this. Many wore face coverings and gloves as they arrived at the demonstrations, in Belfast they were handed flyers by police officers explaining social distancing rules. Some protesters were given community resolution notices, despite organisers having marked out social distancing measurements and encouraged those attending to space out. Todd said police estimated that some 500 demonstrators attended protests in Belfast and Londonderry. He said that despite the cancellation of a planned protest in Newry, a \u201csmall crowd did gather but dispersed quickly on our request\u201d. Todd confirmed that community resolution notices had been given out, and said protest organisers would be reported to the Public Prosecution Service. \u201cWe estimate there were less than 500 people in attendance at each event and a significant number of Community Resolution Notices (CRNS) and fines were issued in both Belfast and Derry/Londonderry,\u201d he said. \u201cA number of individuals, including organisers, will now be reported to the Public Prosecution Service with a view to prosecution. We will also conduct follow up enquiries to seek to identify others who may have committed offences.\u201d \u201cThe Health Protection Regulations are in place to protect us all during this pandemic and it is everyone\u2019s responsibility to adhere to them to protect our society,\u201d he added. Tennis star Novak Djokovic has said that participating in the US Open would be impossible because of the \u201cextreme\u201d coronavirus protocols in place for the tournament. The world number one said he was not sure the tournament would go ahead. \u201cI had a telephone conversation with the leaders of world tennis. There were talks about the continuation of the season, mostly about the US Open due in late August, but it\u2019s not known whether it will be held,\u201d Djokovic told Serbia\u2019s Prva TV. \u201cThe rules that they told us that we would have to respect to be there, to play at all, they are extreme. We would not have access to Manhattan, we would have to sleep in hotels at the airport, to be tested twice or three times per week.\u201d \u201cAlso, we could bring one person to the club which is really impossible. I mean, you need your coach, then a fitness trainer, then a physiotherapist,\u201d he said. Djokovic suggested the keenness to go ahead with the tournament arose from economic concerns. \u201cThey want the tournament to go ahead at any cost for economic reasons, which I understand,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the question is, how many players are willing to accept those terms.\u201d World number two Rafa Nadal said this week that he would not travel to the US in the present circumstances. The tournament, scheduled to begin on 31 August, will be the first Grand Slam to be played after the coronavirus pandemic caused the suspension of the tennis season in March. The French Open was postponed to September, while the Wimbledon championships was cancelled. Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev\u2019s spokesman has been hospitalised after testing positive for covid-19, he posted on Facebook on Saturday. He said that the president\u2019s health was not at risk. The spokesman, Berik Uali, said that Tokayev, 67, was tested regularly, and added that additional safety measures had been taken at the presidential headquarters. \u201cPresident Tokayev continues his work as scheduled, his health is under no threat,\u201d Uali said. The nation has confirmed 12,511 cases of coronavirus, with 53 deaths. It ended a two-month lockdown last month, but social distancing rules and closed borders remain in place. The Government is understood to be on track to meet its June 6 care home coronavirus testing target, despite a survey finding that some had not received testing kits. At the more than a tenth of homes surveyed by the National Care Forum, which represents 120 not-for-profit care organisations, reported they had not received testing kits at the start of the week. However, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) believes it is on track to have offered testing to all care homes with residents over-65 in England by Saturday, it is understood. The number of coronavirus cases in Canada has risen to 94,335, up from 94,070 on Friday, according to the public health agency. The country has now recorded 7,703 deaths, an increase from 7,652 the day before. Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro has defended his decision to withhold some official data on the country\u2019s coronavirus pandemic - the world\u2019s second largest outbreak. On Friday, the health ministry stopped reporting a tally of confirmed cases, and its overall death toll. It also took down a website which had mapped the spread of the virus in Brazil. \u201cThe cumulative data ... does not reflect the moment the country is in,\u201d Bolsonaro tweeted, citing a note from the ministry. \u201cOther actions are underway to improve the reporting of cases and confirmation of diagnoses.\u201d Neither Bolsonaro nor the ministry gave a reason for taking down the coronavirus mapping website, which had been a key public resource for tracking the development of the pandemic. The government also came under fire for pushing back the release time of its daily tally of diagnoses and deaths. These figures were previously made available around 5pm, but in recent days have been released near 10pm. Brazil has the second highest number of confirmed cases of any country in the world, with 614,941 cases, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The US has the highest, with 1,901,416 confirmed cases. Brazil has recorded 34,021 deaths as a result of the virus, according to the tracker. This remarkable photograph shows a socially-distanced anti-racism protest in Turin, Italy, today. This is just one of a wave of demonstrations around the world calling for justice for George Floyd and an end to racism. If you\u2019d like to follow the latest developments in the global anti-racism demonstrations, we have a dedicated live blog which you can find here. Italy reported 72 new coronavirus deaths on Saturday, against 85 a day earlier. The country saw 270 new cases, down from 518 the day before, the Civil Protection department said. These figures bring the county\u2019s total death toll since the outbreak emerged on Feb. 21 to 33,846, the agency said, the fourth-highest in the world after the United States, Britain and Brazil. The number of people registered as currently carrying the illness fell to 35,877 from 36,976 the day before, and the total number of confirmed cases stands at 234,801. This takes Italy\u2019s tally to the seventh highest in the world, after India overtook it a day earlier. There were 293 people in intensive care on Saturday, down from 316 on Friday, continuing a long-running drop. As of today, 165,078 have been declared recovered from coronavirus, against 163,781 a day earlier. The northern region of Lombardy, where the country\u2019s outbreak is thought to have began, remains by far the worst-affected region, and accounts for 142 of the 270 new cases reported on Saturday. Piedmont is the second-worst hit region, reporting 38 new cases. Of the country\u2019s 20 regions, the only others to register more than 10 new cases were Lazio, with 28, Emilia Romagna with 17 and Liguria with 13. The UK government did not consult NHS leaders or give them notice before a decision to make all hospital staff wear surgical masks from 15 June, senior healthcare chiefs have said. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said healthcare workers believe last-minute decisions are being made on the hoof because of political rather than public health considerations and that announcements were being made to \u201cfill the space\u201d at the Downing Street coronavirus briefings. His intervention comes after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said on Friday that all hospital visitors and outpatients in England would have to wear face coverings, and that hospital staff must use surgical masks from the middle of the month, despite the government previously saying the evidence that face masks prevented the spread of Covid-19 was inconclusive. In case you missed it, read the full report from my colleague Mattha Busby here: Nearly a third of companies who have received coronavirus loans from the Bank of England are connected to tax havens, research suggests. Analysis by TaxWatch, an investigative thinktank, claims that 14 out of the 53 businesses which have benefited from the support are either based in a tax haven, or substantially owned by a tax haven resident. These companies have received more than \u00a35bn in loans as part of the coronavirus corporate financing facility (CCFF) - a Bank of England scheme designed to support some of the biggest companies with credit ratings. British Airways, whose parent company is based in Jersey, has accessed \u00a3300m of support from the scheme, and digger-maker JCB, whose parent company is located in the Netherlands, and fashion brand Chanel, whose parent company is based in the Cayman Islands, have received loans of \u00a3600m. TaxWatch said one company receiving a loan is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office while another is nine months late in filing its UK accounts. Protests in Lebanon against the government\u2019s handling of the country\u2019s economic crisis have resumed, after subsiding for the past few months due to lockdown restrictions. Tear gas was launched by police at several hundred protesters who had reconvened on a main square in Beirut, with most of the country\u2019s coronavirus measures now lifted. Some protesters threw rocks at police and smashed storefronts, many wearing face masks. Many demanded the resignation of the government, early parliamentary elections to be held, and paramilitary group Hezbollah be disarmed. Lebanon\u2019s financial crisis escalated in October, with a dollar crunch causing banks to impose strict controls on capital. This led to widespread protests. Since then, the currency has lost more than half of its value on the parallel market, prices in the country have soared, and many people have been made unemployed after businesses suffered the dual blows of an economic crisis and coronavirus. Hi everyone, I\u2019m Molly Blackall, taking over the live blog for the next few hours. I\u2019ll be bringing you breaking news on the coronavirus pandemic from around the world. If you spot anything you think we should be reporting on in this blog, you can drop me a message on Twitter. Thanks in advance! The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has threatened to pull out of the World Health Organization (WHO) over \u201cideological bias\u201d, after the US president, Donald Trump, announced the severance of all US ties with the WHO at the end of May. Ireland has revised its schedule for the gradual re-opening of the economy over the coming months and is set to speed up the easing of coronavirus restrictions. Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in London for an anti-racism rally in defiance of calls to avoid mass gatherings. It came after UK home secretary, Priti Patel, urged protesters not to gather for Black Lives Matter and George Floyd demonstrations during the pandemic. Madrid residents wearing face masks queued two metres apart to be among the first visitors back in the Spanish capital\u2019s famed galleries today as the country eases out of Covid-19 lockdown measures. The Prado, Reina Sofia and Thyssen-Bornemisza museums reopened after nearly three months of restrictions. Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism industry \u2013 decimated by the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 can reopen to foreign visitors later this summer but only under strict guidelines, officials have said. In the UK, a further 204 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19, according to newly released figures. It means the official Covid-19 death toll in the country is 40,465 as of 5pm yesterday, according to the Department of Health and Social Care figures, but the true number is thought to have already surpassed 50,000. In Turkey, people are enjoying their first weekend without Covid-19 lockdown in nearly two months after the country\u2019s president, Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, suddenly scrapped a stay-at-home order. Confirmed Covid-19 infections in Afghanistan have passed 19,000, amid a warning that the actual number of cases of the disease in the country may be much higher than official figures show. Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism industry \u2013 decimated by the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 can reopen to foreign visitors later this summer but only under strict guidelines, officials have said. Travellers will be able to visit the country from August, Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism ministry said, but they must carry coronavirus-free certificates issued no earlier than 72 hours before boarding. Only those who will spend a minimum of five days in Sri Lanka will be allowed in. It comes after the country was only just recovering from the devastating impact of last year\u2019s Easter Sunday bombings, in which 279 were killed, when the pandemic halted international travel. Hotels shut, leaving tens of thousands of people jobless. AFP reports that even with the certificates, tourists will have to take a virus test at the airport upon arrival. A further check will be done four to five days later - and a third if staying for more than 10 days. \u201cWhile this may be inconvenient it is essential to safeguard everybody and provide peace of mind,\u201d the ministry said. Visa fees will increase in price from $40 to $100, with visitors only allowed to stay in hotels designated by the ministry. They will not be allowed to use public transport on the island. The country has reported 11 deaths and 1,801 confirmed infections since its first coronavirus patient was identified on 27 January. Visitor numbers to Sri Lanka dropped to 1.91 million last year, down from 2.33 million in the previous year. In the UK, a further 204 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19, according to newly released figures. It means the official Covid-19 death toll in the country is 40,465 as of 5pm yesterday, according to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) figures, but the true number is thought to have already surpassed 50,000. According to the health department, 284,868 people have tested positive for the disease as of 9am today. But the department again failed to provide a daily figure for the number of people tested, explaining it has been \u201ctemporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting across all pillars\u201d. In Turkey, people are enjoying their first weekend without Covid-19 lockdown in nearly two months after the country\u2019s president, Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, suddenly scrapped a stay-at-home order. Cafes, restaurants and other facilities reopened on Monday as infection rates slowed and restrictions on intercity travel were lifted. Erdo\u011fan had intended to maintain the weekend lockdown, applied to big cities since 11 April, until a public backlash. Today people have flooded beaches and shores in Istanbul, and hundreds queued to get into parks, Reuters reports. In the capital, Ankara, day-trippers caused traffic jams. \u201cThe last time I was here was 70 days ago,\u201d Gulay Cevik, a housewife in Istanbul fishing in the Eminonu district told Reuters. I would always come here to fish, but since the outbreak we\u2019ve had to protect ourselves a bit. But I really missed it.\u201d Cevdet Akaydan, a 23-year-old public servant, was out swimming with his friends along the shore in western Istanbul. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice, very clean and cool right now, it relaxes you,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone should come, and go in ... You can\u2019t explain it, you have to experience it.\u201d But Erdo\u011fan has expressed concern that infections could rebound. On Friday, 930 new coronavirus cases were reported, after a drop to 786 earlier in the week. So far, 4,648 people have died from the virus in Turkey, with 168,340 infections. \u201cYou really get giddy like a child. It\u2019s lockdown, lockdown, lockdown,\u201d said Cem Pehlivan, a textile worker fishing in Istanbul. \u201cNow I feel really good, I\u2019m comfortable and the weather\u2019s fine.\u201d Madrid residents wearing face masks queued two metres apart to be among the first visitors back in the Spanish city\u2019s famed galleries today as the country eases out of Covid-19 lockdown measures. The Prado, Reina Sofia and Thyssen-Bornemisza museums reopened after nearly three months of restrictions. \u201cI was really looking forward to coming back. To see how it has come back to life makes me very emotional,\u201d masters student Alejandro Elizalde told Reuters, wiping away tears while viewing Diego de Velazquez\u2019s \u201cLas Meninas\u201d, one of the Prado\u2019s most famous paintings. State-run museums were shut on 12 March as part of measures imposed to curb the spread of the disease, which has now seen the death toll top 27,000 with more than 240,000 confirmed cases. Restrictions have been lifted gradually, with Madrid one of the slowest places to ease curbs as it was among the worst hit. The Prado and Reina Sofia are not yet fully open, but many masterpieces, including works by Velazquez and Goya in the Prado and Picasso\u2019s \u201cGuernica\u201d in the Reina Sofia, are on display. Health measures are in force, including physical distancing, reduced capacity and timed tickets for visits. Staff took visitors\u2019 temperatures as they entered the Prado. \u201cIt\u2019s a really weird feeling and at the same time it\u2019s really good because I\u2019ve never been in the Reina Sofia with so few people,\u201d business developer Elena V\u00e1zquez said. Spain will further ease the lockdown in Madrid and Barcelona from Monday, when bar and restaurant patrons will be allowed to sit inside rather than just on outdoor terraces. And in over half the country, nightclubs will be allowed to reopen, but dancing will not be permitted. The government is instead suggesting dance floor space be used for tables. Here\u2019s a comprehensive video explainer from my Guardian US colleague, reporter Kenya Evelyn, detailing why the unrest sparked by the police killing of George Floyd could be a defining moment for racial politics in America, and how the Covid-19 pandemic set the backdrop for the protests. And here\u2019s an additional piece which Evelyn has written on how Floyd\u2019s struggles resonate with many black Americans. She writes: While his death has come to symbolize the plight of black people navigating the criminal justice system, for many, Floyd\u2019s life and the timing of his killing underscores the burden of being black in America, and created the spark that lit this week\u2019s uprising.\u201d Confirmed Covid-19 infections in Afghanistan have passed 19,000, amid a warning that the actual number of cases of the disease in the country may be much higher than official figures show. The health ministry has detected 582 new cases from 761 tests, according to the latest update, bringing the total number of infections to 19,551. Eighteen patients also died overnight, meaning the country\u2019s Covid-19 death toll stands at 327. There have been 1,830 recoveries. It comes as the health ministry has announced new measures imposed from today to help contain the spread of the virus, including that masks must be worn in public places, two-metre physical distancing must be maintained and gatherings of more than 10 people should be avoided. Elderly people should not leave their homes and workplaces must be disinfected. At a press conference on Saturday, deputy health minister Wahid Majrooh pledged that 14 new testing labs would be launched in Afghanistan. Last week, the International Rescue Committee warned about the low capacity of testing and said the Afghan health ministry had the capacity to test 2,000 suspected patients each day, but were receiving between 10,000 and 20,000 samples each day. Speaking at the same conference, Kabul\u2019s governor, Mohammad Yakub Haidary, said: I receive calls during nights and days, from ordinary people and officials, saying that their relatives are either sick or died. [The] number of infections is more than what we imagine, in Kabul, it may be more than a million as testing capacity is too low. There is a catastrophe going on in Kabul, we have suspected deaths which we didn\u2019t have previously, and we didn\u2019t have burials during nights but now, we have it. I seriously ask people of Kabul and all around the country to wear masks, we will monitor and publish those who don\u2019t wear it. Also, respect social distancing.\u201d Most of the new cases were reported in the western province of Herat, where 193 out of 200 tests returned positive results. Herat borders Iran \u2013 which has been badly hit by the pandemic \u2013 and the first case of the virus was reported in the province after thousands of Afghan migrants returned from the neighbouring country in February and March, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined. The total number of infections in Herat is 3,621 with 64 deaths. In the capital, Kabul, 161 new cases have been recorded. In the remote province of Kunar, five patients tested all returned positive results, as seven patients died of Covid-19 overnight. In Helmand, two patients tested in the last 24 hours both were positive and the province recorded its first death. Meanwhile, amid continuing conflict, at least 20 Afghan security forces personnel were killed in two incidents in the last 24 hours. Ten Afghan security forces were killed on Friday in an attack by the Taliban on the Zabul-Kandahar highway near the city of Qalat, in Zabul province, local officials said. Eleven members of the Afghan local police, including their commander, were killed in a roadside bomb blast in Badakhshan province on Friday night, the provincial police spokesman said. It\u2019s Simon Murphy here taking back the reins of the global live blog, with thanks to my colleague, Jedidajah Otte, for covering while I was on a break. The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has threatened to pull out of the World Health Organization (WHO) over \u201cideological bias\u201d, after US president Donald Trump announced the severance of all US ties with the WHO at the end of May. Brazil now has the world\u2019s third-highest number of Covid-19 deaths. Fuelling the debate raging around the pandemic, its origins and the best way to respond, Bolsonaro criticised the World Health Organization for suspending clinical trials of the drug hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 - a decision it reversed this week - and threatened to follow in Trump\u2019s footsteps by quitting. \u201cI\u2019m telling you right now, the United States left the WHO, and we\u2019re studying that, in the future. Either the WHO works without ideological bias, or we leave, too,\u201d the far-right leader told journalists. Dubbed the \u201cTropical Trump\u201d, Bolsonaro has followed the US president in his handling of the pandemic, downplaying its severity, attacking stay-at-home measures and touting the purported effects of hydroxychloroquine against Covid-19. Dutch mink farms have begun a government-ordered mass cull amid concern that animals infected with coronavirus could transmit the illness to humans. Infected mink have been found on 10 Dutch farms where the ferret-like animals are bred for their fur, according to the country\u2019s Food &amp; Wares Authority, Reuters reports. The government ordered the cull of 10,000 mink on Wednesday after determining that affected farms could act as a long-term reservoir of disease. Dutch mink were first infected with coronavirus by their handlers in April. In May, the government identified two cases in which humans had been infected by sick animals - the only animal-to-human transmissions known since the global outbreak began in China. Infected mink don\u2019t necessarily develop signs of disease, making them potential silent sources of the pandemic virus, said Arjan Stegeman, a veterinary epidemiologist at Utrecht University who is investigating the outbreak, according to Bloomberg. Groups opposed to the fur trade say the outbreak is another reason to close all farms. Ireland has revised its schedule for the gradual re-opening of the economy over the coming months and is set to speed up the easing of coronavirus restrictions, Reuters reports. From 8 June, the country will enter phase two, which will allow for people to travel within their own county, or up to 20km from their homes, and gatherings of a maximum of six people indoors. All retail outlets can reopen, while shopping centres can reopen on 15 June. Public libraries and outdoor facilities and amenities for children can also open. Phase three is set to begin on 29 June, when all domestic travel restrictions will be lifted, and cafes and restaurants can open with physical distancing and strict cleaning in operation. Bars can operate as restaurants where possible, and places of worship, museums and galleries can reopen, as well as hotels, hostels and caravan parks. From 20 July, Ireland will move to phase four, which will see theatres, cinemas, nightclubs reopening where social distancing measures can function. Some sports team leagues can resume with limitations on numbers of spectators, Hairdressers and barbers, cr\u00e8ches, childminders and pre-schools for children of non-essential workers can open their doors again. The government is due to review a 14-day quarantine for arrivals from abroad on 18 June. The prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said he hopes non-essential international travel can resume some time later in the summer. The measures planned in each of the remaining phases of the plan will be reviewed if there is a sharp rise in the number of infections, hospital admissions or deaths. Tomoya Saito, the director of the department of health crisis management at Japan\u2019s National Institute of Public Health, explains how Japan got coronavirus under control by painstakingly tracking infections in the population. The British home secretary, Priti Patel, has urged protesters in the UK not to gather for Black Lives Matter and George Floyd demonstrations during the pandemic. \u201cWe are in a health pandemic across the United Kingdom, and coronavirus is a deadly virus, and of course I\u2019d say to those that want to protest: \u2018Please don\u2019t.\u2019 \u201cWe must put public health first at this particular time,\u201d she said in an interview with Sky.. Hello, I\u2019m briefly taking over from my colleague Simon Murphy while he has a break. If you have any updates to flag you can contact me either on Twitter @JedySays or you can email me. India has overtaken Italy as the sixth worst-hit country in the coronavirus pandemic after another biggest single-day rise in confirmed infections. India\u2019s health ministry reported 9,887 new cases on Saturday, bringing the official total to 236,657. It means it now has fewer confirmed cases than only the US, Brazil, Russia, UK and Spain. As Black Lives Matter protests continue across the world, thousands took to the streets in Sydney. Aerial footage shows demonstrators snaking through the Australian city on a Stop All Black Deaths in Custody rally. It was declared an authorised public assembly minutes before its scheduled start time of 3pm, after a court ruling was overturned. In Russia, 197 more people have died with coronavirus in the last 24 hours, bringing the country\u2019s official death toll to 5,725. There were 8,855 new cases, according to officials, pushing the total number of infections to 458,689. Italy hopes other EU countries will reopen their borders to its citizens on 15 June, the country\u2019s foreign minister has said, as travel restrictions across Europe are gradually eased. In South Africa, as cases rise in the Western Cape province \u2013 the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak \u2013 doctors are voicing concern about other diseases being neglected while medical attention is focused on the pandemic. Indonesia has reported its biggest daily rise in infections, with 993 new cases, taking its total official number to 30,514. In Nepal, climbers who earn a living supporting international expeditions to the summit of Everest have been left destitute by the cancellation of this year\u2019s climbing season. Scientists expect to be able to declare next week that New Zealand is coronavirus-free. Italy hopes other EU countries will reopen their borders to its citizens on 15 June, the country\u2019s foreign minister has said, as Covid-19 travel restrictions across Europe are gradually eased. Italy, which has the world\u2019s fourth-highest coronavirus death toll, opened its doors to other EU citizens on 3 June, but most European countries are still largely off-limits for Italian nationals. \u201c15 June is an important date for many of our citizens,\u201d Luigi Di Maio told a news conference during a visit to neighbouring Slovenia. Germany and Switzerland have indicated that they could open their borders to Italians from that date, Di Maio said. Reuters reports that he said he hoped border openings would apply to people from all parts of Italy, including those areas worst-affected by the outbreak. Speaking at the same press conference, the Slovenian foreign minister, Anze Logar said: \u201cHealth conditions in Italy are improving fast ... I\u2019m looking optimistically towards 15 June.\u201d Italy has reported about 234,500 confirmed coronavirus cases and 33,770 deaths. Slovenia, which declared an end to its coronavirus epidemic last month, has reported 1,479 coronavirus cases and 109 deaths. It has allowed the entry of people from neighbouring Croatia, Hungary and Austria in recent weeks. French Polynesia, which comprises more than 100 islands in the South Pacific, will open to international travel next month in a bid to salvage its vital tourism industry. The French overseas territory, which has reported just 60 cases of Covid-19 and no deaths, stopped international flights in March amid the pandemic. But, with no tourists able to visit for three months and hotels shut, AFP reports that there have been calls to ease restrictions to help restart the ailing economy. \u201cWe are going to open up our country even more to save jobs,\u201d said President Edouard Fritch, adding that nearly 19,000 Polynesians have jobs in or related to the tourism sector. On 3 July citizens will be allowed to return and quarantine restrictions on arrivals will also be eased. From 15 July, it will once again accept international tourism from its main markets in Europe and the US. \u201cWe are no longer in a health emergency, but we are facing an economic and social emergency,\u201d said tourism and employment minister Nicole Bouteau. In South Africa, as Covid-19 cases rise in the Western Cape province \u2013 the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak \u2013 doctors are voicing concern about other diseases being neglected while medical attention is focused on the pandemic. The Western Cape province, a popular tourist destination home to the coastal city of Cape Town, accounts for 66% of South Africa\u2019s 43,434 coronavirus cases and 77% of the 908 deaths. Meanwhile, provincial authorities predict infections will almost quadruple to 100,000 in coming weeks. AFP reports that many medical practitioners have been moved from specialised wards such as oncology and anaesthesiology to help treat Covid-19 patients \u2013 meaning a large number of other patients could be left in the lurch as a result. Around half the staff at Cape Town\u2019s Groote Schuur hospital have been earmarked for redeployment as the pandemic moves towards an expected peak between the end of June and the beginning of July. Experts fear this could affect planned surgeries and other services, according to AFP. \u201cThe intense focus on Covid has created a backlog of patients with non-Covid diseases who are not able to access care,\u201d a group of doctors from Groote Schuur wrote in the South African Medical Journal last month. \u201cMany cancer diagnoses and hence treatments have been delayed, as have joint replacements and cataract surgery,\u201d the doctors said, warning that patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes and asthma had \u201cmissed appointments\u201d. \u201cMany are unable to access medications,\u201d they added. Meanwhile, several hospitals in Cape Town told AFP that they had stopped elective imaging, procedures and surgery, while outpatient clinics had been scaled down. Many patients have also avoided hospital visits for fear of contracting the virus. University of Cape Town oncologist Jeanette Parkes said all routine check-ups had been cancelled. It is estimated that the virus will create a backlog of about 150,000 procedures in South Africa, according to the Cape Town-based professors Bruce Biccard and Lydia Cairncross in a recent article published in the country\u2019s online Daily Maverick. Poland is planning to extend a ban on international flights until 16 June, according to reports. Citing a government decree, state-run news agency PAP reported the news last night. It comes after state-controlled Polish airlines LOT restarted flights between the country\u2019s biggest cities, including Warsaw, Gdansk, Krakow, and Wroclaw, from 1 June. As of Friday, Poland has reported 25,410 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 1,137 deaths. More from the Black Lives Matter protest in Sydney, which saw thousands take to the city\u2019s streets to protest. Aerial footage shows demonstrators snaking through the Australian city as at least 2,000 people marched on the \u2018Stop All Black Deaths in Custody\u2019 rally. It was declared an authorised public assembly minutes before its scheduled start time of 3pm, after a court ruling was overturned. Thousands of protesters are marching in cities and towns across Australia against indigenous deaths in custody and the killing of George Floyd in the United States. Indonesia has reported its biggest daily rise in Covid-19 infections, with 993 new cases, taking its total official number to 30,514. Health ministry official Achmad Yurianto reported 31 new coronavirus fatalities, bringing the country\u2019s official death toll to 1,801. However, it has been reported that the true number of deaths in the country \u2013 the fourth most populous in the world \u2013 could be far higher. Elsewhere, the Philippines\u2019 health ministry has reported seven new coronavirus deaths and 714 additional infections. It means the total confirmed coronavirus deaths in the country stands at 994, while official cases have reached 21,340. More from the news earlier that India has overtaken Italy as the sixth worst-hit country in the coronavirus pandemic after another biggest single-day rise in confirmed infections. India\u2019s health ministry reported 9,887 new cases on Saturday, bringing the official total to 236,657. It means it now has fewer confirmed cases than only the United States, Brazil, Russia, Britain and Spain. India\u2019s official Covid-19 death toll \u2013 at 6,642 \u2013 remains relatively low compared to the other countries. Reuters reports that Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government is attempting to jump-start the economy, which has been crippled by the epidemic, and put millions back to work. The government is easing its lockdown of the 1.3 billion population imposed in March, with restrictions loosened from Monday, but some experts are worried it is too soon. Giridhar R Babu, epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India, in particular, questioned the re-opening of religious places. \u201cWe can survive and sustain the gains without ... opening up religious places for some time,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Concerts, sporting events and political rallies are still banned. On Friday, the World Health Organization (WHO) highlighted how India\u2019s lockdown had helped it dampen down transmission of the disease, but warned there was a risk the cases could rise again. \u201cAs India and in other large countries open up and people begin to move there is always a risk of the disease bouncing back up,\u201d Dr Mike Ryan, head of WHO\u2019s emergencies programme, told a news conference in Geneva. People visiting places of worship will be asked to wash their hands and feet, and there will be no distribution of food offerings, sprinkling of holy water or touching of idols and holy books. In Russia, 197 more people have died with coronavirus in the last 24 hours, bringing the country\u2019s official death toll to 5,725. There were 8,855 new cases of the virus, according to officials, pushing the total number of infections to 458,689. It comes after it emerged earlier this week that new mortality data from Russia\u2019s second-largest city reignited questions about whether the country\u2019s official tally has discounted thousands of deaths tied to the coronavirus outbreak. St Petersburg issued 1,552 more death certificates this May than in the previous year, a nearly 32% rise indicating that hundreds of deaths tied to the pandemic are not reflected in the city\u2019s official coronavirus death toll for the month of 171. In Nepal, climbers who earn a living supporting international expeditions to summit Everest have been pushed into destitution by the cancellation of this year\u2019s climbing season amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Fundraising has been launched by climbers to support the community of porters, cooks and guides left without any income since the government cancelled climbing permits and stopped international flights, the Guardian reports today in a piece by Roshan Sedhai in Kathmandu, Amelia Gentleman and Pete Pattisson. Nirmal Purja, a record-breaking Nepali mountaineer who is currently in lockdown in Winchester, is attempting to raise funds for colleagues : \u201cThe community [in Nepal] is suffering. Some people don\u2019t even have food to put on the table. It\u2019s the saddest thing.\u201d International mountaineering companies have continued to pay their staff, but the smaller ones have not. Parts of the climbing season have been cancelled in the past due to natural disasters but this is the first time a season has been cancelled in its entirety. \u201cThere are so many porters whose livelihood relies on what they carry. This is the time they make money that sustains them throughout the rest of the year,\u201d Purja said. \u201cNo one should be starving.\u201d Top Nepali guides can earn between \u00a34,000 to \u00a312,000 a season \u2013 more than 50 % of their annual income \u2013 but thousands of helpers get by on a more precarious living. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any tourists now. The streets are totally deserted... It\u2019s becoming hard to survive,\u201d said Suman Rai, a porter based in Lukla. Over half a million people working in tourism have been impacted by the lockdown, according to the department of tourism, but the government is still discussing how to support them. As countries around the world continue to grapple with Covid-19, scientists expect to be able to declare next week that New Zealand is virus-free. An anonymous woman in Auckland was the last confirmed case in the country, which has suffered 22 deaths with thousands also losing their jobs as a result of the economic impact of the disease. But Charlotte Graham-McLay reports from the capital Wellington that \u201cas New Zealanders look to the hundreds of thousands of deaths recorded in other countries, there is a sense that the rest of the world faced a different pandemic, the disastrous scale of which never fully arrived here\u201d. In the piece, she adds: Now, providing there are no new and unexpected cases to marr the country\u2019s 14-day streak of zero fresh instances of Covid-19, scientists say they expect to be able to declare next week that the virus has been eliminated from New Zealand \u2013 making it the first country among the OECD group of wealthy nations, and the first country that has recorded more than 100 cases to make such a statement, analysts said.\u201d The last person known to have contracted the virus domestically from an unknown source was diagnosed on 29 April and they remained in quarantine until 18 May, according to data provided to the Guardian by the Ministry of Health. The health ministry says elimination of Covid-19 could be declared 28 days after the last confirmed domestic case of the illness had left quarantine \u2013 which would be on 15 June. Nick Wilson, a public health specialist from the University of Otago, described the data as \u201cpretty reassuring\u201d, adding: \u201cAccording to our model that would put us nearly at the 99% probability of elimination.\u201d Shaun Hendy, a scientist at the University of Auckland, who was involved in a study used by New Zealand\u2019s health ministry that predicted tens of thousands of deaths if the virus was not contained, added: \u201cThere\u2019s a very high chance that we\u2019ve eliminated the disease domestically and there\u2019s so few parts of the world that have the options and choices we do.\u201d But elimination is \u201can ongoing process\u201d, New Zealand\u2019s director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, cautioned on Wednesday. I\u2019ll be handing over to Simon Murphy in the UK now. Thanks for reading. United Airlines will close cabin crew bases in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Frankfurt, as the airline industry continues to reel from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The Chicago-based airline said the move would cost 840 jobs, according to a report in the South China Morning Post. \u201cIn the current and future environment, we simply are not able to sustain an in-flight base at these locations,\u201d United\u2019s senior vice-president of in-flight services, John Slater, said. \u201cWe recognise that closing any base places a hardship on those who live near those locations.\u201d One estimate puts the crowd in Sydney at 30,000. A reminder the protest was considered unlawful until a last-minute decision by the NSW court of appeal. Meanwhile, Black Lives Matter protests are continuing in Australia. This is the scene in Sydney. The NHS Providers deputy chief executive, Saffron Cordery, has said NHS Trusts received \u201clittle or no consultation\u201d ahead of the government\u2019s announcement on imminent changes to face covering regulations. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said on Friday that all hospital visitors and outpatients will need to wear face coverings and hospital staff must use surgical masks as of 15 June, the Press Association reports. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman added that, while members of the public are \u201cstrongly urged\u201d to attend hospital wearing a face covering, no one will be denied care and masks will be provided by the hospital if necessary. But Cordery said in a statement that a lack of forewarning from the government has left NHS Trusts scrambling to find enough equipment to cater for hospital staff, patients and visitors. \u201c(The announcement) of compulsory mask wearing for all NHS staff working in any part of a hospital is clearly designed to help to ensure that both staff and patients are protected and feel safe,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, as is the case for a number of announcements throughout the pandemic, this has come with little or no consultation with the NHS frontline and without a plan in place to ensure that all trusts will have access to adequate supplies of type one and two masks.\u201d Cordery added that trusts were nervous about the imminent lifting of some patient visiting restrictions from 15 June. \u201cWe know that trusts want to do all they can to ensure that patients can have contact with their loved ones while in hospital, but there is understandably nervousness and concern about opening up visiting too quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cTrusts need time to put in place processes and guidance to ensure that patients can receive visitors safely and while adhering to social distancing and infection control measures. \u201cImportant decisions like these should not come as a surprise to those expected to deliver them.\u201d Here is a look at how the crowd grew at a Black Lives Matter protest in the Australian city of Adelaide. You might have missed this interesting news out of the US earlier today. The NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, has said the league was wrong not to listen to listen to players who spoke publicly about racism in America. \u201cWe, the National Football League, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,\u201d said Goodell. \u201cWe, the National Football League, believe black lives matter.\u201d Read more on that here. \u202aPolice and organisers are now discussing extending the Sydney Black Lives Matter march to Prince Alfred Park out of concerns Belmore Park will reach capacity. In excess of 10,000 people are marching, and many are still in the city walking, yet to reach Belmore Park\u202c. Hello everyone, Luke Henriques-Gomes, taking over the blog from Josh Taylor. Thanks Josh. Protesters in Sydney have begun marching from Town Hall to Belmore Park. As they turned from Bathurst Street into Castlereagh Street, they paused to \u201ctake a knee\u201d. Here\u2019s the latest on global coronavirus news: Australia\u2019s deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, has said warnings by China that its citizens are not safe from racial attacks related to the coronavirus pandemic in Australia are based on \u201cfalse information\u201d Tens of thousands of people have turned out for Black Lives Matter protests in cities across Australia, including in Sydney after an appeals court ruled the protest lawful Germany reported 407 new cases of coronavirus, while India overtook Italy in the number of confirmed cases and South Korea reported 51 new cases The G20 has pledged $21bn to fight coronavirus The Australian state of Victoria recorded no new cases of coronavirus for the first time since the pandemic began, but one Melbourne man who travelled to Bundaberg has tested positive in Queensland The mood at Melbourne\u2019s Black Lives Matter protest was at times mournful and often angry. Many speakers told the crowd \u2013 which stretched a block in each direction \u2013 that Australia had a shameful history that continued to this day \u2013 pointing to the 434 First Nations people who have died in police custody since the 1991 royal commission. Worse though was that it had taken the tragic death of an African American man, George Floyd, to draw attention to the plight of Indigenous Australians in this country. \u201cIt\u2019s the same story on different soil,\u201d Ky-ya Nicholson-Ward, 17, said of what has been happening in the US and in her own country. The speakers, who included family members of Indigenous people who had died in custody or from police actions such as Tanya Day and Kumanjayi Walker, led chants including \u201cWe can\u2019t breathe\u201d and \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d. Another chant involved those at the rally hitting their chests in unison to create the sound of a heartbeat. Warren Day, the son of Tanya, said: \u201cIt took George Floyd, an African American man, to put the spotlight on Australia\u2019s shame. \u201cFour-hundred and thirty-two Aboriginal deaths in custody since 1991 and still no convictions. \u201cWe need change and it needs to start happening now,\u201d he added. Those in the crowd, easily in the tens of thousands, almost all wore masks but struggled to social distance close to the stage. They carried placards with messages such as \u201cWe hear you\u201d, \u201cRacism is a pandemic\u201d and \u201cFuck the police\u201d. One of the organisers, Meriki Onus, said it was one of the largest protests she had seen in the city, including the massive Invasion Day rallies that have grown in size each 26 January. When African Australian artist Sampa The Great took to the stage to perform two songs with her younger sister, the rally briefly began to move as one. Some danced. Black lives matter, she said, \u201cbecause I woke up black today, and I\u2019m going to wake up black tomorrow\u201d. With that, the crowd turned on its heels and marched away from Parliament House. Leetona Dungay, the mother of Indigenous Australian man David Dungay who died in prison in 2015, is now addressing the Sydney crowd. She talks about how her son died while saying \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2013 like George Floyd. Dungay said he couldn\u2019t breathe 12 times before he died while being restrained by five prison guards at Long Bay jail hospital. The crowd hushes to hear her. She ends by saying black lives matter, to applause. The crowd is again chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d. In Sydney, a police officer has told the Guardian they\u2019ve received orders in line with the court of appeal decision, and are now treating this as a legal protest they are facilitating. Druitt Street and much of George Street are now closed. The same police officer told the Guardian he estimated about 4,000 people are at the protest. Police are making efforts to spread protesters out onto the now cleared roads. Protesters are observing space between each other, but the size of the protest has swelled so much that the 4 square metres/1.5 metres around each person appears unfeasible. The court of appeal decision will not be published until next week. AP reports India surpassed Italy as the sixth worst-hit country in the coronavirus pandemic after another biggest single-day spike in confirmed infections. The health ministry reported 9,887 new cases on Saturday, bringing the total to 236,657. Most of the new cases are in rural areas following the return of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers who left cities and towns after the lockdown in late March. The lockdown is now largely being enforced in high-risk areas while authorities have partially restored train services and domestic flights and allowed shops and manufacturing to reopen. Shopping malls and religious places are due to open on Monday with restrictions to avoid large gatherings. From the Brisbane, Queensland rally where thousands have turned out, via AAP: \u201cWe rise together and we speak in one voice against racism ... and legislation that takes away our freedom in this country ... our right to have a voice, our right to be free,\u201d the Wangan and Jagalingou man Adrian Burragubba said. Cheers and applause echoed through the streets as he called for justice and government-funded trauma support for families whose loved ones die in custody. \u201cWhile our people are dying in custody, our voice has gotta become louder, become a roar,\u201d he said. In a separate press conference, the Quandamooka woman and state environment minister Leeanne Enoch encouraged Queenslanders to speak out. \u201cThis issue is not just about turning up for one day, it is about turning up every day,\u201d she said. Here\u2019s how the Sydney protest greeted the news that organisers had been successful in overturning the New South Wales supreme court ruling preventing the protest from going ahead. More from the Melbourne rally, via AAP: One speaker remarked that it took the death of an African American man to put the spotlight on the deaths of Indigenous Australians. \u201cWe all bleed red because we are human,\u201d another speaker said, to shouts of support from the crowd. \u201cViolence has been here for a couple of hundred years and your system\u2019s nuts,\u201d said another speaker. There is a strong police presence with a police helicopter overhead. The mood among protesters and police is peaceful. Protesters are holding up banners with slogans such as \u201cinjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere\u201d and \u201ctolerating racism is racism\u201d. The New South Wales court of appeal has overturned a supreme court decision preventing a Black Lives Matter rally from going ahead in Sydney today. The protest will now proceed starting at 3pm. The Melbourne rally is very big, but lots of social distancing is going on. We are expecting a New South Wales court of appeal decision very soon on whether the Sydney Black Lives Matter protest can go ahead. As you can probably see by the previous posts, the protest is going ahead regardless, but it will just determine what powers police have in fining or arresting people at the protest. Police have escorted a counter-protester from the steps of Sydney Town Hall. Police have a large presence around the Town Hall area, but are not asking people to leave or fining anyone. There appear to be at least 2,000 people here now. And it\u2019s important to note, the protest isn\u2019t meant to begin for another half an hour. The light rail line across George Street has also now been shut. Organisers are frantically running around asking people to distance, which is now more feasible as the light rail track space has opened for protesters. Protesters on the steps are chanting \u201cwhose lives matter?\u201d To a response from the crowd \u201cblack lives matter\u201d. Protesters are also shouting \u201cI can\u2019t breath\u201d, a reference to the words of US man George Floyd when he was being retained by a Minneapolis policeman, and died after he put his knee into Floyd\u2019s neck for about 8 minutes. My other colleague Calla Wahlquist is at the Melbourne rally too and has some information on the cases some of the speakers are talking about. Elias Visontay reports a man holding an \u201call lives matter\u201d sign in Sydney was booed and taken away by police. Other reports suggest they went to have a talk with him in a nearby chocolate shop. Looks like most if not all at the Melbourne rally appear to be following the advice of the organisers about wearing a mask. Another Black Lives Matter rally in Byron Bay, on the far north coast of New South Wales. Just some more information on the Melbourne man who travelled to Bundaberg with coronavirus. The health department in Victoria has provided this information on his travels, confirming he was likely infections on his flight to Queensland: On Monday 1 June, the man caught a Skybus from Southern Cross Station to Melbourne Airport then flew to Queensland on Virgin flight VA313, which left Melbourne at 8am. He was likely infectious. The man is linked to a confirmed case from the Rydges on Swanston outbreak, but was not disclosed as a close contact so was not in quarantine when he left Victoria. Raul Bassi, the organiser of Sydney\u2019s protest who was told by the NSW supreme court yesterday the rally should not go ahead, is pacing around the Town Hall area telling people to keep to groups of 10 and observe distancing. \u201cThey need to be in groups of 10 only, it\u2019s very important today,\u201d Bassi told the Guardian. Bassi is explaining the legal issues with the protest. Volunteers are also handing out masks and sanitising hands. Protesters are already chanting \u201cno justice no peace\u201d. My colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes is in Melbourne, Victoria as the Black Lives Matter protest gets under way. According to AAP, police have lined the steps of the Victorian parliament on foot and horseback, and the atmosphere is peaceful. People are holding banners with slogans such as \u201cunited when all are equal\u201d and \u201csilence is violence\u201d. The Sydney rally isn\u2019t due to begin for another hour but already hundreds of protesters have gathered. Many are sitting on the steps of the Town Hall with signs that read \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d, \u201cI am sorry\u201d and \u201cracism is a pandemic too\u201d. There is already a noticeable police presence, with officers on foot and bikes. Thousands have rallied in Adelaide as part of Black Lives Matter protests across Australia on Saturday, AAP reports. Police gave special permission for the event to proceed despite Covid-19 restrictions. The rally joined calls for justice for US man George Floyd, who died while being arrested in Minneapolis, and also drew attention to the number of Aboriginal people who have died in custody. Many of those attending wore masks and made some efforts to socially distance, though large groups appeared to be in close contact. Speaker Jack Buckskin welcomed the large turnout, telling the gathering whether Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal, they were all part of the same society. \u201cThis is about us coming together as people,\u201d he said. \u201cToday we stand united. Our movement happens with people. \u201cWe want people to walk alongside us. This is what Aboriginal people have been asking for.\u201d The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 407 to 183,678, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Friday. The reported death toll rose by 33 to 8,646. Via Reuters. Via AP: South Korea on Saturday reported 51 new cases of Covid-19, mostly in the densely populated capital region, as authorities scramble to stem transmissions among low-income workers who can\u2019t afford to stay home. The figures announced by South Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention brought national totals to 11,719 cases and 273 deaths. At least 34 of the new cases were linked to door-to-door sellers hired by Richway, a Seoul-based health product provider. The vice-health minister, Kim Gang-lip, said the spread of the virus among Richway sellers was particularly alarming as most of them are in their 60s and 70s. He called for officials to strengthen their efforts to find and examine workplaces vulnerable to infections. More than 120 infections have also been linked to a massive warehouse operated by Coupang, a local e-commerce giant, which has been accused of failing to properly implement preventive measures and having employees work even when sick. Local women, Jessica Large, Candice Sharman and Monique Dawson, queued up to have their photo taken with Joe Williams after the protest. They said they came to the protest because \u201call lives matter\u201d. Large and Sharman are both Indigenous. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot shit happen that should not,\u201d Large said. \u201cI wanted to come out today and show my support.\u201d \u201cMy grandfather was Aboriginal, so it means a lot,\u201d said Sharman, who added that she was \u201cdevastated\u201d to see the video of the violent arrest of the 16-year-old Aboriginal boy in Sydney this week. \u201cThey see everything that\u2019s going on in America, how could they do that here? Australia\u2019s meant to be a free country. I understand he might have been doing something wrong but they have other resources to control people.\u201d When asked about the Sydney protest being cancelled, Large said: \u201cI understand but at the same time it\u2019s a bit ridiculous, like everyone else was protesting in Melbourne and everywhere else. What does it matter? Really, we\u2019ve had hardly any cases of Covid-19, and we\u2019re only staying in our tight groups and keeping our distance from other people. Unless you\u2019re purposefully getting close to people, there\u2019s no risk.\u201d They said hearing about the police banning the Sydney protest made them even more determined to come to today\u2019s protest in Wagga. Sharman said: \u201cWe were already planning to come but it just made us want to come 100% more.\u201d Speaking after the Wagga Wagga march, organiser Joe Williams said he thought the march was \u201cbeautiful\u201d. He said Wagga Wagga was the \u201cmost progressive\u201d community he has ever been involved with and felt hopeful that systemic change could happen. \u201cEvery person of authority was here today \u2013 the local mayor, the local member, the police \u2013 they want to see a change systematically as well, not just locally.\u201d But he acknowledged the size of the task: \u201cThere have been 434 deaths since the royal commission. Royal commissions are supposed to clear these things up. Where are the recommendations then that are coming from the royal commission? What we have to do is look systematically at where the issues are. How are we going to stop killing Aboriginal people in custody? That\u2019s 200 years of oppression, that\u2019s 200 years of mistreatment.\u201d While the rally organisers in Sydney are appealing the New South Wales supreme court decision to stop the Black Lives Matter protest, the police came out with this strong statement. Big turnout for the Black Lives Matter rally in Brisbane, Queensland. Western Australia has recorded one new case of coronavirus and two historical cases. The new case is another person in hotel quarantine after returning from overseas, while blood tests confirmed a couple who returned overseas in March also had the virus. Quite a big rally in Adelaide, South Australia, where the Black Lives Matter protest was allowed to proceed. McCormack says the statement from China is \u201cnot true\u201d because there hasn\u2019t been waves of attacks on Chinese people in Australia. Worth noting, that\u2019s not correct. A survey in April recorded 178 incidents in two weeks against Asian-Australians. Australia\u2019s deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, says China\u2019s warning of racist attacks for visitors to Australia is a \u201cmoot point\u201d because the borders are still closed. \u201cPeople of China know this is a great country to visit,\u201d he says. He said the allegations made are based on \u201cfalse information\u201d. He says Australia is a culture based on tolerance and respect. Gabrielle Jackson, who is at the Black Lives Matter protest in Wagga Wagga, in southern New South Wales, reports: At least 1,000 people marched down the main street of Wagga Wagga today in a Black Lives Matter protest march, chanting \u201cAll lives matter when black lives matter\u201d before taking a knee and raising right fists in silence for two minutes. The march organiser, Joe Williams \u2013 a local Wiradjuri/Wolgalu man and former Rabbitohs rugby league star \u2013 joked he\u2019d only expected 100 people to show up as the large crowd was ushered into the town\u2019s amphitheatre while being urged to respect social distancing rules (although Wagga has had few cases of Covid-19 and no deaths). While acknowledging systemic problems of police brutality, Williams thanked the local police for \u201cbending over backwards to make this happen\u201d. He said the state member, independent Joe McGirr, the mayor and the council had been supportive of the protest. He urged the crowd to \u201cmake it your business not to turn a blind eye\u201d to racism. \u201cWhen you hear it in your circles, pull it up. Walk with us, talk with us,\u201d he said. \u201cRacism ain\u2019t a black issue, racism ain\u2019t a white issue. Racism is a people issue and you\u2019ve got to do your bit to stamp it out.\u201d AAP is reporting: A Melbourne man was infectious with Covid-19 when he flew to Bundaberg via Brisbane for a fruit-picking job this week. The man, in his 20s, socialised with about 15 family members and friends during an overnight stay, before flying with Virgin to Bundaberg to work at a strawberry farm, the deputy premier, Steven Miles, said. Contact tracing for everyone who has been in contact with the man is now under way. Four people who shared the accommodation with him have tested negative and a clinic has been set up at the farm where the man worked to test other people there. Once landing in Bundaberg, the man was collected by his employer, staying in shared accommodation and working a shift alongside other people. His diagnosis brings the state\u2019s total confirmed cases to 1,061 and health officials across the state have now carried out 205,628 tests. Here\u2019s a summary of where we are at in coronavirus news: China\u2019s ministry of culture and tourism has told Chinese citizens to avoid travelling to Australia, claiming racial discrimination and violence against Chinese people Organisers of a Black Lives Matter protest in Sydney are appealing a supreme court ruling preventing them from holding the protest later today The New South Wales police minister David Elliott has warned police are ready for people who may \u201cflout the law\u201d at the protest The World Health Organization has released guidance telling people over 60 or with health issues to wear masks when out and unable to physically distance Victoria reported no new cases of coronavirus for the first time since the pandemic began. New South Wales also reported no new cases Mexico reported 4,346 cases and 625 deaths The G20 has pledged $21bn to help fight coronavirus Via Reuters. China recorded three new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus as of the end of Friday, down from five the day before, the national health authority reported. All of the cases were imported, involving travellers arriving from abroad, the National Health Commission (NHC) said on its website. The NHC also confirmed two new asymptomatic cases, or people who are infected with the virus but do not show symptoms, compared with three the day before. The total number of infections in China, where the virus first emerged late last year, stands at 83,030. With no new deaths reported, the death toll remained 4,634. The organiser of the Sydney Stop All Black Deaths in Custody rally is lodging an urgent appeal after the supreme court refused to authorise it. \u201cThe organisers have received strong advice from lawyers across the legal community that the decision has significant flaws that amount to jurisdictional error,\u201d the Greens MP David Shoebridge said on Saturday. \u201cTaking the legal jargon away, the case will be that the judge got it wrong. That rally is in fact authorised and was agreed to by police.\u201d Shoebridge gave evidence in court on Friday in support of the rally. The rally organiser, Raul Bassi, said he expected to have 5,000 people gather at 3pm on Saturday and was planning to have marshals policing social distancing and handing out face masks and hand sanitiser. But after a four-hour hearing, the supreme court justice Desmond Fagan refused to approve the public assembly, citing the current coronavirus restrictions on mass gatherings. AAP reports that Australia\u2019s most populous state has recorded no new locally-acquired cases of coronavirus for the 10th day in a row. No new cases of Covid-19 were diagnosed from the 12,751 tests completed in the 24 hours to 8pm on Friday, NSW Health said on Saturday. The only infections reported since 27 May have been in hotel quarantine. \u201cNSW Health would like to thank those with symptoms for coming forward, getting tested and ensuring cases in the community are identified as quickly as possible,\u201d a statement said. \u201cWhile there have no new cases recorded in the past 24 hours, the virus is likely circulating among people in the community with mild symptoms. \u201cAs such, the risk of outbreaks and a resurgence of cases remains.\u201d The state no longer has any Covid-19 patients in intensive care and just 71 people being treating by health authorities. Some 341 cases remain active. NSW has recorded 3,110 cases in total, with 50 people dying in the state. The NSW police minister, David Elliott, says police are prepared for people to be \u201cflouting the law\u201d and turning up to the Black Lives Matter protest in Sydney today. \u201cPolice are prepared for anyone who just wants to flout the law. As tragic as it is that we are in a situation where freedom of speech isn\u2019t as free as we would like it to be at the moment, I am concerned that some people, particularly those incited by other MPs overnight, will turn up,\u201d he said. He appealed for people to be peaceful and to comply with police instructions, but would not be drawn on whether police would be prepared to arrest everyone gathered. Victoria police released data on the areas where people were fined $1652 for breaching public health orders. We\u2019ve had a bit of a dig into the data to look at the demographics in some of the most-fined and least-fined areas: In Stonnington, an affluent area in Melbourne\u2019s inner east, there were 82 fines issued by Victoria police to 17 May despite the area having the state\u2019s second-highest number of cases. Banyule, in the city\u2019s north-east, had the third-highest number of cases but had seen only 39 fines issued. Yet some heavily targeted areas with higher migrant populations or greater social housing density had relatively few cases. Police in Greater Dandenong, which has a high migrant population, issued 333 fines to 17 May despite there being only 15 cases recorded. Yarra, which despite being relatively affluent has a high proportion of social housing, saw 287 fines while recording only 29 cases. Via Reuters: The Group of 20 rich and emerging economies has pledged more than $21 billion to fight the coronavirus, the group said early on Saturday. \u201cThe G20, with invited countries, has coordinated the global efforts to support the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, G20 members and invited countries have pledged over US$21 billion to support funding in global health,\u201d the group said in a statement. The pledges will be directed towards diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics, and research and development, the statement added. In April the group called on all countries, non-governmental organisations, philanthropies and the private sector to help close a financing gap estimated at over $8 billion to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Saudi Arabia, the current G20 chair has pledged $500 million to support global efforts to combat the pandemic. It said then it would allocate $150 million to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation, $150 million to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisations, and $200 million to other health organisations and programmes. At least 391,108 people have died globally from COVID-19 and more than 6.68 million people have been infected by the novel coronavirus that causes it, following an outbreak that started in Wuhan, China, in early December. Via Reuters: Mexico\u2019s health ministry reported on Friday an additional 4,346 cases of the novel coronavirus in the country as well as 625 new deaths, bringing the country\u2019s confirmed total to 110,026 cases and 13,170 deaths. Victoria has recorded no new coronavirus cases for the first time since the pandemic began. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to achieve this through Victorians doing an incredible job of keeping themselves &amp; each other safe,\u201d the Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, tweeted. It comes as health authorities in the state are pleading with Black Lives Matters protesters not to go ahead with today\u2019s protest, amid fears the virus could spread. Organisers of the protest have told people attending to wear masks, observe social distancing, and not protest in groups larger than 20 people. There are 178 Covid-19 cases acquired through unknown transmission. Seven people are in hospital, with one in intensive care. So far, 1,586 people have recovered and 19 people have died in Victoria. Just a bit more on filming resuming in California from 12 June, according to Reuters, producers will need approval from local health officials before filming can restart. The guidelines developed by representatives from Disney, Netflix, Warner Bros, NBCUniversal and unions would require extensive coronavirus testing, daily symptom checks and other safeguards before actors and crew can return to work. Again on the China travel warning regarding Australia, the Australian opposition spokesman for housing, Jason Clare, told the ABC there had been a \u201cspike in racist abuse\u201d but said Australia is one of the safest countries in the world. \u201cThe borders are shut,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably be shut for some time until we\u2019ve got a treatment or a vaccine. But I\u2019m sure I speak on behalf of all of the tourist operators up and down and right across Australia when I say that we want to get tourists back when it\u2019s safe to do so. So I hope that the government is working with the Chinese government to ensure that when we can open the border again, we can get Chinese tourists back.\u201d Government MP Jason Falinski said the relationship with China was \u201cstrained\u201d and there had been unfortunate incidents in Australia, and it was something Australia and China needed to resolve. Good morning, and welcome to today\u2019s global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. I\u2019m Josh Taylor and I will be taking you through the news this morning. China\u2019s ministry of culture and tourism has told Chinese citizens to avoid travelling to Australia, claiming racial discrimination and violence against Chinese people in response to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThere has been an alarming increase recently in acts of racial discrimination and violence against Chinese and Asians in Australia, due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d the ministry said in a statement reported by Reuters. It did not give any specific examples of such discrimination or violence, but there have been reports in Australia and other countries like the US of people being racially abused due to the coronavirus pandemic. In other coronavirus news: The World Health Organization has issued new guidance advising people aged over 60 or with health issues to wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot physically distance The UK becomes the second country with 40,000 recorded Covid-19 deaths, following the US Sweden has recorded its third consecutive day of over 1,000 new cases Patients who have died or have been admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 have been found to have been deficient in vitamin K The US unemployment rate has dropped to 13.3%, with the US adding 2.5m jobs. Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro has threatened to pull the country out of the World Health Organization unless it stops being a \u201cpartisan political organisation\u201d Mass black lives matter protests will get under way in cities across Australia later this day, despite New South Wales police securing a court ruling banning the protest in Sydney, and the Victorian and federal governments warning against participating in the protests due to the risk of coronavirus",
