On Wednesday, Maloney was appointed to the select committee on the coronavirus crisis, a new oversight committee.<br><br>Here\u2019s Patel\u2019s statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Carolyn Maloney spent decades as an anti-vaccine movement leader giving validity to a dangerous creed threatening public health and the most vulnerable. </em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>The history of Maloney\u2019s anti-vaccine stances is long and dangerous: she authored ani-vaccine legislation; angrily berated a CDC Director during a congressional hearing because the CDC Director would not agree that vaccines cause autism; led a radical group of activists in a \u2018Green the Vaccine\u2019 rally outside of the steps of Congress; hosted radical anti-vaccine activists in Congress; and regularly claimed vaccines were as dangerous as smoking. <br></em></p> <p><em>It is dangerous and unthinkable to elevate her anti-science voice during the coronavirus crisis. The world is waiting on a vaccine to bring this horror to an end. This is no time to hand the mic to someone who endangers public health by questioning science. Appointing her to this position begs the question: How is a committee tasked with overseeing the development of a COVID-19 vaccine credible if Maloney, an anti-vaccine activist that questions the CDC\u2019s scientific findings on vaccines, is one of its leaders? <br></em></p> <p><em>Now more than ever we need elected officials who trust doctors, medicine, and science. Maloney does not fit the bill.

In a 2012 congressional testimony on autism, according to <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/03/11/maloney-no-longer-believes-vaccines-cause-autism/\">the New York Post</a>, Maloney said:<br><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And you\u2019ve got to listen, you know, to \u2014 I remember smoking.

Although non-US citizens were prohibited from entering the country if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks, American citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family members were exempt.

And in China, where officials shut down travel both in and out of Wuhan, the city where the Covid-19 outbreak began, the travel ban barely slowed the spread of diseases, according to a report published in Science.</p> <p>But there is no evidence that travel restrictions ultimately stopped the spread of coronavirus, or significantly reduced the contagion\u2019s death toll. </p> <p>Read more: </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/trump-coronavirus-travel-ban-europe-us\">Will Trump's coronavirus travel ban work?

      "bodyText": "Live reporting on the coronavirus continues in Friday\u2019s blog: Donald Trump implied that he\u2019d seen evidence proving the unproven theory that the coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. He also repeated claims that China favored Joe Biden over him in the election, during a White House event to review the government\u2019s efforts to protect senior citizens. Trump announced the creation of the Coronavirus Commission for Safety and Quality in Nursing Homes. The office of the director of national intelligence said the intelligence community does not believe coronavirus was manmade. The new statement comes amid reports that Trump has asked intelligence officials to investigate whether the virus originated from a Chinese government laboratory. Armed protestors demonstrated against the extension of shelter in place orders in Michigan. The demonstrators, some of whom were carrying assault rifles, compared the state\u2019s Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer to Hitler. Another 3.8 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, according to the latest data from the labor department. More than 30 million Americans have submitted unemployment claims in the past six weeks. Georgia will lift its statewide shelter-in-place order for most residents starting tomorrow. Republican governor Brian Kemp said the order remained in effect for the elderly and the \u201cmedically fragile,\u201d and he urged residents to still stay at home as much as possible. Looking for coronavirus updates from around the world? Catch up on The Guardian\u2019s global liveblog: Hundreds of protesters, some armed, gathered inside Michigan\u2019s state capitol on Thursday as state lawmakers debated the Democratic governor\u2019s request to extend her emergency powers to combat coronavirus. A tightly packed crowd of protesters, some carrying rifles, attempted to enter the floor of the legislative chamber, and were held back by a line of state police and capitol staff, according to video footage posted by local journalists. \u201cLet us in! Let us in!\u201d the protesters chanted, as they stood shoulder-to-shoulder inside the statehouse. Few of them were wearing face masks. Some of the protesters shouted anti-government slogans, including comparing the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, to Hitler. Joe Biden is expected to address allegations of sexual misconduct tomorrow on MSNBC. In recent days, new information has emerged about an allegation of sexual assault against Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, made by Tara Reade, a former aide. A former neighbor od Reade\u2019s told NPR on Wednesday that the two had spoke about the alleged assault 25 years ago. Health officials in Germany, the UK and the US are looking at antibody testing to figure out when and how their countries could open back up. Some authorities are even considering issuing \u201cimmunity passports\u201d that would help key workers safely and quickly return to their jobs. But some early Covid-19 antibody tests, and the research that hinges on them, have been deeply flawed. Infectious disease experts warn that while reliable antibody tests could eventually reveal much about how the disease spreads and how deadly it is, it is too early to draw any definitive conclusions from screening studies. Here\u2019s what you need to know: The Democratic National Committee\u2019s War Room director condemned Trump\u2019s scapegoating of China. \u201cTrump finally admitted the truth: he rolled over for China. Trump put his political fortunes first and our public health last,\u201d said Daniel Wessel in a statement to The Guardian. \u201cHe refused to call out China on its coronavirus response and delayed taking action to mitigate the crisis out of fear of upsetting his trade deal that has gone largely unfulfilled. Now Americans are suffering the consequences.\u201d Although Trump has taken an increasingly hostile stance toward China in recent days, a month ago, the president complimented the country\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis. During the White House event, Trump said that China would want his opponent Joe Biden to win the election. The president has recently been pushing the idea that China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus is proof that Beijing \u201cwill do anything they can\u201d to make him lose his re-election bid in November. The Guardian\u2019s Alison Rourke and Lily Kuo report: In an interview with Reuters, the US president said he was looking at different options in terms of consequences for Beijing over the virus. \u201cI can do a lot,\u201d he said, without going into detail. Trump has increasingly blamed China for the pandemic and on Wednesday again said Beijing should have let the world know about the coronavirus much sooner. He also speculated about retaliation: \u201cThere are many things I can do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for what happened.\u201d For the first time, Trump linked Beijing to his re-election chances in November. \u201cChina will do anything they can to have me lose this race,\u201d he said, adding that he believed China wants his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, to win the race to ease the pressure on US-China trade relations. \u201cThey\u2019re constantly using public relations to try to make it like they\u2019re innocent parties,\u201d he said of Chinese officials. Donald Trump has concluded his White House event to address protections for seniors. Although this was not billed as a coronavirus briefing, like his White House event yesterday \u2014 it really seemed like one. Trump veered off-topic, took questions from reporters, made the same misleading assertions he\u2019s made at previous coronavirus briefings ( I\u2019ve fact-checked a few of them below). Before signing off the president wondered out loud whether he should wear a mask when he travels to Arizona next week, leaving Washington for the first time in more than a month, in order to visit a Honeywell aerospace facility that has transitioned to producing N-95 masks. \u201cI\u2019ll have to see the climate,\u201d Trump said, adding that he would \u201chave no problem wearing a mask.\u201d \u201cShould I speak in a mask?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs that politically correct? A Democratic congressional candidate is arguing that a member of the committee in charge of overseeing stimulus money should step down over past comments she made on vaccines. The Guardian\u2019s senior political reporter Daniel Strauss reports: The candidate, Democrat Suraj Patel, is running for New York congresswoman Carolyn Maloney\u2019s seat. On Wednesday, Maloney was appointed to the select committee on the coronavirus crisis, a new oversight committee. Here\u2019s Patel\u2019s statement: Carolyn Maloney spent decades as an anti-vaccine movement leader giving validity to a dangerous creed threatening public health and the most vulnerable. The history of Maloney\u2019s anti-vaccine stances is long and dangerous: she authored ani-vaccine legislation; angrily berated a CDC Director during a congressional hearing because the CDC Director would not agree that vaccines cause autism; led a radical group of activists in a \u2018Green the Vaccine\u2019 rally outside of the steps of Congress; hosted radical anti-vaccine activists in Congress; and regularly claimed vaccines were as dangerous as smoking. It is dangerous and unthinkable to elevate her anti-science voice during the coronavirus crisis. The world is waiting on a vaccine to bring this horror to an end. This is no time to hand the mic to someone who endangers public health by questioning science. Appointing her to this position begs the question: How is a committee tasked with overseeing the development of a COVID-19 vaccine credible if Maloney, an anti-vaccine activist that questions the CDC\u2019s scientific findings on vaccines, is one of its leaders? Now more than ever we need elected officials who trust doctors, medicine, and science. Maloney does not fit the bill. I call on Speaker Pelosi to remove Representative Maloney from the Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis sending a message to America\u2019s doctors and scientists: we will always follow your lead. Maloney, who\u2019s been a member of Congress for over 25 years, has had to walk back past statements questioning the safety of vaccines for children. In a 2012 congressional testimony on autism, according to the New York Post, Maloney said: And you\u2019ve got to listen, you know, to \u2014 I remember smoking. I was on the City Council. I sat through so many hearings where they vowed smoking was not bad for your health. It\u2019s common sense it was bad for your health...The same thing seems to be here with vaccinations. There\u2019s too much verbal evidence coming from parents where they break down,[and say], \u2018I had a normal child, I gave him a vaccination, and then they came down with autism.\u2019 More recently a spokesperson for Maloney has said she does not believe there\u2019s a link between vaccinations and autism. On Wednesday Maloney was named by the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to the bipartisan select committee on the coronavirus crisis. Maloney is one of seven Democrats named to the committee. The committee is a high profile perch for a member of Congress. It is charged with oversight of the coronavirus stimulus package passed in Congress. Fact check: Is the virus manmade? Trump said he can\u2019t say why, but he\u2019s confident that the coronavirus originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. But the office of the director of national intelligence has said the intelligence community does not believe coronavirus was manmade. In a statement, the Office of the DNI said: \u201cThe Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.\u201d \u201cThe IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.\u201d Fact check: Travel ban Trump says the US is \u201cvery lucky\u201d that he enacted a travel \u201cban\u201d on China and a \u201cban on Europe\u201d. In fact, the administration\u2019s travel policy did not \u201ccut off\u201d all travel \u2013 from China. Although non-US citizens were prohibited from entering the country if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks, American citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family members were exempt. Similarly, Trump\u2019s European travel restrictions exempted citizens, residents and their families. And initially, the restrictions didn\u2019t apply to the UK and Ireland, as well as most Eastern European countries. Epidemiologists have told the Guardian that these policies likely had little impact, as they were enacted after the virus was already spreading within the US.\u201cUnfortunately, travel bans sound good,\u201d noted Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard\u2019s TH Chan School of Public Health, after Trump announced European restrictions. \u201cBut we\u2019re way past the point where simply restricting travel is a reasonable response.\u201d The few studies so far that have investigated the impact of travel restrictions have found that such policies may have at best delayed the spread of disease by a few days or weeks. A recent article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that travel restrictions and airport screenings in several countries \u201clikely slowed the rate of exportation from mainland China to other countries, but are insufficient to contain the global spread of Covid-19. And in China, where officials shut down travel both in and out of Wuhan, the city where the Covid-19 outbreak began, the travel ban barely slowed the spread of diseases, according to a report published in Science. But there is no evidence that travel restrictions ultimately stopped the spread of coronavirus, or significantly reduced the contagion\u2019s death toll. Read more: Fact check: Testing The president, as he\u2019s done at multiple coronavirus press briefings, noted that the US has conducted about 6m coronavirus tests. \u201cYou add up everybody together they don\u2019t add up to that,\u201d Trump said, implying, as he\u2019s done before that the US has done more testing than other countries combined. This is not true. Countries around the world have together conducted more than 6m tests. Moreover, while testing in the US has ramped up after an initially slow start, the US lags behind other countries in testing per capita. Currently, the US is testing about 1 in every 52 people. The president said he hasn\u2019t ruled out pardoning Flynn, a former national security adviser who pled guilty to lying to the FBI about communicating with a Russian ambassador. During a White House event addressing how the government will protect seniors, Trump once again complained about the treatment of Flynn. Hi there, this is Maanvi Singh \u2013 blogging from the west coast. Donald Trump is still speaking at a White House event, where he has been delivering remarks on protecting America\u2019s seniors, and is taking questions from reporters. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Another 3.8 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, according to the latest data from the labor department. More than 30 million Americans have submitted unemployment claims in the past six weeks. The office of the director of national intelligence said the intelligence community does not believe coronavirus was manmade. The new statement comes amid reports that Trump has asked intelligence officials to investigate whether the virus originated from a Chinese government laboratory. The New York subway will close for nightly cleaning. The transit system will close between 1 am and 5 am ervery night to allow the subway cars to be thoroughly disinfected. Another protest broke out at Michigan\u2019s state capitol. The demonstrators, some of whom were carrying assault rifles, railed against Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home order. Georgia will lift its statewide shelter-in-place order for most residents starting tomorrow. Republican governor Brian Kemp said the order remained in effect for the elderly and the \u201cmedically fragile,\u201d and he urged residents to still stay at home as much as possible. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump just announced he will sign a proclamation today declaring the month of May to be Older Americans Month. Speaking at the White House, the 73-year-old president joked about his age, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m in that category. I have a feeling I am. But I feel good.\u201d Trump\u2019s announcement comes as polls indicate that Americans who are 65 or older are increasingly critical of the president\u2019s handling of the pandemic. Trump will need the support of older Americans to have any chance of winning the presidential election in November, so this proclamation is likely meant to appease some of his elderly supporters. In his speech announcing the proclamation, the president also took credit for a 2014 bill that was signed into law by Barack Obama. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports on the latest from California: Californians in many parts of the state are breathing a sigh of relief after governor Gavin Newsom announced temporary closures of beaches only in Orange County, south of Los Angeles, instead of closures of beaches statewide, like previous reports had indicated. San Diego mayor Kevin Faulconer welcomed the news on Twitter after chiding the governor for the expected statewide beach-ban. But the news is sure to provoke residents of Orange County, where more than 200 protestors last weekend took to the streets, in defiance of statewide restrictions, to call for a reopening of the economy. And reports are already emerging of another rally planned for noon tomorrow. While health experts hold firm on the importance of social distancing and hygiene, the reaction to beach closures has been mixed. This week, public health experts and epidemiologists told the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levin that some of the backlash and concern may be unwarranted. One public health professor said he was initially shocked by the photos showing densely packed beaches, but said it was possible that those who are grouped together could be from the same household. Other experts pointed out that some of the conditions at beaches \u2014 like salt water, sand and sunlight \u2014 could make it more difficult for the virus to spread from person to person. Experts say the virus doesn\u2019t survive long in ultraviolet light, although light cannot kill a virus already in the body, as Trump has suggested. \u201cIf allowing people to have access to sunshine and recreation is what\u2019s going to keep them from protesting and violating laws, that may be a trade-off worth making,\u201d said Wendy Parmet, a Northeastern University health policy expert. Mike Pence said he found the government\u2019s treatment of Michael Flynn to be \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d as the president signals he is considering a possible pardon of his former national security adviser. \u201cI think Gen. Michael Flynn is a patriotic American who served with great distinction in the armed forces,\u201d Pence told reporters while visiting a General Motors plant in Indiana. \u201cI\u2019m deeply troubled by the revelations of what appears to have been investigative abuse by officials in the Justice Department and we are going to continue to look into that very carefully.\u201d Trump renewed speculation about whether he would pardon Flynn earlier today, when he sent a tweet criticizing the government for its handling of the Flynn case. It\u2019 s important to note that Flynn himself pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the US and went on to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. But many of the president\u2019s supporters now claim the prosecution of Flynn\u2019s case was unjust and have urged Trump to pardon the former official, raising concerns about the president using his power to protect his allies. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports on the latest from California: California governor Gavin Newsom announced today that beaches in Orange County would be closed starting Friday, after pictures showed dense crowds of beach-goers last weekend. Unlike earlier reports \u2014 which said the governor would close all parks and beaches statewide -- the closure is targeted to Orange County, south of Los Angeles. \u201cOrange County has been on our list of health concerns,\u201d Newsom said at a news conference, adding that the county is among the top four problem areas of the state. Newsom said that the previous, erroneous reports were not generated by his office and that he\u2019s been clear and consistent about his plans. Reports of the statewide beach closures sparked outrage in pockets across the state and even drew pushback from mayors. San Diego mayor Kevin Faulconer welcomed the apparent turn of events. Joe and Jill Biden joined World Cup champion Megan Rapinoe on Instagram live for a 40-minute conversation that touched on the coronavirus pandemic, equal pay and national unity. After a glitchy start, the Bidens beamed into Rapinoe\u2019s Instagram from their home kitchen. Jill Biden excitedly showed off a newly-dyed purple streak in her hair, which she said was in solidarity with pay equity. Rapinoe reminded Biden that she endorsed Elizabeth Warren during the primary but said she was now proudly Team Biden. She nodded to his embrace of some of Warren\u2019s policies and said she looked forward to him championing the \u201cmost progressive\u201d platform in the party\u2019s history. Asked about the coronavirus, Biden said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be constantly criticizing the president because I want to get things done. But I\u2019ve been very disappointed.\u201d He urged Trump to \u201cTake responsibility. This is a national crisis.\u201d As Biden continued to rail against the president\u2019s response, Jill Biden interjected: \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about him. Let\u2019s talk about us.\u201d A number of the comments on the livstream urged Rapinoe to ask Biden about the sexual assault allegation against him, a charge that his campaign has forcefully denied. The topic did not come up. At the end of the conversation, Rapinoe pitched herself for the No. 2. \u201cIf you need a vice president, I\u2019m just saying, I\u2019m available for an interview,\u201d she said, as Jill Biden lit up with excitement. \u201cI would love that,\u201d she said. Democratic congressman Ted Lieu criticized Trump for pushing a nonsensical claim that his administration inherited \u201cbroken\u201d coronavirus tests from the Obama era. The California Democrat noted that the Trump administration had created the first version of the coronavirus test, which was unusable as a result of contamination. \u201cStop making up stuff,\u201d Lieu said. \u201cYou are the President. Act like it. Accept responsibility for your mistakes.\u201d Trump has previously claimed he inherited faulty tests from the Obama administration, which is obviously incorrect because the virus only emerged in the past several months. The president has repeatedly tried to deflect widespread criticism of his administration\u2019s early response to the virus by blaming everyone from Obama to China and the World Health Organization for the crisis. Maryland governor Larry Hogan\u2019s decision to keep the state\u2019s coronavirus tests guarded at an undisclosed location comes after reports emerged earlier this month that the federal government was confiscating shipments of medical equipment. Colorado governor Jared Polis said earlier this month that the state\u2019s order of 500 ventilators had been \u201cswept up\u201d by FEMA. \u201cWe\u2019re competing against any other state, every other country,\u201d Polis told CNN. \u201cNow we\u2019re even competing against the federal government.\u201d Officials in other states, including Massachusetts and Kentucky, have similarly said the federal government confiscated shipments of personal protective equipment. Maryland governor Larry Hogan said he is keeping the 500,000 coronavirus tests he obtained from South Korea guarded at a secure, undisclosed location. While discussing his fears that the tests would be seized before reaching Maryland, the Republican governor said the tests were being guarded by the National Guard and state police at an undisclosed location. Hogan announced earlier this month that he had successfully negotiated directly with South Korea to acquire 500,000 additional tests for the state, which he praised as an \u201cexponential, game-changing step forward.\u201d The remarkable move raised questions about governors circumventing the federal government to address supply chain issues, even though Trump has repeatedly insisted it\u2019s up to the states to expand testing. Goergia governor Brian Kemp intends to lift the statewide shelter-in-place order for most of the state\u2019s residents starting on Friday. Kemp said Georgians should still try to stay at home as much as possible, and the shelter-in-place order still applies to the elderly and the \u201cmedically fragile.\u201d Safety restrictions for businesses will also remain in effect until at least May 13. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done has worked,\u201d Kemp told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \u201cIt\u2019s given us time to build our hospital infrastructure capacity, get ventilators and ramp up testing. That\u2019s what really drove our decision.\u201d Kemp has received some criticism for allowing non-essential businesses like hair salons and barbershops to start reopening, raising concerns about a potential surge in coronavirus cases. Trump similarly said yesterday that the federal guidelines aimed at limiting the spread of the virus, which are set to expire tonight, would be \u201cfading out.\u201d Mike Pence is wearing a mask as he visits a General Motors plant in Indiana, just two days after the vice president was criticized for not covering his face while visiting the Mayo Clinic facilities in Minnesota. The vice president has generally avoided wearing a mask for public appearances, even though the CDC has recommended face coverings to limit the spread of coronavirus, so this represents a rare reversal from Pence. The Mayo Clinic said in a since-deleted tweet that Pence was informed of its policy requiring masks before he visited, and the vice president appeared to be the only one not covering his face. The vice president oddly defended his actions by saying he wanted to look frontline workers in the eye to say thank you. It\u2019s very unclear as to how a mask would prevent Pence from looking frontline workers in the eye. Pelosi speaks up for Biden over sexual assault allegation House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has given a robust defense of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden - as some within her party urged him to directly address a woman\u2019s sexual assault accusation against him that his campaign already has denied. Biden is facing growing pressure to publicly address an allegation of sexual assault made by Tara Reade, a former aide to his Senate office. The former vice-president has remained silent about the accusation, a position that is seen as increasingly untenable in the wake of new reporting. Many major Democratic women\u2019s organizations and prominent feminists have also declined to comment publicly on Reade\u2019s claim that Biden, then a senator from Delaware, assaulted her in 1993. Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said in a statement this month that \u201cthis absolutely did not happen\u201d, but she has not commented further. Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, formally endorsed Biden for president on Monday. On Thursday, Pelosi said she continued to fully support Biden, Reuters writes. She noted that staffers who ran Biden\u2019s Senate office have said they had no recollection of a sexual assault complaint. Pelosi also highlighted Biden\u2019s long history of supporting policies to stop the abuse of women. \u201cI have complete respect for the whole #MeToo movement,\u201d Pelosi said at a news conference. \u201cThere is also due process and the fact that Joe Biden is Joe Biden.\u201d \u201cHe is the personification of hope and optimism and authenticity for our country - a person of great values,\u201d Pelosi added. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm Reade\u2019s accusations and also was unable to reach Reade or a representative for her for comment. More protests in Michigan People are demonstrating at the Michigan capitol, angry at governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s efforts to extend social and business restrictions for May in response to the coronavirus crisis. Earlier today hundreds of people were outside the capitol building in Lansing. Some protestors could be seen not wearing masks or social distancing as instructed by the governor\u2019s executive order. Protestors not practicing safety precautions could face fines, local station WXYZ reported. The state of emergency in Michigan was due to end today. It was the place where demonstrations first bubbled up earlier this month, with people demanding they be allowed to go back out and about and open up the paralyzed economy again. But many protesters wore or carried paraphernalia supportive of Donald Trump, and many wore camouflage and carried assault rifles, leading to tense scenes and an obvious lack of social distancing, per federal guidelines and state orders. And it became clear that protests there and in other states were being stoked by right-wing causes and even by the president in an extraordinary advocacy of civil disobedience and contrary to his own government policy. The USNS Comfort treated just 182 people as a surge in cases in the hard-hit city fell short of the worst-case projections. The last dozen patients on the ship were discharged or transferred to other hospitals over the weekend, The Associated Press reports. Eleven people that were treated on the ship died from coronavirus, the Defense Department said. Several ship personnel came down with coronavirus while deployed to New York. A Pentagon spokesman called the ship\u2019s departure \u201ca sure sign of modest progress in mitigating the virus in the nation\u2019s hardest hit city and is a welcome sign.\u201d Governor Andrew Cuomo said last week that he and Donald Trump agreed the Comfort was no longer needed in New York City. \u201cI believe Comfort not only brought comfort but also saved lives,\u201d Cuomo said. The Comfort and its 620 doctors, nurses and other crew members will return to the homeport in Norfolk, Virginia, where the ship will be restocked and be readied for another possible assignment. More than 18,000 people in the state have died from coronavirus, most of them in New York City. That total doesn\u2019t include more than 5,300 deaths in the city that were attributed to the virus on death certificates but weren\u2019t confirmed by a lab test. The Defense Department said it did not have information on how much the Comfort\u2019s mission to New York cost. The Comfort has a capacity of up to 1,000 hospital beds, but according to New York City\u2019s Office of Emergency Management, it had 427 set up for the coronavirus crisis. Republican senator Rick Scott escalated his ongoing feud with New York governor Andrew Cuomo over additional funding for state governments. The feud started earlier this week, when Scott wrote a Wall street Journal op-ed arguing government funding should not be used \u201cto save liberal politicians from the consequences of their poor choices.\u201d That sparked fury from Cuomo, who noted Scott\u2019s homestate of Florida is more reliant on federal funding than New York is. \u201cThey\u2019re not bailing us out,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe bail them out every year.\u201d Scott has now come out swinging again, saying in a new statement, \u201cGovernor Cuomo used his daily briefing as an opportunity to attack me to distract from the fact that he wants his state bailed out by Florida taxpayers.\u201d Congressional leaders continue to spar over the details of the next coronavirus relief bill, but the National Governors Association has said states need another $500 billion. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Another 3.8 million Americans filed for unemployment last week, according to new figures from the labor department. More than 30 million Americans have submitted unemployment claims in the past six weeks as the economy suffers the effects of the pandemic. Trump claimed he had done a \u201cspectacular\u201d job handling the pandemic, despite widespread criticism of his administration\u2019s early response to the virus. The president\u2019s comments come as the US coronavirus death toll stands at 61,288. The New York subway will close for nightly cleaning, governor Andrew Cuomo announced at his daily briefing. The transit system will be closed from 1 am to 5 am to thoroughly disinfect all subway cars. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The interim president of the New York City Transit system said the subway closures for nightly cleaning would be in effect for \u201cthe duration of the pandemic.\u201d \u201cThe duration of the pandemic\u201d could be interpreted in a number of different ways, but if the plan remains in effect until a coronavirus vaccine is developed, the closures could last for several more months. The Guardian\u2019s Kenya Evelyn with a recap of New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s daily press briefing: For the first time in decades, New York City will no longer be \u201cThe City that never sleeps.\u201d The governor, along with New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, who patched in remotely, announced a partnership that the city will halt train service every night from 1 am to 5 am for disinfecting and cleaning. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find a way to make our subway system cleaner that it has ever been in its history, probably,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy, no one said it would be easy.\u201d Cuomo and de Blasio have not had the warmest relationship, to say the least. The two leaders have not shared a stage together since 2 March, one day after New York reported its first confirmed coronavirus case. The governor reported that hospitalizations and new cases are down, and while 306 deaths are down from 330 Wednesday, Cuomo still called the number \u201cterrible\u201d. \u201cOptimist would say that\u2019s a number on the decline, realists would say that\u2019s a tremendous amount of grief for a loved one,\u201d he said. New York State had more than 300,000 confirmed cases of the virus and 18,000 deaths as of midday Thursday. \u201cToday\u2019s another day to be better and do better,\u201d Cuomo said. Before expanding on details of state tracing efforts, Cuomo reiterated that the key to reopening states is keeping the infection rate down and hospital capacity high. \u201cIf we do this right, this is a science reopening,\u201d he said. Cuomo was also joined by former New York City mayor and Democratic presidential candidate, Michael Bloomberg, who\u2019ll lead the state\u2019s case tracing efforts. With no interaction with Cuomo, however, the mayor\u2019s delivery garnered questions of whether the video was pre-recorded. Cuomo\u2019s interaction with de Blasio, meanwhile, was obviously polite but noticeably cold - with both leaders taking no-so-subtle shots at each other\u2019s infrastructure and management mixed in with heaps of praise. While meeting with New Jersey governor Phil Murphy, Trump also reiterated his nonsensical claim that his administration \u201cinherited\u201d broken coronavirus tests. \u201cWe have broken tests,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cWe had tests that were obsolete. We had tests that didn\u2019t take care of people.\u201d Considering this virus only emerged in the past several months, it is obviously impossible for the Obama administration to have left Trump \u201cbroken tests.\u201d The president said he thought the White House had done a \u201cspectacular\u201d responding to coronavirus, despite widespread criticism of the administration\u2019s early response. During an Oval Office meeting with New Jersey governor Phil Murphy, Trump told reporters, \u201cI think our whole group has been spectacular.\u201d But the administration has been criticized for fumbling its early response to the virus by failing to make testing more widely available. Trump noted the US has now conducted more tests than any other country, but the country has still conducted far less tests per capita than Italy. The Trump administration is reportedly considering retaliatory actions against China for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The Washington Post reports: Senior officials across multiple government agencies are expected to meet on Thursday to begin mapping out a strategy for seeking retaliatory measures against China, two people with knowledge of the meeting said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to disclose the planning. Officials in American intelligence agencies are also involved in the effort. ... In private, Trump and aides have discussed stripping China of its \u2018sovereign immunity,\u2019 aiming to enable the U.S. government or victims to sue China for damages. George Sorial, who formerly served as a top executive at the Trump Organization and is now involved in a class-action lawsuit against China, told The Washington Post he and senior White House officials have discussed limiting China\u2019s sovereign immunity. Legal experts say an attempt to limit China\u2019s sovereign immunity would be extremely difficult to accomplish and may require Congressional legislation. The president has repeatedly tried to deflect criticism of the White House\u2019s early response to coronavirus by blaming China for not being forthcoming about the outbreak. House speaker Nancy Pelosi was careful not to criticize Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for calling senators back to Washington starting next week. Pelosi and majority leader Steny Hoyer originally said the House would also return next week, but they reversed that decision after a consultation with the Capitol\u2019s attending physician. \u201cWe\u2019re 430 members,\u201d Pelosi said during her weekly briefing call. \u201cThe decision was made on the strength of our numbers and people coming together.\u201d The speaker added, \u201cNow, what they advised the Senate, I don\u2019t know. They are 100, we\u2019re four times that.\u201d The office of the director of national intelligence has released an unusual statement saying officials do not believe coronavirus was manmade, echoing many health experts. \u201cThe Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,\u201d the statement reads. The statement added, \u201cThe IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.\u201d Trump has reportedly asked intelligence officials to investigate whether coronavirus was created in a Chinese government laboratory, even though many public health experts have said they think the virus came about naturally. The vice president is traveling to Indiana today to visit a General Motors plant that has shifted its production focus to make more ventilators. Pence has made several trips out of Washington in recent weeks, most recently visiting the Mayo Clinic facilities in Minnesota earlier this week, where he was criticized for not wearing a face mask as he met with staffers and patients. Trump is reportedly anxious to leave the White House as well, and he has openly mused about when he might be able to once again hold campaign rallies. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign said he and Bernie Sanders had reached an agreement to ensure Sanders\u2019 supporters and proposals are adequately represented at the party\u2019s convention. Biden\u2019s team argued the agreement, which involves supporters of Sanders filling some delegate slots to reflect the results of primarie, would help to bring the party together before the convention. The campaign also specified that Sanders\u2019 supporters would be represented in the New York delegation, even though the state canceled its primary. Biden\u2019s campaign said in a statement, \u201cWhile Senator Sanders is no longer actively seeking the nomination, the Biden campaign feels strongly that it is in the best interest of the party and the effort to defeat Donald Trump in November to come to an agreement regarding these issues that will ensure representation of Sanders supporters and delegate candidates, both on the floor and in committees.\u201d Sanders suspended his campaign earlier this month, but he had said he will remain on states\u2019 ballots to continue to win delegates in order to influence the party\u2019s platform at the convention. The Senate\u2019s oldest member is urging majority leader Mitch McConnell to reconsider his decision to reconvene the chamber on Monday. California senator Dianne Feinstein, who is 86, noted the House has backed off its initial plan to call members back to Washington next week. \u201cThe Attending Physician of Congress, Dr. Brian Monahan, advised House leadership that he recommends against resuming their session,\u201d Feinstein said in a statement. \u201cSpeaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer did the right thing by heeding this public health advice and are setting the right example for the country. \u201cThat\u2019s why I ask the majority leader to reconsider his plan to reconvene the Senate. He would bring 100 senators and many more staff members and reporters into close proximity while Washington itself remains under a stay-at-home order. There is no way to do this without increased risk. This is the wrong example for the country.\u201d The Washington metropolitan region is seeing a rising number of coronavirus cases, raising further concerns about asking senators, most of whom are over 50, to return to Capitol Hill. This is Joan Greve, taking over for Jo Walters. The latest cover of Time magazine features an altered \u201copen\u201d sign reading \u201cnope,\u201d a nod to the difficult road ahead as the country starts to look toward reopening the economy. The magazine\u2019s cover story dives into the potential danger of reopening the country too quickly: There is both promise and peril in being a pioneer, and the people of Hokkaido have learned both lessons well over the past few months. After infections of COVID-19 on the Japanese island exploded following its annual winter festival this year, officials in February declared a state of emergency to control the disease. Soon after, new daily cases plummeted, and Hokkaido\u2019s quick action was heralded as a beacon for the rest of Japan to follow. But it wasn\u2019t just infections that dropped; over the next month, agriculture and tourism business also dried up, and Hokkaido\u2019s governor decided to ease social restrictions. However, compliance with limits on social interaction after weeks of sequestering was harder this time around. Within a month, Hokkaido\u2019s new COVID-19 infections jumped by 80%, and the governor had to reinstate lockdown policies. There are similar stories from Singapore, Hong Kong and Germany, and all serve as sobering lessons for the decision-makers in the U.S. who are under increasing pressure to reopen the country to reactivate its stalled economy. The story comes as the federal guidelines aimed at limiting the spread of the virus are set to expire, and some governors are already taking steps to reopen their states, potentially risking another surge in coronavirus cases. Long-time Republican fixer Roger Stone has just filed notice that he is appealing his conviction last year. Stone, a longtime confidant and former aide to Donald Trump, was convicted in November of seven felonies in an attempt to interfere with a congressional inquiry. He was sentenced to 40 months in prison. He was denied his request in January for a new trial. The president tweeted about Stone this morning. Another 3.8 million people lost their jobs in the US last week as the coronavirus pandemic continued to batter the economy. The pace of layoffs appears to be slowing, but in just six weeks an unprecedented 30 million Americans have now sought unemployment benefits and the numbers are still growing. The latest figures from the labor department released on Thursday showed a fourth consecutive week of declining claims. While the trend is encouraging, the rate of losses means US unemployment is still on course to reach levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The figures are also still undercounting the number of people out of work. Some states are still dealing with backlogs of claims after their systems were overwhelmed by the massive volume of applications. Florida has become a notable black spot. As of Tuesday the state had received more than 1.9 million claims and processed just over 664,000, one of the slowest rates in the nation. Public health official Anthony Fauci this morning confirmed he is a member of a secretive team rushing to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019m part of the team,\u201d Fauci told NBC\u2019s Today. The team is called Operation Warp Speed. Subtle. Background: the Trump administration is planning to speed up development of a coronavirus vaccine with the goal of having 100 million doses ready by the end of 2020, a senior unnamed administration official said on Wednesday, Reuters reported. Executives and other experts have previously suggested that clinical trials to guarantee a vaccine is safe and effective could take a minimum of 12 to 18 months. Several agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services announced plans earlier in April to partner with more than 15 drug companies as well as European regulators in an effort to spur development of vaccines and treatments for the disease. The latest Trump administration efforts to speed vaccine development were originally reported by Bloomberg News, citing people familiar with the matter. The project will join private pharmaceutical companies with government agencies and the military in trying to cut the development time for a vaccine by as much as eight months, Bloomberg News said, with some folks comparing it to the Manhattan Project that developed the nuclear bomb. Fauci said the best case scenario was a widely-available vaccine by January 2021. \u201cWe are in the early, phase one, of the trial, the next phase is to find out whether it works and is safe,\u201d he said. If it goes to plan, who will be there to welcome it? President Trump or President Biden. Donald Trump says China \u201cwill do anything they can\u201d to prevent his reelection in November. The Guardian\u2019s Alison Rourke and Lily Kuo have this report from an exclusive Reuters interview with Donald Trump in the Oval Office. The US president said he was looking at different options in terms of consequences for Beijing over the virus. \u201cI can do a lot,\u201d he said, without going into detail. Trump has increasingly blamed China for the pandemic and on Wednesday again said Beijing should have let the world know about the coronavirus much sooner. He also speculated about retaliation: \u201cThere are many things I can do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for what happened.\u201d For the first time, Trump linked Beijing to his re-election chances in November. \u201cChina will do anything they can to have me lose this race,\u201d he said, adding that he believed China wants his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, to win the race to ease the pressure on US-China trade relations. \u201cThey\u2019re constantly using public relations to try to make it like they\u2019re innocent parties,\u201d he said of Chinese officials. Trump said the trade deal that he concluded with Chinese president Xi Jinping aimed at reducing chronic US trade deficits with China had been \u201cupset very badly\u201d by the economic fallout from the virus. California governor Gavin Newsom will order all beaches and state parks closed again from tomorrow. A memo by the California Police Chiefs Association outlining the decision said it was initatiated \u201cafter the well-publicized media coverage of overcrowded beaches this past weekend.\u201d The governor was reportedly concerned after tens of thousands of people flocked to state shores last weekend during a heat wave, in violation of California\u2019s mandatory stay-at-home order. Newsom targeted beachgoers in Orange and Ventura counties as setting a poor example if the state wants to continue its progress fighting the coronavirus.\u201dThose images are an example of what not to see, what not to do if we\u2019re going to make the meaningful progress we\u2019ve made the past couple of weeks,\u201d Newsom told local station KABC. Local leaders shot back at criticism over keeping the beaches open. Donald Wagner, member of the Orange County board of supervisors said on Wednesday that closing the beaches was the governor\u2019s right, but added \u201cit is not wise to do so.\u201d \u201cMedical professionals tell us the importance of fresh air and sunlight in fighting infectious diseases, including mental health benefits,\u201d Wagner wrote. There is no scientific or medical evidence that sunlight or fresh air play any role in combating the coronavirus. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the top public health official on the White House coronavirus task force, had more to say this morning about the preliminary results of the most promising trial yet of the drug remdesivir to treat Covid-19. A relatively large study conducted by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) showed some hopeful results for remdesivir, an experimental antiviral produced by the US pharmaceutical company Gilead, initially as a potential treatment for the Ebola virus. The main finding is that the drug reduced the amount of time that patients with severe coronavirus had to spend in hospital from 16 days (with a placebo) to 11 days. The clinical trial has not been peer-reviewed and these are strictly preliminary results. It\u2019s early days. But Fauci told ABC\u2019s Good Morning America today that the results were \u201cclearly positive\u201d if \u201cmodest\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a first step in what we project will be better and better drugs coming along, alone or in combination. So it\u2019s good news but...this is not the total answer.\u201d It is expected to be approved as an emergency treatment by the US regulator the Food and Drug Administration \u201crelatively soon\u201d, Fauci said. Donald Trump is on Twitter this morning once again railing against the conviction of his former national security adviser Michael Flynn. There has been talk that Flynn could beat the rap as early as this week with a pardon from the president, which Trump has been hinting at/not denying periodically for ages. Flynn was, very briefly, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser but he was fired and pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his dealings with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office. Flynn has been awaiting sentence and in January tried to withdraw his guilty plea. Trump also just retweeted his son, Don Jr, who yesterday said: Flynn originally cut a deal as part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. He initially cooperated with the investigation, which concluded last year without establishing criminal conspiracy but did lay out extensive evidence of contact between Trump aides and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president himself. Flynn hired a new lawyer, earlier this year, Fox News pundit Sidney Powell, a longtime critic of the Mueller inquiry who has peddled numerous false conspiracy theories on the investigation and other Trump policies and issues in prime time interviews. In March Trump tweeted: \u201cSo now it is reported that, after destroying his life &amp; the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the FBI, working in conjunction with the Justice Department, has \u2018lost\u2019 the records of General Michael Flynn. How convenient. \u201cI am strongly considering a Full Pardon!\u201d As the president often says, we\u2019ll see. Good morning, US blog readers. Your primary blogger Joan Greve will be with you shortly but we\u2019ll get the day started with some of the leading news around US politics and the coronavirus. Federal guidelines on social distancing are set to expire at midnight tonight and at least two dozen states are set to begin reopening with greater social movement and business activity tomorrow or over the weekend. While Donald Trump is keen for this to happen, his own public health experts are urging extreme caution about states relaxing their own stay-at-home orders (as opposed to mere guidelines). There were more than 2,600 new deaths in the US from coronavirus yesterday. And last night California announced it was going to close its beaches and state parks just days after allowing them to open, after people crowded there in an unsafe way. And: Top public health expert Anthony Fauci this morning said the preliminary results from early trials of the drug remdesivir in treating coronavirus were \u201cclearly positive\u201d though \u201cmodest\u201d and were a \u201cfirst step in what we project will be better and better drugs\u201d to treat Covid-19. Presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has formed his \u201cvetting team\u201d to search for his best vice presidential candidate \u2013 while calls for him to address directly a recently elevated accusation of sexual assault in the past are growing. The latest unemployment figures in the US are due out at 8.30 and our business team will cover that separately. They will not make good reading.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian government entered a contract to buy 500,000 Covid-19 test kits from a company headed by a convicted rapist, which had no experience in medical diagnostics, failed to deliver shipments at a critical point in the pandemic, and is now under investigation by the medical regulator. At the height of the crisis, a small, largely unknown Brisbane company, Promedical Equipment Pty Ltd, told the Australian government it could supply huge quantities of Covid-19 rapid antibody testing kits made by a relatively well-known Chinese manufacturer, Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech. Promedical\u2019s chief executive, Neran De Silva, was convicted of rape in 2018, and was a one-time business associate of the government services minister, Stuart Robert, through a cryotherapy treatment business. Promedical\u2019s two shares were purchased for $2 by De Silva\u2019s partner. Before the pandemic it sold cryogenic, massage therapy and erectile dysfunction machines. The Chinese-made Covid-19 testing kit it was offering to sell the Australian government was already approved for use in both Australia and the US. Promedical was effectively acting as a distributor. The Guardian can reveal the Australian government signed a contract with Promedical to supply it with 500,000 antibody testing kits in March, as it urgently attempted to boost its capacity to screen for Covid-19. Promedical and its representatives were on a media blitz about the same time, telling The Today Show, the Daily Telegraph, the Daily Mail and Sky News it could supply 5m tests to Australia every week, an announcement heralded as \u201crevolutionary\u201d and \u201camazing\u201d. But the deal between Promedical and its Chinese manufacturer broke down in acrimonious fashion. Wondfo effectively disowned the Brisbane company, revoking authorisation to distribute its products in early April. Promedical has not delivered any of the Wondfo tests, the government said, nor had they been paid for. A health department spokeswoman said its contract with Promedical stipulated it would only be paid once the tests were received. No money had been given to Promedical, she said. \u201cThe contract was for payment on delivery and acceptance of the testing kits. On 3 April, the department was advised that the Chinese manufacturer Wondfu had withdrawn its permission for Promedical to distribute their device,\u201d she said. \u201cTo date, the tests have not arrived in Australia and no payment has been made.\u201d Promedical blamed Wondfo and claimed the manufacturer was \u201cunable to meet order quantities by the deadlines specified\u201d. \u201cPromedical continued to secure orders with government bodies for quantities far larger than those Wondfo could produce within the tight timeframe,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cOn 3 April 2020, it was evident Wondfo could not supply the required quantities of its Covid-19 IgG Rapid Detection Kit to fill Promedical\u2019s Australian government [order].\u201d Promedical says it is planning to supply its own branded Covid-19 testing kits to the government. But that test does not appear on the Therapeutic Goods Administration\u2019s list of approved Covid-19 tests. A Promedical spokeswoman said the government had been \u201cmade aware of changes to the delivery timeline as a result of the changes to supplier\u201d. The company said it had received assurances from the Australian government that it would proceed with the contract. \u201cPromedical\u2019s contact with the Australian government has confirmed that, as long as Promedical\u2019s Covid-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Detection Kit is included in the TGA\u2019s [Australian register of therapeutic goods], they will continue with the order and quantities, in line with an updated contract,\u201d a Promedical spokeswoman said. The government has cast serious doubt on that claim. A health department spokeswoman said: \u201cNo further action is being taken by the department in regard to the contract for any new or additional testing kits that may be sourced by Promedical.\u201d The Guardian has previously revealed that the TGA is investigating Promedical\u2019s actions. Even when its deal with Wondfo broke down, it continued to falsely claim in promotional material that the Covid-19 testing kits it was selling had Australian and US regulatory approval. Promedical told the Guardian it had now \u201cupdated\u201d its communications \u201cto provide further clarification for buyers\u201d. The pandemic has put huge pressure on governments to urgently approve medical devices to boost testing capacity amid unprecedented demand. In Australia, the TGA is treating requests for approval with urgency and then conducting post-market surveillance to ensure they are accurate and reliable. The medical regulator says \u201cany Australian-based legal entity may be the sponsor of a medical device\u201d, provided it can fulfil legislative requirements, including being able to demonstrate adequate safety and performance. When Promedical was asked whether it had any prior experience in medical diagnostics, a spokeswoman said the pandemic had seen businesses \u201call over the world adapt and innovate like never before\u201d. \u201cWhen Covid-19 entered Australia, Promedical immediately began looking for the best solution to stop its spread; finding a way to speed up the testing and reporting process,\u201d she said. It also said it worked closely with regulatory bodies, including the TGA, and followed strict guidelines. The type of antibody testing offered by Promedical is generally used to supplement the primary form of Covid-19 testing, which examines genetic material in laboratories. Antibody testing is designed as a method of rapid screening, and experts say it has some utility in the response to the pandemic, but should not be relied upon as the sole diagnostic tool. Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert at the Australian National University, has previously told the Guardian the government must take care to prevent inaccurate antibody tests coming on to the market, despite the urgency of the crisis.",

The Sky cutbacks come just as the station is celebrating a surge in viewers, especially for its dedicated 24/7 Sky News Covid-19 channel, where viewing figures are up 406% since it started streaming free online on News Corp websites. Foxtel cuts go further Foxtel has announced a third round of redundancies in a matter of weeks, this time to marketing and creative staff, bringing to around 300 the number of job losses from the struggling pay TV company. Another 70 positions were made redundant on Thursday, on top of the 200 last month and a number from Fox Sports before that. Foxtel has been hit hard by the cancellation of live sport during the pandemic as fans cancelled their Foxtel and Kayo subscriptions despite attempts to offer sweeteners to stay. \u201cThese are changes we had to make to face up to the impacts of Covid-19 on our business and a very different future for everyone involved in the media, entertainment and sporting industries,\u201d a spokesman said.

Bauer wields the axe Another 70 media workers lost their jobs this week after German magazine giant Bauer Media restructured its Australian operation, which publishes the Australian Women\u2019s Weekly and Woman\u2019s Day, among many other historic titles.

A no good, very bad week It\u2019s been a bad week for well-known Australian journalists working in the UK. Former ABC and BuzzFeed reporter Mark Di Stefano hit the global headlines after he was stood down from his new job at the Financial Times. Di Stefano, who started at the FT in January, was suspended after the Independent accused him of listening in on sensitive Zoom meetings held by its senior managers telling staff about salary cuts and furloughs. The media and tech reporter has been accused of listening to the audio feed of video conference calls held by the Independent and its sister title the Evening Standard about responding to the financial impact of coronavirus. Fellow Aussie Latika Bourke, who files for the Sydney Morning Herald from London, tweeted that journalists should be clapped alongside other heroes of the coronavirus frontline in the UK. She was retweeting a Labour MP who was thanking all the key workers: \u201cNurses, the care workers, the bus drivers, the paramedics, the shop workers, the police officers.\u201d Bourke thought reporters should be added to the list.

infrastructure and Australian companies that have been hammered by the coronavirus crisis, its chief investment officer says.</p> \n<p>Kristian Fok said the fund wanted to help build a sustainable economy in the wake of the crisis, which has laid waste to the hospitality, tourism and education industries and sent the sharemarket into a tailspin.</p> \n<p>Cbus, which has about $51.8bn under management even after share prices collapsed by as much as 30% due to the pandemic, is jointly run by unions and employers and largely invests on behalf of workers in the construction industry.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe would like to see, if we\u2019re going to invest any money, that it\u2019s not just about a short-term sugar hit, that they\u2019re things that are going to help us move to the sustainable economy that we need to position ourselves in,\u201d Fok told Guardian Australia.</p> \n<p>He said the fund had money ready to spend within the next six months, as Australia emerges from the government lockdowns that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/30/australians-on-jobseeker-payment-up-450000-in-less-than-a-month\">shuttered large parts of the

from being seized</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>About three quarters of the fund\u2019s members work in construction, which has so far been spared a shutdown, avoiding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/13/coalition-expects-coronavirus-to-send-australias-unemployment-soaring-to-10\">mass unemployment</a> in the sector.</p> \n<p>This means the fund has been less affected by withdrawals than funds such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/22/australia-is-easing-superannuation-access-for-those-worst-hit-by-coronavirus-but-can-we-afford-it\">Hostplus and Rest</a>, which draw much of their membership from the devastated hospitality or retail sectors.</p> \n<p>Fok said withdrawals by Cbus members as the coronavirus hit had initially peaked at about $128m a day but had since subsided to the \u201chigh 20 millions\u201d a day.</p> \n<p>He said the fund\u2019s first investment priority was \u201csaving businesses and jobs\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo, strong businesses that have got cashflow problems because of the shutdown but remain, in the long term, high quality businesses, are now seeking to recapitalise,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\">

      "bodyText": "The industry superannuation fund that services the construction industry, Cbus, has a war chest of more than $2.5bn ready to invest in projects including social housing, infrastructure and Australian companies that have been hammered by the coronavirus crisis, its chief investment officer says. Kristian Fok said the fund wanted to help build a sustainable economy in the wake of the crisis, which has laid waste to the hospitality, tourism and education industries and sent the sharemarket into a tailspin. Cbus, which has about $51.8bn under management even after share prices collapsed by as much as 30% due to the pandemic, is jointly run by unions and employers and largely invests on behalf of workers in the construction industry. \u201cWe would like to see, if we\u2019re going to invest any money, that it\u2019s not just about a short-term sugar hit, that they\u2019re things that are going to help us move to the sustainable economy that we need to position ourselves in,\u201d Fok told Guardian Australia. He said the fund had money ready to spend within the next six months, as Australia emerges from the government lockdowns that have shuttered large parts of the economy. About three quarters of the fund\u2019s members work in construction, which has so far been spared a shutdown, avoiding mass unemployment in the sector. This means the fund has been less affected by withdrawals than funds such as Hostplus and Rest, which draw much of their membership from the devastated hospitality or retail sectors. Fok said withdrawals by Cbus members as the coronavirus hit had initially peaked at about $128m a day but had since subsided to the \u201chigh 20 millions\u201d a day. He said the fund\u2019s first investment priority was \u201csaving businesses and jobs\u201d. \u201cSo, strong businesses that have got cashflow problems because of the shutdown but remain, in the long term, high quality businesses, are now seeking to recapitalise,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other area that we are now actively engaged in is direct lending \u2013 there are opportunities that we looked at and walked away from that we are now having another look at. He said Cbus would then look to invest in a pipeline of projects backed by governments, including its existing Bright Energy renewables joint venture in Western Australia and affordable housing financed by the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation. \u201cI think at this time in particular there\u2019s probably going to be an increasing need for affordable housing as we come through,\u201d he said. He said the fund was also looking at investing in climate initiatives and in supplying purpose-built housing to people receiving benefits under the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Further down the track, Cbus\u2019s war chest includes about $1bn ready to invest in infrastructure. \u201cIt\u2019ll be clearly dependent on the finances of both the federal government and the state governments,\u201d he said. \u201cAn example is the rail idea between Melbourne Airport and Spencer St Station, where there has already been a fair bit of progress in terms of discussions around that. \u201cClearly in the short term there\u2019s probably not going to be that much demand but it does actually take some time to build.\u201d",

The Chinese government said on Thursday that any claims that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory were \u201cunfounded and purely fabricated out of nothing\u201d.

      "body": "<p>We log in every day at 7.45am. One by one, we join an array of faces on our screens. We doctors aren\u2019t used to video-conferencing like this, and still greet each other with excited waving hands. Since the coronavirus crisis began, these daily virtual meetings have proved an invaluable way to keep up to speed on clinical guidelines, in-house protocols and staff wellbeing \u2013 all of which are changing every day.</p> <p>But these meetings also bring us news that we take more personally: how many of our patients have symptoms? How many have tested positive? How many have died? These are important questions, for sure, but my public health training reminds me to think globally. The coming year will see developments that will allow us to bring the virus under control in the west, but what about in other countries? I cannot help but think of my relatives in India, and what this pandemic will mean for them \u2013 not just now, but in the future. The really important question is not who will die of coronavirus tomorrow, but in 200 years\u2019 time.</p> <p>For coronavirus is not the only pandemic the world faces. There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away.</p> <p>While I will surely be able to offer my patients in England a coronavirus vaccine in a year or two, and while western health systems will be reinforced to be more ready for a potential future outbreak, I worry that we may repeat the mistakes of cholera: conquering coronavirus everywhere except for the poorest parts of the world.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>To reach my grandparents\u2019 house in Bihar, in north-east India, you have to take a car from Patna airport across one of the longest river bridges in the world, the Mahatma Gandhi Setu. This bridge takes you north over the river Ganges, past Hajipur, a city famous for its fragrant bananas, and up to Darbhanga, near the border with Nepal. When I was a child, the road was so damaged by the region\u2019s regular floods and monsoons that the journey, which would take just two hours in the UK, took seven hours, bumping over gut-lurching potholes. Today, the road is smooth and elevated, giving a spectacular view of the area\u2019s lush flood plains. They provide the perfect conditions for cultivating the fruits \u2013 mangoes, lychees and guava \u2013 that still flavour my memories of visits to my grandparents.</p> <p>The wet, semi-tropical conditions in the Ganges delta also make it a hotspot for water-borne diseases. And it is in northern India that cholera is thought to have originated several millennia ago, owing to the abundance of still water pools and Hindu ceremonies involving worshippers washing themselves in rivers. A 2,000-year-old <a href=\"https://mosaicscience.com/story/cholera-haiti/\" title=\"\">inscription</a> at a temple in Gujarat vividly describes the <a href=\"https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/cholera\" title=\"\">clinical picture</a> of patients afflicted by severe cholera: \u201cThe lips blue, the face haggard, the eyes hollow, the stomach sunk in, the limbs contracted and crumpled as if by fire.\u201d</p> <p>In the 19th century, the scientist Max von Pettenkofer believed, incorrectly, that cholera required certain soils and environmental factors unique to India, and so thought that it could not be contagious or endemic in Europe. But the persistence of cholera in this area has less to do with climate and more to do with political choices.</p> <p>Cholera is an infectious disease that turns on all the taps in your gut, so that water and salts pour out of your system, giving you copious watery diarrhoea that looks starchy, like rice water. This diarrhoea helps the infection spread between people, leaving a trail of victims so severely dehydrated that, if they don\u2019t receive treatment, they shrivel up like prunes within hours.</p> <p>For centuries, cholera only caused localised epidemics in north-east India. That was until 1817, when one of these outbreaks, originating in Bengal, spread across the world, starting the first of seven cholera pandemics. But just as Wuhan cannot be blamed for the current Covid-19 pandemic, we cannot hold this region responsible for cholera\u2019s spread, any more than North America should be blamed for the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, which <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/information_h1n1_virus_qa.htm\" title=\"\">originated</a> in industrially farmed pigs. What the spread of these diseases has in common is international trade, and the movement of animals and people that comes with it.</p> <p>Empire shaped the history of cholera, and it was the economic concerns of imperial powers that brought cholera to heel in the west. But if imperialism was crucial to providing the impetus to end cholera, it also produced a logic that divided the world and only eliminated the disease from one half.</p> <p>In his book Plagues and Peoples, the historian William Hardy McNeill describes how the British army carried cholera overland into Nepal and Afghanistan, while British navy and merchant ships carried it beyond the Indian Ocean. That is how the first pandemic spread from the Bay of Bengal to south-east Asia, the Middle East, east Africa, and then to Europe by the early 1820s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a9c5ea40ee067a947cf54cdc894b72a5e4949e95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9c5ea40ee067a947cf54cdc894b72a5e4949e95/0_0_2048_1344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dam infected with cholera in South Africa in 2001.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dam infected with cholera in South Africa in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SCHALK/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1831, cholera reached the north-east of England, the region where I grew up. One of the first victims, in Sunderland, was a 12-year-old girl called <a href=\"https://co-curate.ncl.ac.uk/resources/view/34622/\" title=\"\">Isabella Hazard</a>. Her illness was characteristically swift: she was entirely well one evening and dead the next afternoon. She was an early victim of the first of a series of waves of the disease that caused pandemonium in 19th-century Europe. Port cities, crucial to trade, were affected particularly badly.</p> <p>It is hard to imagine the panic created by the \u201cBlue Death\u201d, as cholera was nicknamed, because at the time its cause was a total mystery. The most common theory \u2013 that the disease was associated with \u201cbad airs\u201d (or \u201cmiasmas\u201d) \u2013 inspired desperate experiments to control it. In Kingston, Jamaica, for instance, British colonial officers tried to banish the disease by firing cannons through the streets \u201cto destroy the morbific power that lurked in the dark alleys\u201d.</p> <p>So cholera went on, unabated, in wave after wave of pandemics throughout the 19th century, causing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera_outbreaks_and_pandemics\" title=\"\">millions</a> of deaths, mainly in poor neighbourhoods. The working classes rioted across Europe, suspecting the disease was a conspiracy by the ruling elite, who they thought were poisoning them. In the 1830s, the revolutionary <a href=\"https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/133436/7/133436.pdf\" title=\"\">Mario Adorno</a> accused the Bourbon royal family of concocting \u201ca devilish plot bent on poisoning the people\u201d of Sicily with cholera, as part of his attempt to topple them.</p> <p>But disasters like pandemics are never just destructive \u2013 they also induce change, and often spark scientific developments and social reforms. The European imperial powers eventually started pouring resources into discovering the true cause of the disease, primarily to prevent the catastrophic economic downturns that accompanied every fresh outbreak. This investment led to three major developments that helped end cholera in the western world: reforms that improved public health, to stop populations getting the disease in the first place; the discovery of new medicines, to prevent and treat the disease; and international cooperation, to unite against a common enemy.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In 1813, Frances Snow gave birth to her first child, John, in York. She and her husband, William, who worked at the local coal yard, raised John in one of the poorest parts of the city. Like Bihar in India, the area John grew up in was regularly affected by flooding, when the River Ouse broke its banks.</p> <p>When John became a doctor, he grew sceptical of the idea that cholera was caused by \u201cmiasmas\u201d. Instead, he suspected it had something to do with water. He famously proved his theory in 1854, during an outbreak in Soho which killed 616 people. He created a <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg\" title=\"\">dot map</a> of all the cholera cases in the area and spoke to the families to understand their daily habits, meticulously doing what we would today call contact tracing. He discovered that nearly everyone who had been afflicted used the same <a href=\"https://www.immunology.org/john-snows-pump-1854\" title=\"\">water pump</a> on Broad Street. Snow had the handle of the pump removed, making it unusable, which led to a sharp decline in cholera cases in Soho. It was later found that this particular well was shallow and had been contaminated by a nearby cesspit. In one elegant experiment, Snow had unveiled the spectre of cholera, which had haunted him since his childhood: the cause was just plain old dirty water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f63a4072882a24e93c548103f07594c57fdadf08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f63a4072882a24e93c548103f07594c57fdadf08/0_512_2912_3640/800.jpg\" alt=\"A replica of the Soho water pump identified as the source of a cholera outbreak by John Snow in 1854.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A replica of the Soho water pump identified as the source of a cholera outbreak by John Snow in 1854.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was a problem for colonial powers, because their cities and colonies were unsanitary places. Rapid industrialisation had impoverished both English and Indian rural workers, triggering mass migrations to cities for work. Provided with no public amenities, these new migrants built makeshift homes in unhygienic and polluted slums. Snow\u2019s revelations led to the creation of \u201cImprovement Trusts\u201d and a Commission for Public Health in major cities across India, and these did improve the sanitary conditions, but largely only for British expats and colonial officers. By the end of British rule, clean water was available to nearly all British citizens in India, but <a href=\"https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/india70-a-brief-colonial-history-of-sanitation-in-india-10602/\" title=\"\">only 1%</a> of Indians outside the colonial walls.</p> <p>Today, <a href=\"http://pragati.nationalinterest.in/2014/08/indias-sanitation-story/\" title=\"\">more than half</a> of Indian households have no access to any kind of formal sanitation, meaning that they must defecate in the open, and 70% of sewage is untreated when it re-enters rivers and streams. As a result, up to 30,000 people in India die from cholera every year. Those who can afford it resort to digging their own water wells, deep into the ground. Given the trouble and expense my grandparents went to do this, I know the fact that their well-water still gives me an upset stomach, forcing me to drink bottled water when I visit, brings them great shame. But it isn\u2019t their fault; there is only so much individuals can do when their government refuses to invest enough to ensure clean water for all its people.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>John Snow\u2019s discovery was the first step towards halting cholera. But as the pandemic continued to ravage Europe, effective medicines were needed to prevent and treat the disease. And those could only be developed once scientists understood how dirty water made us sick.</p> <p>In Florence, a contemporary of Snow\u2019s spent his days with his eye pressed up against the cold brass ring of a microscope that he himself had designed. Filippo Pacini was a professor of pathology and a pioneer in the kingdom of the tiny; he had a gift for the new art of microscopy and was naming previously undiscovered parts of the human body when he was only 19. He was convinced that the cause of many medical mysteries, like the ones that afflicted his sisters for most of their lives, could be found through careful observation with this powerful new tool.</p> <p>Pacini <a href=\"http://ccras.nic.in/sites/default/files/viewpdf/jimh/BIIHM_1978/32%20to%2038.pdf\" title=\"\">studied</a> the organs of four patients who had died of cholera. He pored over their intestines with his microscope, and noticed the same thing was wrong in each. The lining of their gut was highly abnormal: not pink and rubbery as it should be, but pale and coming off in floppy sheets, like soggy newspaper. When he teased apart this lining with a tiny probe, he noticed that multitudes of tadpole-like dots emerged from the tissue.</p> <p>Pacini recognised that these dots \u2013 which he called \u201c<em>vibrios</em>\u201d (commas), because of their shape \u2013 must be the cause of cholera. He was the first person to observe for certain what had been speculated for centuries: that diseases could be caused by things too small to see by the naked eye. However, the scientific community failed to appreciate the value of his research, and his findings languished, largely ignored, for another three decades.</p> <p>Pacini had discovered the \u201cgerm\u201d, but it was not until the German physician Robert Koch himself discovered the comma bacillus in Egypt in 1883 that germ theory became popularised. During the following century, further research led to two crucial targeted therapies, based on breakthroughs by scientists from the Indian subcontinent shortly after it gained independence. In 1953, <a href=\"https://peoplepill.com/people/hemendra-nath-chatterjee/\" title=\"\">Hemanda Nath Chatterjee</a> developed a simple mix of salt and sugar that could be added to water to safely replace the copious fluids lost as diarrhoea. The basic recipe is still used today.</p> <p>Six years later, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambhu_Nath_De\" title=\"\">Sambhu Nath De</a> discovered that cholera released a poisonous toxin, which deserved just as much attention as the bacterium itself. Using modest equipment in a laboratory in Kolkata, he showed that the bacteria were not needed to make people sick. If they were stewed in a soupy culture, then removed \u2013 like whole spices \u2013 even just the remaining broth was enough to cause life-threatening intestinal damage and give all the symptoms of the disease.</p> <p>These discoveries transformed our understanding of cholera, and how it could be treated. They provided the basis of two new medicines: oral rehydration therapy, to replace lost salts; and a cholera vaccine, to induce an immune response against the bacteria and its toxin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ebed66dc9af682e5ab50e139d51a437d6b248c63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebed66dc9af682e5ab50e139d51a437d6b248c63/0_94_2883_1729/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A nurse giving sugar solution to a child suffering from cholera in Zimbabwe in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A nurse giving sugar solution to a child suffering from cholera in Zimbabwe in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philimon Bulawayo/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, it\u2019s easy for westerners to get their hands on the <a href=\"https://jcdr.net/articles/PDF/13376/13050_F(SHU)_PF1(KB_SL)_PN(SL).pdf\" title=\"\">most effective vaccine</a>, Dukoral. Using it simply involves adding a vial of the liquid vaccine to water, together with a sachet of a granulated buffer that protects the vaccine from stomach acid. It\u2019s no harder than adding milk and sugar to tea. Two doses will induce an antibody response that will <a href=\"https://youtu.be/e4ZVQvVDH5c\" title=\"\">protect you</a> for about five years. But Dukoral cannot be used in the areas where cholera is most prevalent, because they don\u2019t have access to clean water, so taking the medicine could actually put people at risk. Besides, it is unaffordable in those places; to earn enough to pay for two doses, the average Briton would have to work for less than an hour, while the <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-6-000-is-6-of-a-small-farmer-s-annual-income-according-to-nsso-data/story-rddMw0hk6cSbxjo7E1GyKK.html\" title=\"\">average Indian farmer</a> would have to work for three whole days.</p> <p>There are other, cheaper cholera vaccines, such as Shanchol, which is manufactured by Shantha Biotechnics in India. This has the advantage of not needing any extra water, as it is poured directly into the mouth. But it is not as effective as Dukoral, as it does not protect you against the toxin, just the bacteria. Plus, it still requires two doses given two weeks apart. That\u2019s hardly feasible for healthcare workers trying to cover vast areas of rural India.</p> <p>There are many other obstacles to cholera vaccination programmes. To be effective, they must reach enough of the population to achieve herd immunity. This requires accurate surveillance, which is impossible without a strong and centralised public health system. Like the other countries where cholera is still endemic, India lacks this infrastructure, largely owing to the long shadow of colonial extraction, post-colonial debt, and loans granted by the IMF and the World Bank in the 1990s on the condition that the government reduce its spending, which led to cuts to public health and education programmes \u2013 the very things that a society needs to haul itself out of the conditions that stoke cholera.</p> <p>So although the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of the cholera vaccine in areas where cholera is endemic, and despite the existence of an easy-to-use vaccine which is manufactured in their own country, my relatives in their remote village in Bihar have not had it. But if I, as a westerner, want to visit them for a week, I can easily get it in the UK.</p> <p>Oral rehydration therapy and the cholera vaccine have greatly reduced cholera\u2019s reach in subsequent decades, but it has not gone away completely. Two years after Sambu Nath De\u2019s seminal research, a new pandemic \u2013 the seventh \u2013 sprung up in Indonesia and took hold in Asia and north Africa. This pandemic is still ongoing. More than a billion people live in countries at risk of the disease which, by no coincidence, are some of the poorest countries on earth.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In the two decades after cholera first reached Europe, individual European nations, acting in isolation, tried in vain to prevent and contain it. But there was no point cleaning up port cities at great expense when you could not vouch for the sailors and cargo flowing through it. They eventually realised that a problem caused by globalisation required an international solution.</p> <p>This led to the first example of global cooperation in order to combat a disease. In 1851, the first <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30737-6/fulltext\" title=\"\">International Sanitary Conference</a>, convening the major European imperial powers, was held in Paris. Still, it took time for all those gathered to reach a consensus, and the first International Sanitary Conventions were not adopted until 1892.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781315613598/chapters/10.4324/9781315613598-7\" title=\"\">Anne-Emanuelle Birn</a>, a professor at the University of Toronto School of Public Health, trade was the driving motive of these meetings, and public health just a necessary means. They proved successful: transnational interventions, such as quarantine and disease surveillance by international health bureaux, did bring down cholera deaths. These International Sanitary Conferences proved the power of international cooperation to improve health and boost the economy, and provided the blueprint for the Health Organization of the League of Nations, and later the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/10/world-health-organization-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-pandemic\" title=\"\">WHO</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps the greatest achievement of this cooperation came in 1979, when smallpox was eradicated globally. But unlike smallpox, cholera has not been eradicated \u2013 not because of some insurmountable biological hurdle, but because we have thrown our weight behind schemes that focus solely on cholera, rather than trying to end the poverty that makes such diseases likely. There are still about <a href=\"https://www.who.int/cholera/the-forgotten-pandemic/en/\" title=\"\">3 million cases</a> and 100,000 deaths from cholera every year, all entirely preventable. Based on recent estimates, from 1 January to 25 March of this year, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455997/\" title=\"\">cholera</a> claimed more lives than the <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-toll/\" title=\"\">coronavirus</a>. But we are saying so much about coronavirus and so little about cholera because coronavirus has broken the unwritten rule that dangerous infections should not befall those in the west.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.who.int/gho/epidemic_diseases/cholera/cholera_009.jpg?ua=1\" title=\"\">map</a> of the places still struggling with cholera shows <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/06/maintaining-the-momentum-against-cholera/\" title=\"\">47 countries</a> \u2013 in Central America, sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. This might seem to confirm that tropical countries are bound to nurture this bacteria, because of their warm climates and high population density. But the experience of the Marshall Islands, a remote Pacific archipelago that suffered a cholera outbreak at the end of 2000 and start of 2001, shows that there is nothing inevitable about where the disease takes its toll. As the University of Hawaii researchers Seiji Yamada and Wesley Palmer <a href=\"https://www.medicinasocial.info/index.php/socialmedicine/article/viewFile/12/211\" title=\"\">have shown</a>, two neighbouring islands there experienced very different fates \u2013 despite having similar climates and being just four miles apart.</p> <p>The US maintains a military base on Kwajalein Island, where the menial labour is carried out by low-paid workers who live on <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2016/07/116493/micronesia-ebeye-island-missile-test-photos#slide-1\" title=\"\">another nearby island, Ebeye</a>. Many of them are descended from refugees from other islands in the archipelago who were displaced by US weapons testing in the 40s and 50s. The housing and infrastructure provided to them on Ebeye by the military is not much better than a slum. The average household is home to <a href=\"https://www.tuftsgloballeadership.org/blog/isolation-and-disparity-kwajalein-atoll-noah-rose\" title=\"\">nine people</a>, so infections spread rapidly. The sewers pour their contents into lagoons where people swim and fish, and when it rains they overflow into the streets.</p> <p>At the time of the outbreak, there was no running water on Ebeye. Furthermore, since the land there was not fit for agriculture, traditional Marshallese ingredients were unavailable, and nearly all food was imported, unhealthy and expensive, leaving many malnourished. It was a ship bringing food to the island that is thought to have started the outbreak of 2000-2001.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2694bc371e8dbc130396fda3a396a24368d8d48d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2694bc371e8dbc130396fda3a396a24368d8d48d/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Reiss/USGS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Kwajalein Island, meanwhile, the residents are almost exclusively American expats who work for private military contractors. They live in detached villas with amenities like those of a beach resort, and the population density is 20 times less than that on Ebeye. Once the outbreak had begun, workers were only allowed to commute from Ebeye to Kwajalein if they could prove that they had received vaccination or prophylactic antibiotics. During the cholera outbreak, there were 400 cases and six deaths on Ebeye. However, on Kwajalein there was not a single case.</p> <p>What made contracting cholera so likely on Ebeye and so unlikely on Kwajalein has nothing to do with climate or geography. There is no biological or environmental reason why cholera cannot be eradicated for good in Ebeye, and Bihar, and right across the world. It is not the knowhow that is lacking, but rather the political will to extend these benefits to all people.</p> <p>It is now 200 years since the cholera pandemics began, more than 150 years since the bacteria was identified, and 60 years since an inexpensive treatment and vaccination regime was developed. And yet still this contagion is plaguing some countries as if none of that progress had ever happened. That is the real lesson of cholera.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>There are <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/the-new-coronavirus-could-circulate-forever-says-experts\" title=\"\">fears</a> that coronavirus is now distributed so widely that, like cholera, it may be here for the long haul. It is not yet known whether this current coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, will eventually mutate to cause milder, cold-like symptoms, like the <a href=\"https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/could-we-be-living-with-covid-19-forever\" title=\"\">four endemic coronaviruses</a>; or instead go the way of the first Sars coronavirus and remain as a deadly, but contained, infection. In either scenario, Sars-CoV-2 or a similar future virus could, like cholera, be eliminated only from the richer parts of the world, and left to circulate, with deadly consequences, in the world\u2019s poorest regions.</p> <p>The world will eventually recover a semblance of normality by adopting the same three techniques we used against cholera: prevention of transmission, targeted treatments and global cooperation between nations. But as we saw with cholera, all three strategies can exacerbate global divides, if they are applied selectively to protect only the richer half of the world.</p> <p>There are signs that this is happening already: from richer countries <a href=\"https://qz.com/africa/1805769/coronavirus-chinese-middlemen-deplete-africa-facemasks-supply/\" title=\"\">buying up</a> so much extra personal protective equipment that poor countries will be unable to obtain or afford enough to protect their health workers; to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/were-desperate-for-a-coronavirus-cure-but-at-what-cost-to-the-human-guinea-pigs-kenan-malik\" title=\"\">outsourcing</a> of coronavirus clinical trials to poor countries, like India, that will be less able to afford the vaccine once it is developed; to poor countries becoming blind spots in the world\u2019s gaze on coronavirus, because they lack the <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/openmovements/widening-data-divide-covid-19-and-global-south/\" title=\"\">digital infrastructure</a> necessary to collect comprehensive data about their outbreaks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3b411833015e0d8712b89b42b5a361903d5a1fa9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b411833015e0d8712b89b42b5a361903d5a1fa9/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An oral cholera vaccination being given in Bangladesh in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An oral cholera vaccination being given in Bangladesh in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is hardly news that we live in an unequal world. In the 90s, global health experts began to refer to the so-called \u201c10/90 gap\u201d, based on the fact that only 10% of health research funding was addressing the health problems that affected 90% of the world\u2019s population. At the time, diarrhoeal diseases accounted for 7.2% of global disease burden, but attracted only 0.06% of health research investment. The 10/90 gap has remained largely unchanged. But with this new pandemic, we have an opportunity to put that right.</p> <p>Just as cholera gave birth to global health, coronavirus should trigger its latest reboot. Richard Smith, the former editor of the BMJ, <a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2013/10/08/richard-smith-moving-from-global-heath-3-0-to-global-health-4-0/\" title=\"\">has compared</a> the stages of global health since the first cholera pandemics to the updates of an operating system. I welcome what he calls \u201cGlobal Health 4.0\u201d: namely, research and policy led by researchers and activists from poor countries. And while the WHO has not always lived up to its lofty goals, nor managed to achieve eradication of cholera as it did for smallpox, the solution is not to weaken it, as per Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/trump-decision-cut-who-funding-international-vandalism-coronavirus\" title=\"\">removal of funding</a>, but the opposite: it needs much more funding, and more independence from corporate donors, if it is to help tackle the socio-economic conditions that make us sick.</p> <p>Besides the basic moral argument for a system of public health and international cooperation that benefits all people, it is also in everyone\u2019s interests, because as long as infections blight poor countries, they will continue to pose a threat to the west, too. The Nigerian global health scholar Obijiofor Aginam <a href=\"https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&amp;context=ijgls\" title=\"\">has written</a> that \u201cenormous sacrifices must then be made by the developed world to confront mutual vulnerability\u201d. Coronavirus has reminded us, once again, of this mutual vulnerability.</p> <p>To prevent further pandemics, Aginam calls for a \u201ccommunitarian globalism\u201d: a bottom-up approach, \u201cbased on ideals of fairness, justice, and equitable distribution of scarce but moderate global resources\u201d. We have already seen glimpses of this kind of solidarity in the current crisis: from the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/aggressive-testing-contact-tracing-cooked-meals-how-the-indian-state-of-kerala-flattened-its-coronavirus-curve/2020/04/10/3352e470-783e-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html\" title=\"\">communist government in Kerala</a> giving food and shelter to migrant workers; to the <a href=\"https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/3/30/somalia-sends-20-doctors-to-help-italys-coronavirus-effort\" title=\"\">Somalian doctors</a> offering their help in crisis zones such as Italy; to <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/democraciaabierta/cuba-time-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">Cuba allowing</a> an infected British cruise ship to dock to receive timely medical care by its doctors.</p> <p>There are, of course, important differences between coronavirus and cholera. The fact that coronavirus has a higher transmission rate than cholera, for instance, will make curbing its spread particularly challenging. But the lesson from cholera holds nonetheless. If we allow global health to be funded and governed by the old colonial logic that is embedded in its current structures, then the story will play out as it did for cholera.</p> <p>For now, I will continue to worry about my patients and colleagues in England, and how many of them will succumb to this virus. But while there are certainly better and worse ways to respond to the crisis here in the short term, history will judge us not just on who dies from coronavirus today, but in the centuries to come.</p> <p>For when my patients die during a pandemic in one of the richest countries in the world, it is of course a tragedy, but I can take comfort in the fact that it is an exceptional one, and that every effort is being made to prevent further such deaths. A much bigger moral failing would be if there are still people in the poorest parts of the earth dying of coronavirus in 2200. In 50 years\u2019 time, when I take the road north through Bihar to my ancestral home, I hope I will be able to buy a bunch of bananas in Hajipur without wearing a mask, and fill my nostrils with their sweetness.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

We doctors aren\u2019t used to video-conferencing like this, and still greet each other with excited waving hands. Since the coronavirus crisis began, these daily virtual meetings have proved an invaluable way to keep up to speed on clinical guidelines, in-house protocols and staff wellbeing \u2013 all of which are changing every day. But these meetings also bring us news that we take more personally: how many of our patients have symptoms? How many have tested positive? How many have died? These are important questions, for sure, but my public health training reminds me to think globally. The coming year will see developments that will allow us to bring the virus under control in the west, but what about in other countries? I cannot help but think of my relatives in India, and what this pandemic will mean for them \u2013 not just now, but in the future. The really important question is not who will die of coronavirus tomorrow, but in 200 years\u2019 time. For coronavirus is not the only pandemic the world faces. There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away. While I will surely be able to offer my patients in England a coronavirus vaccine in a year or two, and while western health systems will be reinforced to be more ready for a potential future outbreak, I worry that we may repeat the mistakes of cholera: conquering coronavirus everywhere except for the poorest parts of the world. * * * To reach my grandparents\u2019 house in Bihar, in north-east India, you have to take a car from Patna airport across one of the longest river bridges in the world, the Mahatma Gandhi Setu. This bridge takes you north over the river Ganges, past Hajipur, a city famous for its fragrant bananas, and up to Darbhanga, near the border with Nepal. When I was a child, the road was so damaged by the region\u2019s regular floods and monsoons that the journey, which would take just two hours in the UK, took seven hours, bumping over gut-lurching potholes. Today, the road is smooth and elevated, giving a spectacular view of the area\u2019s lush flood plains. They provide the perfect conditions for cultivating the fruits \u2013 mangoes, lychees and guava \u2013 that still flavour my memories of visits to my grandparents. The wet, semi-tropical conditions in the Ganges delta also make it a hotspot for water-borne diseases. And it is in northern India that cholera is thought to have originated several millennia ago, owing to the abundance of still water pools and Hindu ceremonies involving worshippers washing themselves in rivers. A 2,000-year-old inscription at a temple in Gujarat vividly describes the clinical picture of patients afflicted by severe cholera: \u201cThe lips blue, the face haggard, the eyes hollow, the stomach sunk in, the limbs contracted and crumpled as if by fire.\u201d In the 19th century, the scientist Max von Pettenkofer believed, incorrectly, that cholera required certain soils and environmental factors unique to India, and so thought that it could not be contagious or endemic in Europe. But the persistence of cholera in this area has less to do with climate and more to do with political choices. Cholera is an infectious disease that turns on all the taps in your gut, so that water and salts pour out of your system, giving you copious watery diarrhoea that looks starchy, like rice water. This diarrhoea helps the infection spread between people, leaving a trail of victims so severely dehydrated that, if they don\u2019t receive treatment, they shrivel up like prunes within hours. For centuries, cholera only caused localised epidemics in north-east India. That was until 1817, when one of these outbreaks, originating in Bengal, spread across the world, starting the first of seven cholera pandemics. But just as Wuhan cannot be blamed for the current Covid-19 pandemic, we cannot hold this region responsible for cholera\u2019s spread, any more than North America should be blamed for the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, which originated in industrially farmed pigs. What the spread of these diseases has in common is international trade, and the movement of animals and people that comes with it. Empire shaped the history of cholera, and it was the economic concerns of imperial powers that brought cholera to heel in the west. But if imperialism was crucial to providing the impetus to end cholera, it also produced a logic that divided the world and only eliminated the disease from one half. In his book Plagues and Peoples, the historian William Hardy McNeill describes how the British army carried cholera overland into Nepal and Afghanistan, while British navy and merchant ships carried it beyond the Indian Ocean. That is how the first pandemic spread from the Bay of Bengal to south-east Asia, the Middle East, east Africa, and then to Europe by the early 1820s. In 1831, cholera reached the north-east of England, the region where I grew up. One of the first victims, in Sunderland, was a 12-year-old girl called Isabella Hazard. Her illness was characteristically swift: she was entirely well one evening and dead the next afternoon. She was an early victim of the first of a series of waves of the disease that caused pandemonium in 19th-century Europe. Port cities, crucial to trade, were affected particularly badly. It is hard to imagine the panic created by the \u201cBlue Death\u201d, as cholera was nicknamed, because at the time its cause was a total mystery. The most common theory \u2013 that the disease was associated with \u201cbad airs\u201d (or \u201cmiasmas\u201d) \u2013 inspired desperate experiments to control it. In Kingston, Jamaica, for instance, British colonial officers tried to banish the disease by firing cannons through the streets \u201cto destroy the morbific power that lurked in the dark alleys\u201d. So cholera went on, unabated, in wave after wave of pandemics throughout the 19th century, causing millions of deaths, mainly in poor neighbourhoods. The working classes rioted across Europe, suspecting the disease was a conspiracy by the ruling elite, who they thought were poisoning them. In the 1830s, the revolutionary Mario Adorno accused the Bourbon royal family of concocting \u201ca devilish plot bent on poisoning the people\u201d of Sicily with cholera, as part of his attempt to topple them. But disasters like pandemics are never just destructive \u2013 they also induce change, and often spark scientific developments and social reforms. The European imperial powers eventually started pouring resources into discovering the true cause of the disease, primarily to prevent the catastrophic economic downturns that accompanied every fresh outbreak. This investment led to three major developments that helped end cholera in the western world: reforms that improved public health, to stop populations getting the disease in the first place; the discovery of new medicines, to prevent and treat the disease; and international cooperation, to unite against a common enemy. * * * In 1813, Frances Snow gave birth to her first child, John, in York. She and her husband, William, who worked at the local coal yard, raised John in one of the poorest parts of the city. Like Bihar in India, the area John grew up in was regularly affected by flooding, when the River Ouse broke its banks. When John became a doctor, he grew sceptical of the idea that cholera was caused by \u201cmiasmas\u201d. Instead, he suspected it had something to do with water. He famously proved his theory in 1854, during an outbreak in Soho which killed 616 people. He created a dot map of all the cholera cases in the area and spoke to the families to understand their daily habits, meticulously doing what we would today call contact tracing. He discovered that nearly everyone who had been afflicted used the same water pump on Broad Street. Snow had the handle of the pump removed, making it unusable, which led to a sharp decline in cholera cases in Soho. It was later found that this particular well was shallow and had been contaminated by a nearby cesspit. In one elegant experiment, Snow had unveiled the spectre of cholera, which had haunted him since his childhood: the cause was just plain old dirty water. This was a problem for colonial powers, because their cities and colonies were unsanitary places. Rapid industrialisation had impoverished both English and Indian rural workers, triggering mass migrations to cities for work. Provided with no public amenities, these new migrants built makeshift homes in unhygienic and polluted slums. Snow\u2019s revelations led to the creation of \u201cImprovement Trusts\u201d and a Commission for Public Health in major cities across India, and these did improve the sanitary conditions, but largely only for British expats and colonial officers. By the end of British rule, clean water was available to nearly all British citizens in India, but only 1% of Indians outside the colonial walls. Today, more than half of Indian households have no access to any kind of formal sanitation, meaning that they must defecate in the open, and 70% of sewage is untreated when it re-enters rivers and streams. As a result, up to 30,000 people in India die from cholera every year. Those who can afford it resort to digging their own water wells, deep into the ground. Given the trouble and expense my grandparents went to do this, I know the fact that their well-water still gives me an upset stomach, forcing me to drink bottled water when I visit, brings them great shame. But it isn\u2019t their fault; there is only so much individuals can do when their government refuses to invest enough to ensure clean water for all its people. * * * John Snow\u2019s discovery was the first step towards halting cholera. But as the pandemic continued to ravage Europe, effective medicines were needed to prevent and treat the disease. And those could only be developed once scientists understood how dirty water made us sick. In Florence, a contemporary of Snow\u2019s spent his days with his eye pressed up against the cold brass ring of a microscope that he himself had designed. Filippo Pacini was a professor of pathology and a pioneer in the kingdom of the tiny; he had a gift for the new art of microscopy and was naming previously undiscovered parts of the human body when he was only 19. He was convinced that the cause of many medical mysteries, like the ones that afflicted his sisters for most of their lives, could be found through careful observation with this powerful new tool. Pacini studied the organs of four patients who had died of cholera. He pored over their intestines with his microscope, and noticed the same thing was wrong in each. The lining of their gut was highly abnormal: not pink and rubbery as it should be, but pale and coming off in floppy sheets, like soggy newspaper. When he teased apart this lining with a tiny probe, he noticed that multitudes of tadpole-like dots emerged from the tissue. Pacini recognised that these dots \u2013 which he called \u201cvibrios\u201d (commas), because of their shape \u2013 must be the cause of cholera. He was the first person to observe for certain what had been speculated for centuries: that diseases could be caused by things too small to see by the naked eye. However, the scientific community failed to appreciate the value of his research, and his findings languished, largely ignored, for another three decades. Pacini had discovered the \u201cgerm\u201d, but it was not until the German physician Robert Koch himself discovered the comma bacillus in Egypt in 1883 that germ theory became popularised. During the following century, further research led to two crucial targeted therapies, based on breakthroughs by scientists from the Indian subcontinent shortly after it gained independence. In 1953, Hemanda Nath Chatterjee developed a simple mix of salt and sugar that could be added to water to safely replace the copious fluids lost as diarrhoea. The basic recipe is still used today. Six years later, Sambhu Nath De discovered that cholera released a poisonous toxin, which deserved just as much attention as the bacterium itself. Using modest equipment in a laboratory in Kolkata, he showed that the bacteria were not needed to make people sick. If they were stewed in a soupy culture, then removed \u2013 like whole spices \u2013 even just the remaining broth was enough to cause life-threatening intestinal damage and give all the symptoms of the disease. These discoveries transformed our understanding of cholera, and how it could be treated. They provided the basis of two new medicines: oral rehydration therapy, to replace lost salts; and a cholera vaccine, to induce an immune response against the bacteria and its toxin. Today, it\u2019s easy for westerners to get their hands on the most effective vaccine, Dukoral. Using it simply involves adding a vial of the liquid vaccine to water, together with a sachet of a granulated buffer that protects the vaccine from stomach acid. It\u2019s no harder than adding milk and sugar to tea. Two doses will induce an antibody response that will protect you for about five years. But Dukoral cannot be used in the areas where cholera is most prevalent, because they don\u2019t have access to clean water, so taking the medicine could actually put people at risk. Besides, it is unaffordable in those places; to earn enough to pay for two doses, the average Briton would have to work for less than an hour, while the average Indian farmer would have to work for three whole days. There are other, cheaper cholera vaccines, such as Shanchol, which is manufactured by Shantha Biotechnics in India. This has the advantage of not needing any extra water, as it is poured directly into the mouth. But it is not as effective as Dukoral, as it does not protect you against the toxin, just the bacteria. Plus, it still requires two doses given two weeks apart. That\u2019s hardly feasible for healthcare workers trying to cover vast areas of rural India. There are many other obstacles to cholera vaccination programmes. To be effective, they must reach enough of the population to achieve herd immunity. This requires accurate surveillance, which is impossible without a strong and centralised public health system. Like the other countries where cholera is still endemic, India lacks this infrastructure, largely owing to the long shadow of colonial extraction, post-colonial debt, and loans granted by the IMF and the World Bank in the 1990s on the condition that the government reduce its spending, which led to cuts to public health and education programmes \u2013 the very things that a society needs to haul itself out of the conditions that stoke cholera. So although the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of the cholera vaccine in areas where cholera is endemic, and despite the existence of an easy-to-use vaccine which is manufactured in their own country, my relatives in their remote village in Bihar have not had it. But if I, as a westerner, want to visit them for a week, I can easily get it in the UK. Oral rehydration therapy and the cholera vaccine have greatly reduced cholera\u2019s reach in subsequent decades, but it has not gone away completely. Two years after Sambu Nath De\u2019s seminal research, a new pandemic \u2013 the seventh \u2013 sprung up in Indonesia and took hold in Asia and north Africa. This pandemic is still ongoing. More than a billion people live in countries at risk of the disease which, by no coincidence, are some of the poorest countries on earth. * * * In the two decades after cholera first reached Europe, individual European nations, acting in isolation, tried in vain to prevent and contain it. But there was no point cleaning up port cities at great expense when you could not vouch for the sailors and cargo flowing through it. They eventually realised that a problem caused by globalisation required an international solution. This led to the first example of global cooperation in order to combat a disease. In 1851, the first International Sanitary Conference, convening the major European imperial powers, was held in Paris. Still, it took time for all those gathered to reach a consensus, and the first International Sanitary Conventions were not adopted until 1892. According to Anne-Emanuelle Birn, a professor at the University of Toronto School of Public Health, trade was the driving motive of these meetings, and public health just a necessary means. They proved successful: transnational interventions, such as quarantine and disease surveillance by international health bureaux, did bring down cholera deaths. These International Sanitary Conferences proved the power of international cooperation to improve health and boost the economy, and provided the blueprint for the Health Organization of the League of Nations, and later the WHO. Perhaps the greatest achievement of this cooperation came in 1979, when smallpox was eradicated globally. But unlike smallpox, cholera has not been eradicated \u2013 not because of some insurmountable biological hurdle, but because we have thrown our weight behind schemes that focus solely on cholera, rather than trying to end the poverty that makes such diseases likely. There are still about 3 million cases and 100,000 deaths from cholera every year, all entirely preventable. Based on recent estimates, from 1 January to 25 March of this year, cholera claimed more lives than the coronavirus. But we are saying so much about coronavirus and so little about cholera because coronavirus has broken the unwritten rule that dangerous infections should not befall those in the west. * * * A map of the places still struggling with cholera shows 47 countries \u2013 in Central America, sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. This might seem to confirm that tropical countries are bound to nurture this bacteria, because of their warm climates and high population density. But the experience of the Marshall Islands, a remote Pacific archipelago that suffered a cholera outbreak at the end of 2000 and start of 2001, shows that there is nothing inevitable about where the disease takes its toll. As the University of Hawaii researchers Seiji Yamada and Wesley Palmer have shown, two neighbouring islands there experienced very different fates \u2013 despite having similar climates and being just four miles apart. The US maintains a military base on Kwajalein Island, where the menial labour is carried out by low-paid workers who live on another nearby island, Ebeye. Many of them are descended from refugees from other islands in the archipelago who were displaced by US weapons testing in the 40s and 50s. The housing and infrastructure provided to them on Ebeye by the military is not much better than a slum. The average household is home to nine people, so infections spread rapidly. The sewers pour their contents into lagoons where people swim and fish, and when it rains they overflow into the streets. At the time of the outbreak, there was no running water on Ebeye. Furthermore, since the land there was not fit for agriculture, traditional Marshallese ingredients were unavailable, and nearly all food was imported, unhealthy and expensive, leaving many malnourished. It was a ship bringing food to the island that is thought to have started the outbreak of 2000-2001. On Kwajalein Island, meanwhile, the residents are almost exclusively American expats who work for private military contractors. They live in detached villas with amenities like those of a beach resort, and the population density is 20 times less than that on Ebeye. Once the outbreak had begun, workers were only allowed to commute from Ebeye to Kwajalein if they could prove that they had received vaccination or prophylactic antibiotics. During the cholera outbreak, there were 400 cases and six deaths on Ebeye. However, on Kwajalein there was not a single case. What made contracting cholera so likely on Ebeye and so unlikely on Kwajalein has nothing to do with climate or geography. There is no biological or environmental reason why cholera cannot be eradicated for good in Ebeye, and Bihar, and right across the world. It is not the knowhow that is lacking, but rather the political will to extend these benefits to all people. It is now 200 years since the cholera pandemics began, more than 150 years since the bacteria was identified, and 60 years since an inexpensive treatment and vaccination regime was developed. And yet still this contagion is plaguing some countries as if none of that progress had ever happened. That is the real lesson of cholera. * * * There are fears that coronavirus is now distributed so widely that, like cholera, it may be here for the long haul. It is not yet known whether this current coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, will eventually mutate to cause milder, cold-like symptoms, like the four endemic coronaviruses; or instead go the way of the first Sars coronavirus and remain as a deadly, but contained, infection. In either scenario, Sars-CoV-2 or a similar future virus could, like cholera, be eliminated only from the richer parts of the world, and left to circulate, with deadly consequences, in the world\u2019s poorest regions. The world will eventually recover a semblance of normality by adopting the same three techniques we used against cholera: prevention of transmission, targeted treatments and global cooperation between nations. But as we saw with cholera, all three strategies can exacerbate global divides, if they are applied selectively to protect only the richer half of the world. There are signs that this is happening already: from richer countries buying up so much extra personal protective equipment that poor countries will be unable to obtain or afford enough to protect their health workers; to the outsourcing of coronavirus clinical trials to poor countries, like India, that will be less able to afford the vaccine once it is developed; to poor countries becoming blind spots in the world\u2019s gaze on coronavirus, because they lack the digital infrastructure necessary to collect comprehensive data about their outbreaks. It is hardly news that we live in an unequal world. In the 90s, global health experts began to refer to the so-called \u201c10/90 gap\u201d, based on the fact that only 10% of health research funding was addressing the health problems that affected 90% of the world\u2019s population. At the time, diarrhoeal diseases accounted for 7.2% of global disease burden, but attracted only 0.06% of health research investment. The 10/90 gap has remained largely unchanged. But with this new pandemic, we have an opportunity to put that right. Just as cholera gave birth to global health, coronavirus should trigger its latest reboot. Richard Smith, the former editor of the BMJ, has compared the stages of global health since the first cholera pandemics to the updates of an operating system. I welcome what he calls \u201cGlobal Health 4.0\u201d: namely, research and policy led by researchers and activists from poor countries. And while the WHO has not always lived up to its lofty goals, nor managed to achieve eradication of cholera as it did for smallpox, the solution is not to weaken it, as per Donald Trump\u2019s removal of funding, but the opposite: it needs much more funding, and more independence from corporate donors, if it is to help tackle the socio-economic conditions that make us sick. Besides the basic moral argument for a system of public health and international cooperation that benefits all people, it is also in everyone\u2019s interests, because as long as infections blight poor countries, they will continue to pose a threat to the west, too. The Nigerian global health scholar Obijiofor Aginam has written that \u201cenormous sacrifices must then be made by the developed world to confront mutual vulnerability\u201d. Coronavirus has reminded us, once again, of this mutual vulnerability. To prevent further pandemics, Aginam calls for a \u201ccommunitarian globalism\u201d: a bottom-up approach, \u201cbased on ideals of fairness, justice, and equitable distribution of scarce but moderate global resources\u201d. We have already seen glimpses of this kind of solidarity in the current crisis: from the communist government in Kerala giving food and shelter to migrant workers; to the Somalian doctors offering their help in crisis zones such as Italy; to Cuba allowing an infected British cruise ship to dock to receive timely medical care by its doctors. There are, of course, important differences between coronavirus and cholera. The fact that coronavirus has a higher transmission rate than cholera, for instance, will make curbing its spread particularly challenging. But the lesson from cholera holds nonetheless. If we allow global health to be funded and governed by the old colonial logic that is embedded in its current structures, then the story will play out as it did for cholera. For now, I will continue to worry about my patients and colleagues in England, and how many of them will succumb to this virus. But while there are certainly better and worse ways to respond to the crisis here in the short term, history will judge us not just on who dies from coronavirus today, but in the centuries to come. For when my patients die during a pandemic in one of the richest countries in the world, it is of course a tragedy, but I can take comfort in the fact that it is an exceptional one, and that every effort is being made to prevent further such deaths. A much bigger moral failing would be if there are still people in the poorest parts of the earth dying of coronavirus in 2200. In 50 years\u2019 time, when I take the road north through Bihar to my ancestral home, I hope I will be able to buy a bunch of bananas in Hajipur without wearing a mask, and fill my nostrils with their sweetness. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

A spokesman for the bank, which is owned by a group of industry super funds, said it made the move after figuring out that \u201cthe redraw facility of some legacy home loans could lead to some customers falling behind their original repayment schedules\u201d. Home loan redraw facilities allow borrowers to make extra mortgage payments and either use the money to pay off their loan quicker or draw down cash later on. Customers who have flooded the bank\u2019s Facebook page with complaints appeared to have been caught by surprise by the move. \u201cThe money we lost is actually my husband\u2019s redundancy payment as he was retrenched last week,\u201d one customer, said in a post to the page last week. The customer said her redraw limit had been slashed by \u201cover $16,000\u201d. \u201cWe are not eligible for Centrelink payments and were relying on those funds to get us through,\u201d she said. Another said his limit had been slashed by $20,000 with \u201cno notice\u201d. \u201cActually no communication at all,\u201d he said. \u201cLucky I am not relying on that amount for future purchases, but how would you know that? I have been a loyal customer for over 20 years, and am well ahead of required payments.\u201d Some customers said they had taken their grievances to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. An AFCA spokesman said the authority could not comment on specific cases. ME Bank did not respond to questions about when it discovered the problem, when it made the change or what the typical reduction in redraw was. Its spokesman said about 4% of home loan customers were affected by the change. This equates to a little over 20,000 loans, based on home loan numbers disclosed in the bank\u2019s most recent annual report. \u201cME is in the process of contacting affected customers,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cSome customers could be at risk of not meeting their repayment commitments, potentially leaving them open to financial hardship at the end of the loan term. \u201cWe are reviewing the personal circumstances of each customer affected and are committed to working with them to determine how we can help customers with their individual financial needs. \u201cFor customers whose limits have been reduced, the bank will look to rearrange financing at the bank\u2019s cost.\u201d He said home loan customers in difficulty could apply for a three- or six-month deferment of repayments as part of the federal government\u2019s coronavirus relief package.",

      "bodyText": "Top story: Trump flouts intelligence with Wuhan claims Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray with a round-up of the main headline news this Friday morning. Tensions have emerged in NHS England as it deals with how to redeploy BAME staff away from the virus frontline to safeguard their health. The death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis from coronavirus in English hospitals is more than 2.5 times that of the white population, according to stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies. It also found that deaths of people from a black Caribbean background were 1.7 times higher than for white Britons. One health official said it was \u201creally tricky \u2026 you have to make quite difficult decisions about certain people being on the frontline [dealing with Covid patients] and not others. It\u2019s not like trusts are awash with staff they can start redeploying [to cover BAME colleagues], especially as they have already had to redeploy people to staff Covid wards.\u201d Donald Trump is accused of putting US intelligence agencies under pressure to suggest the virus came from a state-run laboratory in China. The president was asked a few hours ago whether he had seen anything that gives you a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d to that effect, and replied: \u201cYes, I have.\u201d But the office of the director of national intelligence (DNI) had only just gotten through saying that the intelligence community does not believe coronavirus was manmade or genetically modified, though it would examine any \u201cemerging information and intelligence\u201d about whether it came from animals or a laboratory accident. A whistleblower complaint by a US scientist who was abruptly removed from heading the search for a vaccine may add to evidence that Donald Trump is leaning on government agencies to back his claims about the merits of unproven treatments. Dr Rick Bright says he was removed as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda) because he resisted an effort to expand the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat Covid-19. Boris Johnson has promised to set out next week how schools and workplaces might safely reopen once lockdown restrictions are eased. Despite announcing an increase of 674 in the UK death toll, taking it to a total of 26,771, the prime minister suggested the worst was over. \u201cWe are past the peak and we are on the downward slope,\u201d he said, three days after returning to work as he recovers from Covid-19 himself.

Futures for the S&amp;P 500 and Dow industrials were more than 1% lower. The pound is worth $1.256 and \u20ac1.147 at time of writing. The FTSE is pitching downward by 1.2% ahead of the open. The papers \u201cBeckham reverses move to claim furlough cash\u201d, says the Guardian in its front page picture story \u2013 our lead story is Boris Johnson saying Britain is \u201cpast the peak of this disease\u201d. The Sun calls the fashionista Victoria Beckham \u201cPenny pinch Posh\u201d. The words \u201cpast\u201d and \u201cpeak\u201d feature prominently in headline constructions of other papers too, including the Times, Express and Mirror. The Metro has a variation: \u201cWe can see sunlight\u201d. \u201cJohnson pledges to reveal road map out of lockdown\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s the Telegraph \u2013 a few short months ago you might have expected \u201cto Brexit\u201d on the end instead. The i says \u201cUK public will be told to wear masks\u201d as part of easing lockdown. \u201cNow we can care safely\u201d \u2013 the Mail highlights its part in getting PPE to aged carers. \u201cUS stocks on brink of best month since 1987 despite economic pain\u201d \u2013 something non-regular FT riders might find difficult to fathom.

Some half a million will be leaving university, as many more may be leaving school or ending training and further education to emerge into nothingness. If they have lost their entire summer term, they will have had precious little careers advice, most of which was an early victim of austerity cuts anyway. The wealth of research from previous recessions shows that a long spell of early unemployment risks people being scarred for life. </p> <p>Before the virus struck, they might have found jobs that didn\u2019t match their qualifications in pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes \u2013 almost all are now closed.

Many have physical disabilities, illnesses and mental health problems that have been ignored. Many are part of that long tail of lost youth from addicted or violent families; they are care leavers, people with no qualifications pulled into gangs and drugs, and failed by schools and underfunded social services that are unable to pick them up in time.

      "bodyText": "This summer, new cohorts of young people will tumble out of their closed-down schools and colleges into a shut-down world of no work. Some half a million will be leaving university, as many more may be leaving school or ending training and further education to emerge into nothingness. If they have lost their entire summer term, they will have had precious little careers advice, most of which was an early victim of austerity cuts anyway. The wealth of research from previous recessions shows that a long spell of early unemployment risks people being scarred for life. Before the virus struck, they might have found jobs that didn\u2019t match their qualifications in pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes \u2013 almost all are now closed. On the dole they will join millions of others, many of them young, along with the 1.4 million people newly thrown on to universal credit. The Institute for Fiscal Studies warns that young people are already hardest hit, as under-25s were two and half times more likely to have been working in shut-down sectors: just 5% of those in the top decile of earners have lost jobs. Here\u2019s a shocking fact hidden by the steep fall in unemployment figures in recent years: there were always at least 800,000 unemployed under-25s adrift \u2013 not in education, employment or training (Neets). Many have physical disabilities, illnesses and mental health problems that have been ignored. Many are part of that long tail of lost youth from addicted or violent families; they are care leavers, people with no qualifications pulled into gangs and drugs, and failed by schools and underfunded social services that are unable to pick them up in time. As one employment expert said, \u201cThese were the ones we didn\u2019t fix when the sun shone.\u201d Instead of help, they were chased away from claiming benefits by Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s exceptionally punitive Jobcentre-sanctioning regimes demanding they sign in every day. This week the alarm was raised by the Youth Employment Group, a new consortium including the Institute for Employment Studies (IES), the Prince\u2019s Trust and others determined to prevent another lost generation of long-term unemployed people.

In a recession, \u201cwhat kills is not people losing jobs, but the lack of anyone hiring,\u201d says Wilson. It will take a phenomenal government effort to fire up good work programmes. Already Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has talked this week of winding down the government\u2019s furlough scheme. But what happens next to all the millions of employees who will be cast off? Young people are always at the back of the queue. Ministers have no memory: they deliberately forget anything some other government did.

But this time, if they want to prevent unemployment armageddon, they should look back to what Labour did, both with 1997\u2019s new deal for young people and its post-2008 crash rescue programmes. What worked was job guarantees and high-quality training, experienced advisers and subsidies to employers to hire those who were unemployed.

He decided not to pick up. It was Kurt Cobain, who killed himself later that day. There would be many more deaths in the life of Mark Lanegan, a life that is amazingly still going.\u2019 2. Mother of all sci-fi: which is the best Alien movie? \u2018David Fincher\u2019s battles with Fox over the final cut are well documented, as is the flawed decision to kill off poor Newt. But the movie boasts an impeccable supporting cast of British character actors who all enjoy themselves immeasurably, and the decision to retain the earlier films\u2019 use of a pinched and airless setting within which the xenomorphs can wreak their mindless violence turns out to be a splendid one.\u2019 3.

Wildlife through the window: what readers have spotted during lockdown \u2018Across the road from us, on the banks of the Taff, resides a flock of pigeons, some ducks, four geese and a bevy of mute swans. Some of these swans seem to think that the grass is greener on our side of the road, and so like to take full advantage of the new pelican crossing which has been thoughtfully provided by Cardiff council. No pelicans have been sighted thus far, but we live in hope.\u2019 5.

      "bodyText": "Migrant workers on Spanish farms that provide fruit and vegetables for UK supermarkets are trapped in dire conditions under lockdown, living in cardboard and plastic shelters without food or running water. Thousands of workers, many of them undocumented, live in settlements between huge greenhouses on farms in the southern Spanish provinces of Huelva and Almeria, key regions for European supply chains. Local union activists have been supporting the migrants, bringing them water, food and basic supplies since Spain declared a lockdown in mid March. Clare Carlile from Ethical Consumer, a UK UK campaign organisation crowdfunding to support the local activists, says the situation is the result of years of neglect of workers. \u201cThey got visited by the Spanish army on the 18th of March and told to stay put, even though in some places running water is several kilometres away. Now, with Covid fears, a water truck comes twice a week. If you are at work and miss it you must walk several kilometres for water after a hard day. \u201cFailure of employers provide basic rights has for years created dire circumstances for the inhabitants of the settlements. Now, the pandemic has pushed the situation to crisis point.\u201d The workers fear they are unprotected against the virus, both in the unhygienic settlements and when working side-by-side on the farms. Amadou, who is from Mali, is a member of the Collective of African Workers, a grassroots organisation campaigning for an end to the shanty towns in Lepe settlement, Huelva province. We\u2019re living here, feeling scared and afraid, because up until now we haven\u2019t received any kind of help, not in terms of water, gloves, or face masks,\u201d Amadou told Ethical Consumer. Soc-sat, the local agricultural union, is providing food, soap, medicine and nappies for babies in settlements in Almeria and Huelva, while groups say promises have been made by the local state but have not yet materialised. The Guardian has repeatedly reported on dire and sometimes exploitative conditions in the fruit and vegetable picking regions of southern Spain that supply berries and salad to supermarkets across Europe. Spain is the main fruit and vegetables producer in the EU. Around half of the goods \u2013 from salad picked in greenhouses to citrus fruits \u2013 are for the export market. Nearly all, 93%, goes to the EU market: Germany France, the UK. The regions of Huelva and Almeria, where migrants are now struggling under lockdown, are key parts of this cross-Europe supply chain. Huelva is where 97% of the Spanish berry crop is grown; in Almeria, workers producer around 35% of Spain\u2019s total fruit and vegetable exports. Last month Philip Alston, the UN Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, visited Spain; his report was highly critical of the conditions for migrant workers in Huelva. \u201cI visited areas I suspect many Spaniards would not recognise as a part of their country,\u201d Alston said. \u201cIn Huelva, I met with workers living in a migrant settlement in conditions that rival the worst I have seen anywhere in the world. They are kilometres away from water, and live without electricity or adequate sanitation. Many have lived there for years and can afford to pay rent, but said no one will accept them as tenants. They are earning as little as \u20ac30 (\u00a326) per day \u2026 In 2018-19 the strawberry crop in Huelva was worth \u20ac533 million euros. Recent weeks have seen concerns across Europe that supply chains will falter under the pressure of increased consumer demand and more difficult working conditions. The estimated third of the workforce of migrant farm labour who do not have the legal right to work have faced many difficulties under lockdown. Last week a coalition of 27 NGOS called for regularisation of migrant farm workers as well as proper protection from Covid-19. One of the charities, Caritas, said: \u201cThe Covid-19 crisis and lockdown measures are \u2026 putting the spotlight on how acutely the EU\u2019s agricultural system depends on migrant workers. Now that many of them have returned to their home countries, or cannot access the fields due to travel restrictions, vast amounts of fruits and vegetables are at risk of being left unpicked. \u201cIn the fields and in many food-processing plants, labourers toil close to one another with no protective equipment.

      "bodyText": "Heavy snow has fallen on deserted resorts across the high country, as a wintry blast swept south-eastern Australia on Friday. Parts of the Australian alps that were devastated by the summer\u2019s bushfire crisis were blanketed with early falls. More than 20cm fell at Thredbo and surrounding mountains in two days, with more forecast. The Bureau of Meteorology recorded 180mm of precipitation at the resort, which spent the first few weeks of 2020 with bushfires raging on three sides. But the snow has fallen on an empty resort, with national parks in New South Wales and Victoria shut due to the coronavirus. The heavy snowfall comes three weeks before the resort recorded a similar dump last year, with 25cm falling on 27 May. The 2019 season also saw 10cm fall on 1 April, and a spokeswoman from the resort said it was \u201cnot uncommon to receive early season snowfall\u201d before the NSW ski season officially opens in mid-June. Perisher ski resort, which is north of Thredbo in the Snowy Mountains, has recorded 16cm of fresh snow, with 131mm in the bureau\u2019s rain gauge. Selwyn Snow Resort, which was destroyed by the fires along with the abandoned mining village of Kiandra, received 13cm of snow. Across the border in Victoria, the historic Mount Buffalo chalet was doused in pink fire retardant and surrounded by sprinklers as a fire raced up the side of the mountain over summer. On Friday morning, Mount Buffalo\u2019s ski fields, which are higher up the mountain than the chalet, had 16cm of fresh snow. David Chitty, who runs the Mount Buffalo ski school, had to content himself to watching it via the snow camera as the Mount Buffalo and Alpine national parks remain closed. Falls Creek had 20cm of snow, with another 10cm forecast to fall, and Mount Hotham had 16cm. The ski season does not officially open until the Queens Birthday weekend, on 8 June. Falls Creek ski resort has still pencilled in opening night fireworks but the rest of its events calendar is blank. National parks in Victoria and New South Wales remain closed, and residents are still not allowed to travel for non-essential reasons. Queensland, Western Australia and the NT have opened national parks this week, and some are allowing fishing and camping and other outdoor sports. It could mean that alpine towns such as Bright, Thredbo and Jindabyne miss out on their second-busiest season of the year, having lost the summer to bushfires and Easter to the coronavirus shutdown. Victoria\u2019s shutdown laws are due to be reviewed on 11 May, and the national cabinet has said it will review the national baseline restrictions on 8 May. Chitty said he was hopeful that restrictions may be eased. \u201cI think there\u2019s a chance that visitors will be able to visit the snow in some form over this winter,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hard thing is managing social distancing.\u201d His business will survive, he said, because he started setting aside a \u201cwar chest\u201d against national disasters following the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires. \u201cI have been operating since the 1980s so I have been through all the disasters,\u201d he said. Off the mountains, Melbourne recorded its wettest start to the year since 1855. More than 400mm of rain has fallen in the city since 1 January, compared to just 49mm in the same period last year. Friday is on track to be the coldest ever start to May in Melbourne. The maximum temperature is forecast to reach 12C. The previous record for a chilly first of May is 12.8C.

Formerly catalogued as by an unknown Flemish artist, the painting was conserved and reattributed in 2019. It is now thought to combine a landscape by Joos de Momper the Younger (1564-1635) with figures by the workshop of Jan Brueghel the Elder (1568-1625). Flemish artists often specialised in particular types of painting and collaborations of this kind were common.

Photo: Simon Gillespie Studio, 2:B - Claude\u2019s biographer Joachim von Sandrart records that the artist trained as a pastry cook in his native France. He spent most of his subsequent artistic career in Rome, becoming famous for his harmonious classical landscapes. This view shows one of his favourite subjects, the Ponte Molle, a bridge across the River Tiber to the north of Rome.

However, he became best known for his humorous and characterful paintings of birds. Marks prided himself on the accuracy of his bird paintings, and enjoyed regular sketching trips to London Zoo. This painting shows a group of Humboldt penguins clustering and preening on a rock. Image: Dominicans in Feathers (1880-87) by Henry Stacy Marks (1829-98), Birmingham Museums Trust, 4:D - In the first version of this composition, completed in 1870, the dove is red and carries a white poppy. Birmingham\u2019s later variation was begun in 1877 but was unresolved when Rossetti gave it to his sister-in-law, the artist and writer Lucy Madox Brown. The picture was completed after Rossetti\u2019s death by her father, the pre-Raphaelite painter Ford Madox Brown. Image: Beata Beatrix (1877) by Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828-88), Birmingham Museums Trust, 5:A - The lines are taken from Christina Rossetti\u2019s poem, A Bird Song. The picture contrasts the lush green of the summer landscape with the grief of the woman in mourning for a relative killed in the war.

Birmingham\u2019s collection includes a selection of Walton\u2019s works together with his passport. Image: Alpine Climbers (1869) by Elijah Walton (1832-80), Birmingham Museums Trust, 7:B - Born in Pittsburgh, Mary Cassatt began studying art in Philadelphia at the age of 16. She travelled extensively in Europe before settling in Paris in 1874. Birmingham\u2019s portrait is one of only two oil paintings by the artist in UK public collections: the other is in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow. Image: Portrait of a Woman (1881-83) by Mary Cassatt (1844-1926), Birmingham Museums Trust, 8:C - A scallop shell and staff are traditional emblems of pilgrimage. They are particularly associated with pilgrims to the shrine of St James the Great at Santiago de Compostela in north-west Spain. Bunce's painting is inspired by a poem by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, The Staff and Scrip (a name for the pilgrim's bag).

      "body": "<p>Harold Macmillan was British prime minister from 1957 to 1963. A charming Tory with a patchy record, he\u2019s usually remembered for saying that during his government Britons had \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/16/harold-macmillan-never-had-it-so-good\">never had it so good</a>\u201d in their standard of living. What has been forgotten, almost completely, is that he said this in the middle of a pandemic.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1986/dec/30/obituaries\">Macmillan</a> made his claim on 20 July 1957, at a party rally in Bedford. Like Boris Johnson, he was a new premier with a preference for optimistic public statements. In 1957, the British economy was actually quite fragile, and Macmillan acknowledged this in his speech, but the idea that Tory rule kept Britain prosperous and safe was central to his premiership. As now, the party had already been in power for years, and needed to present a Labour government as a terrible risk.</p> <p>The pandemic, of a new strain of flu, had started in China the previous winter. During the first half of 1957 it steadily moved across Asia and then the rest of the world, killing hundreds of thousands of people, to the alarm of the world\u2019s media, including the British press. In June, the first cases appeared in Britain. Yet that month, and again in July, Macmillan\u2019s health secretary, Dennis Vosper, refused to make a public statement setting out the threat the flu posed, arguing that it was not spreading in the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/lack-of-logic-in-boris-johnsons-claims-on-lockdown-and-coronavirus-peak\">Lack of logic in Boris Johnson\u2019s claims on lockdown and coronavirus \u2018peak\u2019 | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By August, the virus was all over north-west England. Macmillan finally began to pay attention. He asked another health minister, John Vaughan-Morgan, for his department\u2019s view of the situation. Vaughan-Morgan replied: \u201cThe general assessment seems to be that eventually [the flu] will affect up to 20% of the population.\u201d But he insisted that the virus was more a public relations than a medical problem: \u201cThis is a heaven-sent topic for the press during the \u2018silly season\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The government advised those with symptoms to stay at home, but otherwise took little national action as the flu spread right across the country <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/1/newsid_3086000/3086843.stm\">during the autumn</a>, instead leaving it to local medical officials to work out what to do. In some areas, schools were closed, but few sporting events or other mass gatherings were cancelled. In October, the peak of the outbreak in Britain, the Conservative party conference went ahead as usual. Macmillan\u2019s speech didn\u2019t mention the pandemic.</p> <p>The outbreak continued into the winter, and ultimately may have killed more than 30,000 Britons. Senior medical figures were horrified at Britain\u2019s performance. John Corbett McDonald of the public health laboratory service wrote to Ian Watson of the Royal College of General Practitioners: \u201cAlthough we have had [over] 30 years to prepare for what should be done in the event of an influenza pandemic\u201d \u2013 since the previous one in 1918 \u2013 \u201cwe have all been rushing around trying to improvise [solutions]. We can only hope that \u2026 at the end it may be possible to construct an adequate explanation of what happened.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/the-language-that-disguises-the-governments-failings-on-coronavirus\">The language that disguises the government\u2019s failings on coronavirus | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many critics of Johnson over coronavirus are hoping for a similar reckoning. The government is expecting one, too, judging by its goalpost-shifting rhetoric, such as the prime minister\u2019s highly selective boast this week that Britain had \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/27/uk-coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-back-at-work-amid-talk-of-easing-lockdown?page=with:block-5ea696548f08fa2bdcb1bff2#block-5ea696548f08fa2bdcb1bff2\">defied so many predictions</a>\u201d about the impact of the virus.</p> <p>But for Johnson\u2019s critics, the fate of Macmillan\u2019s government in the aftermath of the 1957 pandemic is not a reassuring precedent. During the later months of the crisis \u2013 not a point the government has reached yet \u2013 the Tories\u2019 poll ratings did fall sharply. But by the time the next general election came, in 1959, the pandemic had receded. The Labour manifesto didn\u2019t even raise the government\u2019s handling of it.

      "bodyText": "Harold Macmillan was British prime minister from 1957 to 1963. A charming Tory with a patchy record, he\u2019s usually remembered for saying that during his government Britons had \u201cnever had it so good\u201d in their standard of living. What has been forgotten, almost completely, is that he said this in the middle of a pandemic. Macmillan made his claim on 20 July 1957, at a party rally in Bedford. Like Boris Johnson, he was a new premier with a preference for optimistic public statements. In 1957, the British economy was actually quite fragile, and Macmillan acknowledged this in his speech, but the idea that Tory rule kept Britain prosperous and safe was central to his premiership. As now, the party had already been in power for years, and needed to present a Labour government as a terrible risk. The pandemic, of a new strain of flu, had started in China the previous winter. During the first half of 1957 it steadily moved across Asia and then the rest of the world, killing hundreds of thousands of people, to the alarm of the world\u2019s media, including the British press. In June, the first cases appeared in Britain. Yet that month, and again in July, Macmillan\u2019s health secretary, Dennis Vosper, refused to make a public statement setting out the threat the flu posed, arguing that it was not spreading in the UK. By August, the virus was all over north-west England. Macmillan finally began to pay attention. He asked another health minister, John Vaughan-Morgan, for his department\u2019s view of the situation. Vaughan-Morgan replied: \u201cThe general assessment seems to be that eventually [the flu] will affect up to 20% of the population.\u201d But he insisted that the virus was more a public relations than a medical problem: \u201cThis is a heaven-sent topic for the press during the \u2018silly season\u2019.\u201d The government advised those with symptoms to stay at home, but otherwise took little national action as the flu spread right across the country during the autumn, instead leaving it to local medical officials to work out what to do. In some areas, schools were closed, but few sporting events or other mass gatherings were cancelled. In October, the peak of the outbreak in Britain, the Conservative party conference went ahead as usual. Macmillan\u2019s speech didn\u2019t mention the pandemic. The outbreak continued into the winter, and ultimately may have killed more than 30,000 Britons. Senior medical figures were horrified at Britain\u2019s performance. John Corbett McDonald of the public health laboratory service wrote to Ian Watson of the Royal College of General Practitioners: \u201cAlthough we have had [over] 30 years to prepare for what should be done in the event of an influenza pandemic\u201d \u2013 since the previous one in 1918 \u2013 \u201cwe have all been rushing around trying to improvise [solutions]. We can only hope that \u2026 at the end it may be possible to construct an adequate explanation of what happened.\u201d Many critics of Johnson over coronavirus are hoping for a similar reckoning. The government is expecting one, too, judging by its goalpost-shifting rhetoric, such as the prime minister\u2019s highly selective boast this week that Britain had \u201cdefied so many predictions\u201d about the impact of the virus. But for Johnson\u2019s critics, the fate of Macmillan\u2019s government in the aftermath of the 1957 pandemic is not a reassuring precedent. During the later months of the crisis \u2013 not a point the government has reached yet \u2013 the Tories\u2019 poll ratings did fall sharply. But by the time the next general election came, in 1959, the pandemic had receded. The Labour manifesto didn\u2019t even raise the government\u2019s handling of it. The Conservatives talked up their economic record instead, and won easily, increasing their Commons majority to 100. In Britain, it remains disconcertingly easy \u2013 and a sign of how lopsided our democracy is \u2013 for Tory governments responsible for disasters to change the subject. The rightwing bias of the press, worse now than in the 1950s, as there are fewer left-leaning papers, is the obvious villain. But equally important is a reluctance from voters to face up to the sheer scale of what the Conservatives have sometimes got wrong. The 1957 flu catastrophe came the year after the disastrous British military intervention at Suez \u2013 also under the Conservatives, and supported by Macmillan \u2013 which destroyed much of Britain\u2019s credibility as a world power.

The global players\u2019 union, Fifpro, announced the percentage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/20/number-of-footballers-with-depression-symptoms-doubles-during-shutdown-survey-fifpro-coronavirus\">players reporting symptoms of depression</a> had doubled since the shutdown.</p> <p>Last week a player confided to Davies his recent struggles. \u201cHe said he was missing the changing-room banter and bravado, and that he doesn\u2019t have much to turn to in terms of support because he lives by himself.

That is a vicious circle because, as a gambling addict, you\u2019re out of control and reckless with your behaviour. It\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\u201d</p> <p>The absence of routine can also pose problems. \u201cAs a professional footballer you get told what time to be at the training ground, what time training is starting, what time to have breakfast, what time you\u2019re going to finish and, basically, you\u2019re mollycoddled \u2026 Now when you get up in the morning, you might go for a run or do some exercise but that will only last for an hour or so, so what do you do to get that buzz, that rush of scoring a goal?

Sportspeople are competitive and want instant gratification \u2026 People are scratching around trying to bet on other avenues in online betting systems, and that\u2019s a danger in itself, be it slot machines, blackjack or roulette, which are dangerous because it\u2019s just numbers on a screen \u2013 not hard cash.

You can hide it quite well.\u201d</p> <p>Eight years ago Davies crashed into a car close to home because he was watching horse racing on his phone. \u201cI said: \u2018Sorry, I\u2019ve fallen asleep at the wheel, I play football, I\u2019ve had a double session today.\u2019 I looked and there was a kid sat in the car seat in the back and for the first time in my life I felt guilty about what I was doing.

      "bodyText": "It is almost five years since Scott Davies last placed a bet. Losing everything on the 6.30 at Goodwood led him to the brink of ending his life and, ultimately, to seek help for a crippling addiction that put paid to his promising career as a professional footballer. \u201cIt was 8 June 2015,\u201d he says, with total recall. \u201cFor the first time in my life I got scared and that was when I first reached out to my parents.\u201d In nine years he lost about \u00a3250,000, plus \u00a350,000 of his parents\u2019 money, after gambling 80-90% of his wages. These days, he educates players about the dangers of gambling on behalf of Epic risk management, gambling harm-minimisation consultants. The latest Gambling Commission report found 0.5% of people aged 16 and above are classified as problem gamblers but data collected by Epic from every EFL club across 2018-19 identified 7.2% of first-team players as potentially problem gamblers: people who have an urge to gamble continuously despite harmful consequences. This month the PFA reported a rise in players accessing mental health support, with its director of player welfare, Michael Bennett, concerned about an increase in players gambling because of coronavirus. The global players\u2019 union, Fifpro, announced the percentage of players reporting symptoms of depression had doubled since the shutdown. Last week a player confided to Davies his recent struggles. \u201cHe said he was missing the changing-room banter and bravado, and that he doesn\u2019t have much to turn to in terms of support because he lives by himself. He had been off gambling for a few months and thought he was in control of it but this [pandemic] has set him off again. The recent figures don\u2019t surprise me, sadly, but the only slight satisfaction is that players are reaching out. Suffering in silence is the worst thing you can do.\u201d Davies, funded by the PFA, spent 26 days in rehabilitation at a Sporting Chance clinic and understands the temptation facing players. \u201cIf I had to go through this now, I would try to make ends meet by gambling. If someone asked me to take a 30% pay cut in the height of my addiction, when I was earning a couple of thousand a week at Crawley, I would think: \u2018I\u2019ll try and win that 30% back\u2019. That is a vicious circle because, as a gambling addict, you\u2019re out of control and reckless with your behaviour. It\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\u201d The absence of routine can also pose problems. \u201cAs a professional footballer you get told what time to be at the training ground, what time training is starting, what time to have breakfast, what time you\u2019re going to finish and, basically, you\u2019re mollycoddled \u2026 Now when you get up in the morning, you might go for a run or do some exercise but that will only last for an hour or so, so what do you do to get that buzz, that rush of scoring a goal? How do you replicate that? \u201cGambling is often the one people turn to. Sportspeople are competitive and want instant gratification \u2026 People are scratching around trying to bet on other avenues in online betting systems, and that\u2019s a danger in itself, be it slot machines, blackjack or roulette, which are dangerous because it\u2019s just numbers on a screen \u2013 not hard cash. It\u2019s not until you check your bank account that you realise how much you have lost.\u201d At present Davies is limited to virtual sessions but continues to educate EFL players and staff to ensure they understand potential gambling risks, rules around betting integrity and how to look for signs of potential harm. A common trend is experienced players dropping down the leagues and trying to finance a champagne lifestyle on lemonade money. After a workshop at a Championship club last year, Davies says a high-profile player revealed he had a gambling problem. \u201cHe looked like a picture of health and wealth; he was wearing a gold Rolex and dripping in Gucci, but it just shows you don\u2019t know who is struggling. You can hide it quite well.\u201d Eight years ago Davies crashed into a car close to home because he was watching horse racing on his phone. \u201cI said: \u2018Sorry, I\u2019ve fallen asleep at the wheel, I play football, I\u2019ve had a double session today.\u2019 I looked and there was a kid sat in the car seat in the back and for the first time in my life I felt guilty about what I was doing. I thought: \u2018I\u2019m bringing other people\u2019s lives into danger.\u2019 \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know how to stop, how to end this pain I was going through. I gave the driver \u00a3500 that I had stuffed away in my car \u2013 money I had won that day. I drove home and cried myself to sleep. That was a massive wake-up call.\u201d Davies began betting at 16, while earning \u00a350 a week at Reading, and sometimes walked four miles from his digs to training because he could not afford the \u00a31.20 bus fare. From there, his addiction spiralled from playing poker on the Aldershot team bus to haemorrhaging his \u00a330,000 signing-on fee at Crawley inside three weeks. \u201cThere were times when I used to sleep in my car after training because I couldn\u2019t afford to get home.

      "body": "<p>The Apex was nearly finished. A brand new cruise ship for the Celebrity Cruises line, it was a towering, 117,000-ton vessel with luxuries like a \u201cresort deck\u201d featuring martini-glass-shaped jacuzzis and a movable platform cantilevered off the side \u2013 known as \u201cthe Magic Carpet\u201d \u2013 to be used as an outdoor restaurant. As the builders put the finishing touches to it, the company held parties for crew and contractors, even as the rest of the world was shutting down to prevent the spread of coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Alexandra Nedeltcheva was one of the waiters. Though she avoided the parties, she served the contractors and crew at one of the ship\u2019s restaurants. She says she contracted Covid-19 before the Apex even left port.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really scary, you don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to last,\u201d says a coughing Nedeltcheva. She says she had trouble getting anyone to respond to her calls for medicine and help. \u201cWhen I called medical and said, \u2018can you get me some medicine, my head is going to explode\u2019, they said, \u2018there are people sicker than you, stay where you are\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>She is one of more than 100 Celebrity Cruises crew members who have joined a class-action suit filed against the company on 14 April, alleging it failed to take timely action to protect workers, despite having weeks of notice that coronavirus was spreading worldwide.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b05d4419605b955b08d2503b661e2e36ed0a6bff\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b05d4419605b955b08d2503b661e2e36ed0a6bff/0_0_4291_2864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crew on the balcony of the Celebrity Apex cruise ship, Saint-Nazaire, France, 1 April 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apex crew claim the company failed to protect workers.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sebastien Salom-Gomis/SIPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The ship is not an exception. Across the world, a Guardian investigation has uncovered at least 50 ships facing outbreaks of Covid-19 among the crew.</p> \n<p>Nedeltcheva, who managed to catch a charter flight to her home city in Bulgaria, may have been one of the lucky ones.</p> \n<p>Upwards of 100,000 other crew members \u2013 including hundreds of her colleagues aboard the Apex \u2013 remain trapped on their ships.</p> \n<p>Most have no communication with the outside world, and the ones who do are often scared of losing any prospect of future work by complaining. In the course of the Guardian\u2019s investigation, however, a portrait has begun to emerge of what is effectively a nation of floating castaways, marooned on boats from the Galapagos Islands to the port of Dubai.</p> \n<p>The first cruise ship to face Covid-19 cases, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/06/inside-the-cruise-ship-that-became-a-coronavirus-breeding-ground-diamond-princess\">Diamond Princess</a>, was quarantined at dock in Japan for two weeks starting on 3 February. But cruises kept departing until mid-March. Although most passengers have since been repatriated, Covid-19 outbreaks continue to spread among the crew stuck on the ships. Last week employees aboard the Queen Victoria, which had just pulled into Southampton, were told they would have to quarantine in their cabins for 14 days because Covid-19 cases had been confirmed aboard, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/leaked-audio-cunard-cruises-queen-victoria-has-cases-of-covid-19-2020-4?r=US&amp;IR=T\">according to a recording</a> of the captain\u2019s announcement obtained by Business Insider.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13bc6b2b35e6d8a9a38c5029b961e5b1e6e5295a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13bc6b2b35e6d8a9a38c5029b961e5b1e6e5295a/0_0_3902_2600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers in protective gear prepare to check passengers after they disembarked the Diamond Princess cruise ship at the Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama, Japan, 21 February 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Diamond Princess was quarantined for two weeks in Japan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jiji Press/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the US the situation was so grim aboard the Oasis of the Seas, from which rescue crews have repeatedly evacuated sick workers to hospitals in Florida, that the captain made an announcement over the loudspeaker asking crew members not to video their co-workers being taken off the ship in ambulances, according to an account from an employee <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article241922051.html\">given to the Miami Herald</a>.</p> \n<p>Another member of the class-action suit against Celebrity Cruises, which is owned by Royal Caribbean, is Julia Melim, a US resident who hosted the Celebrity Infinity\u2019s shopping and port-tourism show on the shipboard TV channel. Melim was one of only seven crew members allowed to leave the ship in Miami last week. The rest remain aboard. She says there was so much sickness that the ship\u2019s medical personnel cleared out the whole third floor to isolate and treat people who had symptoms.</p> \n<p>The cruise industry says cruise lines were just as blindsided by the pandemic as the rest of the world and that those on ships haven\u2019t suffered higher infection rates than those on land.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for Celebrity Cruises said: \u201cWe have no higher priority than keeping our guests and crew safe, healthy, cared for and well-informed.

      "bodyText": "The Apex was nearly finished. A brand new cruise ship for the Celebrity Cruises line, it was a towering, 117,000-ton vessel with luxuries like a \u201cresort deck\u201d featuring martini-glass-shaped jacuzzis and a movable platform cantilevered off the side \u2013 known as \u201cthe Magic Carpet\u201d \u2013 to be used as an outdoor restaurant. As the builders put the finishing touches to it, the company held parties for crew and contractors, even as the rest of the world was shutting down to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Alexandra Nedeltcheva was one of the waiters. Though she avoided the parties, she served the contractors and crew at one of the ship\u2019s restaurants. She says she contracted Covid-19 before the Apex even left port. \u201cIt\u2019s really scary, you don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to last,\u201d says a coughing Nedeltcheva. She says she had trouble getting anyone to respond to her calls for medicine and help. \u201cWhen I called medical and said, \u2018can you get me some medicine, my head is going to explode\u2019, they said, \u2018there are people sicker than you, stay where you are\u2019.\u201d She is one of more than 100 Celebrity Cruises crew members who have joined a class-action suit filed against the company on 14 April, alleging it failed to take timely action to protect workers, despite having weeks of notice that coronavirus was spreading worldwide. The ship is not an exception. Across the world, a Guardian investigation has uncovered at least 50 ships facing outbreaks of Covid-19 among the crew. Nedeltcheva, who managed to catch a charter flight to her home city in Bulgaria, may have been one of the lucky ones. Upwards of 100,000 other crew members \u2013 including hundreds of her colleagues aboard the Apex \u2013 remain trapped on their ships. Most have no communication with the outside world, and the ones who do are often scared of losing any prospect of future work by complaining. In the course of the Guardian\u2019s investigation, however, a portrait has begun to emerge of what is effectively a nation of floating castaways, marooned on boats from the Galapagos Islands to the port of Dubai. The first cruise ship to face Covid-19 cases, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined at dock in Japan for two weeks starting on 3 February. But cruises kept departing until mid-March. Although most passengers have since been repatriated, Covid-19 outbreaks continue to spread among the crew stuck on the ships. Last week employees aboard the Queen Victoria, which had just pulled into Southampton, were told they would have to quarantine in their cabins for 14 days because Covid-19 cases had been confirmed aboard, according to a recording of the captain\u2019s announcement obtained by Business Insider. In the US the situation was so grim aboard the Oasis of the Seas, from which rescue crews have repeatedly evacuated sick workers to hospitals in Florida, that the captain made an announcement over the loudspeaker asking crew members not to video their co-workers being taken off the ship in ambulances, according to an account from an employee given to the Miami Herald. Another member of the class-action suit against Celebrity Cruises, which is owned by Royal Caribbean, is Julia Melim, a US resident who hosted the Celebrity Infinity\u2019s shopping and port-tourism show on the shipboard TV channel. Melim was one of only seven crew members allowed to leave the ship in Miami last week. The rest remain aboard. She says there was so much sickness that the ship\u2019s medical personnel cleared out the whole third floor to isolate and treat people who had symptoms. The cruise industry says cruise lines were just as blindsided by the pandemic as the rest of the world and that those on ships haven\u2019t suffered higher infection rates than those on land. A spokesperson for Celebrity Cruises said: \u201cWe have no higher priority than keeping our guests and crew safe, healthy, cared for and well-informed. We have at all times worked in close coordination with government and health authorities and are grateful for their guidance. We are working with all appropriate authorities to ensure the safe return home of all our crew members.\u201d The Cruise Line Industry Association says it is still assembling information on how many of its ships have been affected, but says it so far knows of 899 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on board 15 ocean-going cruise ships. \u201cThis accounts for 0.06% of confirmed cases globally,\u201d said the association in a statement. \u201cIt is hard to tell how many of those confirmed cases are crew members, as we are still in the process of collecting that information as well.\u201d Those numbers appear to grossly underestimate the problem, given that the Diamond Princess alone had more than 600 cases. Another cruise ship, the Ruby Princess, which is blamed for spreading the disease around Australia in March, has now surpassed the Diamond Princess in the scale of its deadly outbreak \u2013 21 people died and 900 were infected aboard the ship. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has specifically identified cruise ships as being global spreaders of coronavirus. \u201cCruise ships are often settings for outbreaks of infectious diseases because of the semi-enclosed environment and contact between travelers from many countries,\u201d said a 4 April CDC order, barring those leaving cruise ships from taking any commercial flights in the US. \u201cOutbreaks of Covid-19 on cruise ships pose a risk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage.\u201d Most ships have only one doctor and a few nurses for thousands of passengers and crew, workers say The ships generally rely on hospitals on shore for urgent care. Because of the pandemic, however, the US and other ports are refusing to take all but the most dire cases. \u201cThey are basically getting no healthcare,\u201d says Michael Winkleman, the attorney in Miami who filed the class-action suit. \u201cThey are locked in their rooms and told they can call an advice line for help. But when they call, no one comes.\u201d Cruise lines have little recourse in seeking government help for urgent healthcare. While many of the major cruise companies, including Carnival and Royal Caribbean, are headquartered in the US, the companies are registered in low-tax countries.

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has offered Australians an \u201cearly mark\u201d to ease Covid-19 restrictions next week while warning a return to normality will depend on uptake of the Covidsafe contact tracing app. The prime minister dangled the prospect of a potential loosening of the rules next Friday as he issued his strongest declaration yet that it was conditional on more downloads. Morrison also revealed that net overseas migration is down 30% and is expected to fall by 80% in 2020-21, both compared with 2018-19, in a sign the economic contraction from Covid-19 will last much longer than restrictions to social life. Treasury officials and the Reserve Bank both estimate that unemployment is set to top 10%. The first restrictions were eased this week with New South Wales allowing visits to friends and relatives, and a similar measure announced on Friday in the Australian Capital Territory, the first Australian jurisdiction with no active cases. The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, described allowing family visits and resumption of non-essential retail as a \u201cdownpayment\u201d on further changes to be considered next week, expected to include allowing small outdoor gatherings as a first step out of the lockdown. Morrison said two further meetings of national cabinet were scheduled next week and then leaders would decide next Friday \u201cabout how restrictions can be eased\u201d. Morrison told reporters in Canberra that 3.5 million Australians have downloaded the Covidsafe tracing app, explaining that boosting downloads is one of four unmet conditions to ease restrictions. \u201cWe need that tool so that we can open up the economy,\u201d he said, declining to nominate a precise target. \u201cIt\u2019s over to you, Australia.\u201d Morrison acknowledged the need to tread carefully. \u201cWe do not want to go into a start-stop or \u2013 even worse \u2013 a reverse process into the future,\u201d he said. The health minister, Greg Hunt, had previously suggested a target of 40% \u2013 which would suggest as many as 10 million Australians would need to download the app \u2013 but that figure was disavowed by health department officials who have said even 20% would be a good result. Morrison noted that regulations governing the app prevent employers mandating employees download it, but suggested businesses, including cafes, would encourage their patrons to do so in a bid to restart the economy. Appearing alongside the sports and aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, Morrison announced an extra $205m for the aged care sector to implement an industry code of practice on protection against Covid-19. Colbeck said the national cabinet had developed a set of principles for phased resumption of community sport, starting with non-contact activities with 10 or fewer participants ramping up to full contact training and competition. According to a government statement, the initial phase allows for the resumption of children\u2019s outdoor sport with strict physical distancing measures for non-sporting attendees such as parents, and outdoor recreational activities including outdoor-based personal training and boot camps, golf, fishing, bush-walking, and swimming. But the principles note that \u201cindividual jurisdictions will determine progression through these phases\u201d. Even with the prospect of restrictions being eased, the economic impacts of the coronavirus crisis continue to mount. Morrison said Australia was facing a \u201csignificant fall\u201d in net overseas migration which would trigger a \u201clag impact\u201d on the Australian economy beyond the immediate health crisis. He argued it was not a \u201clong-term\u201d change, suggesting it would be reasonable to assume borders would be open by the end of 2021, but he noted Australia had outperformed expectations in the past six weeks. Morrison revealed some 650,000 businesses had signed up to the jobkeeper program, an increase on the 540,000 businesses and 3.3 million employees reported by Treasury officials on Tuesday. Morrison played down the possibility of further changes to the $130bn program, noting that there are \u201cmany calls\u201d on the federal budget \u2013 including jobseeker unemployment benefits \u2013 and the commonwealth has \u201cno plans\u201d to change eligibility of either program beyond administrative changes. Morrison also said it was too soon to say whether the free childcare package would be extended beyond late June, when it is due to expire. The government has previously kept the door open to having it in place for six months, similar to other support packages, but there have been lingering concerns across the childcare sector that their normal funding is down. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said testing for Covid-19 would be expanded to include samples of certain groups that were not showing symptoms \u2013 including health and aged care workers and elective surgery patients. The aim of this testing, Murphy said, was \u201cto make sure that our confidence that we don\u2019t have significant asymptomatic transmission is correct\u201d. The government\u2019s latest modelling on the effective rate of transmission covers fewer states than last week, because of a lack of data. In the two states where there were adequate figures \u2013 NSW and Tasmania \u2013 the rate of transmission remained below 1, meaning one person with the virus transmitted it to fewer than one person on average. Murphy said Tasmania was comfortably now below the 1 benchmark, as it had brought the outbreak in the north-west of the state under control.",

International students from outside the EU are meanwhile paying the highest rates for their tuition.</p> <p>Some who went home are attending online lectures at night because of time differences. Harshita Iyer, 25, studying at the London School of Economics (LSE), is back in Canada with a five-hour time difference. \u201cI\u2019m lucky most of my classes are in the afternoon, but I know people who have lectures at 1am,\u201d she says. She is also worried about how the time difference will affect her ability to do upcoming exams.</p> <p>Some who have returned home have internet problems. Shanavi Dessai, 18, who is one of around 400 international students at the University of Sussex to have signed an open letter calling on the university to reimburse their fees, is back in India. \u201cIt\u2019s monsoon season here soon and electricity problems are rampant,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is honestly horrible.\u201d</p> <p>Alex Arroyo, 18, studying at the University of Portsmouth, is stuck in Menorca trying to study online without his laptop. \u201cMy return flight was cancelled and I\u2019ve been in lockdown for five weeks,\u201d he says. \u201cI left everything in the flat.\u201d Arroyo says he\u2019s been using his iPad to study but can\u2019t access all of the sites he needs.

Like Schermers, she says she was scared to stay in cramped university accommodation. Instead, Knight moved into her partner\u2019s flat, but now faces the daunting prospect of having to pay thousands of pounds in double rent for six months, because she can\u2019t get out of her student housing contract. \u201cI don\u2019t qualify for any financial assistance because I\u2019m not a UK citizen, and [to qualify for financial assistance from Canada] you have to have been working for the past 12 months.

The vast majority of our more than 340,000 frontline team members have expressed pride in the role they are playing in helping provide for families across the country during this time of need.\u201d</p> <p>Whole Foods workers organized their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/31/whole-foods-coronavirus-outbreak-us-health\">first sick-out</a> protest on 31 March, and are joining the 1 May day of action <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FtqA27f6Br_o1Uw3R7jjI3pJ3NPV_2kCIBLbJ8lFaCo/edit\">calling on</a> more workers to join the sick-out and participate in organized protests.</p> <p>The sick-out includes demands such as increased hazard pay, paid sick leave for workers who choose to isolate or self-quarantine, and the closure of stores in response to confirmed coronavirus cases among workers.

Our team has been diligently working to offer new policies, guidelines, product features, resources, increased bonuses, and personal protective equipment to ensure the health and safety of shoppers during this critical time.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of workers at Amazon warehouses, Whole Foods grocery stores, Target retail stores, and shoppers at Instacart and Shipt called out sick on Friday as part of a coordinated one-day strike across the US in protest of working conditions and inadequate safety protections during the coronavirus pandemic. The 1 May walkout began after Amazon ended its unlimited unpaid time off policy for workers at the end of April. \u201cThe fact they took it away prior to the sick-out lets you know they\u2019re aware of the sickout and trying to stop people from participating in that,\u201d said Derrick Palmer, an Amazon employee at the JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York, who has worked at Amazon for more than four years. \u201cNow they\u2019re forcing people to go to work because if you run out of unpaid time off, that\u2019s it, you\u2019re fired.\u201d Palmer was one of the workers who participated in protests outside of JFK8 warehouse a few weeks ago in demand of safety protections for Amazon workers. An assistant manager at JFK8, Chris Smalls, was fired shortly after he organized the protest. Palmer said that after the protests, Amazon began providing personal protective equipment to workers and enforcing social distancing rules and temperature checks, but he said cleaning procedures remain inadequate. \u201cWhile we respect people\u2019s right to express themselves, we object to the irresponsible actions of labor groups in spreading misinformation and making false claims about Amazon during this unprecedented health and economic crisis,\u201d said the spokesperson in an email. At Target, workers complained it took too long for the company to provide workers with personal protective equipment, and little is being done to enforce social distancing within stores. According to Target Workers Unite, over 100 stores and some distribution centers are represented in the sickout. \u201cI\u2019m participating because Target Corporation has not designed or enforced adequate protection for its workers,\u201d said Sophie Haras, who has worked at a Target store in Hadley, Massachusetts for over one year. \u201cSocial distancing guidelines are regularly ignored by both employees and guests, and the amount of customers allowed inside the store is in the hundreds, so high that my store leader, among others, has decided not to count customers at all. Target has also neglected to be transparent about positive cases of Covid-19, both in our stores and distribution centers.\u201d Michelle Enright, a department specialist at Target in Sterling Heights, Michigan for 28 years, is participating in the sick out due to the lack of protections provided to workers during the pandemic. \u201cThere is no support from Target corporate,\u201d said Enright. \u201cWhat we want to do is make the point we are humans, we can get sick, and we\u2019re not just pieces of a machine.\u201d A Target spokesperson told the Guardian in an email: \u201cWhile we take them seriously, the concerns raised are from a very small minority. The vast majority of our more than 340,000 frontline team members have expressed pride in the role they are playing in helping provide for families across the country during this time of need.\u201d Whole Foods workers organized their first sick-out protest on 31 March, and are joining the 1 May day of action calling on more workers to join the sick-out and participate in organized protests. The sick-out includes demands such as increased hazard pay, paid sick leave for workers who choose to isolate or self-quarantine, and the closure of stores in response to confirmed coronavirus cases among workers. At least two Whole Foods employees have died from coronavirus, and over 200 workers have tested positive around the US. \u201cWe are organizing a sickout on May 1 to call on Whole Foods to provide the protective measures listed in our demands, which they have not provided despite internal complaints, a letter from fourteen state attorney generals, and concerns raised with OSHA,\u201d said Dan Steinbrook, a Whole Foods employee in the Boston, Massachusetts area and one of the organizers of the sick out. A Whole Foods spokesperson disputed the claims of workers calling for the sickout protest. \u201cOur focus right now is ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our Team Members, which remains our top priority, while continuing to serve our customers and communities,\u201d said the spokesperson. Shoppers at Instacart organized their first sick-out protest on 30 March, and Shipt shoppers launched their own independent sick-out protest on 7 April. Vanessa Bain, an Instacart shopper in the San Francisco, California, area and an organizer of the sick out, noted few Instacart shoppers have received personal protective equipment kits in response to demands made during their first sick-out protest. She received a PPE kit, which included a paper-thin mask, hand sanitizer, and a thermometer that didn\u2019t work. As Instacart hired 300,000 new shoppers in the month of April, and continues to hire more to keep up with increased demands for grocery delivery services, Bain asserts Instacart has to take meaningful action to protect workers and the public during this pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build a movement across companies and elevate each other\u2019s demands,\u201d said Bain. \u201cWe\u2019re all in the same position as frontline workers making similar demands that companies have failed to meet that are basic and essential to be able to do our jobs safely.\u201d An Instacart spokesperson told the Guardian in an email: \u201cWe remain singularly focused on the health and safety of the Instacart community. Our team has been diligently working to offer new policies, guidelines, product features, resources, increased bonuses, and personal protective equipment to ensure the health and safety of shoppers during this critical time.\u201d",

I felt angry and embarrassed. I\u2019d never missed a bill before \u2026 I had no choice but to go back to work,\u201d he said. Haynes is among a rapidly growing number of working people faced with impossible economic and health tradeoffs during the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 which has so far left more than 61,000 Americans dead and 30 million unemployed. A third of American households \u2013 about 120 million people \u2013 still risk having their water disconnected and racking up exorbitant fees, despite calls from a coalition of lawmakers and advocates to suspend all utility shutoffs until the country drags itself out of this unprecedented crisis. And while more than 600 localities and 13 states have mandated moratoriums on disconnecting residents since early March, some of these will soon expire as states reopen for business. In Tennessee, where the energy burden is also very high, the governor has resisted calls for a statewide moratorium, claiming utility companies \u2013 like socially distancing residents \u2013 can be trusted to do the right thing. So far, a handful of utilities serving 2.2 million, or 30% of Tennessee residents, have suspended shutoffs. None have agreed to reconnect households without running water despite the serious public health threat posed by poor hygiene. Deborah O\u2019Barr, 62, from Goodspring, has lived without running water since 2016. It\u2019s a complicated situation: she and her husband, Bobby, 63, who are both disabled, bought the house in a private sale, assuming it would be easy enough to get the water reconnected \u2013 it was shut off before they moved in because of unpaid bills. It was not reconnected, and for four years they have relied on a local spring and their son for water to cook with and drink, as well as rainwater for the toilet and cleaning. According to the local water department\u2019s rules, O\u2019Barr must prove that she is the legal homeowner, and then pay $1,050 for a new meter. But the deeds are still in the name of the previous owner, who is in prison on remand, and even if this could be resolved, O\u2019Barr says she doesn\u2019t have the money. \u201cIt feels like nobody cares. We must be the lowest of the low as far as the water company is concerned. We just don\u2019t matter, not even during a pandemic,\u201d said O\u2019Barr. They are not the only ones without tap water relying on wells and springs, according to Connie Gatlin, office manager for Minor Hill water utility district. \u201c[Mrs O\u2019Barr] has been aware of the utility\u2019s rules and requirements since 2016. [She\u2019s] waited for the pandemic to bring it up again. It\u2019s up to each [utility] board to decide about reconnections, that\u2019s what the governor said.\u201d \u201cWe need a state moratorium [on shutoffs],\u201d said Brianna Knisley, of the advocacy group Appalachian Voices, who is concerned about the looming recession. \u201cThe stay-at-home order expired on 30 April, but many people don\u2019t have jobs to go back to.\u201d Even before the current crisis, water affordability was a growing nationwide problem, after years of price hikes left an expanding number of low-income households struggling to pay bills. As a result, some public water utilities increased shutoffs, ostensibly to encourage people to pay up on time: about one in 20 households were disconnected in 2016, according to research by Food and Water Watch (FWW). In addition, more than 2 million people do not have indoor plumbing \u2013 no running water or flushing toilet. Nationwide, nobody knows how many Americans were without water at the start of the pandemic \u2013 nor how many have been disconnected since. What is known is that financial aid to help families and utilities keep taps running has so far been excluded from federal rescue packages. The water and sewage industries estimate $26.4bn in lost revenue, mostly as a result of the industrial and business lockdown \u2013 which is fuelling concern that small towns may feel forced to sell off their utilities to big for-profit corporations. \u201cIt is appalling that the federal government is still dragging its feet,\u201d said Mary Grant of FWW. \u201cCongress must act in the public\u2019s interests and order a national moratorium on water shutoffs while providing financial relief to our local public water providers. Our communities are in crisis and can\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d",

This week\u2019s superb BBC Four documentary on Oxford\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08bm92k\">Young Rembrandt</a> exhibition, narrated off-screen by Simon Schama, left me delighted but baffled.

      "bodyText": "A woman sits on a bench by the Thames. Two policemen arrive and tell her to stand up. Two boys remove their shirts in Holland Park. They are told to put them back on. A policeman shouts at two girls in bikinis on Primrose Hill to get dressed. How dare they enjoy themselves. You can crowd a London Tube train but not climb a Welsh mountain. You can drive to a country footpath, but only if the walk takes longer than the drive. Michael Gove will allow you out \u201cjust for an hour\u201d. The trouble with official curbs on personal freedoms is that they degenerate into idiot authoritarianism. Rules become ever more pernickety, because their enforcers regard mere enjoyment as abuse. Gove\u2019s directorate is like The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, if not Oliver Cromwell. The latter\u2019s blue laws similarly told women how to dress, and banned walks, pubs, plays, sports and the celebration of festivals. To unbridled power, the only lawful activity is one \u201cnecessary\u201d to the security of the state. Is pleasure really unnecessary and happiness a menace? This week\u2019s superb BBC Four documentary on Oxford\u2019s Young Rembrandt exhibition, narrated off-screen by Simon Schama, left me delighted but baffled. Why can I crowd Oxford\u2019s supermarkets but not its Ashmolean Museum? Why are people trusted to \u201csocially distance\u201d in a DIY shop but not in a garden centre or a National Trust park? My local hardware store can sell from its front door, but not my local pub. Only time will tell whose model of coronavirus was correct, and which government\u2019s means of combating it was most effective. Out of a sort of desperation, we have all become statistical nerds, and we strive to be objective.

      "bodyText": "Millions of households have missed, or expect to miss, payments on at least one bill as a result of the coronavirus crisis, and could face serious consequences as a result, the charity Citizens Advice has said. Since the lockdown started, millions of workers have been furloughed or laid off by employers, and seen their pay fall as a result. Measures have been put in place to allow borrowers payment holidays and stall evictions, but the charity said that after these protections are lifted, millions face a \u201cfinancial cliff edge\u201d. A survey of 2,016 people carried out for Citizens Advice found a quarter of respondents had missed, or expected to miss, a payment, and 20% had missed payments of rent, council tax or telecoms bills. Arrears in these payments can have the most severe consequences, the charity said, with eviction, bailiff action or disconnection possible. If the results are extrapolated across the rest of the population, Citizens Advice said 11 million people could face problems when protections put in place during the crisis end. Property possessions and face-to-face bailiff recovery have been paused, but these measures are not due to continue beyond June. The survey found that people facing the greatest health risk from coronavirus were three times more likely to have fallen behind on a bill than average, and that the figure was the same among those in insecure work, such as agency workers and those on zero-hours contracts. Those aged under 40 were four times as likely to have missed payments as those over 40. The charity called on the government to fast-track the abolition of no-fault evictions and ensure tenants are given the chance to make up payments that they miss as a result of the crisis. It also wants councils to receive financial support to offer payment holidays to those struggling to meet council tax bills. Lucretia Thomas, a project adviser at Citizens Advice Enfield, said the pandemic had had a \u201cdevastating\u201d effect on households, with some facing the threat of eviction from landlords. \u201cMany families that we see are in insecure employment and have lost income during the lockdown,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re telling us that their household expenses have increased as they stay at home to reduce the spread of Covid-19 during this challenging time and beyond.\u201d Dame Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said government measures had eased the financial burden for many households, \u201cbut millions still have reason to fear the looming financial cliff edge when these protections end\u201d.

Thank you for your company and correspondence, commendations and criticisms, all of it a welcome and vital part of our community\u2019s discussion. Be well, and stay safe. Tonight in Australia: 6,767 cases have been recorded in Australia after 14 new cases in the past 24 hours. 1,022 are still active cases, 83 people are in hospital, with 28 in intensive care. South Australia has had no new cases for nine days, Queensland for five. The death toll is 93 \u2013 NSW 43, Victoria 18, Tasmania 13, WA eight, Queensland four, SA four, ACT three. Twenty-one of the deaths were among passengers of the Ruby Princess cruise ship, four were on the Artania in WA and 13 were residents at the Newmarch House aged care home in Sydney. More than 3.5 million people have registered with the federal government\u2019s tracking app Covidsafe since Sunday. On restrictions, closures and suppression measures: National cabinet will decide on relaxing some social and economic clamps next Friday, a week earlier than expected. Australia\u2019s borders won\u2019t reopen for at least three months, the federal government says. More than 340,000 businesses have received a cashflow boost worth over $6bn Aged care providers will get $205 million to help keep homes open to visitors through extra screening staff and protective equipment. More than 1.5 million people are on jobseeker, with 900,000 claims processed in the past six weeks. In NSW from midnight Friday, households will be allowed two adult visitors, and their children, under an initial easing of self-isolation measures. Most beaches are open for exercise, swimming and surfing only. In WA, up to 10 people are able to gather for non-contact recreational activities and outdoor personal training, while open homes and display villages will also be permitted. In Queensland, some stay-at-home restrictions will be eased on Saturday, allowing people to travel 50km from their residence to visit parks, have picnics and jet ski. Shopping for non-essential items will also be permitted. The Northern Territory is implementing a three-stage easing of restrictions starting with reopening parks and allowing people to golf, fish and swim with others from May 1 before restaurants and bars reopen with a two-hour limit on May 15. Bans on entertainment venues will be lifted in the third stage. Tasmania will on Monday ease restrictions in the state\u2019s northwest which forced retailers and schools to stay closed. Victoria has no plans to lift restrictions until May 11 at the earliest. Victoria will launch a website showcasing live music and comedy performances on Sunday with creators given access to $2.35 million in grants. NSW students will attend school one day a week starting from May 11. Queensland will on May 15 review keeping children at home. No change has been flagged in Victoria. Western Australia hopes all students will return to classes by May 11 while 63 per cent of students have gone back in SA. Still open: supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, public transport, some schools, hairdressers, petrol stations, postal and freight services, bottle shops, newsagents, retail shops. Restaurants restricted to takeaway and delivery in most states. In other developments: Five Australian hospitals will receive the experimental drug remdesivir from US pharmaceutical company Gilead. Five defence force officers have been flown home after contracting the virus in the Middle East. 23 aged care facilities have had an outbreak, 15 have cleared it. The Guardian\u2019s international liveblog continues here: And to the Northern Territory: The Northern Territory government insists its health system is prepared for a potential second wave of coronavirus cases, as four defence force members with Covid-19 arrived from overseas. The four returned from the Middle East on a routine Australian Defence Force flight that landed in Darwin early on Friday morning. It occurred a day after Chief Minister Michael Gunner laid out his road map for winding back coronavirus restrictions in three stages over five weeks, with all businesses including restaurants, bars, cafes and gyms to reopen. The NT had recorded no new cases of coronavirus since April 6, with only three of 28 people to test positive still recovering. There have been no deaths or community transmission, with all cases related to travel, but a second wave of the virus is considered a high risk, especially if restrictions are removed too quickly. The Australian Defence Force says it decided to test personnel \u201cafter being notified that a number of locally engaged contractors had tested positive\u201d but did not say where the officers became infected.. The four were asymptomatic and taken to Royal Darwin hospital for assessment and placed in isolation. A number of other people on that flight went into mandatory quarantine, NT Chief Health Officer Dr Hugh Heggie said. A fifth ADF member who tested positive recently completed their deployment and returned to Australia and is currently in mandatory quarantine in Brisbane. \u201cDefence will take all necessary measures in consultation with our coalition partners, relevant host nations and Australian federal, state and territory governments to ensure ADF personnel receive the treatment and care required,\u201d the ADF said in a statement. The public were safe because everyone on that plane that landed on the Friday morning plane was in quarantine and not \u201cwalking the streets or in shopping centres\u201d, NT Health Minister Natasha Fyles said. Fyles said the health department had done acute care scenario testing to prepare for an outbreak of COVID-19, it had a pandemic plan, and a lot had been learnt when repatriated Australians from China and a cruise ship were quarantined in Darwin earlier this year. NT Police Commissioner Jamie Chalker said Territorians had been wonderful in their compliance with restrictions so far and urged them to remain vigilant and maintain measures, such as physical distancing, with parks starting to open this long weekend. South Australia has enjoyed nine days of zero new Covid-19 cases. But the premier has warned against complacency, and lifting restrictions too early. From AAP: Talks of lifting South Australian coronavirus restrictions will begin in a week\u2019s time but if done too early, could be a blow to the economy, the premier says. Steven Marshall said restaurants, cafes and pubs could open to a bookings-only system where social distancing and good hygiene would remain in place when restrictions lifted. \u201cWe may need to go back to the proprietor of that restaurant to find out who was dining there on a certain night if we find out someone had been infected and was present there, so there will be modifications,\u201d the premier said on Friday. He encouraged South Australians to participate in non-contact sports, such as tennis, golf and lawn bowls, so long as they coincided with current restrictions. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re not using the change rooms and facilities and keep the numbers under 10, we\u2019re encouraging people to get out and play.\u201d Marshall said more clarity around contact community and recreational sports could also be given from next Friday, now it\u2019s been confirmed that decisions will be made by individual states or territories. Decisions on elite sports that require crossing jurisdictions will be made at the national level. \u201cWe know sport is part of our psyche here in Australia but we\u2019ve got to do it in a way which is safe,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWe have to recognise that different jurisdictions are at different points along the curve in terms of the pandemic.\u201d He said the cabinet will meet twice next week to further discuss the right way to incrementally lift restrictions. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one shot to get this right here in SA. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to have this in-and-out orientation, releasing them and then putting them back in place a few weeks later. \u201cIt would have an enormous cost to the economy.\u201d It comes as the state reported its ninth consecutive day of zero Covid-19 cases. The state\u2019s total remains at 438 with 97 per cent considered recovered. There are no longer any patients in intensive care but three people remain hospitalised. SA Pathology has conducted more than 58,000 tests since February and although the two-week blitz has finished, the testing remains open to anyone who has minor symptoms. The Australian Digital and Data Council (you didn\u2019t know we had one, did you) met today by phone: a meeting of the state, territory and federal ministers, as well as NZ\u2019s minister for broadcasting, communications and digital media. The major topic was, of course, Covid-19, \u201cthe largest disruptive event the world has seen in many years\u201d. The meeting reported that 3.5 million people in Australia have downloaded the Covidsafe app. \u201cMinisters acknowledged privacy concerns are still front and centre for many people when deciding whether to download the app and were an important consideration in the app\u2019s design.\u201d The NSW government has released a statewide Covid-19 \u2018heat map\u2019, showing pandemic information by postcode. The map details the number of active cases, testing rates, and number of recovered cases in each local community. \u201cThis new way of showing NSW Health data will help communities understand the numbers of people being tested, and encourage more people with symptoms to come forward for testing when they see the impact COVID-19 is having on their local area,\u201d NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian said. \u201cIt also provides encouraging data showing how people are bouncing back from the virus.\u201d It\u2019s accessible here. Cholera has largely been beaten in the west, but it still kills tens of thousands of people in poorer countries every year. As we search for a cure for coronavirus, we have to make sure it will be available to everyone, not just to those in wealthy nations. This is a fine piece by Dr Neil Singh. For coronavirus is not the only pandemic the world faces. There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away. The chief of Australia\u2019s Defence Force, General Angus Campbell, has written to the families of ADF members, thanking them \u201cfor the continuous sacrifices that you and your family make in supporting us\u201d. He said the role of Defence in Australia\u2019s Covid-19 response was critical, \u201cand I thank every Australian Defence Force member, their parents, partners and children for the patience, resilience, understanding and support they continue to provide so that we can continue to serve\u201d. The ADF has established Operation Covid Assist, deploying military personnel within Australia to assist state and territory governments with contact tracing, planning and logistics, and working alongside police to enforce mandatory quarantine arrangements for international arrivals. Five members of the Australian Defence Force have caught Covid-19 while serving in the Middle East. On that note I am going to hand over to Ben Doherty. Stay safe, stay warm, and if you have any respiratory symptoms or a fever, however mild, please do get a Covid-19 test. My nephew (a reliable source) had one today and says they \u201ctickle\u201d. So I imagine adults can manage it. A reminder: In other news, if you, like me, are in Melbourne, you may have noticed that it is quite cold. Almost record-breakingly cold for the first of May, in fact, although the dial did just inch above 12C this afternoon. There has been significant snowfall across the alpine resorts, which just a few months ago were on fire or close to it. The ski season doesn\u2019t officially start until next month so it\u2019s possible coronavirus restrictions could by then be eased to allow some skiing. In the mean time, check out these beautiful photos. Here are a few more details on that study on the potential spread of the coronavirus in schools, which the WA government announced earlier in partnership with the Telethon Kids Institute. It will be conducted across 80 public schools, education support centres and residential colleges across WA, covering a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds. Participation in the study is voluntary, and requires the consent of both teachers and the parents of all children involved. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to give consent if your child attends one of the 80 schools, only if they specifically are part of the study. The first part of the study involves surveillance testing of a sample of staff and students across 40 schools over three months, potentially longer depending on the number of cases detected. Parents will be advised of the outcome of tests and the tests used will be different to those at a Covid clinic. It\u2019ll be a less invasive swab. That will start next week. Any positive tests will be subject to contact tracing, and any close contacts identified will \u201cundergo multiple tests for Covid-19 at intervals over two weeks, irrespective of whether they show symptoms\u201d, a WA government statement said. Close contacts will also be required to keep a diary during that period. This is intended to identify any onward transmission and \u201cprovide a greater understanding of the role schools play in the transmissibility of Covid-19 between students and staff, and the wider community via household members and other non-school contacts\u201d. The third part of the study is about the psychosocial impacts of the pandemic. Also below the line folks, we will be switching comments off soon as our hardworking moderator is about to clock off. While we\u2019re talking about sport, Mark McGowan was just asked about the prospect of AFL returning (they aren\u2019t interested in rugby league in Western Australia). He said players would be subject to a 14-day mandatory quarantine, just like everyone else entering the state. The difference in the NRL seems to be that they plan to keep players permanently quarantined, apart from games. That\u2019s why Queensland has granted them a free pass through the border. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, says she had a phone conference following national cabinet with the NRL chairman, Peter V\u2019Landys, and the CEOs of the Broncos, Cowboys and Titans, and told them they could resume training for the season reopener on 28 May. In a statement, Palaszczuk said: I said I was as keen as anyone else to see the NRL return and I meant it. The only condition was that it did not put our excellent work containing the spread of COVID-19 at risk and the Chief Health Officer advises that the NRL plan is workable. She also demanded assurances that the NRL will enforce home quarantine, after reports of some players breaking restrictions this week. The decision means players have permission to travel across the Queensland border to play, effectively making them essential workers. First round games will be played in Queensland and of course I put in a bid for a local grand final and we all look forward to hosting the State of Origin. South Australia has recorded no new cases of Covid-19 for the ninth day in a row. That\u2019s no new cases since 22 April. Cook is outlining a plan for a study, which will be done with the Telethon Kids Institute, to monitor and track any transmission of Covid-19 in schools. It will involve a random sample of staff and students who volunteer to be tested for Covid-19 over a period of three months. Any positive tests will be contact traced, and participants are required to keep a diary. The study will examine whether any of the transmission occurred at school. Cook says \u201call available evidence indicates that schools are safe and our commitment to this study should provide the community further assurance that we are taking all available steps\u201d to ensure that schools are safe, and that any undetected spread at school is discovered. And a clarification on that earlier figure re the number of tests. Cook says the WA figures related to the number of people tested (which to date is more than 41,000), not the number of tests done. That\u2019s why WA\u2019s test figures could appear low compared to other states, because some states report the number of tests done and there can be multiple tests done per person. The Western Australian health minister, Roger Cook, says WA has the highest rate of tests per community transmission of the virus. Which seems to be quite an esoteric way to measure it. Still, a high rate of testing. Cook makes the point that the overwhelming majority of WA\u2019s cases are imported. They\u2019ve had a few cruise ships land. McGowan says WA recorded no new Covid-19 cases overnight. There are now only 32 active cases in the state, 23 locals and 11 from elsewhere. Only three of those active cases are in regional areas, in the Goldfields. Eleven patients remain in hospital, with three in ICU. More than 41,000 tests have been conducted. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, is addressing the media in Perth. He starts by talking about a fatal police shooting that happened at the South Hedland shopping centre, which is about 1,500km north of Perth, a few hours ago. More on that here. McGowan says he would \u201clike to thank everyone who has dealt with that situation ... those police officers. I would like to thank them all.\u201d An Aboriginal woman, Joyce Clarke, died after being shot by police in Geraldton in September. A police officer has been charged with murder. Just after Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference ended, the government announced another tweak to its childcare package to ease concerns about some services facing funding shortfalls. Under the temporary \u201cfree childcare\u201d policy, parents are spared from paying any fees, but providers have been crunching the numbers and finding problems. While the general funding under the relief package was intended to work together with the jobkeeper wage subsidy of $1,500 per worker per fortnight, some services do not meet the test for the payment and those that do qualify cannot claim it for some casuals or work visa holders. The education minister, Dan Tehan, issued a statement this afternoon saying the government had expanded the eligibility for extra payments to childcare services that miss out on the jobkeeper wage subsidy. It says: Providers that are not eligible for the JobKeeper Payment, including non-government schools, large charities and not-for-profit organisations, will be eligible for a top-up payment. Tehan said the government would also help family day care and in-home care providers that were not eligible for jobkeeper and apply for an ABN by 1 June. You can read more about that here: Some more details on that one-off $205m payment to the aged care sector. It\u2019s intended to facilitate testing by ensuring centres have adequate staff. The payment is linked to the number of residents at a facility. Providers will receive about $900 per resident in major metropolitan areas and $1,350 per resident everywhere else. The aged care Code of Conduct on Pandemic Procedures sets out the requirements for aged care centres to facilitate family visits. It can be viewed here. (This is the link the PMO provided, even though it says \u2018draft\u2019.) It comes after the aged care sector received criticism for, in some cases, shutting down facilities and not allowing visitors even when no outbreak was present. When there is a Covid-19 outbreak, a lockdown is allowed but communication with family members and residents must be swift and extensive. The code says that visits to residents should be short unless the person being visited is dying, or the resident has an established pattern of receiving visits that help in their care or support. When it comes to residents who are dying or in their final weeks, the code says, homes should be flexible with regards to the number of visitors at any one time and the length and frequency of visits. Erring on the side of compassion is important, given the difficulty in predicting when a person is going to die. Where visitors have an established pattern of always coming at a set time to help their loved one, for example coming to help with meals, \u201cthe length, frequency, and nature of the visits should reflect what is needed for the person to be cared for appropriately and consistent with established practices and routines\u201d. While we are talking about sport, Scott Morrison, a keen Cronulla Sharks fan, refused to comment in that press conference on whether the NRL had been or would be given permission to resume its 2020 season. The league has set a return to play date of 28 May. More on that issue here: The national principles for the resumption of sport and recreation activities are 15 points long, so I won\u2019t go through all of them. Point 13 is that sport, if resumed, will be spectator-free for the foreseeable future. The principles say the resumption of sport will be based on \u201cobjective health information\u201d and that while the Australian Institute of Sport\u2019s Framework for Rebooting Sport in a Covid-19 Environment will provide a \u201cgeneral guide\u201d the final decisions will be made by state and territory governments. Other key points: Outdoor activities are considered lower risk. Community sporting activities involving 10 or fewer participants in a \u201cnon contact fashion\u201d will be able to resume first before sport involving larger groups and full-contact sports. Physical distancing will have to be maintained. That will also apply to children\u2019s sport. Golf, fishing, bushwalking, swimming etc will also be required to stick to physical distancing rules. \u201cSignificantly enhanced risk mitigation\u201d must be applied to all indoor activities associated with outdoor sorts. So no shaking hands in the change rooms. The AIS framework is the minimum baseline standard required to be met before the resumption of training or match play of professional sports. Sports seeking specific exemptions must seek approvals from the relevant state or territory governments, or local public health authorities. At all times, sporting organisations must respond to the directives of public health authorities, including if ordered \u201cquarantine of a whole team or large group, and close contacts, for the required period\u201d. \u201cFor the foreseeable future, elite sports, if recommenced, should do so in a spectator-free environment with the minimum support staff available to support the competition.\u201d The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, has announced a very slight easing of restrictions. The definition of household units will be expanded/clarified to include children. Household units will now be allowed to visit each other, so adult children can visit their parents. Barr described this measure as a \u201cdown payment\u201d on further changes to be announced next week, which he hints will include an easing of restrictions on the number of people allowed to congregate together outdoors. Barr also issued advice that non-essential retail is also allowed, like buying a winter coat before winter. Barr warned Australia has \u201cstill got a long way to go\u201d and it\u2019s \u201cmore a matter of when further outbreaks occur rather than if they do\u201d. \u201cThe one race I am happy we\u2019ve won [in the ACT] \u2026 is we have no active cases\u201d. So, what did we learn from that press conference? Well, not as much as we may have expected. We know that the national cabinet has brought forward its decision on whether to ease those baseline shutdown provisions to next Friday 8 May. Previously the deadline was 11 May. Downloading the CovidSafe app is not mandatory, but Morrison says the number of downloads will be one of the factors considered. He will not say how many people need to have downloaded it, but suggests there need to be many more downloads for national cabinet to be comfortable with its ability to improve contact tracing. So: app not mandatory but strongly encouraged, particularly if you want to go back to the pub or play sport. On sport, a set of principles has been agreed to on allowing the resumption of professional and community sport, but no decisions have actually been made. Those decisions will be made next week. The biggest aged care providers have also signed on to a new industry code of conduct on managing the coronavirus, and the federal government has agreed to give them a one-off payment of $205m. And the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said Australia will begin testing cohorts of asymptomatic people in an attempt to ensure early detection of any new outbreaks and avoid a second wave. That cluster testing will be focused on groups that have a high risk of exposure or work with vulnerable people, like aged care workers or healthcare workers. Teachers are among those who might get tested. Anyone with any respiratory symptoms at all \u2013 a cough, runny nose, anything \u2013 is now encouraged to get tested for Covid-19 and to avoid work. Murphy also comments: We weren\u2019t at the the time of the view that information was being withheld from us. Morrison says an independent investigation would look at what happened and why it happened. So we can learn if something similar could happen in any part of the world so the world will be able to respond quicker. Because clearly in these cases time is everything. Scott Morrison is asked to comment on Donald Trump\u2019s claim to have evidence to substantiate a theory that the coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Trump\u2019s comment was made despite US intelligence agencies concluding that the virus was \u201cnot manmade or genetically modified\u201d. Morrison says he has not seen any evidence to suggest that\u2019s the case, but says Australia is still pushing for an independent investigation into the origin of the disease. What we have before us doesn\u2019t suggest that that is the likely source. There\u2019s nothing that we have that would suggest that that is the likely source, but you can\u2019t rule anything out in this scenario. He says the virus did originate in Wuhan, but \u201cthe most likely scenario that has been canvassed related to wildlife wet markets\u201d. That is why Australia wants an \u201cobjective independent\u201d investigation, he says. While that can\u2019t be ruled out, it\u2019s not something we have seen any hard evidence of that that is the position. Guardian Australia\u2019s Daniel Hurst asks if the free childcare policy will be extended past the initial three months. Morrison says it\u2019s too early to say. A reporter asks if the easing of restrictions next week is contingent on more people downloading the CovidSafe app. Morrison says it is. He says if you want to go to the pub, you have to download the app. Now if that isn\u2019t an incentive for Australians to download CovidSafe on a Friday, I don\u2019t know what is ... that is a prerequisite to even getting to that conversation. There will not be any additional restrictions. We haven\u2019t been considering additional restrictions, we have been out of that mode for some weeks ... but the degree, honestly, to which we can consider easing the restrictions we have now, that depends on how many people have downloaded the CovidSafe app. It really does. Morrison says the principles agreed to for restarting sport and recreational activities are based heavily on the Australian Institute of Sport\u2019s plan. He says national cabinet has not made a decision on when and in what way sport can resume. That will be made next week. Among the principles are that outdoor activities are lower risk, and that there should be a staged resumption of sport. Possibly with smaller groups, less than 10 people in a non-contact sport, being allowed out first. Again, no decisions made yet: Decisions have not been taken to move on any of those matters but these principles set out the basis upon which we might be able to go forward when we set that out next week. Richard Colbeck is also the minister for sport. He says the return will be staged. We are currently in stage A \u2013 no sport. The next stage is stage B \u2013 outdoor, non-contact sports in groups of 10 or less. Then it\u2019s stage C \u2013 all sport. He makes another plug for the app If you want to get out to play, download the app today. Both Scott Morrison and Brendan Murphy are asked for their opinion on Victoria\u2019s deputy chief health officer, Dr Annaliese van Diemen, making a tweet. The state opposition has called for her to resign and reported her to Victoria\u2019s public health commission. Morrison made some remarks on that earlier, and said he won\u2019t comment further. Murphy defended van Diemen\u2019s ability to do her job. She\u2019s a fine young public health physician who has been working 80 hours a week for the past three weeks. She made a personal tweet on a personal twitter account ... I don\u2019t personally agree with her but that\u2019s a matter for her. A question on how people living in densely populated areas should deal with the easing of restrictions. Journalist: People are told \u201cdon\u2019t do a Bondi\u201d. What if people go down to the beach and see it\u2019s really busy. Do they go home? Morrison says people need to \u201cexercise commonsense\u201d. Physical distancing, the requirement to remain 1.5 metres apart, will not lift when the restrictions lift. Those things would always have to be practised. So long as the coronavirus is out there then that is your best defence against it. Morrison says people should be motivated by their own desire not to get sick. I think people will be able to exercise judgment in their own self-interest. People walking into a crowded room ... will be putting their health at risk. Murphy: Whilst we are living with this virus the way that we interact with each other will have to be different and will remain different. Murphy is asked if the cohort testing of asymptomatic people will include testing of schoolchildren. He says no, but it will include testing of teachers. He says there has been cohort testing of asymptomatic schoolchildren, when a school reports an outbreak. There really isn\u2019t a strong basis to test a cohort of children at this time. What about the NRL? Morrison says it\u2019s a matter for state jurisdictions to clear or not clear any particular sporting codes. But the health advice to the states will be consistent and provided by the AHPPC. So each state should be saying the same thing to each code. In relation to the New Zealand Warriors being given permission to travel, Morrison says \u201cno amount of reporting\u201d will change that outcome. It has been received and is being considered. Will employers be requiring people to download the app, or will the government require businesses to require employees to download the app, before restrictions are lifted? Morrison says it cannot be required under law \u201cbut we are encouraging it\u201d. It\u2019s done on the basis of encouragement in the national public health interest and I have to say in the national economic interest. It is our path back to download the CovidSafe app. Morrison is also asked about the strained relationship with China. It is a mutually beneficial partnership. It is not a one-way street ... we will continue to work within that arrangement and pursue that relationship. To questions. I think Morrison just suggested he will try out Barre class, which is a joke that has run the length of this lockdown period and proved that we truly are starved for information. The question was asking for an indication of the kind of restrictions that might be lifted. Morrison says he won\u2019t predict what national cabinet will decide. He says it will also be a matter of figuring out what mitigation measures can be introduced. Murphy is outlining the plan to ensure enough testing is done to detect any possible second wave of coronavirus. Australia will do cohort testing, identifying particular groups and testing asymptomatic people to ensure the virus isn\u2019t undetected. Those cohorts include aged care workers, healthcare workers and hospital patients. (If they consent, of course.) Says Murphy: We need to test more people. If we are going to get on top of those small outbreaks ... we cannot afford to have an outbreak that takes off so that we get a second wave when we reduce restrictions such as a number of other countries have seen. So our testing has to be very good. He says that the case data shows that most people who transmit the virus do still have symptoms, so anyone with any symptoms should get tested. The most important thing in testing is for anyone who has respiratory symptoms, a cough or a cold or a sore throat, to get tested ... get tested and don\u2019t go to work. Murphy says case numbers in Australia are now so low \u201cthat we can examine each case, each cluster, and get really detailed epidemiological information on what\u2019s happening\u201d. Murphy shows a slide using data given to the government from Apple and Google, showing how many people are on the roads. It has fallen substantially, showing people are obeying stay at home orders. A quip: Google does track people. The CovidSafe app does not. Murphy says Australia has beaten the modelling in terms of the number of new cases of Covid-19 reported. Pretty convincingly we have flattened the curve. There are now only two states on the graph showing the effective reproduction number. Last week the ACT and NT had dropped off the graph, because their case numbers were so low. The case numbers in every other jurisdiction are so small that the models feel that they can\u2019t effectively use the effective reproduction number ... only in NSW and Tasmania are there enough numbers to show an effective reproduction number. Brendan Murphy is going through the requirements that need to be in place before restrictions can be eased. Australia now has enough testing kits and a secure supply line. We have enough masks and a good supply line, and the supply line for other PPE is being restored. The public health workforce needed to be ready to respond to an outbreak. Murphy says Australia has excelled in that space. Every state and territory now expanded so much in the very active stage of the outbreak that they are now able to stand down some of the workforce but they are there and ready to be active if we need them again. Murphy says that the requirement for improved contact tracing was almost there, \u201caccept for the app uptake\u201d. We need the app uptake to be higher before we can say that that final piece in the jigsaw puzzle of contact tracing is there. Australia currently has 6,765 cases of Covid-19. The chief health officer, Brendan Murphy, says we are \u201cstill consistently getting less than 20 new cases per day over recent days\u201d. There have been 93 deaths. More than 570,000 tests have been done. Scott Morrison says Australia is expecting a 30% fall in overseas immigration in the 2019-20 year, on 2018-19 figures. In 2020-21, the forecast is for an 85% fall on 2018-19 figures. The aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, says all the major aged care providers, including Anglicare and BaptistCare, signed up to the new aged care code last night. It sets out rules and rights for people visiting their loved ones at the end of their life, and people who are used to receiving regular visitation as part of their care, such as dementia patients. Colbeck says \u201conly 23 residential aged care homes\u201d have had an outbreak of Covid-19 in Australia. (Weird use of \u201conly\u201d.) Fifteen of those residential aged care centres have now cleared the infection and in eight it is ongoing. Colbeck says most centres had only two or three residents with an infection. Among those who have now been declared Covid-free are Dorothy Henderson Lodge, the first aged care home to have an outbreak. At least six residents of that aged care facility died after testing positive to Covid-19. The aged care industry code has been agreed to by the major establishments in the aged care industry in Australia, and also interest groups in the sector. Morrison says the government is also making a one-off payment of $205m into the aged care sector to help it respond to the coronavirus and comply with the new industry code. National cabinet has agreed to a set of principles for sport and recreation, which will be released today, and also approved the aged care code. Morrison says there are now 3.5m downloads \u201cand there needs to be millions more\u201d. We need that tool so we can open the economy. So if you haven\u2019t downloaded the app yet, download it. The app is voluntary, and the government has said it will not make individual participation in activities contingent on having the app on your phone. But it appears that our collective ability to get on with our lives will be tied to the app. So it\u2019s over to you Australia. Morrison says national cabinet has brought forward its decision on whether the baseline restrictions should be lifted to next Friday 8 May. Australians deserve an early mark for the work that they have done. National cabinet will meet twice next week to work through the detail. Morrison says Australia has now met 11 of the 15 conditions set by the AHPPC for lifting restrictions. One of those conditions is downloading the CovidSAFE app. This is a critical decision for national cabinet when it comes to making decisions next Friday about how conditions can be eased. Morrison says that 1.5 million Australians are now on jobseeker and 900,000 claims have been processed in six weeks. This bears out the Treasury estimate that unemployment will rise to 10% and perhaps beyond. Scott Morrison says Australia has had \u201csome real success on the health front\u201d in dealing with Covid-19. There are about 1,000 active cases in Australia at the moment. But the coronavirus is \u201cnot the only curve we need to flatten\u201d. He says we need to restart the economy, and get businesses open. We need to restart our economy, we need to restart our society. We can\u2019t keep Australia under the doona. The prime minister has just started speaking in Canberra, joined by the ministers for aged care and sport. The national cabinet meeting was due to discuss a possible code of conduct for aged care homes responding to coronavirus, linked in part to the situation at Newmarch House in western Sydney. The meeting will also have considered advice from the AHPPC on reopening sport and recreation activities. Scott Morrison\u2019s office has just issued an alert saying he will address the media at 2pm following the national cabinet meeting today. We understand national cabinet has been discussing the possible easing of baseline restrictions, and the meeting ran longer than usual, so this could be quite an interesting update. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, is due to give an update at 2pm Perth time today, which is 4pm on the east coast. So, working backwards, we can expect an update from the prime minister on today\u2019s national cabinet meeting some time between now and 4pm. I\u2019m going to leave you for the day. Thanks for reading. Calla Wahlquist will take over from here. A teenage girl has been charged after allegedly spitting in a Sydney railway station staffer\u2019s face and saying \u201cI have Covid\u201d before the man and his co-worker were allegedly punched by her friend. The 17-year-old girl tried to enter the Blacktown station on 23 April while smoking a cigarette before a male staffer approached to say smoking wasn\u2019t allowed, NSW police said in a statement on Friday, according to AAP. She allegedly spat on the 56-year-old man\u2019s face and said: \u201cI have Covid.\u201d A 16-year-old teenage boy, who is known to the girl, then ran over and coughed and spat in the staff member\u2019s face, police said. A 53-year-old female Sydney Trains employee intervened and was allegedly punched in the head. The two teenagers then fled the scene, police said. They were arrested at a home in Pendle Hill on Thursday and the girl was charged with smoking in a public area and not complying with a Covid-19 direction on spitting and coughing. The boy was charged with two counts of common assault and not complying with the Covid-19 direction on spitting and coughing. They were both granted bail to appear at a children\u2019s court on 14 July. Universities Australia chief executive Catriona Jackson has issued a statement while national cabinet is on. She said: Over the past two weeks state and territory governments have increasingly recognised and understood the difficulties international students are facing due to impacts from the Covid-19 global pandemic. Through no fault of their own, many of the more than 310,000 higher education students living and studying in Australia have lost their part-time jobs. They are not eligible for the same support local students can get through jobkeeper and jobseeker. To date, the Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australian, Tasmanian, Victoria and Western Australian governments have announced assistance packages for international students. Some support has also been offered at the Federal level. Jackson said a \u201cnationally consistent approach to this challenge is vital\u201d. Universities Australia is ready to work with all governments on developing sustainable, ongoing assistance that international students will require beyond the short-term. Ratings agency S&amp;P has downgraded stricken airline Virgin to D, the lowest grade possible, after the company\u2019s administrators got payments on its planes frozen for a month and applied for protection from its US creditors. As Guardian Australia reported, the administrators \u2013 partners at Deloitte \u2013 have asked a court in the US to protect them from claims there by American creditors owed billions of dollars and prevent four planes that are being repaired in Nashville from being seized. D \u2013 for default \u2013 is the lowest credit rating S&amp;P can hand out. The agency said in a note: We expect that unsecured lenders will be forced to accept less value for amounts owing under the terms of the existing unsecured debt facilities as part of the anticipated debt restructuring and recapitalisation process. As Guardian Australia has reported, unsecured lenders who took a punt on Virgin in return for high interest rates are likely to take a hefty haircut. Estimates of what they\u2019ll get vary from a pessimistic 7c in the dollar to a rather optimistic 65c. Well done, Canberra. Taiwan has been widely praised for its response to Covid-19 but is locked out of World Health Organisation discussions about the pandemic. Australia\u2019s decision to support the island being granted observer status comes amid an already strained relationship with China over the Morrison government\u2019s call for an inquiry into the cause of the virus. The government is yet to announce the Warriors have been granted an exemption, although clearly someone is briefing that it is going to happen. No doubt it will raise eyebrows among others who have been denied entry. From AAP: The Warriors have agreed to travel to Australia for the resumption of NRL training next week after seeking clarity from rugby league\u2019s bosses. Peter V\u2019landys spoke with Warriors officials on Friday morning, with the team expected to be headed to Tamworth once they gain approval from Australian border authorities. \u201cThe Warriors just wanted clarity on a few things and now they have got that they are fully supportive,\u201d V\u2019landys told AAP. We are awaiting a press conference after today\u2019s national cabinet meeting, which is happening right now. It is expected there will be news on a roadmap to resume professional and local sport, as well as changes to aged care visiting rules. I might kick off by pointing you to this interesting piece by ANU anthropologist Michael Rose. Rose says that if there is a Australia-NZ travel bubble during the pandemic, as been floated, then it should include our Pacific neighbours, too. Hi everyone, Luke Henriques-Gomes here, taking over my Naaman Zhou. Thanks to Naaman for his efforts this morning. Scott Morrison has described some of mining billionaire Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest\u2019s comments as \u201cnonsense\u201d on 2GB radio today. The mining magnate had said, on a podcast by the West Australian newspaper a month ago, that the virus could have originated in a country other than China. \u201cIt just might be Australia, it just might be Britain, it just might be China,\u201d he said on 2 April. Today, Morrison was asked about these comments on radio after Forrest brought China\u2019s Victorian consul general to a government press conference yesterday. The prime minister said: That\u2019s obviously nonsense. I don\u2019t think anybody is in any fantasyland about where it started \u2013 it started in China. It started in China. That is not a statement of accusation or criticism, it\u2019s just a statement of fact. Yesterday, Forrest invited consul general Long Zhou to a presser with the health minister, Greg Hunt, without Hunt\u2019s knowledge. The mining magnate then told commentators to \u201ctake a chill pill\u201d over the uproar. He described it as \u201cthe biggest non-story ever\u201d. I\u2019m the most Australian person I know. Take a chill pill. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has released new data on the impact of Covid-19 on household finances, finding that nearly half (45%) of Australians aged over 18 years have been impacted. The results are: A third of Australians (31%) reported that their household finances had worsened over this period, while one in seven (14%) reported an improvement. The majority of Australians (81%) said their household could raise $2,000 for something important within a week, lower than the 84% reported in 2014. One in 13 Australians (7.5%) said their household lacked the money to pay one or more bills on time, and one in 10 (10%) had to draw on accumulated savings to support basic living expenses. It seems the Covid-19 economic supports might be part of the reason people are mostly still able to pay their bills: A quarter of Australians aged 18 years and over (28%) said they received the first one-off $750 economic support payment, announced by the commonwealth government in March. Those aged 65 years and over were more likely than those aged 18 to 64 to have received the first one-off $750 economic support payment (60% compared with 19%). The Queensland Coalition MP Andrew Laming has asked people to \u201ccall the police\u201d on teachers if they do not let their children attend school. Laming, the federal MP for Bowman in Brisbane, posted the message in a video on Facebook yesterday. He said vulnerable students from poorer families were falling behind, AAP reports. Please, pick up your enrolment forms, hold them above your head, march into school, drop your kids off, and if they try and prevent those kids from going to school, call the police. This is witchcraft. We are back in the Middle Ages with these unions. In Queensland, schools are currently open but only for the children of essential workers and vulnerable families. The government will re-evaluate that on 15 May. Queensland\u2019s state education minister, Grace Grace, said Laming\u2019s statements were \u201ca little bit idiotic\u201d. She told AAP: This is from someone who I\u2019m starting to think is acting a little bit idiotic and it is quite ridiculous. Every single school in Australia and around the world is impacted by this pandemic. So these outrageous claims, calling unnecessary anxiety and causing stress amongst our principals and teachers, are simply ridiculous. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has said that the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, should concentrate on his job and \u201cwhat went wrong with the Ruby Princess\u201d before he criticises Victoria\u2019s deputy chief medical officer. Dutton \u2013 and many state and federal Liberal MPs \u2013 called for the deputy CMO\u2019s resignation today, after she made a tweet comparing Covid-19 to the arrival of James Cook. But Albanese told reporters \u201cI\u2019m not getting into that\u201d. People engaged in the health sector have a job to do at the moment protecting us on health issues. Peter Dutton has a job to do as well. He\u2019s in charge of our borders and maybe he should concentrate on what went wrong with Ruby Princess before he goes outside those parameters. This does not mean the Labor preselection to replace retiring MP Mike Kelly has been completed, but Albanese says he \u201cwould expect that Kristy will receive strong support\u201d. We will have a candidate by Monday afternoon. Nominations close at 12 o\u2019clock on Monday, people are entitled to put their names forward. But I think that it\u2019s very clear to me the best candidate is Kristy McBain. Albanese said earlier: \u201cShe is a strong and articulate person. She is someone who has been on the ground when the people of Eden-Monaro have needed people to be present.\u201d Labor leader Anthony Albanese has just announced his preferred candidate for the Eden-Monaro byelection. Kristy McBain, the mayor of Bega Valley Shire, is his pick, and both are giving a presser right now. McBain says: I did not set out seeking this position but I want to take it on. I wanted to take it on for a couple of reasons. I am local, I am from the community and I have worked for the community for a number of years now. I don\u2019t want my community to be left behind and at the moment, my community is being left behind. They are being forgotten My community has had three bushfires in two years. The whole of Eden-Monaro is drought-declared, or should be drought-declared, but it\u2019s not. We are now in Covid-19, and with these three disasters happening concurrently, we do not and are not receiving the support that we need. Channel Nine reports that the New Zealand Warriors have been given special permission to enter the country for the resumption of the NRL season. The national cabinet has allowed Tamworth Airport to receive one flight \u2013 on Sunday at 4pm \u2013 carrying the Kiwi team. The team will have to quarantine for 14 days before they can play. The NRL is scheduled to start on 28 May. Some international freight flights will resume out of South Australia, AAP reports. Services out of Adelaide airport are set to resume, with Singapore Airlines planning to use passenger aircraft to carry 40 tonnes of cargo on 6 May and 13 May. The state\u2019s trade minister, David Ridgway, said it would be a big relief for South Australian exporters. In many cases, exporters have had to ship their produce by road to the eastern states to fly out from there, at a considerable cost, and that\u2019s if they were able to even access those outbound flights. And another exclusive \u2013 this time from Chris Knaus and Ben Smee. The Australian government entered a contract to buy 500,000 Covid-19 test kits from a company headed by a convicted rapist which had no experience in medical diagnostics, failed to deliver shipments at a critical point in the pandemic and is now under investigation by the medical regulator. The company, Promedical, told the Australian government it could supply huge quantities of test kits, but they have not yet arrived and Promedical have not been paid. Promedical\u2019s chief executive, Neran De Silva, was convicted of rape in 2018 and was a one-time business associate of the government services minister, Stuart Robert, through a cryotherapy treatment business. Before Guardian Australia\u2019s revelations, Promedical was given positive media coverage by the Today Show, the Daily Telegraph, the Daily Mail and Sky News and described as \u201crevolutionary\u201d and \u201camazing\u201d. My colleague Melissa Davey has the exclusive story that negotiations are underway to supply five Australian hospitals with the experimental coronavirus drug remdesivir: The US pharmaceutical company Gilead is finalising the location of five hospitals in Australia to receive the highly sought-after experimental Covid-19 drug remdesivir. The only confirmed location is St Vincent\u2019s hospital in Sydney ... A NSW Health spokeswoman confirmed the health department \u201chas been engaging with Gilead on gaining access to the drug for Covid-19 patients\u201d. The news comes as the doctor informing the Covid-19 response in the White House, the immunologist Dr Anthony Fauci, promoted preliminary findings from a joint Gilead and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study that suggested remdesivir could improve recovery time of patients. His comments have revived global hope in the drug, with no treatments now available for the virus. But experts have warned that the study findings are unpublished and preliminary. Read the full story: National cabinet will meet today and is expected to discuss bringing back sport (both elite and local) as well as easing additional restrictions to aged care homes. Many care facilities have instituted enhanced rules, beyond what is legally required. AAP reports that \u201cthe principles for sport and recreation are set to be a headline issue\u201d at today\u2019s meeting. National cabinet will consider advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee about elite and community activities. Expanded testing is considered a key goal to trigger lifting restrictions at a national level. Leaders will also be given an update on mental health measures with a plan under consideration to better coordinate services. National cabinet will discuss an industry code for aged care, as governments move to ensure people are not isolated beyond the rules. Peter Gutwein adds that he is \u201clooking at\u201d easing restrictions across the entire state: I think it\u2019s fair to say that we are starting to get on top of this and I think that over time, we will gradually be able to look at restrictions being lifted. But we will need to step into that carefully and cautiously, always with an eye to the fact that we have an older and more vulnerable population. Tasmania\u2019s premier, Peter Gutwein, has just announced that the additional restrictions imposed on the state\u2019s north-west will be lifted by Monday. Additional restrictions had been placed on the region due to a coronavirus cluster among health workers, which was traced to the Ruby Princess cruise ship. Up to 5,000 people who were healthcare workers and their families were placed under quarantine, and non-essential businesses and shops were banned. But on Friday Gutwein said these severe restrictions will be lifted, though the entire state would continue to have its existing restrictions. \u201cWe are confident that those additional restrictions, placed on the north-west on Sunday almost three weeks ago, the 12 April, will be able to lift,\u201d he said. \u201cMeaning on Monday the fourth of May, the businesses and services which were impacted by those additional restrictions can reopen, and the workers and staff will be able to return to work. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note this will only be the lifting of the additional restrictions. The statewide restrictions in place in terms of personal movement, the operation of certain businesses, will still apply.\u201d The north-west outbreak has been linked to 11 deaths so far. There are now less than 80 active cases in Queensland, with 11 people in hospital and four people in intensive care. There are still 2,700 Queenslanders in quarantine. It has now been 93 days since the state\u2019s first case. Asked when Queensland could be declared \u201cCovid-free\u201d, Jeannette Young said it would take weeks. \u201cFor Queensland to be Covid-free, we would have to have no active cases and we probably have to wait for two incubation periods to be sure.\u201d Queensland\u2019s health minister, Stephen Miles, has announced there have been no new coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours as the state gears up to ease restrictions at the weekend. That means there have only been eight cases in the state this week. But Miles warned Queenslanders to still keep a 1.5-metre distance from other people, and not to become complacent. \u201cOur message today is, this weekend, as we ease those restrictions, let\u2019s not mess it up,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s keep it up. Let\u2019s keep getting the zero results.\u201d The state\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, said Queensland could then see more restrictions lifted in future. But that will depend on the weekend. \u201cWe\u2019ll immediately get feedback about what people have done,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we see large gatherings in places, that would concern us greatly and we\u2019ll have to rethink.\u201d But she says there was no reason for transmission to increase under the new rules, because people were supposed to only be primarily with their household. In the past 24 hours, Victoria police have issued 74 fines and conducted 651 spot checks. They fined four people drinking alcohol in a shopping centre carpark and 10 people who gathered at a private residence for a birthday party. Police have now conducted a total of 33,556 spot checks since 21 March. Here is the precise wording of the amendment to the NSW public health order that has allowed today\u2019s relaxation of restrictions. A spokesperson from Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s office told Guardian Australia that visiting friends would be considered beneficial for mental health and would, therefore, constitute \u201ccare\u201d. Previously, the deputy premier, John Barilaro, also said you can \u201ccan visit family &amp; friends for any reason\u201d. But, as always with enforcement, this can depend on the discretion of police, their interpretation of the law and what you precisely are doing. Daniel Andrews is speaking now. The Victorian premier says the state will consider \u201coptions we will have to potentially ease [restrictions]\u201d in the lead-up to 11 May. But he asks people to continue staying at home for now, even as other states ease restrictions, because Victoria has had a higher rate of community transmission than other states: We have come too far, we have achieved too much for us to give that back, for us to fritter that hard work away. I know it is easy to think that well, with such low case numbers maybe the worst has passed, maybe this is over, I just want to remind every Victorian this is very, very fragile, we saw a spike in numbers just a couple of days ago, we have had outbreaks in lots of different settings. We have also had significant community transmission in Victoria as well. About 10% of our cases we can\u2019t track them back to an overseas traveller. Not every state is like that. Some states have no community transmission at all. He also calls on Victorians to get tested for \u201cmildest symptoms\u201d and says the state has ramped up testing: The more tests we can get done in the lead-up to 11 May, the more options we will have to potentially ease some of the rules that I know are frustrating. NSW has recorded nine new coronavirus cases overnight. Gladys Berejiklian said this morning that the state had conducted more than 7,000 tests in the past 24 hours, with nine positive results. And the premier urged people with symptoms to get tested today, before the weekend\u2019s expected flurry of activity once restrictions ease in the state. \u201cPlease come forward even if you have the mildest symptoms,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to wait until Monday. You could be unintentionally passing on the disease without knowing you have it.\u201d NSW\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said three of the nine new cases were residents at Anglicare\u2019s Newmarch House aged care home, four were community transmission cases and one was under investigation. She also confirmed that the resident who died at Newmarch House yesterday was a 74-year-old man. The Australian stock market is set to open lower today after what has been a record month of growth. After the sharp falls at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the past month was the best April for the stock market since 1988. But after a 2.4% rise yesterday it is expected to fall today, according to AAP. The SPI 200 futures contract was down 123 points, or 2.22%, to 5,417.0 points at 8am. In the US, unemployment claims topped 30m and Amazon and American Airlines\u2019 earnings disappointed traders. In Australia, property price data for April is due to be published today. In some brief US news, President Donald Trump has just claimed, about 30 minutes ago, that he has seen evidence that Covid-19 was created in a lab. When asked if he had seen evidence that gives him a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d that it originated in a lab in Wuhan, he said: \u201cYes, I have\u201d. This is a direct contradiction of America\u2019s own national intelligence community, and scientists. The director of national intelligence said: \u201cThe intelligence community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.\u201d Australia\u2019s intelligence community has said similar. In today\u2019s briefing, Trump appeared to discredit his own director of national intelligence when asked about it. A bit more detail on those relaxed restrictions coming in today and tomorrow. In Queensland, from Saturday: You will be allowed to go for picnics and non-essential drives, and national parks will reopen, but you are not allowed to travel more than 50km from your home. You can shop for non-essential items. The \u201ctwo-person person rule\u201d is still in effect, meaning that you can only be joined by one other person who isn\u2019t in your household \u2013 and still keep physically distant. Previously, Annastacia Palaszczuk said people inside a home were allowed two additional guests. The Queensland border remains closed unless you are a resident or essential worker. In NSW, from today: Two adults and the children in their care are allowed to visit another person\u2019s home, for any reason. You still have to comply with physical distancing \u2013 which means keeping apart, avoiding unnecessary contact and not crowding small spaces. There are no limits on how many guests someone is allowed a day as long as there are no more than two adults at a time. In WA, since Monday: Gathering limits increased from two people to 10. People are allowed to leave home for recreational activities including picnics, fishing, boating and camping. Maximum number of people at a wedding raised from five to 10. Border restrictions remain in place. Five Australian defence force personnel have tested positive for Covid-19 after contracting it in the Middle East. The five people are asymptomatic and arrived back in Australia this morning, AAP reports. They were were tested after a number of local contractors became infected with the virus. Four returned to Australia on Friday morning on a routine defence force flight and were taken to Royal Darwin hospital for assessment. The fifth, who had completed deployment, previously returned to Australia and is in mandatory isolation in Brisbane. The Australian defence force says it decided to test personnel \u201cafter being notified that a number of locally engaged contractors had tested positive\u201d. \u201cDefence will take all necessary measures in consultation with our coalition partners, relevant host nations and Australian federal, state and territory governments to ensure ADF personnel receive the treatment and care required,\u201d it said on Friday. Another resident of Anglicare\u2019s Newmarch House in western Sydney has died. Anglicare said the resident died yesterday afternoon, bringing the total number of Covid-19 deaths at the aged care home to 13. Yesterday the operator announced that three more residents had tested positive. There are now at least 37 who have contracted the virus, and 22 staff members. \u201cThis is a time of great grief for the family and we want to extend our deepest sympathies,\u201d Anglicare said this morning. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in Australia this Friday. Restrictions in NSW ease today \u2013 with two adults (and any dependent children) now allowed to visit another person\u2019s house for any reason. Restrictions will also ease in Queensland from Saturday, though travel will be restricted to within 50km. A flight from India will also arrive in WA today, bringing more than 100 Australians back. Overnight, around the world: Russia\u2019s prime minister has been diagnosed with coronavirus. Mikhail Mishustin was supposed to be leading the country\u2019s response to the pandemic but has said he will now self-isolate. Germany will ease restrictions, opening museums, galleries, zoos and playgrounds and allow religious services to resume. Brazil announced a record number of new cases in 24 hours (7,218). The death toll rose by 435 to 5,901.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>Anxiety is still the first feeling of which I am aware every morning. First as a sense of unease as I regain consciousness and then physical and mental distress as I reconnect with the reality of the new normal. It can still take me a couple of hours of hiding under the duvet before I feel brave enough to get up and have breakfast. Some things have changed, though. Thankfully my dreams are no longer quite so terrifying. Rather, they have switched into something more distant and desolate where I am disconnected from the present. One night I dreamed first I was with my son, who was learning to fly in the Lofoten Islands \u2013 somewhere I\u2019ve never been (nor have I watched the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/04/tv-tonight-nordic-mistaken-identity-thriller-twin-begins\">TV series </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/04/tv-tonight-nordic-mistaken-identity-thriller-twin-begins\">Twin</a>) and would not be unable to place on a map of Norway \u2013 and then that I was in a spaceship with Buzz Aldrin as we were flying to the edge of the solar system. Buzz didn\u2019t seem that pleased to have me for company. What\u2019s also changed is that during the day some of the anxiety now dissipates into sadness and depression. Sadness both at the scale of the crisis \u2013 we are now well past the chief scientific adviser\u2019s \u201cbest result\u201d death toll of 20,000, with no end in sight \u2013 and at my own personal losses. In particular the separation from my family, friends and colleagues. In the early days of the lockdown I was somehow able to kid myself that maybe the quarantine wouldn\u2019t last that long. But now it\u2019s sunk in that the government is making things up as it goes along, life may not return to normal for many months and that all plans will have to be put on hold. I remember my mother telling me how she and some friends danced down Piccadilly during an air raid in the second world war (I\u2019m assuming they were a bit pissed) before a warden angrily shepherded them into a shelter. I can\u2019t quite work out whether I need a bit more or a bit less of that sort of spirit.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>While almost every other sporting body has either cancelled or rearranged fixtures for the months ahead, the Premier League still appears to be under the delusion that it can not only somehow reschedule the remaining games of the current season but also start the next season more or less on time. I know the clubs don\u2019t want to sacrifice any TV money or refund season ticket holders, but I can\u2019t help wondering what part of the government\u2019s coronavirus advice they have somehow missed. Clearly, as a Spurs fan, I would be more than happy for the current season to be declared null and void and for Champions League places to be decided on where clubs finished in May 2019, but I can see that might not be a universally popular choice. But someone has got to make a decision quickly, even if it means pissing some people off, as the situation is getting ridiculous. Still, at least there is someone I know who is still making money out of football. Louis, the son of my friend Kevin, is 42% up on his portfolio investment in the FOOTIE, football\u2019s equivalent of the FTSE, where you buy and sell shares in footballers. Often ones you\u2019ve never seen or heard of apart from a three-minute YouTube compilation. Louis\u2019 best investment is a \u00a310 stake in an Italian teenager, of whom I\u2019d never heard, called Sandro Tonali \u2013 bought because he had a passing resemblance to Andrea Pirlo \u2013 now showing a profit of 220%. Despite a lengthy tutorial from Louis, I\u2019m still not entirely sure how the FOOTIE really works \u2013 apparently Paul Pogba\u2019s current value of \u00a38 per share has fluctuated wildly in the past few months despite him not having played a single minute of football \u2013 but apparently it has become the go-to site for all fans with a few quid to risk who are overwhelmed by the mass monotony.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Some of my more intrepid colleagues have made a point of still going into Westminster so that they can observe 90% of MPs dialling in their contributions by Zoom on eight screens in the chamber. It won\u2019t surprise you that I have taken a rather more timid approach, preferring not to take my chances on public transport and following proceedings via Parliament TV instead. I already feel I have used up most of my nine lives. The distance has done nothing to convince me that the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus has often felt as if it has been getting worse rather than better. First we had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/a-deflated-johnson-struggles-to-muster-his-usual-ebullience\">Boris Johnson on his return to Downing Street</a> declaring that other countries were looking at our apparent success. I wonder what an apparent failure would look like. Then we have had three contradictory briefings on Dominic Cummings\u2019s contributions to the government\u2019s scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage). First was that he had definitely never attended a Sage meeting. Next that he had been present but not involved. And finally, that rather than being a supporter of herd immunity as it had originally been reported, he single-handedly saved the UK by making the scientists introduce an immediate lockdown. We\u2019ve also had Michael Gove talk up his HMRC academy for training 50,000 new customs officers (current applications = zero) to cope with new post-Brexit customs regulations, while Dominic Raab insisted the coronavirus was a magnificent opportunity for the UK to strike an advantageous Brexit deal with the EU by 31 December and that we shouldn\u2019t believe everything Michel Barnier or the IMF say about the economy shrinking by 35%. But pride of place definitely has to go to Priti Patel, whose performance before the home affairs select committee was every bit the car crash that was anticipated. At one point, the home secretary told the committee that the reason the UK didn\u2019t follow other government\u2019s guidelines for self-isolation at airports was that we had both more and fewer international passengers arriving. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s airport. The public inquiry that will follow all this should make for compelling reading.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91a830b5a9de6d33aee3c00d5d900687b1f8f70e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91a830b5a9de6d33aee3c00d5d900687b1f8f70e/0_32_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The bleach sure as hell works on my hair\u2019 ...

The coronavirus has therapists, funeral directors and makers of sports equipment. With the change in temperature, I have finally had to admit I am basically a fair-weather cyclist. Pedalling my way up and down the same hill on a bike that is far too small for me for an hour in the wind and the rain really doesn\u2019t appeal, and with it looking less and less likely that gyms will be reopening, something had to give. So I have found an online distributor that can deliver by 1 June \u2013 most manufacturers can now only promise July delivery, such is the demand \u2013 and I have ordered an exercise bike for \u00a3229, which means I will only have to endure another month on my wife\u2019s bike outdoors. For someone who prefers their exercise to be dull, repetitive and painful, this is the ideal solution. Not least because it offers up the possibility of my own 24-hour-gym at home. If I can\u2019t sleep because I\u2019m feeling anxious, I will shortly be able to get up at 2am and cycle precisely nowhere to relieve the cortisol levels. What could be better? I\u2019ve also ordered myself some resistance bands, which my friend Alex insists are nearly as effective as weights. If all goes to plan, I will be all sorted in case gyms are closed for a year. Though as soon as Virgin Active in Streatham does reopen, I will be one of the first back in to nab my favourite cross-trainer. I\u2019ve always been a creature of habit and I\u2019ve been going to the same gym for well over 20 years now, so why would I stop? <em>Mens (in)sana, in corpore sano</em>.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>Before my wife took up pottery seriously about eight years ago, I had only a passing interest in ceramics. It was an art form I didn\u2019t really get. But having watched Jill develop her work \u2013 and having lived through her many failures as well as the successes \u2013 pottery has become yet another serious passion of mine. To go alongside football, opera and Panini stickers. One of the things I most love about ceramics is the potters themselves. When you buy a piece directly from an artist, they are always keen to explain exactly how the work was made. What clays and glazes were used, whether it was thrown, handbuilt or both, and how many times and at what temperature the pot was fired. It\u2019s as if ceramics is a form of artistic alchemy and even the creators aren\u2019t entirely sure of how their work will actually look when it emerges from the kiln \u2013 and want to share the process with you. This week one potter called John, some of whose works we already have in our collection, took this to the extreme by not just sending me a pot he had made but including a letter, with accompanying photographs, of exactly how it was made. He had started by going to an old gravel pit in the Netherlands, where he had dug down to the 2.5m-year-old clay underneath, which he had taken back to the studio to be churned in a baker\u2019s dough mixer before throwing it on the wheel. There was plenty more technical detail, but what I loved most was his end note. \u201cThen of course there is my input into the making, the joy of throwing and all that happens along the way, be it philosophical, spontaneous, accidental, expressive, all of which play a part but may have different emphasis on the day of making.\u201d I wrote some weeks ago that I have taken to talking to my pots. Some of my friends thought I was losing it a bit. But now, I feel vindicated. Because if you know a pot well enough, every time you look at it, it will talk right back to you.</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested</strong>: Mainlining Dettol.\ufeff</p>",

And Trump\u2019s judges on the eleventh circuit have shown what critics see as a hostility to a central issue for the state of Florida and the country: voting rights.</p> <p>The legal team representing voters in the Florida felony disenfranchisement case claims in part that the state law was passed with racial and discriminatory intent in violation of the constitution.</p> <p>\u201cThis issue of felony disenfranchisement is a really important issue in the United States,\u201d said Sean Morales-Doyle, a Brennan Center lawyer who is litigating the case.</p> <p>\u201cFlorida\u2019s voters came forward and really made clear that they rejected this, that this wasn\u2019t a policy that voters on any part of the political spectrum believe in. And then we promptly saw the Florida legislature attempt to undo that.\u201d</p> <h2>Ninth circuit</h2> <p><strong>California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, Montana, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona</strong></p> <p><strong>Key issue: Immigration</strong></p> <p>Since Trump became president, the US court of appeals for the ninth circuit has gone from an 18-7 majority of active judges appointed by Democrats, with four vacancies, to a much narrower 16-13 majority of judges appointed by Democrats. But the court\u2019s senior judges, who carry about half the caseload of active judges, also issue rulings \u2013 and at the senior level, Republican appointees now outnumber Democratic appointees 10-3.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s already flipped in some ways,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a professor at Richmond School of Law specializing in federal judicial selection, of the ninth circuit.</p> <p>Whatever the balance on the bench, activists express concern about decisions coming down from the court, historically one of the most progressive in the country. </p> <p>Trump judges on the ninth circuit have been especially abrasive in immigration cases, denying spousal visas in violation of long precedent and dismissing asylum claims, including in a case where the plaintiff had evidence of murders of multiple family members in his home country.</p> <p>In one dissent, a Trump-appointed judge supported a Trump proclamation banning entry to any would-be immigrant who could not prove either possession of health insurance or an ability to pay for healthcare.</p> <p>The judge ruled that the government would \u201csuffer immediate, irreparable harm\u201d unless the health insurance screen was allowed to stand, <a href=\"https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/19-36020/19-36020-2019-12-20.pdf?ts=1576882834\">quoting</a> Trump on the \u201cfinancial and public health burdens that the uninsured can impose\u201d.</p> <p>Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/01/28/judicial-appointments-in-trumps-first-three-years-myths-and-realities/\">analyzes</a> the shifting makeup of federal courts under Trump, said the ninth circuit had undergone \u201ca big change\u201d and noted that the outsized caseload of the circuit, the biggest in the country covering 60 million people, often required visiting judges to fill in.</p> <h2>Fifth circuit</h2> <p><strong>Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi</strong></p> <p><strong>Key issue: healthcare</strong></p> <p>Since Trump became president, the US court of appeals for the fifth circuit has gone from a 9-5 majority of active judges appointed by Republicans, with three vacancies, to an 11-5 majority of judges appointed by Republicans, with one vacancy.</p> <p>Trump judges on the circuit have boosted key administration projects, especially on immigration, greenlighting $3.6bn in spending on the border wall and taking a chilly view of asylum claims.

In a case with ominous resonance under the coronavirus pandemic, the court has defended objections on religious grounds to immunizations.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth pointing out that four of the courts, the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth, had Republican-appointed majorities when Trump took office,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cSo he has perhaps strengthened the Republican-appointee majority on those courts by putting younger and perhaps ideologically more committed judges in the place of older Republicans.\u201d</p>",

It is in these appeals courts where judges serving lifetime appointments have extraordinary power over issues as public as the climate crisis and as private as the right to choose. That longer-term trend has converged with a much more recent development: Donald Trump\u2019s appointment of a record number of appeals court judges installed with unprecedented speed, as part of a grand project coordinated with conservative legal activists to remake the federal bench for generations to come.

Over time, however, the composite ideological orientation of a court comes through. And Trump\u2019s judges on the eleventh circuit have shown what critics see as a hostility to a central issue for the state of Florida and the country: voting rights. The legal team representing voters in the Florida felony disenfranchisement case claims in part that the state law was passed with racial and discriminatory intent in violation of the constitution. \u201cThis issue of felony disenfranchisement is a really important issue in the United States,\u201d said Sean Morales-Doyle, a Brennan Center lawyer who is litigating the case. \u201cFlorida\u2019s voters came forward and really made clear that they rejected this, that this wasn\u2019t a policy that voters on any part of the political spectrum believe in.

Whatever the balance on the bench, activists express concern about decisions coming down from the court, historically one of the most progressive in the country. Trump judges on the ninth circuit have been especially abrasive in immigration cases, denying spousal visas in violation of long precedent and dismissing asylum claims, including in a case where the plaintiff had evidence of murders of multiple family members in his home country. In one dissent, a Trump-appointed judge supported a Trump proclamation banning entry to any would-be immigrant who could not prove either possession of health insurance or an ability to pay for healthcare. The judge ruled that the government would \u201csuffer immediate, irreparable harm\u201d unless the health insurance screen was allowed to stand, quoting Trump on the \u201cfinancial and public health burdens that the uninsured can impose\u201d. Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who analyzes the shifting makeup of federal courts under Trump, said the ninth circuit had undergone \u201ca big change\u201d and noted that the outsized caseload of the circuit, the biggest in the country covering 60 million people, often required visiting judges to fill in. Fifth circuit Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi Key issue: healthcare Since Trump became president, the US court of appeals for the fifth circuit has gone from a 9-5 majority of active judges appointed by Republicans, with three vacancies, to an 11-5 majority of judges appointed by Republicans, with one vacancy. Trump judges on the circuit have boosted key administration projects, especially on immigration, greenlighting $3.6bn in spending on the border wall and taking a chilly view of asylum claims.

In a case with ominous resonance under the coronavirus pandemic, the court has defended objections on religious grounds to immunizations. \u201cIt\u2019s worth pointing out that four of the courts, the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth, had Republican-appointed majorities when Trump took office,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cSo he has perhaps strengthened the Republican-appointee majority on those courts by putting younger and perhaps ideologically more committed judges in the place of older Republicans.\u201d",

Italian industry groups are reported <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/as-virus-lockdown-eases-italy-ponders-what-went-wrong/2020/04/26/a1377c24-878b-11ea-81a3-9690c9881111_story.html\">to have strongly resisted</a> the idea of shutting down Lombardy, one of the engines of the country\u2019s economy. Developing countries such as Pakistan have had to balance slowing the spread of the disease with the disastrous consequences of closing the farms and construction sites where the poorest work.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really easy for me to say, hey, we should institute social distancing measures and close schools and cut the link between those susceptible to the disease and the infectious,\u201d says Katz. \u201cKnowing what the larger societal impact is makes it harder to pull the trigger.\u201d</p> \n<p>There were blind spots in the way countries prepared. A global index <a href=\"https://www.ghsindex.org/\">released in October</a> concluded the US was more ready than anywhere else to fight a pandemic. But the scorecard, based on WHO methodology, focused more on technical capacity than government processes, says Alexandra Phelan, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center.</p> \n<p> Official figures show the US has had the largest and most deadly outbreak, exacerbated by a slow initial response, mismanagement of testing and poor coordination <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/11/trump-states-governors-clashes\">between states and the federal government</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs this outbreak has demonstrated, you can have the best labs in the world, the best notification systems and software, but if you don\u2019t have the appropriate governance of when to use these powers \u2026 they don\u2019t function,\u201d Phelan says.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<h2><strong>Civil liberties face their greatest test in a generation</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee0b6a0dfc7d235bd7be8100b37f5625f14022f1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee0b6a0dfc7d235bd7be8100b37f5625f14022f1/0_0_5328_3176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A drone used by Indian police for surveillance in Bhopal during lockdown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"596\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A drone used by Indian police for surveillance in Bhopal during lockdown.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sanjeev Gupta/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Digital surveillance tools that might have been closely scrutinised in normal times have been urgently rolled out over recent weeks.

      "bodyText": "People keep saying it: everything has changed. As the days spent in our homes blur together and become indistinguishable, outside in the world huge shifts in consciousness are happening. Just as it was unimaginable that things could go back to normal after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US, so it is that policy, investments and our collective imaginations over the coming years will be overshadowed by a virus that took fewer than 100 days to shut the world down. These strange months may be the first of an era defined by hyper-awareness of the threat posed by pandemics. It is too soon to say what that will look like. Each day brings shocks and possibilities, illuminates a little more of our new reality. Epidemiologists will study the past five months for decades; historians even longer. But already we can see the rough contours forming. We are learning what works against Covid-19. And, surveying the wreckage of the third coronavirus to become an epidemic this century \u2013 along with two animal influenzas and several waves of Ebola \u2013 lessons are emerging about the kinds of societies that will be required to withstand the future outbreaks that scientists tell us are inevitable, and increasing. * * * You must move fast China announced the discovery of a \u201cpneumonia of unknown origin\u201d on the afternoon of 31 December. The announcement barely registered in a world preparing to celebrate the end of the decade. But that same day in Taiwan, the government in Taipei ordered any planes arriving from Wuhan to remain on the tarmac so airport staff could inspect the health of all those onboard. China resisted implementing country-wide health screenings or taking temperature readings in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, for the next fortnight, even as doctors in the city were reporting floods of patients struggling to breathe, and as leaders in Beijing became aware they were confronting \u201cthe most severe challenge\u201d since Sars. In the meantime, Taiwan\u2019s Centers for Disease Control was monitoring arrivals from Wuhan, quarantining any person with a fever or cough and urging its citizens to avoid any unnecessary travel to Hubei. A study released in March underlined the importance of acting fast. Had China implemented widespread testing, a cordon sanitaire around Hubei and other measures a week earlier, it would have reduced China\u2019s caseload by 66%, the researchers argued. Acting three weeks earlier would have cut cases by 95%. As of this week, Taiwan has confirmed 429 positive coronavirus cases and six deaths. The lesson for governments was underlined by Michael Ryan, a surgeon and the executive director of the World Health Organization\u2019s health emergencies programme, in a press conference in March. \u201cBe fast. Have no regrets. You must be the first mover. The virus will always get you if you don\u2019t move quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you need to be right before you move, you will never win \u2026 Speed trumps perfection.\u201d * * * We know what works to contain it \u2026 Months into this epidemic, even basic information about the coronavirus is still unclear. How infectious is it? How deadly? Leaders make life-and-death decisions based on best guesses. \u201cWe are flying the plane as it\u2019s being built,\u201d says Ashley Arabasadi, a policy adviser at the US-based institute Management Sciences for Health. Yet the basic principles for containing a disease, developed and refined with reference to hundreds of previous epidemics, have held true for Covid-19. \u201cThe successful examples and failed examples in containing the spread of the virus have something in common,\u201d says Yanzhong Huang, the director of the Centre for Global Health Studies at Seton Hall University in the US. The countries that have implemented early and extensive testing, such as South Korea and Iceland, have been able to keep their societies relatively open, without loosing the virus into their populations. Singapore kept a lid on its initial wave by diligently retracing the steps of people who tested positive for Covid-19. Those they came into sustained contact with were often put in home isolation, with harsh penalties for breaking it. The sick were quarantined in hospitals, even if their symptoms were mild. When containing cases is no longer possible, early evidence from Europe shows that physical distancing measures, implemented early, \u201cflatten the curve\u201d and reduce the overall size of a country\u2019s outbreak. \u201cIrrespective of the society, the level of development, the preparedness of the health system, early lockdown worked in containing the epidemic, whereas a late lockdown led to a massive outbreak,\u201d says Joel Ruet, the president of the Bridge Tank thinktank, which conducted the research. \u2026 the hard part is implementing it In 2014, as Ebola was spreading in west Africa, Rebecca Katz remembers hearing frustrations from some of the countries helping to fund the response. \u201cThey would be asking things like: \u2018How dare Sierra Leone not close schools during an Ebola outbreak?\u2019\u201d says the director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University Medical Center. \u201cFor a long time it\u2019s been easy for donor countries to cast judgment on recipient countries for their behaviour in disease transmission.\u201d The coronavirus outbreak has made clear that it is a universal problem: even countries that know what works, and have the capacity to act, still hesitate. Some with strong liberal traditions, such as Britain, balked initially at the prospect of drastically curbing civil rights. Italian industry groups are reported to have strongly resisted the idea of shutting down Lombardy, one of the engines of the country\u2019s economy. Developing countries such as Pakistan have had to balance slowing the spread of the disease with the disastrous consequences of closing the farms and construction sites where the poorest work. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy for me to say, hey, we should institute social distancing measures and close schools and cut the link between those susceptible to the disease and the infectious,\u201d says Katz. \u201cKnowing what the larger societal impact is makes it harder to pull the trigger.\u201d There were blind spots in the way countries prepared. A global index released in October concluded the US was more ready than anywhere else to fight a pandemic. But the scorecard, based on WHO methodology, focused more on technical capacity than government processes, says Alexandra Phelan, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center. Official figures show the US has had the largest and most deadly outbreak, exacerbated by a slow initial response, mismanagement of testing and poor coordination between states and the federal government. \u201cAs this outbreak has demonstrated, you can have the best labs in the world, the best notification systems and software, but if you don\u2019t have the appropriate governance of when to use these powers \u2026 they don\u2019t function,\u201d Phelan says. * * * Civil liberties face their greatest test in a generation Digital surveillance tools that might have been closely scrutinised in normal times have been urgently rolled out over recent weeks. More than 40 countries have implemented some form of surveillance or censorship in the name of fighting the coronavirus, according to one estimate. These tools have created a world that might have appeared dystopian a few months ago. In Hong Kong and Bahrain, people in quarantine are being issued with electronic bracelets that track their movements. Drones equipped with cameras hover over some Indian neighbourhoods warning residents they are being watched. Israel has revealed it has secretly been amassing people\u2019s phone data and is tapping that database to find potential coronavirus cases. South Korea credited its advanced use of technology with helping to uncover clusters of cases that would otherwise have gone undetected. About 81% of Koreans approve of the surveillance measures there, according to one poll. Human rights advocates acknowledge we are living through an emergency, but worry governments will use fears of future outbreaks to justify keeping many of these tools in place \u2013 whether or not they help. \u201cWe are facing an immense challenge, but necessity is the question,\u201d says Akshaya Kumar, the director of crisis advocacy at Human Rights Watch. \u201cSome of these measures are just peering into people\u2019s lives and taking power without a clear sunset clause, and without a sense that they\u2019re really needed to combat the virus.\u201d \u201cThe potential for abuse is high,\u201d the UN warned in a report last week. \u201cWhat is justified during an emergency now may become normalised once the crisis has passed.\u201d * * * Public trust is a government\u2019s most valuable asset. The next months will strain it There is no precedent for half the world\u2019s population living under some kind of lockdown. It might just be the single largest collective act undertaken by humanity. Its successful execution requires extraordinary public trust in their governments, says Lars Tr\u00e4g\u00e5rdh, a Swedish historian who studies trust in institutions over time. \u201cIf you trust the government is working for your good, and you trust other citizens to follow the rules, you have huge advantages for collective action,\u201d he says. In places where trust in government is weak, fear has worked to clear the streets. In South Africa, police used whips to enforce a national curfew. Indian migrant labourers walking home were made to squat and crawl as punishment for being outside, while in Jordan, more than 1,600 people were imprisoned in the first three days of quarantine. But restrictions implemented in low-trust societies could engender a backlash, says Tr\u00e4g\u00e5rdh. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what happening in Southern Europe and the US right now where you see a lot of disobedience.\u201d Over the next months, governments are going to allow people to resume their lives amid the worst economic conditions since the Great Depression. Should new waves of the virus be detected, states may again ask their citizens to return home. Managing this is going to require significant stores of public trust, that in some places are quickly eroding. \u201cIf people agree to do something in the long term, without a threat hanging over their heads, they are more likely to keep doing it,\u201d Tr\u00e4g\u00e5rdh says. \u201cThe alternative is fear, distrust, and chaos, and that isn\u2019t good, no matter what the policy might be.\u201d * * * Leaders who deny science are a liability Many leaders have enjoyed what may be a temporary surge in popularity as frightened citizens rally around them in a crisis. Two notable exceptions have been the US president, Donald Trump, and his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro, whose ratings have declined sharply. Both men, rightwing populists who frame their presidencies as revolts against the elites, including scientific authorities, have been highly skilled at influencing the media environment. But the coronavirus is a unique test. It spreads and kills regardless of how it is being framed online or in the media. It emphasises the importance of experts. Success depends on rallying the country together. \u201cLeaders such as Trump deploy simple messages: insider versus outsider, us versus them,\u201d says Sanjoy Chakravorty, a professor at Temple University in the US, who studies the politics of information. \u201cAnd they are having an ideological crisis in how to manage the message here. This is a very complicated information sphere, which you can\u2019t put into \u2018us and them\u2019 boxes \u2026 because in this case everybody is the \u2018us\u2019.\u201d Rather than rewarding bravado, the moment appears to favour leaders who can be honest about the uncertainty inherent in fighting a virus, says Kathleen Bachynski, an assistant professor of public health at Muhlenberg College. \u201cIf leaders are not willing or able to be honest about these limitations, there will be this loss of credibility \u2013 and it won\u2019t be because they are wrong, it\u2019s because information is changing.\u201d Those overseeing some of the more successful responses, such as Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel or Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand, have been praised for their ability to project empathy and communicate complex ideas. Asked to explain Germany\u2019s metrics for deciding when to ease the lockdown, Merkel fluently explained the need to bring down the \u201creproducibility number\u201d of the virus so that the health system can cope with its continued spread. In a press conference a few days earlier, Trump answered the same question by pointing to his head. \u201cThe metrics right here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my metrics.\u201d The responses to the virus in both Brazil and the US are increasingly being led by state leaders, who are bypassing the federal government and coordinating directly with each other. * * * Self-sufficiency matters again \u2026 Governments will not soon forget the desperate global scramble for personal protective equipment and medical supplies they have engaged in these past months. Nor the sight of doctors and nurses forced to guard against infection using bin bags and homemade masks. Several countries have already restricted the exporting of some pharmaceuticals and more than a dozen have imposed bans on selling some food abroad. The UN has warned that if quarantines persist, food supply chains in some places might start to be disrupted from this month. The message is being received. EU countries are emphasising the importance of increasing the \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d of the bloc and ensuring it produces its own essential goods. Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, told village leaders last week the most important lesson from the pandemic was the need for self-reliance. \u201cWe should not look to other countries to satisfy our needs,\u201d he said. Australia is one of several countries said to be re-examining the exposure of food, fuel and medical supplies in particular to global supply chains, the fragility of which have been exposed. \u2026 but the world cannot beat the virus without cooperating The coronavirus got lucky: it emerged at a low point for global cooperation. Countries recognised after Sars that sharing information, coordinating responses and pooling resources such as protective gear, medicine and tests was vital. A set of international regulations that came into force in 2007 laid the groundwork for this cooperation. As Covid-19 started to spread, the regulations were virtually ignored. \u201cThe biggest surprise was how quickly the plans were not at all consulted,\u201d Katz says. \u201cThe world was quick to throw out the global governance tools we had so carefully negotiated.\u201d The lack of cooperation has weakened the world\u2019s response, public health experts argue. A global stimulus package might have put a floor under the economic catastrophe unfolding in many countries. Coordinated shutdowns and reopenings would have slowed the spread of the virus and could speed up the recovery. We might have avoided chaos in the global market for medical and protective equipment, with reports of the US waving wads of cash to re-divert planeloads of masks bound for France, and Israel running clandestine spy operations to source testing kits. \u201cThe last four years have seen a profound shift to governments that are protectionist and nationalistic and who argue the multilateral system doesn\u2019t benefit them,\u201d Phelan says. \u201cThose of us who work in global health or other international problems know we\u2019re interconnected. That global problems required global solutions.\u201d * * * Austerity and inequality make us less resilient No economy could withstand the shock of a large slice of the workforce suddenly ordered home. But the virus has irradiated weaknesses that have made the outbreak deadlier, and will make its aftermath hurt more. The problems with tying health insurance to employment in the US have become even more obvious: the 26 million Americans who have filed for benefits over the past month did not just lose their jobs, many also lost their medical coverage. Britain has the NHS, but a decade of austerity had weakened the system and left the country in demonstrably worse health when the virus struck. The rise of precarious gig-economy jobs and zero-hours contracts has created a mass of workers without access to sick and paid leave, incentivising some to keep working when the entire community needs them to stay home. Insecure work and barriers to healthcare disproportionately burden people from ethnic minorities and poor people: both are dying from Covid-19 at a higher rate in the US and Britain. Governments that have spent decades scaling back social welfare systems are now scrambling to build new ones on the fly. \u201cThe world is realising that there are many millions of workers who have fallen through the cracks of the existing social protection systems,\u201d says Luca Pellerano, a senior social protection specialist with the International Labour Organisation. \u201cThey are not in forms of protected employment, yet they are not poor enough to fall into the often quite narrow and shallow [existing] anti-poverty programmes. Countries with very fragile systems, with big coverage gaps, are scrambling to find solutions and are clearly behind the curve.\u201d * * * The poor and migrants cannot be invisible Singapore\u2019s response has been lauded as a model. Its government moved fast, utilising technology, exemplary public communication and the traditional tools of outbreak control to corral its first wave of cases to about 200. Then last week, it announced it had discovered thousands of new infections, almost all of them among migrant workers living in dormitories on industrial estates on the outskirts of the sleek city-state. Rights groups say little attention was paid to the more than 1 million migrant workers, even as restrictions on crowding and movement were rolled out. Viruses can see the people who are usually invisible to policymakers and the public. The conditions in which they work and live are everyone\u2019s problem. The same is true of the residents of Dharavi, a Mumbai slum where almost 1 million people are crammed together within sight of the skyscrapers and penthouses apartments of some of the wealthiest people in Asia. More than 200 cases have been discovered so far. City authorities acknowledge it will be virtually impossible to halt the spread of the disease among these communities. \u201cTen to 15 people stay in one room,\u201d one official, Kiran Dighavkar, told New Delhi Television last week. \u201cHow is it possible to enforce social distancing?\u201d",

Moral: don\u2019t be a John Cock.</p> <p>So much of the behaviour of our 17th-century forebears is uncomfortably familiar. The citizens of east London watch complacently as the plague tears through the West End, and assume they will be fine. They\u2019re proved terrifyingly wrong. Defoe adds in a chilling parenthesis: \u201cFor indeed it came upon them like an armed man when it did come.\u201d</p> <p>Even before germ theory, Defoe\u2019s common sense and perceptiveness led him to conclusions of which our chief medical officer would approve. He gives a prescient warning about the danger of asymptomatic carriers: \u201cThe plague is not to be avoided by those that converse promiscuously in a town infected, and people have it when they know it not, and that they likewise give it to others when they know not that they have it themselves.\u201d</p> <p>If human behaviour remains dismayingly constant, one thing that has changed for the better is science and our understanding of it. Seven hundred years on, there\u2019s something deeply poignant about Boccaccio\u2019s pre-scientific description of the spread of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/18/mass-grave-shows-how-black-death-devastated-the-countryside\">Black Death</a> in his native Florence. \u201cWhat was particularly virulent about this plague was that it would leap from the sick to the healthy whenever they were together, much as fire catches hold of dry or oily material that\u2019s brought close to it. And that was not all. Not only did speaking with the sick and spending time with them infect the healthy or kill them off, but touching the clothes of the sick or handling anything they had touched seemed to pass on the infection.\u201d You feel like the audience in a pantomime, wanting to shout across the centuries and tell him who the villain is and how he operates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3ae05447b0a6414cae1bdc03dfb524ec2d8243f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ae05447b0a6414cae1bdc03dfb524ec2d8243f3/0_0_4500_3119/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The Plague of Athens was an epidemic that devastated the city-state of Athens in ancient Greece during the second year of the Peloponnesian War (430 BC) when an Athenian victory still seemed within reach.

The escapist response to disaster is another predictable move and <em>The Decameron </em>epitomises it.

It\u2019s a welcome relief to lose yourself in a world of cuckolds and randy nuns. And once more, <em>plus \u00e7a change.</em> The gilded Florentine youths are doing the 14th-century equivalent of binge-watching <em>Sex Education</em> on Netflix.</p> <p>Thomas Mann and Camus are less interested in plague itself than in using it to make existential points. The plague in <em>Death in Venice </em>is an avatar of death in general, the terrible mystery, the pale horse; it is something that strips away vanity and reveals unpalatable truths. In Mann\u2019s novella, it is the catalyst for Von Aschenbach\u2019s humiliating descent into clownish self-destruction. At the same time, the pages dealing with the cholera epidemic are vigorous and apposite. The hotels in Venice empty swiftly, despite official protestations that there is nothing to worry about. It\u2019s a young English travel agent who finally cuts through the official flannel. The doubts he raises about administrative competence and probity are ones that in due course we\u2019ll all be obliged to consider. \u201c\u2018That is,\u2019 he continued in an undertone and with some feeling, \u2018the official explanation, which the authorities here have seen fit to stick to.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2b07afc189084e27db046c360430d27f9f70445\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2b07afc189084e27db046c360430d27f9f70445/0_85_2992_1898/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Neil Bartlett\u2019s adaptation of Camus\u2019 The Plague at the Arcola theatre, London, in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Existential epidemic ... a scene from Neil Bartlett\u2019s adaptation of Camus\u2019 The Plague at the Arcola theatre, London, in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Hobson/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Camus is the real odd one out. <em>The Plague </em>is often read as an allegory of the French experience under occupation, but right now there seems nothing allegorical about it: the hero, Dr Rieux, seems like a naturalistic depiction of a frontline care-worker forced into impossible decisions over who gets a ventilator. At other historical moments, the constant reflection on the meaning of the plague could seem heavy-handed \u2013 Gallic, not in a good way \u2013 but in 2020 it\u2019s like reading <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/14/the-crucible-the-perfect-play-for-our-post-truth-times\">The Crucible</a> </em>while your elderly parent is on trial for witchcraft. For long stretches, you forget any notion of allegory and simply wonder how Camus could have got it so right: from the panic buying of peppermints that people think will be a prophylactic, to the high mortality rate in the municipal jail, to the exhausted healthcare workers, and the terrible monotony of quarantine, something with which we are only just beginning to get acquainted.</p> <p>And then, of course, the plague ends. That\u2019s the actual good news that these books bring. The epidemic always passes. The majority of people survive. Thucydides himself had it and recovered. \u201cI shall simply tell it as it happened,\u201d he promises of the plague that ravaged fifth-century Athens, \u201cand describe the features of the disease which will give anyone who studies them some prior knowledge to enable recognition should it ever strike again.\u201d</p> <p><em>Should it ever strike again </em>is the phrase that awakens our sense of hubris. For all the talk of an unprecedented crisis, we are living through something with many precedents. \u201cThere was particularly high mortality among doctors because of their particular exposure,\u201d Thucydides wrote 2,500 years ago in a sentence that could appear in tomorrow\u2019s paper. We have assumed that deadly epidemics belonged to a phase of history that was behind us, as quaint and irrelevant as candlelight and milking your own cows.</p> <p>When the number of fatalities finally peaks and dwindles, Defoe\u2019s citizens pull up their windows and shout to each other to share the news. Camus\u2019s Oran is liberated; its citizens struggle to make sense of what has happened to them. Back in fifth-century Athens, the Peloponnesian war continues. Whether society changes for the better or worse, or simply stays the same, is what we will find out.</p>",

At the same time, the pages dealing with the cholera epidemic are vigorous and apposite. The hotels in Venice empty swiftly, despite official protestations that there is nothing to worry about. It\u2019s a young English travel agent who finally cuts through the official flannel. The doubts he raises about administrative competence and probity are ones that in due course we\u2019ll all be obliged to consider. \u201c\u2018That is,\u2019 he continued in an undertone and with some feeling, \u2018the official explanation, which the authorities here have seen fit to stick to.\u2019\u201d Camus is the real odd one out. The Plague is often read as an allegory of the French experience under occupation, but right now there seems nothing allegorical about it: the hero, Dr Rieux, seems like a naturalistic depiction of a frontline care-worker forced into impossible decisions over who gets a ventilator. At other historical moments, the constant reflection on the meaning of the plague could seem heavy-handed \u2013 Gallic, not in a good way \u2013 but in 2020 it\u2019s like reading The Crucible while your elderly parent is on trial for witchcraft. For long stretches, you forget any notion of allegory and simply wonder how Camus could have got it so right: from the panic buying of peppermints that people think will be a prophylactic, to the high mortality rate in the municipal jail, to the exhausted healthcare workers, and the terrible monotony of quarantine, something with which we are only just beginning to get acquainted. And then, of course, the plague ends. That\u2019s the actual good news that these books bring. The epidemic always passes. The majority of people survive. Thucydides himself had it and recovered. \u201cI shall simply tell it as it happened,\u201d he promises of the plague that ravaged fifth-century Athens, \u201cand describe the features of the disease which will give anyone who studies them some prior knowledge to enable recognition should it ever strike again.\u201d Should it ever strike again is the phrase that awakens our sense of hubris. For all the talk of an unprecedented crisis, we are living through something with many precedents. \u201cThere was particularly high mortality among doctors because of their particular exposure,\u201d Thucydides wrote 2,500 years ago in a sentence that could appear in tomorrow\u2019s paper. We have assumed that deadly epidemics belonged to a phase of history that was behind us, as quaint and irrelevant as candlelight and milking your own cows. When the number of fatalities finally peaks and dwindles, Defoe\u2019s citizens pull up their windows and shout to each other to share the news. Camus\u2019s Oran is liberated; its citizens struggle to make sense of what has happened to them. Back in fifth-century Athens, the Peloponnesian war continues. Whether society changes for the better or worse, or simply stays the same, is what we will find out.",

      "bodyText": "On 18 January, about 40,000 families in the neighbourhood of Baibuting in Wuhan gathered for a massive potluck meal before the lunary new year. Photographs of the event, proudly published in local state media, showed residents in festive red and yellow bibs digging in, reaching with their chopsticks for hundreds of dishes laid out on banquet tables. Five days later, the city was placed under lockdown and within weeks, there were several possible coronavirus infections in the neighbourhood. For months to come that banquet would be cited as an example of how little local officials had done to prevent the virus from spreading across their city. In the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, Chinese authorities are pushing for a \u201cdining table revolution\u201d to change long-held traditions of communal eating like those on display at the Baibuting meal, where diners take from shared plates with their own chopsticks. Authorities have launched an aggressive campaign to convince diners to use designated serving utensils known as gongkuai or gongshao, or \u201cpublic chopsticks\u201d and \u201cpublic spoon\u201d. Officials are also encouraging the serving of separate portions rather than \u201cfamily style\u201d, where a group shares several dishes. It will be a difficult feat to pull off. After the 2002-03 Sars epidemic, a similar initiative petered out. More challenging is that sharing food is a key part of Chinese social life and a sign of intimacy.

      "body": "<p>A founding father of one of Europe\u2019s largest artist studio complexes has expressed grief, anger and a sense of betrayal after being told he must leave the community he helped create almost half a century ago.</p> <p>The contemporary artist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/\">Howard Silverman</a>, 73, said his part in the development of Spike Island in Bristol had been his life\u2019s work, and being given notice to vacate the studio he considered his spiritual home had devastated him.</p> <p>Fellow studio holders and artists from around the world are backing Silverman\u2019s fight to overturn the decision, with some suggesting the organisation is intent on squeezing out older, established tenants in favour of younger ones.</p> <p>The New York-born Silverman, regarded as a cornerstone of the Bristol art scene, said: \u201cI wake up in the morning stressed and depressed. It affects family, friends and colleagues.\u201d</p> <p>Silverman, whose award-winning work includes installation, sculpture, painting, printmaking, video and digital imagery, is angry that, after spending 46 years at Spike Island and its predecessor organisation, the panel considering his bid to renew his lease had just 20 minutes to study it before debating and then making its decision.</p> <p>He is also distressed that after his appeal was rejected he was served three months\u2019 notice to vacate during the first days of the Covid-19 lockdown, which would have made packing up and leaving even more difficult. \u201cMy studio is my spiritual home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has always been my laboratory and my launch pad. I will be lost without it.\u201d</p> <p>Spike Island is the base for more than 70 artists, dozens of creative businesses and hundreds of fine art students.</p> <p>It began in the 1970s as Artspace Bristol, founded by Silverman and a group of other idealistic, radical artists who sought out and administered affordable studio spaces in old industrial buildings.</p> <p>In 1992, the organisation moved to its current home, a former tea-packing warehouse and rebranded as <a href=\"https://www.spikeisland.org.uk/\">Spike Island</a>. A trust was set up and last year introduced a system of lease reviews. Half of the six artists who have so far reapplied for their leases have been told they must leave.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/01/historic-england-launches-coronavirus-lockdown-photography-project\">Historic England launches lockdown photography project</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Spike Island artist Julian Claxton said the decision to evict Silverman was outrageous. He said Silverman remained a \u201ccutting edge\u201d artist but always had time to encourage and help others. Another artist said he was the life and soul of the community, while a third said it was a \u201cmystery\u201d why he was being evicted.</p> <p>Within 48 hours, more than 500 people including artists from all around the world had signed a<a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/spike-island-stop-unfairly-evicting-artists?source=direct_link&amp;\"> petition</a> protesting against the eviction.</p> <p>A spokesman for Spike Island refused to speak about an individual case, but denied it was favouring younger artists. He said: \u201cThe studio review process is a way to ensure that our artists\u2019 studios are managed fairly. Our [studios] must be inclusive and accessible to all in order to support local artists from different backgrounds and at different career stages.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian has seen a letter dated 26 March \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">after the coronavirus lockdown</a> \u2013 from Spike Island giving Silverman three months to leave from that day \u2013 which would have involved planning the move during physical distancing. After he objected, Spike Island said the three months\u2019 notice would begin after lockdown was lifted.</p> <p>The spokesman said Spike Island was being \u201cincredibly flexible\u201d with artists who were being told to leave. He confirmed the review panel members were given 20 minutes to read submissions from tenants, adding: \u201cAn extensive period of discussion then follows.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A founding father of one of Europe\u2019s largest artist studio complexes has expressed grief, anger and a sense of betrayal after being told he must leave the community he helped create almost half a century ago. The contemporary artist Howard Silverman, 73, said his part in the development of Spike Island in Bristol had been his life\u2019s work, and being given notice to vacate the studio he considered his spiritual home had devastated him. Fellow studio holders and artists from around the world are backing Silverman\u2019s fight to overturn the decision, with some suggesting the organisation is intent on squeezing out older, established tenants in favour of younger ones. The New York-born Silverman, regarded as a cornerstone of the Bristol art scene, said: \u201cI wake up in the morning stressed and depressed. It affects family, friends and colleagues.\u201d Silverman, whose award-winning work includes installation, sculpture, painting, printmaking, video and digital imagery, is angry that, after spending 46 years at Spike Island and its predecessor organisation, the panel considering his bid to renew his lease had just 20 minutes to study it before debating and then making its decision. He is also distressed that after his appeal was rejected he was served three months\u2019 notice to vacate during the first days of the Covid-19 lockdown, which would have made packing up and leaving even more difficult. \u201cMy studio is my spiritual home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has always been my laboratory and my launch pad. I will be lost without it.\u201d Spike Island is the base for more than 70 artists, dozens of creative businesses and hundreds of fine art students. It began in the 1970s as Artspace Bristol, founded by Silverman and a group of other idealistic, radical artists who sought out and administered affordable studio spaces in old industrial buildings. In 1992, the organisation moved to its current home, a former tea-packing warehouse and rebranded as Spike Island. A trust was set up and last year introduced a system of lease reviews. Half of the six artists who have so far reapplied for their leases have been told they must leave. The Spike Island artist Julian Claxton said the decision to evict Silverman was outrageous. He said Silverman remained a \u201ccutting edge\u201d artist but always had time to encourage and help others. Another artist said he was the life and soul of the community, while a third said it was a \u201cmystery\u201d why he was being evicted. Within 48 hours, more than 500 people including artists from all around the world had signed a petition protesting against the eviction. A spokesman for Spike Island refused to speak about an individual case, but denied it was favouring younger artists. He said: \u201cThe studio review process is a way to ensure that our artists\u2019 studios are managed fairly. Our [studios] must be inclusive and accessible to all in order to support local artists from different backgrounds and at different career stages.\u201d The Guardian has seen a letter dated 26 March \u2013 after the coronavirus lockdown \u2013 from Spike Island giving Silverman three months to leave from that day \u2013 which would have involved planning the move during physical distancing. After he objected, Spike Island said the three months\u2019 notice would begin after lockdown was lifted. The spokesman said Spike Island was being \u201cincredibly flexible\u201d with artists who were being told to leave. He confirmed the review panel members were given 20 minutes to read submissions from tenants, adding: \u201cAn extensive period of discussion then follows.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Colin Graves will step down as chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board on 31 August, allowing Ian Watmore to take over after he was cleared of any wrongdoing by a review of his brief spell on the board of the Football League. Graves, who is now expected to run to become chair of the International Cricket Council when Shashank Manohar departs this summer, had previously extended his five-year term at the ECB by six months in order to oversee the first year of the Hundred. With that tournament now postponed until 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic, however, the 72-year-old former Yorkshire chairman and Costcutter magnate will pass the baton on to Watmore sooner, subject to ratification by the ECB annual general meeting at the end of this month. The appointment of Watmore as the ECB\u2019s first salaried chairman has not been entirely smooth despite a strong CV that includes a background in business as chief executive of Accenture, 16 years as a senior civil servant, a short tenure as chief executive of the Football Association and time on the boards of various sporting bodies. A report last month in the Daily Mail highlighted a question mark over the 61-year-old\u2019s conduct during a four-month stint on the board of the EFL, with the suggestion that a meeting held with Mel Morris, the Derby County owner, had prompted the threat of a breakaway league during a disagreement over a new rights deal. When announcing on Friday that Watmore remains chair-elect, however, an ECB statement said: \u201cDuring an extensive process, that included a confidential review of the report referenced in media, the subcommittee has universally agreed that there was no evidence to support any allegation of wrongdoing on Ian Watmore\u2019s part. In addition, it was concluded that the appointment process had been undertaken in a thorough and professional manner and the board now regards the matter closed.\u201d The ECB review was overseen by the board directors Barry O\u2019Brien, Katie Bickerstaffe and Martin Darlow, the first of whom had sat on the original nominations committee chaired by Lucy Pearson and overseen, from a county perspective, by the late David Hodgkiss, the former Lancashire chairman who passed away in March after contracting Covid-19.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning. If there\u2019s a big winner from the coronavirus, then it\u2019s Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos. On Thursday his online retail corporation announced revenues of $74.5bn in the first quarter of 2020, 26% higher than the same period last year and equivalent to more than $33m an hour. Meanwhile, hundreds of workers in Amazon warehouses and Amazon-owned Whole Foods supermarkets are staging a sick-out on Friday, in protest at what they say are unsafe working conditions. An Amazon spokesperson said the company objected to \u201cthe irresponsible actions of labor groups in spreading misinformation\u201d, while Bezos announced plans to plow $4bn into pandemic-related expenses, including personal protective equipment (PPE) and higher wages for workers. Amazon\u2019s news came as US Labor Department data showed 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment since 21 March. That\u2019s 18.4% of the entire working population, a level unmatched since the Great Depression. Rent strike. Thousands of Americans plan to participate in a rent strike on Friday, demanding state leaders in New York, California and Pennsylvania cancel rent during the crisis. Running water. A third of American households risk having their water shut off over unpaid bills during the crisis, and face exorbitant fees to be reconnected to the supply. Trump claims there\u2019s evidence Covid-19 came from a Wuhan lab US intelligence agencies say they agree with the scientific consensus that the coronavirus was \u201cnot manmade or genetically modified\u201d. But Donald Trump begs to differ: on Thursday the president implied, without details, that he had seen evidence to support an unproven theory that Covid-19 originated at a virology lab in Wuhan. Reports suggest the administration is pressurising intelligence officials to turn up proof of the theory, and analysts fear the president is looking for propaganda to prop up his attacks on China for its handling of the pandemic. On Friday, Trump will leave the White House for the first time in a month, to travel to Camp David. Whistleblower complaint. The government\u2019s former vaccine chief, Dr Rick Bright, is preparing a whistleblower complaint after claiming he was dismissed from his role because he resisted political pressure to expand the use of a malaria drug touted by Trump as a potential Covid-19 \u201cgamechanger\u201d. A paroxysm over polls. Trump flew into a rage last Friday after being presented with poor poll numbers by his campaign manager, Brad Parscale. The president reportedly threatened to sue Parscale, telling him \u201cI\u2019m not fucking losing to Joe Biden.\u201d Anti-lockdown protesters tried to storm the Michigan capitol Hundreds of protesters, many of them armed, tried to force their way on to the floor of the legislative chamber at Michigan\u2019s state capitol in Lansing on Thursday, to demand an end to the state\u2019s lockdown after the Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, requested an extension of her emergency stay-at-home measures. In California, the governor, Gavin Newsom, has closed beaches in Orange County after a backlash over pictures of crowds hitting the sand last weekend. Sam Levin asks how risky is a beach day, really?. Contact tracers. California is trying to follow South Korea\u2019s example by organising a massive programme of testing and contact tracing, with San Francisco already enlisting an army of extra health department staff to meet the challenge. At least a million people have recovered from the coronavirus Some better news: more than a million people worldwide are now known to have recovered from Covid-19, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. South Korean health officials said on Thursday that a flurry of apparent reinfections were in fact a result of testing faults, providing reassurance that those who recover are most likely immune to reinfection. Denmark and the Czech Republic have eased lockdowns without a fresh spike in infections. But elsewhere in the world \u2026 \u2026 Russia recorded a record daily rise in infections, as the country\u2019s prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, self-isolated after testing positive for Covid-19. \u2026 British black Africans and British Pakistanis are dying from coronavirus in English hospitals at more than 2.5 times the rate of the white population. In other news \u2026 Biden will break his silence over a sexual assault claim. The presumptive Democratic nominee is expected to respond to the allegation by Tara Reade, a former senatorial aide, in an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe on Friday. Nasa picked Bezos and Musk to develop lunar landers. The US space agency has selected three private space companies, including Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin and Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, to lead development on the vessels for future moon landings. A deadly virus is spreading exponentially \u2026 among bees. UK scientists say cases of chronic bee paralysis virus have surged in Britain and around the world.

It was 11 March. The day before, I had completed a tour of Germany, performing 14 concerts in 10 days. The first news about Covid-19 was starting to seep through, but the concert halls were still open and, as a violinist and music director of the Zurich Chamber Orchestra, I had been playing for 2,000 people every night.</p> <p>At the signing sessions afterwards, the promoters had put up large signs requesting that the audience keep their distance and refrain from selfies (which they didn\u2019t). Next up, I was due to perform at a festival on the beautiful island of R\u00fcgen in the Baltic Sea. Artists were flying in from all around the world, and I had decided to take the family along. Everything was looking fine, when suddenly the bubble burst. As my manager was calling to explain, local authorities on R\u00fcgen had announced that all events were to be cancelled with immediate effect. And then began the series of knock-on legislation and further cancellations.

We binged on Netflix and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s: my beautiful boys goggled at me with a mixture of love and increasing bewilderment as I read to them every night. \u201cWhen is Dad leaving again?\u201d they wondered \u2013 I am constantly on the road and they are used to my frequent long absences.</p> <p>Online, I saw my esteemed colleagues <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/15/bittersweet-symphony-the-best-lockdown-orchestras-and-choirs-online\">performing</a> from their gardens, their balconies, their kitchens. At first I was hooked. What a wonderful idea: the dissemination of music at a ghastly time in our troubled world. But I started to wonder about the sound quality. Of course, a cell phone is a cell phone. But isn\u2019t classical music all about sound, about really listening? All my Russian fiddle teachers certainly thought so: make a beautiful sound and you\u2019ll be OK, they told me when I was a boy. Was it possible to produce a stream from home that would sound like it was in a concert hall?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5dd3949193afb57d97aa6ecda53ed0c486d5bdc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5dd3949193afb57d97aa6ecda53ed0c486d5bdc/524_0_1336_802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Nice to finally meet you\u2019 ... guests Simon Rattle and Magdalena Koz\u030cena\u0301.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Nice to finally meet you\u2019 ... guests Simon Rattle and Magdalena Koz\u030cena\u0301.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ARTE.TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next morning, I called Tobias Lehmann, a giant in the world of sound engineering who co-owns Berlin\u2019s Teldex Studios. An hour later he was standing in my living room, taking measurements. \u201cI think we can make it work,\u201d he chirped. Next I called Wolfgang Bergmann, the head of the German section of Arte, a magnificent Franco-German television channel that lives and breathes culture as a public broadcaster. He and I had discussed many broadcasting ideas in the past. Would I be interested in a livestream? he asked. \u201cOnly if it is with top-notch sound,\u201d I replied. \u201cCan you start tomorrow?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>I told him he was mad, and he said yes, but that I was even madder. He sent over two creative directors who within hours built a set in my living room, brought in beautiful art nouveau lighting to match the existing decor, and worked out how to turn our idea into reality. At this point we were still allowed to move freely and the production company still had permission to film, so long as we all kept at least 1.5m apart.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I could never have imagined in my wildest dreams that such an eclectic bevy of artists would pass through my Berlin salon</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We set up two unmanned cameras in addition to the cameraman in the room, thereby limiting how many people were actually in the space at a given time.

It was 11 March. The day before, I had completed a tour of Germany, performing 14 concerts in 10 days. The first news about Covid-19 was starting to seep through, but the concert halls were still open and, as a violinist and music director of the Zurich Chamber Orchestra, I had been playing for 2,000 people every night. At the signing sessions afterwards, the promoters had put up large signs requesting that the audience keep their distance and refrain from selfies (which they didn\u2019t). Next up, I was due to perform at a festival on the beautiful island of R\u00fcgen in the Baltic Sea. Artists were flying in from all around the world, and I had decided to take the family along. Everything was looking fine, when suddenly the bubble burst. As my manager was calling to explain, local authorities on R\u00fcgen had announced that all events were to be cancelled with immediate effect. And then began the series of knock-on legislation and further cancellations. Soon I \u2013 like musicians around the world \u2013 was staring down the barrel of a destitute season.

Student groups representing the students, from across the UK, have been coordinating emergency food drops with local community groups and charities. Many of the young people have lost their part-time jobs and can no longer afford even basic living costs. The Indian National Students\u2019 Association, one of the largest student groups, says so far it has helped to distribute food to more than 3,000 struggling students across the country. A second UK-wide students\u2019 group, the National Indian Students and Alumni Union, says it has also had calls from hundreds of students who cannot afford food. Charan Sekhon, chair of an Anglo-Indian charity based in Bedford called the Seva Trust, which has delivered food parcels to more than 60 Indian students in its local area, says: \u201cWe have had lots of examples where students are actually starving. They haven\u2019t got anything at all to eat.\u201d Virendra Sharma, Labour MP for Ealing Southall, wrote to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, on Wednesday calling for universities to ringfence money from hardship funds, which are often discretionary, for international students.

The tracing of number plates, flight passenger lists and coronavirus test results could become impossible unless the UK agrees a deal on its future relationship with the EU that includes security and data-sharing arrangements. \u201cWhat detail, what level of information we share [in 2021] has still to be worked out,\u201d said Robin Swann, Stormont\u2019s health minister. Data shared between authorities in Belfast and Dublin helped in February to trace passengers on a plane that landed in Dublin airport who may have had contact with a resident who went on to Northern Ireland and later tested positive for coronavirus. The Social Democrat and Labour party assembly member Matthew O\u2019Tooleasked Swann if this would continue beyond December in the absence of a trade deal or extension to the transition period. \u201cWe will probably still be contact tracing people, we will still be moving from Dundalk to Newry and Buncrana to Derry,\u201d said O\u2019Toole in reference to border towns. \u201cIs there a risk that if we leave the transition period without a deal and there is legal uncertainty around our information governance framework that would put contact tracing particularly in border areas into risk?\u201d Swann replied that it had been flagged as an issue under Brexit\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer contingency planning but that no action could be taken until they knew what shape Brexit would take. \u201cThis is new to this island, this is new to the UK, this is new to Europe and we look at how we actually start to do this level of contact tracing so when it comes to legalities, who holds the information? Is it held on your phone, is it held in a central database? That all has to be [worked out] at this point of time,\u201d he told the Stormont assembly. \u201cLet\u2019s get it up and running and we will work round the rest of it when we get to the end of the year and we see where we are in regards to Brexit.\u201d Swann\u2019s comments come as the European commission told the UK that time was short to implement the Northern Ireland protocol that Boris Johnson included in the withdrawal agreement in January. A technical note issued by Brussels put flesh on the bones of the protocol and served as a reminder of the scale of the challenge facing businesses and now health authorities in the face of a national health emergency. After the first meeting of the specialised committee of EU and UK officials tasked with implementing the Northern Ireland rules, the commission said the exchanges \u201cnow urgently need to be followed up by tangible measures\u201d. Andrew McCormick, a senior official from the Northern Ireland civil service, was present at the meeting.",

      "body": "<p>It was a low-key comeback. After a week in hospital, and two more spent recuperating at Chequers, the prime minister\u2019s official country residence, Boris Johnson arrived at Downing Street last weekend in an inconspicuous Volkswagen mini-van. He slipped inside. There was no victory sign or cheerful wave.</p> <p>For an unprecedented period, the prime minister had been missing. He was either laid low from his coronavirus symptoms, in intensive care in St Thomas\u2019 hospital in Westminster, or recovering from what the tabloids called his \u201cbrush with death\u201d. It was clear that few major government decisions had been made in Johnson\u2019s long absence.</p> <p>Now, according to aides, he was \u201craring to go\u201d; he was ready to \u201ctake control\u201d of government affairs and to \u201cbounce back\u201d. The country, not to mention deferential cabinet colleagues, were waiting for some answers. Was Johnson in favour of easing lockdown? When and how might this happen? And were his laissez-faire instincts a thing of the past?</p> <p>There were personal questions, too. Namely, whether Johnson\u2019s experience of grave illness had recast his personality for the better. In the pre-virus days, the serious politician played second fiddle to the crowd-pleasing comedian and columnist. Now, some saw Johnson taking on a new persona befitting our pandemic-shaped age: that of a statesman.</p> <p>On Monday, for instance, the Times reported an unnamed cabinet minister saying his illness \u201chas changed him \u2026 He now has an emotional connection to the NHS that you don\u2019t get from anything except a near-death experience.\u201d</p> <p>The early signals, though, were mixed. At 9am on Monday morning Johnson appeared in front of Downing Street. His five-minute speech showed a man labouring to breathe as he spoke. His clothes seemed to hang off him \u2013 his appearance and demeanour a physical embodiment of the effects of the infection.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c87e549636e14dead7049ba556c6bfaebd2da397\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c87e549636e14dead7049ba556c6bfaebd2da397/0_170_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson arriving back at Downing Street from hospital after the birth of his baby son.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson arriving back at Downing Street from hospital after the birth of his baby son.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He gave no hint as to when schools and non-essential shops might reopen and some measure of normal life resume.</p> <p>Nor was there acknowledgement \u2013 tacit or otherwise \u2013 that his time away had clarified his thinking, or made him inclined to choose this moment to \u201clevel with the country\u201d, as he has previously promised to do, about the decisions that have been taken, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/uk-government-coronavirus-science-who-advice\">potential mistakes that have been made</a> over the timing of the lockdown.</p> <p>He swerved around the questions about the lockdown, the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/28/gp-coronavirus-no-ppe-guilty-angry\"> lack of personal protective equipment</a> (PPE) and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/27/the-guardian-view-on-coronavirus-tests-ideology-has-hurt-the-uk\">chaos over testing</a>. </p> <p>Instead, Johnson asked the nation for patience. \u201cI believe we are coming now to the end of the first phase of the conflict\u201d, he said. There seemed to be deliberate echoes here of Churchill\u2019s famous second world war speech about the \u201cend of the beginning\u201d. Johnson offered further flourishes. The disease \u2013 as he himself knew \u2013 was \u201can invisible mugger\u201d. Thanks to our collective efforts, Britain had \u201cwrestled it to the ground\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/30/the-guardian-view-on-johnsons-covid-19-plan-doubt-deny-and-dismiss\">The Guardian view on Johnson's Covid-19 plan: doubt, deny and dismiss | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The phrase didn\u2019t really capture the grim and multitudinous truth. By Monday more than 20,000 people had officially died of the virus \u2013 in hospitals, care centres, or in quiet agony at home, surrounded by loved ones. They were not so much mugged as extinguished before their time. By the end of the week the official tally was 27,000-plus, and probably much higher.</p> <p>To his critics, who have included normally loyal supporters in the rightwing media, there are still searching questions about the prime minister\u2019s decisions in late February and March \u2013 or lack of them.</p> <p>By <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-deaths-how-does-britain-compare-with-other-countries\">some analyses</a>, the UK is on track to have the highest death rate in Europe. Other countries, led by Germany and Denmark, have done much better. Were they less complacent and more organised? Either way, they are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/danes-and-czechs-say-easing-lockdowns-has-produced-no-covid-19-surge\">emerging from lockdown</a>.</p> <p>Another moment for Johnson to address these issues might have been prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday. He was due for the first time to face up to Sir Keir Starmer, the new Labour leader. But the evening before, Downing Street wouldn\u2019t say whether Johnson planned to turn up, which was odd.There was speculation Johnson might still be somewhat unwell.</p> <p>In fact, something else was going on. On Wednesday morning, Johnson was at his partner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/29/carrie-symonds-a-media-savvy-history-maker-in-no-10\">Carrie Symonds</a>\u2019 side as she gave birth to a baby boy at an NHS hospital. It was the latest dramatic event in what had been an extraordinary period for Johnson, several lives squashed into one almost: Brexit, Covid-19, and the unparalleled shut-down of national life.</p> <p>A photo taken on the stairs of Downing Street showed a grinning Johnson, back from his fiancee\u2019s bedside. He looks elated and nobody could begrudge the couple their happiness. Well-wishers noted babies change people for the better; cynics pointed out that Johnson has been a father five \u2013 or more \u2013 times before, and that this arrival might prove a distraction from the tasks ahead.</p> <p>In the nine months since he became PM, Johnson has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/revealed-the-inside-story-of-uk-covid-19-coronavirus-crisis\"> frequently seemed semi-engaged</a>. Over New Year he had a holiday in the Caribbean. In February he spent 12 days at Chevening, the government\u2019s estate in Kent, missing five Cobra meetings as Covid-19 spread from China. Reportedly he took weekends off.</p> <p>Former colleagues have joked Johnson prefers to do many things badly, rather than one thing well \u2013 more of a chairman than a CEO.</p> <p>Downing Street aides say this is wrong. They insist Johnson is devoting his full attention to the coronavirus crisis. One ministerial adviser said he was busier at the end of his time off than was admitted. He asked for submissions on a whole range of issues, not just Covid-19. His time in hospital reignited his desire to take care of the NHS, and to get back to work, the adviser said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8d5f2e3810864b71155e573ad27e4581a2588bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8d5f2e3810864b71155e573ad27e4581a2588bd/14_0_2124_1275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson chairs his first digital cabinet meeting at No 10, on 30 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson chairs his first digital cabinet meeting at No 10, on 30 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Johnson is now determined to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/boris-johnson-uk-beginning-to-turn-the-tide-on-coronavirus\">turn the tide</a>\u201d on the virus by mid-June, officials suggest. In his absence ministers have argued about the right way forward. Johnson is keen to take back control of the political situation, officials stress, and is reportedly annoyed at leaks suggesting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/advisers-warn-over-coronavirus-lockdown-relaxation-amid-cabinet-split\">cabinet is split</a> between pro-economy hawks and cautious lockdown doves.</p> <p>So what next? Before falling sick, Johnson could be counted among those who were bullish about the prospect of easing restrictions and returning to business as usual relatively quickly.</p> <p>Multiple sources with knowledge of his thinking say some of that optimism has faded. They says this partly reflects his own experiences in intensive care \u2013 but also the changing scientific picture presented to him.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been briefing from some close to No 10 against Matt [Hancock]. But the truth is the PM\u2019s position is much closer to Matt\u2019s than those pushing for measures to be lifted. Dom [Raab] has come round to that view as well,\u201d one cabinet source said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/the-language-that-disguises-the-governments-failings-on-coronavirus\">The language that disguises the government\u2019s failings on coronavirus | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was Johnson, apparently, who approved the decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/uk-records-4343-care-home-coronavirus-deaths-in-a-fortnight\">add care home figures</a> to the daily death tally \u2013 a risky move towards transparency, given the horrifying numbers involved.</p> <p>And then on Thursday the prime minister appeared for the first time in well over a month at the government\u2019s 5pm press conference. Again, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/30/breathless-boris-is-left-floundering-as-he-faces-foe-he-cant-outbluster\">breathless</a>. And more hesitant than usual, misreading the figure for deaths.</p> <p>And again, he chose not to address the questions that have been asked of him personally, or his government.</p> <p>So far, neither he, nor anybody in his top team, has wanted to meet the challenge set them by Intisar Chowdhury, the 18-year-old son of an NHS doctor who died with coronavirus. The teenager has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/son-of-doctor-who-died-from-covid-19-intisar-chowdhury-confronts-matt-hancock-over-ppe\">asked for an apology</a>, for ministers to \u201copenly acknowledge there have been mistakes in handling this virus.\u201d</p> <p>At the daily briefing, Johnson stressed the allegedly good news. The UK had passed the peak of the disease. It was was on a downward slope. He promised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/30/britain-is-past-peak-of-coronavirus-outbreak-says-boris-johnson\">details next week</a> of how lockdown might end. There would be a \u201croadmap\u201d and a \u201cmenu of options\u201d.</p> <p>There was a warning, too. Johnson likened the pandemic to a pleasant European motoring holiday that had got into unexpected difficulty. Britain was driving through a \u201chuge Alpine tunnel\u201d. Ahead were \u201csunlight and pasture\u201d. It needed to keep control, lest it run into a \u201csecond and bigger mountain\u201d. </p> <p>He claimed the UK had avoided the tragedy that had engulfed other places. Asked if his time in hospital had altered him, he said he was \u201cvery, very lucky\u201d and paid tribute to the \u201cthousands of people\u201d who had been less fortunate.</p> <p>For the moment, Johnson\u2019s political opponents recognise he is unassailable. His popularity ratings are high. The country, polls suggest, is inclined to give him the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/happiness-increasing-boris-johnson-coronavirus\">benefit of the doubt</a>, at least for now, while the virus is still a threat and the NHS is under great strain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/lack-of-logic-in-boris-johnsons-claims-on-lockdown-and-coronavirus-peak\">Lack of logic in Boris Johnson\u2019s claims on lockdown and coronavirus \u2018peak\u2019 | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The new baby will generate further goodwill. There have been gushing headlines from the pro-Boris ringwing media, with more to come when the boy is named, and the first pictures emerge.</p> <p>It is the perfect plotline in a time of gloom. But Johnson will not be able to put off a reckoning forever. The government\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said as much on Thursday when he suggested the country needed to focus on the crisis in hand, and not dwell \u2013 for now \u2013 on how we got here.</p> <p>Other leaders have emerged from the crisis with their reputations enhanced \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/jacinda-ardern-and-her-government-soar-in-popularity-during-coronavirus-crisis\">Jacinda Ardern</a> in New Zealand, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/why-do-female-leaders-seem-to-be-more-successful-at-managing-the-coronavirus-crisis\">Angela Merkel</a> in Germany, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/new-york-andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-blew-the-bugle\">Andrew Cuomo</a> in New York.</p> <p>But they followed a different template: level with the public, admit mistakes, explain the facts.

      "bodyText": "It was a low-key comeback. After a week in hospital, and two more spent recuperating at Chequers, the prime minister\u2019s official country residence, Boris Johnson arrived at Downing Street last weekend in an inconspicuous Volkswagen mini-van. He slipped inside. There was no victory sign or cheerful wave. For an unprecedented period, the prime minister had been missing. He was either laid low from his coronavirus symptoms, in intensive care in St Thomas\u2019 hospital in Westminster, or recovering from what the tabloids called his \u201cbrush with death\u201d. It was clear that few major government decisions had been made in Johnson\u2019s long absence. Now, according to aides, he was \u201craring to go\u201d; he was ready to \u201ctake control\u201d of government affairs and to \u201cbounce back\u201d. The country, not to mention deferential cabinet colleagues, were waiting for some answers. Was Johnson in favour of easing lockdown? When and how might this happen? And were his laissez-faire instincts a thing of the past? There were personal questions, too. Namely, whether Johnson\u2019s experience of grave illness had recast his personality for the better. In the pre-virus days, the serious politician played second fiddle to the crowd-pleasing comedian and columnist. Now, some saw Johnson taking on a new persona befitting our pandemic-shaped age: that of a statesman. On Monday, for instance, the Times reported an unnamed cabinet minister saying his illness \u201chas changed him \u2026 He now has an emotional connection to the NHS that you don\u2019t get from anything except a near-death experience.\u201d The early signals, though, were mixed. At 9am on Monday morning Johnson appeared in front of Downing Street. His five-minute speech showed a man labouring to breathe as he spoke. His clothes seemed to hang off him \u2013 his appearance and demeanour a physical embodiment of the effects of the infection. He gave no hint as to when schools and non-essential shops might reopen and some measure of normal life resume. Nor was there acknowledgement \u2013 tacit or otherwise \u2013 that his time away had clarified his thinking, or made him inclined to choose this moment to \u201clevel with the country\u201d, as he has previously promised to do, about the decisions that have been taken, the potential mistakes that have been made over the timing of the lockdown. He swerved around the questions about the lockdown, the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the chaos over testing. Instead, Johnson asked the nation for patience. \u201cI believe we are coming now to the end of the first phase of the conflict\u201d, he said. There seemed to be deliberate echoes here of Churchill\u2019s famous second world war speech about the \u201cend of the beginning\u201d. Johnson offered further flourishes. The disease \u2013 as he himself knew \u2013 was \u201can invisible mugger\u201d. Thanks to our collective efforts, Britain had \u201cwrestled it to the ground\u201d. The phrase didn\u2019t really capture the grim and multitudinous truth. By Monday more than 20,000 people had officially died of the virus \u2013 in hospitals, care centres, or in quiet agony at home, surrounded by loved ones. They were not so much mugged as extinguished before their time. By the end of the week the official tally was 27,000-plus, and probably much higher. To his critics, who have included normally loyal supporters in the rightwing media, there are still searching questions about the prime minister\u2019s decisions in late February and March \u2013 or lack of them. By some analyses, the UK is on track to have the highest death rate in Europe. Other countries, led by Germany and Denmark, have done much better. Were they less complacent and more organised? Either way, they are now emerging from lockdown. Another moment for Johnson to address these issues might have been prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday. He was due for the first time to face up to Sir Keir Starmer, the new Labour leader. But the evening before, Downing Street wouldn\u2019t say whether Johnson planned to turn up, which was odd.There was speculation Johnson might still be somewhat unwell. In fact, something else was going on. On Wednesday morning, Johnson was at his partner Carrie Symonds\u2019 side as she gave birth to a baby boy at an NHS hospital. It was the latest dramatic event in what had been an extraordinary period for Johnson, several lives squashed into one almost: Brexit, Covid-19, and the unparalleled shut-down of national life. A photo taken on the stairs of Downing Street showed a grinning Johnson, back from his fiancee\u2019s bedside. He looks elated and nobody could begrudge the couple their happiness. Well-wishers noted babies change people for the better; cynics pointed out that Johnson has been a father five \u2013 or more \u2013 times before, and that this arrival might prove a distraction from the tasks ahead. In the nine months since he became PM, Johnson has frequently seemed semi-engaged. Over New Year he had a holiday in the Caribbean. In February he spent 12 days at Chevening, the government\u2019s estate in Kent, missing five Cobra meetings as Covid-19 spread from China. Reportedly he took weekends off. Former colleagues have joked Johnson prefers to do many things badly, rather than one thing well \u2013 more of a chairman than a CEO. Downing Street aides say this is wrong. They insist Johnson is devoting his full attention to the coronavirus crisis. One ministerial adviser said he was busier at the end of his time off than was admitted. He asked for submissions on a whole range of issues, not just Covid-19. His time in hospital reignited his desire to take care of the NHS, and to get back to work, the adviser said. Johnson is now determined to \u201cturn the tide\u201d on the virus by mid-June, officials suggest. In his absence ministers have argued about the right way forward. Johnson is keen to take back control of the political situation, officials stress, and is reportedly annoyed at leaks suggesting the cabinet is split between pro-economy hawks and cautious lockdown doves. So what next? Before falling sick, Johnson could be counted among those who were bullish about the prospect of easing restrictions and returning to business as usual relatively quickly. Multiple sources with knowledge of his thinking say some of that optimism has faded. They says this partly reflects his own experiences in intensive care \u2013 but also the changing scientific picture presented to him. \u201cThere has been briefing from some close to No 10 against Matt [Hancock]. But the truth is the PM\u2019s position is much closer to Matt\u2019s than those pushing for measures to be lifted. Dom [Raab] has come round to that view as well,\u201d one cabinet source said. It was Johnson, apparently, who approved the decision to add care home figures to the daily death tally \u2013 a risky move towards transparency, given the horrifying numbers involved. And then on Thursday the prime minister appeared for the first time in well over a month at the government\u2019s 5pm press conference. Again, he was breathless. And more hesitant than usual, misreading the figure for deaths. And again, he chose not to address the questions that have been asked of him personally, or his government. So far, neither he, nor anybody in his top team, has wanted to meet the challenge set them by Intisar Chowdhury, the 18-year-old son of an NHS doctor who died with coronavirus. The teenager has asked for an apology, for ministers to \u201copenly acknowledge there have been mistakes in handling this virus.\u201d At the daily briefing, Johnson stressed the allegedly good news. The UK had passed the peak of the disease. It was was on a downward slope. He promised details next week of how lockdown might end. There would be a \u201croadmap\u201d and a \u201cmenu of options\u201d. There was a warning, too. Johnson likened the pandemic to a pleasant European motoring holiday that had got into unexpected difficulty. Britain was driving through a \u201chuge Alpine tunnel\u201d. Ahead were \u201csunlight and pasture\u201d. It needed to keep control, lest it run into a \u201csecond and bigger mountain\u201d. He claimed the UK had avoided the tragedy that had engulfed other places. Asked if his time in hospital had altered him, he said he was \u201cvery, very lucky\u201d and paid tribute to the \u201cthousands of people\u201d who had been less fortunate. For the moment, Johnson\u2019s political opponents recognise he is unassailable. His popularity ratings are high. The country, polls suggest, is inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt, at least for now, while the virus is still a threat and the NHS is under great strain. The new baby will generate further goodwill. There have been gushing headlines from the pro-Boris ringwing media, with more to come when the boy is named, and the first pictures emerge. It is the perfect plotline in a time of gloom. But Johnson will not be able to put off a reckoning forever. The government\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said as much on Thursday when he suggested the country needed to focus on the crisis in hand, and not dwell \u2013 for now \u2013 on how we got here. Other leaders have emerged from the crisis with their reputations enhanced \u2013 Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand, Angela Merkel in Germany, Andrew Cuomo in New York. But they followed a different template: level with the public, admit mistakes, explain the facts. Will Johnson do likewise? There were few indications last week that Johnson is inclined to do so. So far, at least, the new Boris looks remarkably like the old one.",

      "body": "<p>Many of us, while nipping to the shop or on our daily walk, will find ourselves gazing into the dark, empty windows of pubs and restaurants, looking forward to the day when things go back to \u201cnormal\u201d. But it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that the high street of six weeks ago is gone, as businesses struggle to pay rents with no income. Even successful pubs and restaurants are already being listed for sale.</p> <p>We\u2019re now starting to get the first tentative bits of economic analysis into where all the pieces may lie when things finally start picking up. And it\u2019s very apparent that the north of England is about to hit serious economic trouble.</p> <p>Of the 20 places in Britain with the <a href=\"https://www.centrefortowns.org/reports/covid-19-and-our-towns/viewdocument\">highest proportion of employees</a> working in restaurants and pubs, 10 are in the north, and just five in the south. Indeed, research from the Royal Society of Arts this week found that chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s constituency of Richmond in North Yorkshire could <a href=\"https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/health/coronavirus/yorkshire-constituency-set-lose-more-jobs-anywhere-uk-2550221\">lose the most jobs</a>, as 35% of his constituents work in hospitality.</p> <p>Naturally, very few parts of the UK will be spared serious damage. Yet, while the wealthier regions of London and much of the south could absorb the impact of another recession, there are a lot of indications that the north simply cannot go through that again.</p> <p>Figures show the south-west is taking enormous hits in this crisis too. But the south hasn\u2019t had quite the same economic battering over the past decade \u2013 between 2009-10 and 2017-18 public spending in the north <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ca09f85c-941b-11e9-b7ea-60e35ef678d2\">dropped by \u00a33.6bn, while rising \u00a35.1bn in the south</a>.</p> <p>The reality is that whole swathes of the north have still not fully recovered from the last financial crash. When the IPPR thinktank looked into the <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/blog/the-northern-powerhouse-5-years-in\">five-year progress of the Northern Powerhouse project</a> last year, it found the number of children in poverty in the north had increased by 200,000 to 800,000, the jobs paid less than the living wage rose by 11%, and real-terms weekly pay increased by only \u00a312 in the north compared with an average national rise of \u00a319.</p> <p>So not only is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy-productivity/uk-regional-productivity-gaps-as-wide-as-in-1901-no-easy-fix-seen-report-idUSKBN1ZY1G6\">the north-south productivity gap at Victorian levels</a> thanks to decades of underinvestment and a brutal 10 years of austerity \u2013 it is actually getting worse. Northern councils are now <a href=\"https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/hull-city-council-funding-crisis-4086516\">warning of \u201calarm bells\u201d</a> over huge gaps in funding, as some are struggling to provide basic services. Most councils in Britain have already been stripped to the bone and, with no cushion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-crisis-english-councils-funding-shortfall\">some are now considering bankruptcy</a>.</p> <p>Put simply, there\u2019s nothing left to cut in the north. Another round of austerity would simply collapse many towns and cities that were already just scraping through. We have the <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/files/2019-11/sotn-2019.pdf\">developed world\u2019s biggest regional economic divide</a>, across virtually every measure. For our London-dominated politics it\u2019s a simple case of \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d.</p> <p>Governments have a history of protecting the financial centre of London and the south-east. Despite the chancellor\u2019s own constituency being hit badly, there\u2019s little indication that this time will be any different \u2013 which would be such a wasted opportunity.</p> <p>There are endless ways of investing in Britain that would support the whole of the UK and reduce the north\u2019s drag on the economy. The government could temporarily suspend the 20% VAT on food served in pubs and restaurants for the year after lockdown finishes, or remove tax on beer and wine. Just like Gordon Brown\u2019s <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-cars/uk-says-still-looking-at-car-scrappage-scheme-idUKLB6000120090411\">car scrappage scheme</a>, these measures would cost the exchequer in the short term but could keep local economies afloat, saving more in the long term.</p> <p>Or something even more substantial \u2013 a holiday voucher scheme where the government pays, say, 30% per cent, towards the cost of a trip in the UK, whether that\u2019s a weekend in a caravan in Blackpool or 10 days in a luxury eco-home in the Cotswolds. </p> <p>It\u2019s likely this government will fall back on the same regressive measures that Conservatives have traditionally used . But it\u2019s now clear that, without careful handling, the looming economic collapse in parts of the north will totally overshadow the 2008 crash and its aftermath.</p> <p>\u2022 Robyn Vinter is a journalist and editor based in Leeds, UK.

      "bodyText": "Many of us, while nipping to the shop or on our daily walk, will find ourselves gazing into the dark, empty windows of pubs and restaurants, looking forward to the day when things go back to \u201cnormal\u201d. But it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that the high street of six weeks ago is gone, as businesses struggle to pay rents with no income. Even successful pubs and restaurants are already being listed for sale. We\u2019re now starting to get the first tentative bits of economic analysis into where all the pieces may lie when things finally start picking up. And it\u2019s very apparent that the north of England is about to hit serious economic trouble. Of the 20 places in Britain with the highest proportion of employees working in restaurants and pubs, 10 are in the north, and just five in the south. Indeed, research from the Royal Society of Arts this week found that chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s constituency of Richmond in North Yorkshire could lose the most jobs, as 35% of his constituents work in hospitality. Naturally, very few parts of the UK will be spared serious damage. Yet, while the wealthier regions of London and much of the south could absorb the impact of another recession, there are a lot of indications that the north simply cannot go through that again. Figures show the south-west is taking enormous hits in this crisis too. But the south hasn\u2019t had quite the same economic battering over the past decade \u2013 between 2009-10 and 2017-18 public spending in the north dropped by \u00a33.6bn, while rising \u00a35.1bn in the south. The reality is that whole swathes of the north have still not fully recovered from the last financial crash. When the IPPR thinktank looked into the five-year progress of the Northern Powerhouse project last year, it found the number of children in poverty in the north had increased by 200,000 to 800,000, the jobs paid less than the living wage rose by 11%, and real-terms weekly pay increased by only \u00a312 in the north compared with an average national rise of \u00a319. So not only is the north-south productivity gap at Victorian levels thanks to decades of underinvestment and a brutal 10 years of austerity \u2013 it is actually getting worse. Northern councils are now warning of \u201calarm bells\u201d over huge gaps in funding, as some are struggling to provide basic services. Most councils in Britain have already been stripped to the bone and, with no cushion, some are now considering bankruptcy. Put simply, there\u2019s nothing left to cut in the north. Another round of austerity would simply collapse many towns and cities that were already just scraping through. We have the developed world\u2019s biggest regional economic divide, across virtually every measure. For our London-dominated politics it\u2019s a simple case of \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d. Governments have a history of protecting the financial centre of London and the south-east. Despite the chancellor\u2019s own constituency being hit badly, there\u2019s little indication that this time will be any different \u2013 which would be such a wasted opportunity. There are endless ways of investing in Britain that would support the whole of the UK and reduce the north\u2019s drag on the economy. The government could temporarily suspend the 20% VAT on food served in pubs and restaurants for the year after lockdown finishes, or remove tax on beer and wine. Just like Gordon Brown\u2019s car scrappage scheme, these measures would cost the exchequer in the short term but could keep local economies afloat, saving more in the long term. Or something even more substantial \u2013 a holiday voucher scheme where the government pays, say, 30% per cent, towards the cost of a trip in the UK, whether that\u2019s a weekend in a caravan in Blackpool or 10 days in a luxury eco-home in the Cotswolds. It\u2019s likely this government will fall back on the same regressive measures that Conservatives have traditionally used . But it\u2019s now clear that, without careful handling, the looming economic collapse in parts of the north will totally overshadow the 2008 crash and its aftermath. \u2022 Robyn Vinter is a journalist and editor based in Leeds, UK.

      "body": "<p>If you are a teacher looking to move between schools during the coronavirus lockdown, how can you make the most of the online education experience with your new class? This is interesting new territory for many teachers. But there are thousands and thousands of teachers and pupils already learning remotely, in virtual schools \u2013 can they offer insights?</p> <p>At a virtual school, lessons are delivered in line with each person\u2019s personalised curriculum. Exactly as you would expect in a physical school space, pupils are taught how to interact with teachers, their peers and lesson content using whiteboard technology, quizzes, voice and video as well as receiving and sending assignment tasks. How should you introduce yourself to a new class, if you are meeting them online for the first time? If we consider how teachers deliver excellent classroom teaching practice in a physical space, how they prepare should not be approached any differently in an online environment.</p> <h2>Flipped learning</h2> <p>\u201cFlipped learning\u201d is a term used to describe how teachers can provide material for pupils to learn outside of the classroom. Although this is traditionally considered homework or coursework and typically completed without the teacher, increasingly this approach to enhance learning outside of the classroom has been set and completed online. During lockdown, teachers will be focusing on core curriculum content, meeting the needs of vulnerable pupils as well as enhancing student engagement, mixing between activities, types of assignments and differentiation techniques to support a range of pupils. One factor that must be considered for teachers who are working remotely, is how they can mix online teaching and learning with traditional methods that would be used in the physical classroom. A good tip for teachers working online, especially from home, is to have a simple whiteboard behind the camera and teach just as you would in a physical classroom space. Doing this over a sustained period of time will definitely present a new challenge, but it\u2019s possible with well-thought-out curriculum plans, and a simple range of equipment.</p> <h2>Blended learning</h2> <p>Blended learning, first developed in the 1960s, was a method of instruction using technology-mediated methods. With flipped learning being the norm during lockdown, what can teachers learn from other educators who are already working in blended learning environments \u2013 teachers working in virtual schools, or online tutors?</p> <p>If we look towards Barak Rosenshine\u2019s 17 recommendations for effective teaching, these can quite easily be reapplied to online teaching, delivered through (at least) video conferencing. At the start of every lesson, review the last lesson with a simple retrieval exercise. This supports long-term retention, can easily be deployed with a simple quiz or competition and is a guaranteed way to get a lesson off to a flying start.</p> <p>When presenting new material, successful teachers teach by giving a series of short presentations using many examples. Teachers should also provide guided practice by modelling various techniques. Where teachers present too much material at once, this will confuse pupils. Working online without sufficient verbal and non-verbal cues, means it will be critical for teachers to regularly check student responses.</p> <p>One way that teachers can do this is to ask a large number of questions. Feedback can be provided by giving prompts, modelling and guiding pupils as they develop independent practice and asking simple questions such as \u201cwho, where, why and how\u201d to help shape pupils\u2019 thinking. When teachers check frequently to see if all students are learning, this processes information into long-term memory, developing schematic concepts to support retention. Teaching remotely, whether using Microsoft Teams, Google Suite or other platforms, gives teachers a significant array of strategies to deploy at this interesting time.</p> <p>Finally, research recommends that teachers should try \u201cscaffold learning\u201d, helping pupils to problem-solve by thinking out loud and providing cognitive support.

If you are meeting your pupils for the first time, I would recommend sending them a survey, asking them to complete simple questions so that you can elicit initial information about their interests, abilities and hopes. You can then start to plan which interventions you will use in your lesson planning and delivery.</p> <p>To help support increased teacher workload, my key recommendation would be that if teachers are able to connect with the pupils online, it is important to allow students to engage in a weekly and monthly review of their learning to support long-term memory. Often this manifests itself when a pupil says: \u201cWe\u2019ve done this before!\u201d But effective teachers will remind pupils that this is a retrieval practice exercise to assist with long-term retention.</p> <h2>Safeguarding and security</h2> <p>If you are joining a virtual school, then I would assume the various safeguarding procedures are already in place. However, if you now find yourself teaching pupils online for the first time, having never met them physically, you should double-check to ensure that your new school has considered data protection, child protection, internet security and the various online safeguarding procedures for teachers and pupils.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-abcs-of-recruiting-teachers-remotely/2020/may/01/how-to-conduct-a-remote-interview-seven-tips-for-schools-hiring-teachers\">How to conduct a remote interview: seven tips for schools hiring teachers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When teaching from your own home environment, it is worth reflecting on your own safeguarding procedures. For example, if you have not yet physically reached your new school, have you received any induction, or has the designated safeguarding officer spoken with you about induction procedures? Of the students in your register, which have specific learning needs that require initial conversations with your special needs coordinator or associated form tutors? All these balances and checks would be done physically on entry to a new school; just because you are doing this remotely, doesn\u2019t mean that they should not happen.</p> <h2>Creating a supportive, online environment</h2> <p>What should teachers consider when meeting their pupils online? Many schools will assign home-learning tasks through software or an online curriculum portal, which parents can access. Other schools will have their teachers and pupils log on to a secure platform, to complete assignments, submit work and interact with the teacher through voice or text. Some schools will be offering live video lessons with pupils, teaching from the home environment or from their school classrooms.</p> <p>If we look towards countries such as South Korea and Singapore, where teachers have an almost celebrity-like online presence, it\u2019s common to find them sharing videos, teaching lessons through YouTube or having millions of viewers on Instagram.</p> <p><em>If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to <a href=\"https://recruiters.theguardian.com/coronavirus-education-offer?utm_source=odpy&amp;utm_medium=dispad&amp;utm_campaign=we_support_schools&amp;CMP_TU=jbsr&amp;CMP_BUNIT=jobs\">recruiters.theguardian.com</a> and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit <a href=\"https://jobs.theguardian.com/jobs/schools/?INTCMP=gdnwb_editorial_editorial_jobs_teachers_content_\">our jobsite</a></em></p>",

Safeguarding and security If you are joining a virtual school, then I would assume the various safeguarding procedures are already in place. However, if you now find yourself teaching pupils online for the first time, having never met them physically, you should double-check to ensure that your new school has considered data protection, child protection, internet security and the various online safeguarding procedures for teachers and pupils. When teaching from your own home environment, it is worth reflecting on your own safeguarding procedures. For example, if you have not yet physically reached your new school, have you received any induction, or has the designated safeguarding officer spoken with you about induction procedures? Of the students in your register, which have specific learning needs that require initial conversations with your special needs coordinator or associated form tutors? All these balances and checks would be done physically on entry to a new school; just because you are doing this remotely, doesn\u2019t mean that they should not happen. Creating a supportive, online environment What should teachers consider when meeting their pupils online? Many schools will assign home-learning tasks through software or an online curriculum portal, which parents can access. Other schools will have their teachers and pupils log on to a secure platform, to complete assignments, submit work and interact with the teacher through voice or text. Some schools will be offering live video lessons with pupils, teaching from the home environment or from their school classrooms. If we look towards countries such as South Korea and Singapore, where teachers have an almost celebrity-like online presence, it\u2019s common to find them sharing videos, teaching lessons through YouTube or having millions of viewers on Instagram.

Under the current conditions, it\u2019s worth trying to arrange for a virtual tour of the school site \u2013 just as you would for a position that involves relocating to the other side of the country, or an international job.

A total of $28m is going to three coal mining companies, all with ties to Trump officials, bolstering a dying American industry and a fuel that scientists insist world leaders must shift away from to avoid the worst of the climate crisis. The other $22m is being paid out to oil and gas services and equipment providers and other firms that work with drillers and coal miners. Melinda Pierce, the legislative director for the Sierra Club, said: \u201cThe federal money Congress appropriated should be going to help small businesses and frontline workers struggling as a result of the pandemic, not the corporate polluters whose struggles are a result of failing business practices and existed long before Covid-19 entered the public lexicon.\u201d More than 40 Democratic lawmakers have argued that fossil fuel companies should not get any assistance under the coronavirus aid package. Some Democrats have also warned the forgivable loans being made under Congress\u2019 Paycheck Protection Program could be a transparency disaster. Banks and lending institutions are distributing the money, so the government says it cannot track recipients in real time. The loans revealed have been made public only through news reports and securities filings by publicly-traded companies, although the Federal Reserve has committed to issuing monthly reports. So far, it\u2019s clear the program is not working as intended. The funds are aimed at helping small businesses to keep paying their employees and covering other recurring expenses during the economic downturn. But they have been exploited by large companies forced to return the money amid a public outcry, including the Los Angeles Lakers, Shake Shack and Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House. The industry aid comes as the Trump administration is reportedly considering a broader bailout for oil and gas corporations, which were already under pressure before the coronavirus and have watched oil prices nosedive because of a global price war and low demand for gasoline. The US government could make loans to oil and gas companies, essentially making taxpayers investors in the industry. The Federal Reserve on Thursday also announced changes to its lending rules that could help indebted petroleum firms. \u201cThe idea that oil workers are getting a paycheck is great,\u201d said Jamie Henn, a spokesman for the Stop the Money Pipeline campaign who co-founded the environment group 350.org. \u201cThe worry is that the money\u2019s going to the top and not going to filter down.\u201d The $50m already paid to fossil fuel companies is a small fraction of the the $2.1tn Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, known as the Cares Act.

Among the coronavirus aid recipients is Hallador Coal, an Indiana-based coal mining company that hired Donald Trump\u2019s former environment chief Scott Pruitt as a lobbyist. The company\u2019s former government relations director now works at the energy department. Hallador is taking $10m to fund two months of payroll and other expenses. Coal mining company Rhino Resources, which was formerly run by Trump\u2019s Mine Safety and Health Administration head, David Zatezalo, is receiving $10m. Coal firm Ramaco Resources, whose CEO, Randy Atkins, is on the energy department\u2019s National Coal Council, is getting $8.4m. The US coal industry has been in steep decline, driven out of the market by cheap natural gas and environmental concerns. Trump campaigned on putting coal miners back to work, and his agencies have unsuccessfully explored ways to bail out coal companies, which are seeing their lowest employment levels in modern history. The Trump administration has also rescinded nearly all of the environment and climate protections the fossil fuel industry has opposed. Fossil fuel companies can also take advantage of tax benefits under the coronavirus legislation, including deferring payment of social security and medicare taxes. The Missouri-based Peabody Energy coal company has said it will speed up collecting an alternative minimum tax refund of $24m to 2020 and defer $18m of owed taxes. US taxpayers already subsidize the fossil fuel industry at roughly $20bn a year, according to conservative estimates. The Center for International Environmental Law has accused the oil, gas and plastics industries of \u201cexploiting the crisis by aggressively lobbying for massive bailouts and special privileges in a desperate attempt to revive an oil and gas industry already in decline\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Six weeks after first feeling unwell, Jenny* is still recovering from what she believes was Covid-19. </p> \n<p>On 17 March she, like many others, began preparing for an expected lockdown in the UK, stocking up on supermarket essentials. She was feeling a little flushed \u2013 something she put down to a reemergence of cold-like symptoms from a few weeks before.</p> \n<p>Then the other symptoms began, including a runny nose, sneezing and phlegm. \u201cAt that time, everybody was saying that runny noses and sneezing were not symptoms of coronavirus so I still didn\u2019t think I had it,\u201d the 33-year-old said. \u201cThen I started coughing.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the days marched on, other symptoms developed, including chest pains, shortness of breath and marks like dappled bruising on the feet \u2013 something <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/04/15/bruises-feet-sign-coronavirus-12557291/\">Spanish doctors have suggested</a> could be a sign of the disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt really was like one thing after another,\u201d Jenny said, adding that on attempting to get back to work, typing in bed, she developed muscle pains in her wrists.</p> \n<p>Her flatmate also became ill \u2013 with symptoms including a fever and loss of taste and smell. Without testing, it is impossible to be sure, but it seemed highly probable that the cause of the illness in both flatmates was Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Jenny still feels exhausted, with days of feeling better followed by setbacks. \u201cI still don\u2019t feel better because a few days ago I started shivering, like I got a chill somehow,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>She is not alone: Fiona Lowenstein, a writer in the US, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/coronavirus-recovery.html\">co-founded a group on the social media platform Slack</a> for people who have experienced Covid-19 after it took her weeks to recover from being <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/opinion/coronavirus-young-people.html\">admitted to hospital</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/opinion/coronavirus-young-people.html\"> with the disease</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"813b8139-288d-4297-9591-f6f2be6d4d7d\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dr Andy Whittamore, a GP in Portsmouth and Asthma UK\u2019s clinical lead, says that viruses are a trigger for asthma and asthma symptoms, and therefore it is fair to assume that coronavirus will act in the same way.</p>\n    <p>Health bodies around the world are listing asthma as a condition that might be considered high risk, but so far there is no evidence to suggest that having asthma increases the infection rate from the coronavirus. There is, though, some evidence that people who have asthma and catch the coronavirus are more likely to go on to have a more severe case of Covid-19. There is yet to be any data which shows how asthma impacts on the mortality rate from the coronavirus, but doctors are advising that people with the condition try to manage their asthma symptoms as best they can in case they catch the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p>Asthma is a condition of the airways, causing inflammation. It can lead to wheezing, coughing and a tight chest, and be triggered both by internal factors in the body, like levels of hormones, and external factors, like viruses, pollution and allergens. Colds and flu are considered a major trigger.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Many report waves of symptoms over a period of weeks \u2013 from heart palpitations to headaches, shortness of breath and fatigue.</p> \n<p>In a survey of group members, 89% of the 465 respondents said they had symptoms that fluctuated in intensity and frequency; 23% had tested positive for coronavirus, taking on average just over nine days to be tested from the onset to symptoms; 28% tested negative and were, on average, tested after about 15 days; and just 3.5% were admitted to hospital, although 38% visited an emergency department.</p> \n<p>With symptoms long-lasting, some members have concerns over whether they are still infectious.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf\">A report published in February by the World Health Organization</a>, based on preliminary data, suggested in mild cases, the median recovery time from Covid-19 is about two weeks from the onset of symptoms, and about three to six weeks for severe or critical cases.</p> \n<p>But while severe Covid-19 may mean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/the-road-to-recovery-for-covid-19-patients\">a long road to recovery</a>, it seems even mild cases can, for some, involve many weeks of recuperation.</p> \n<p>Alice* is still experiencing symptoms more than 50 days after first becoming ill. Based in the UK, the 51-year-old said she joined the Slack group after reading an article by Lowenstein in the New York Times, and that finding the group was a \u201cbig relief\u201d.</p> \n<p>From 11 March, Alice experienced consistent severe fatigue, chest pain and tightness, and a cough \u2013 but no fever. Other symptoms came and went in waves, including chills, insomnia and heart palpitations. \u201cDay eight, nine, 10 was just really horrible, you are just concentrating on breathing and hanging in there,\u201d she said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It is like a storm. One day you have zero symptoms \u2026 then it will just go crazy and as quickly as it hits you it can go.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>By week four she felt on the mend, and began some work and to exercise \u2013 but then relapsed. Eventually she went to A&amp;E. But despite being put in one of the hospital\u2019s \u201ccoronavirus pods\u201d, and having various investigations, she was not tested for the virus, she said.</p> \n<p>The symptoms continued to come and go, Alice said. \u201cIt is like a storm.

      "bodyText": "Six weeks after first feeling unwell, Jenny* is still recovering from what she believes was Covid-19. On 17 March she, like many others, began preparing for an expected lockdown in the UK, stocking up on supermarket essentials. She was feeling a little flushed \u2013 something she put down to a reemergence of cold-like symptoms from a few weeks before. Then the other symptoms began, including a runny nose, sneezing and phlegm. \u201cAt that time, everybody was saying that runny noses and sneezing were not symptoms of coronavirus so I still didn\u2019t think I had it,\u201d the 33-year-old said. \u201cThen I started coughing.\u201d As the days marched on, other symptoms developed, including chest pains, shortness of breath and marks like dappled bruising on the feet \u2013 something Spanish doctors have suggested could be a sign of the disease. \u201cIt really was like one thing after another,\u201d Jenny said, adding that on attempting to get back to work, typing in bed, she developed muscle pains in her wrists. Her flatmate also became ill \u2013 with symptoms including a fever and loss of taste and smell. Without testing, it is impossible to be sure, but it seemed highly probable that the cause of the illness in both flatmates was Covid-19. Jenny still feels exhausted, with days of feeling better followed by setbacks. \u201cI still don\u2019t feel better because a few days ago I started shivering, like I got a chill somehow,\u201d she said. She is not alone: Fiona Lowenstein, a writer in the US, co-founded a group on the social media platform Slack for people who have experienced Covid-19 after it took her weeks to recover from being admitted to hospital with the disease. Many report waves of symptoms over a period of weeks \u2013 from heart palpitations to headaches, shortness of breath and fatigue. In a survey of group members, 89% of the 465 respondents said they had symptoms that fluctuated in intensity and frequency; 23% had tested positive for coronavirus, taking on average just over nine days to be tested from the onset to symptoms; 28% tested negative and were, on average, tested after about 15 days; and just 3.5% were admitted to hospital, although 38% visited an emergency department. With symptoms long-lasting, some members have concerns over whether they are still infectious. A report published in February by the World Health Organization, based on preliminary data, suggested in mild cases, the median recovery time from Covid-19 is about two weeks from the onset of symptoms, and about three to six weeks for severe or critical cases. But while severe Covid-19 may mean a long road to recovery, it seems even mild cases can, for some, involve many weeks of recuperation. Alice* is still experiencing symptoms more than 50 days after first becoming ill. Based in the UK, the 51-year-old said she joined the Slack group after reading an article by Lowenstein in the New York Times, and that finding the group was a \u201cbig relief\u201d. From 11 March, Alice experienced consistent severe fatigue, chest pain and tightness, and a cough \u2013 but no fever. Other symptoms came and went in waves, including chills, insomnia and heart palpitations. \u201cDay eight, nine, 10 was just really horrible, you are just concentrating on breathing and hanging in there,\u201d she said. By week four she felt on the mend, and began some work and to exercise \u2013 but then relapsed. Eventually she went to A&amp;E. But despite being put in one of the hospital\u2019s \u201ccoronavirus pods\u201d, and having various investigations, she was not tested for the virus, she said. The symptoms continued to come and go, Alice said. \u201cIt is like a storm. One day you can have zero symptoms \u2026 then it will just go crazy and as quickly as it hits you it can go.\u201d Lauren Nichols, 32, from Boston, Massachusetts, is another member of the Slack group. She has tested positive for Covid-19 twice and still has symptoms more than 50 days after first feeling unwell. She said the experience was a rollercoaster of symptoms and severities. \u201cMy biggest concern is that there is little visibility into the reality of what recovery truly looks like, as recovery from a medical perspective simply means that the patient \u2018did not die\u2019 and simply does not capture the lingering and painful symptoms that the Covid-19 recovery road truly entails for some or many,\u201d Nichols said, adding that some of her most alarming symptoms occurred in her third and fifth weeks of being unwell. \u201cI am concerned that employers and governments are rushing the recoveries of thousands who are still in pain and still symptomatic, without understanding that this causes both mental and physical complications for people already in a very vulnerable and unwell state of being,\u201d she said, adding that she was also concerned about the lack of support for those recovering. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said it was perhaps not surprising that some people had long recoveries. \u201cMany people often take weeks to completely recover from pneumonia,\u201d he said. \u201cIn these cases, the viral illness has typically long since subsided and thus it is unlikely the patient will be infectious.\u201d But it is unclear why some take longer than others to recover. \u201cWe know that recovery time after pneumonia is often influenced by the presence of co-morbidities and by age of the patient,\u201d said Head. \u201cAlongside that, many people will have undiagnosed co-morbidities, such as diabetes, also influencing how ill a patient becomes, and their recovery time.\u201d The Slack group survey found two-thirds of respondents had a pre-existing medical condition, mainly seasonal allergies or asthma. Why there should be such variation in recovery time remains unknown, but a genetic element may play a part, said Dr James Gill, an honorary clinical lecturer at the University of Warwick and a locum GP. Preliminary work from King\u2019s College London has suggested that genetic factors could account for about half of the variation in a number of key symptoms of Covid-19. Gill said he was only seeing about two to three patients a week with long-lasting symptoms, suggesting the experience is not common, although he noted that without community-level testing to know who had had the virus, it would remain unclear how common a recovery path was. But Gill said data from the Sars outbreak revealed that almost a third of those who had had that particular coronavirus still had a reduced tolerance to exercise many months later, despite having normal lung function. While Gill stressed that Covid-19 was a different disease, he said it could be that a similar proportion of about a fifth or a third of those with Covid-19 had lengthy recovery time . Although symptoms may linger, it is thought an individual is unlikely to be infectious once three days have passed with no raised temperature, but coughing should be treated with caution, Gill said. What recovery looks like is an evolving picture, he continued. \u201cWe are learning on a daily, weekly basis, things about how people are recovering from this, and we can\u2019t know about the long-term impacts until we are in the long term.\u201d Prof David Heymann, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, agreed with Gill. \u201cWhenever a new virus that has come from the animal kingdom is identified in humans there is great concern about what is not known because humans do not have previous experience with this virus and the immune response it will cause,\u201d Heymann said. \u201cThe only way to completely understand is by observation over the long term \u2013 and this includes recovery time from infection.\u201d With suggestions that some cases of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) may arise after illnesses including viral infections, Gill said concern was starting to mount. \u201cThere are a lot of people wondering whether or not we are going to see an uptick in cases of chronic fatigue going forwards as a result [of Covid-19],\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that, but it is something that we are thinking may be possible.\u201d Carmine Pariante, a professor of biological psychiatry at King\u2019s College London, agreed there could be a rise in people experiencing a CFS-like syndrome. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if this is going to happen with Covid-19 because we don\u2019t have the follow-up data,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the picture unfortunately, both in terms of the biochemical picture [of the immune response] and the acute fatigue, which is very prevalent, make us think it will be possible.\u201d Gill said it was important that those who had had a coronavirus infection or suspected Covid-19, had access to physiotherapists and nutritional advice.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to this week\u2019s roundup of developments in the coronavirus pandemic, as scientists continue to work on vaccine trials and the role of face masks for the public continues to be debated. In the US, President Donald Trump continues to cause consternation among scientists Trump, who previously shocked experts by suggesting injecting people with disinfectant could cure Covid-19 \u2013 a dangerous idea that scientists and doctors were quick to debunk \u2013 has now claimed to have seen \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d that Covid-19 originated in Wuhan lab, contradicting his own government experts. Once again, the scientific community has swiftly rebutted Trump\u2019s assertions. Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: \u201cWe have good evidence from the genomics research that the virus is not manmade, and the scientific world has very much moved on from this idea. It is unhelpful for high-profile individuals to repeat the debunked conspiracy theories, as it undermines the public health response\u201d. There is cautious optimism around an experimental coronavirus drug There are signs the antiviral medicine remdesivir \u2013 which has previously been used in Ebola patients \u2013 may be a useful tool in helping those with Covid-19. While it is not a \u201ccure\u201d, a new trial has suggested it can reduce the recovery time of those seriously ill with the disease. Early results from an international trial of 1,000 participants reveal the drug cut recovery time from a median of 15 days to 11 and was also linked to a better chance of survival. The findings come after results from a smaller trial among patients in China, that was cut short, initially suggested the drug had little effect. \u201cWhat it has proven is that a drug can block this virus,\u201d said Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government\u2019s top infectious disease expert. However experts have warned the drug is unlikely to be available widely in the UK any time soon, as it is very difficult to obtain, while they say the trial\u2019s data must also be rigorously analysed and licensing approved.

      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"https://campwell.co.uk/\">Campwell</a> opened for the first time on 14 February, the outlook was bright \u2013 despite the horrendous weather. The woodland eco-site near Bath may have been lashed by storm Dennis but it was full that first weekend and forward bookings were \u201cfantastic\u201d\u2019 according to owner Tim Bowles: \u201cIt was really positive \u2013 we were already beyond our targets in terms of bookings and thinking we might even make a profit.\u201d</p> <p>Just over a month later, the UK went into lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic and, like every other tourism business in the country, Bowles shut up shop. The outlook for his inaugural season went from bright to bleak. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been an ideal start,\u201d Bowles said, although he admits he\u2019s more fortunate than some. His landlord is a friend who is flexible about rent and two supervisors he employs have other work they can fall back on. But even without the pressure of meeting those costs, Bowles says it\u2019s impossible for him to refund all his customers without putting the fledging business at risk. \u201cMost customers have been very accommodating and agreed to reschedule. We have refunded some people, but if we refunded everyone we would be on our knees.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk on social media about how evil businesses are for not giving a refund, but it\u2019s important to remember that these are small business that are dependent on these bookings \u2013 we are a very seasonal business and half our season has already been erased,\u201d added Bowles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d16d563eb147907e80f04c29505603000bd0c5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d16d563eb147907e80f04c29505603000bd0c5d/0_315_708_424/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Bowles (on the right) on the opening weekend of his Campwell eco-site.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Bowles (on the right) on the opening weekend of his Campwell eco-site in February</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He says he \u201cappreciates other people are going through financial difficulty too,\u201d but the timing of the crisis, coming at the beginning of the season, has been \u201cbrutal.\u201d Unlike Airbnb, which announced full refunds or credits for guests who booked before 14 March (for stays up to 31 May) \u2013 a decision that hit individual owners hard \u2013 few small independent businesses have cash reserves to fall back on. In the first few months of the year, owners often use deposits to refurbish accommodation ready for the new season, so most have little money in the bank, and some are in debt. Easter bookings are relied on to inject some cash into the business.</p> <p>Mary and Nate Sparrow, owners of <a href=\"https://www.hippersons.co.uk/\">Hippersons </a><a href=\"https://www.hippersons.co.uk/\">Boatyard</a>, a collection of four houseboats and a glamping pod in Suffolk, invested in a second pod this year to increase capacity for the 2020 season, leaving them with no financial cushion. \u201cPeople think we have loads of money behind us but we don\u2019t. We are now trying to plan ahead financially and considering cashing in our pensions.\u201d</p> <p>This year, Alistair Handyside, owner of <a href=\"https://www.higherwiscombe.com/\">Higher Wiscombe</a> in south-east Devon, a collection of three cottages, invested \u00a3200,000 in the largest one. \u201cOne week later, we went into lockdown and the business stopped dead,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 15 years of running a business, we\u2019ve had three cancellations. On 23 March, we had 16, so this is on a scale that is unprecedented.\u201d</p> <p>Handyside has already lost \u00a380,000 in deferred business; if he is unable to accommodate guests in July and August that will rise to \u00a3140,000. \u201cGood businesses do not want to see customers missing out. If customers are being offered a full-value credit at a reasonable time \u2013 in other words, a fair swap, that is helping that business survive on really thin wages,\u201d said Handyside, who is also chair of the Professional Association of Self-Caterers (Pasc).</p> <p>In a survey of 900 accommodation owners in the south-west conducted by Pasc and the South West Tourism Alliance, 80% said they would collapse if they had no income through this summer, despite some of them receiving a grant of \u00a310,000 and the prospect of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/sunak-backs-down-and-offers-small-firms-100-loan-guarantees\">government-backed rescue loans.</a></p> <p>For Handyside, the biggest frustration has been the failure of insurers to pay out. \u201cMost owners have business interruption insurance, but insurers are refusing coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to be one of the big scandals of Covid-19.\u201d The problem is being compounded by the failure of guests\u2019 holiday insurance. Many holidaymakers are being told it\u2019s up to their accommodation provider to compensate them, so holiday-home owners are becoming the \u201cinsurer of last resort\u201d.</p> <p>The \u201cinsurance scandal\u201d, as Handyside puts it, has left small businesses between a rock and a hard place. Many rely on repeat business from customers for the majority of bookings and do not want to jeopardise that loyalty but simply do not have the funds to refund everyone.</p> <p>Handyside said he is fortunate that his business is year-round, so there is a possibility of some recovery later in 2020, but seasonal businesses have already seen half their year wiped out.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute nightmare,\u201d said Jacqueline Saggers who, with her husband, runs <a href=\"https://www.guildengate.co.uk/\">Guilden Gate</a>, a smallholding in Hertfordshire with two glampsites.

      "bodyText": "When Campwell opened for the first time on 14 February, the outlook was bright \u2013 despite the horrendous weather. The woodland eco-site near Bath may have been lashed by storm Dennis but it was full that first weekend and forward bookings were \u201cfantastic\u201d\u2019 according to owner Tim Bowles: \u201cIt was really positive \u2013 we were already beyond our targets in terms of bookings and thinking we might even make a profit.\u201d Just over a month later, the UK went into lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic and, like every other tourism business in the country, Bowles shut up shop. The outlook for his inaugural season went from bright to bleak. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been an ideal start,\u201d Bowles said, although he admits he\u2019s more fortunate than some. His landlord is a friend who is flexible about rent and two supervisors he employs have other work they can fall back on. But even without the pressure of meeting those costs, Bowles says it\u2019s impossible for him to refund all his customers without putting the fledging business at risk. \u201cMost customers have been very accommodating and agreed to reschedule. We have refunded some people, but if we refunded everyone we would be on our knees.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk on social media about how evil businesses are for not giving a refund, but it\u2019s important to remember that these are small business that are dependent on these bookings \u2013 we are a very seasonal business and half our season has already been erased,\u201d added Bowles. He says he \u201cappreciates other people are going through financial difficulty too,\u201d but the timing of the crisis, coming at the beginning of the season, has been \u201cbrutal.\u201d Unlike Airbnb, which announced full refunds or credits for guests who booked before 14 March (for stays up to 31 May) \u2013 a decision that hit individual owners hard \u2013 few small independent businesses have cash reserves to fall back on. In the first few months of the year, owners often use deposits to refurbish accommodation ready for the new season, so most have little money in the bank, and some are in debt. Easter bookings are relied on to inject some cash into the business. Mary and Nate Sparrow, owners of Hippersons Boatyard, a collection of four houseboats and a glamping pod in Suffolk, invested in a second pod this year to increase capacity for the 2020 season, leaving them with no financial cushion. \u201cPeople think we have loads of money behind us but we don\u2019t. We are now trying to plan ahead financially and considering cashing in our pensions.\u201d This year, Alistair Handyside, owner of Higher Wiscombe in south-east Devon, a collection of three cottages, invested \u00a3200,000 in the largest one. \u201cOne week later, we went into lockdown and the business stopped dead,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 15 years of running a business, we\u2019ve had three cancellations. On 23 March, we had 16, so this is on a scale that is unprecedented.\u201d Handyside has already lost \u00a380,000 in deferred business; if he is unable to accommodate guests in July and August that will rise to \u00a3140,000. \u201cGood businesses do not want to see customers missing out. If customers are being offered a full-value credit at a reasonable time \u2013 in other words, a fair swap, that is helping that business survive on really thin wages,\u201d said Handyside, who is also chair of the Professional Association of Self-Caterers (Pasc). In a survey of 900 accommodation owners in the south-west conducted by Pasc and the South West Tourism Alliance, 80% said they would collapse if they had no income through this summer, despite some of them receiving a grant of \u00a310,000 and the prospect of government-backed rescue loans. For Handyside, the biggest frustration has been the failure of insurers to pay out. \u201cMost owners have business interruption insurance, but insurers are refusing coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to be one of the big scandals of Covid-19.\u201d The problem is being compounded by the failure of guests\u2019 holiday insurance. Many holidaymakers are being told it\u2019s up to their accommodation provider to compensate them, so holiday-home owners are becoming the \u201cinsurer of last resort\u201d. The \u201cinsurance scandal\u201d, as Handyside puts it, has left small businesses between a rock and a hard place. Many rely on repeat business from customers for the majority of bookings and do not want to jeopardise that loyalty but simply do not have the funds to refund everyone. Handyside said he is fortunate that his business is year-round, so there is a possibility of some recovery later in 2020, but seasonal businesses have already seen half their year wiped out. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute nightmare,\u201d said Jacqueline Saggers who, with her husband, runs Guilden Gate, a smallholding in Hertfordshire with two glampsites. They have refused all refunds: \u201cNot because we are being difficult but because we are a small family business and would go under if we did, and that doesn\u2019t help anyone.\u201d With only two sites, a VW van and a Hobbit-style shelter, she hasn\u2019t even been able to give all guests the alternative dates they want because that would mean even more loss of income: \u201cIf we took everyone who\u2019s cancelled and put them in July and August, we would have no income.

New lending fell by \u00a35.4bn over the month, resulting in the highest level of repayments recorded by the Bank since it started tracking the figures in 1987.</p> \n<p>Credit card spending was down by 0.3% year-on-year \u2013 the first time the Bank has recorded an annual drop.</p> \n<p>The fall is likely to be a reflection of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/cbi-report-reveals-uk-retailers-hit-by-covid-19-consumer-spending-collapse\">huge fall in consumer spending</a> since physical distancing measures were introduced and households began to avoid shopping and leisure activities, rather than a sign that households are actively clearing debt. Deposits held in bank accounts leapt by \u00a313.1bn, despite falling interest rates.</p> \n<p>The Bank also noted a \u00a31.3bn fall in repayments during the month, which could be a result of payment holidays being offered by banks and credit card providers to those who incomes have reduced by the crisis.</p> \n<p>Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Economics, said the figures showed \u201cthat private-sector demand for cash surged in March, as businesses and households battened down the hatches.</p> \n<p>\u201cData for April will provide a clear steer on whether businesses are collapsing, though March\u2019s figures are tentatively encouraging.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Bank also reported a drop in the number of mortgages approved by lenders, with loans for both purchases and remortgages falling in March.</p> \n<p>The number of house purchase loans fell by 24% to 56,200 \u2013 the lowest level for seven years, while the number of remortgages was its lowest since August 2016, at 42,600.</p> \n<p>In February, house purchase loans had hit a seven-year high and the market appeared to be geared for a year of rising activity and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/19/house-prices-rise-in-every-region-of-uk-for-first-time-in-two-years\">prices</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email sign-up\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>But it was, in effect, suspended in late March after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/housing-market-frozen-by-government-during-coronavirus-lockdown\">ministers told would-be movers to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/housing-market-frozen-by-government-during-coronavirus-lockdown\"> delay their moves</a> where possible.

      "bodyText": "UK businesses borrowed record sums in March, while consumers cleared \u00a33.8bn of debt, according to figures from the Bank of England that show firms and individuals \u201cbattened down the hatches\u201d as the coronavirus crisis hit. The Bank said \u00a334.1bn of loans had been advanced to firms during the month, the highest figure since records began in 1998. The figures include new lending made under the government\u2019s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme and the Bank\u2019s term funding scheme, put in place to support businesses during the crisis. The annual rate of growth in borrowing by UK businesses rose to 8.2%, and within this borrowing by large businesses rose sharply, to 11.8%. Deposits held by businesses rose by \u00a334bn over the same period, and the Bank said changes in deposits and loans correlated closely across industries. Meanwhile, new borrowing on credit cards and loans plummeted. New lending fell by \u00a35.4bn over the month, resulting in the highest level of repayments recorded by the Bank since it started tracking the figures in 1987. Credit card spending was down by 0.3% year-on-year \u2013 the first time the Bank has recorded an annual drop. The fall is likely to be a reflection of the huge fall in consumer spending since physical distancing measures were introduced and households began to avoid shopping and leisure activities, rather than a sign that households are actively clearing debt. Deposits held in bank accounts leapt by \u00a313.1bn, despite falling interest rates. The Bank also noted a \u00a31.3bn fall in repayments during the month, which could be a result of payment holidays being offered by banks and credit card providers to those who incomes have reduced by the crisis. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Economics, said the figures showed \u201cthat private-sector demand for cash surged in March, as businesses and households battened down the hatches. \u201cData for April will provide a clear steer on whether businesses are collapsing, though March\u2019s figures are tentatively encouraging.\u201d The Bank also reported a drop in the number of mortgages approved by lenders, with loans for both purchases and remortgages falling in March. The number of house purchase loans fell by 24% to 56,200 \u2013 the lowest level for seven years, while the number of remortgages was its lowest since August 2016, at 42,600. In February, house purchase loans had hit a seven-year high and the market appeared to be geared for a year of rising activity and prices. But it was, in effect, suspended in late March after ministers told would-be movers to delay their moves where possible. An estimated 373,000 sales are on hold. The UK\u2019s biggest building society, Nationwide, said on Friday the housing market was \u201cgrinding to a halt\u201d and warned it might not be able to produce its regular house price index over the coming months if there were too few transactions. The lender reported a 0.7% increase in UK house prices in April, but said that 80% of the deals in its sample related to mortgage applications that started before the lockdown, and before the full extent of the impact of the pandemic became clear. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said the medium-term outlook for the housing market was \u201chighly uncertain\u201d, with much depending on the performance of the wider economy. \u201cEconomic activity is set to contract significantly in the near term as a direct result of the necessary measures adopted to suppress the spread of the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the raft of policies adopted to support the economy, including to protect businesses and jobs, to support peoples\u2019 incomes and keep borrowing costs down, should set the stage for a rebound once the shock passes, and help limit long-term damage to the economy.\u201d Hansen Lu, a property economist at Capital Economics, said the rise in house prices would not last, and predicted a 4% drop over the year. \u201cHouse prices are sticky \u2013 buyers may be seeking discounts in light of uncertainty and the economic hit from the pandemic, but owners won\u2019t accept unless forced to by worsening economic circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cThis suggests that while house prices may appear resilient in the short term, as the economic hit from the pandemic continues, some owners will be forced to accept price cuts eventually.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It is easy to see why it could be thrilling fiction for our times: it has a mysterious and fatal virus, an epidemiologist hero, a desperate search for a vaccine and murky political skullduggery. It also features a green monkey. But whether it is the moment for Stanley Johnson, the father of Boris Johnson, to be pushing his 40-year-old novel for a new release is another question. Nonetheless, British publishers have been invited to consider reissuing Johnson senior\u2019s 1982 thriller The Marburg Virus, the Guardian has learned. His agent is so convinced of his ability to effectively publicise a reissue that his pitch describes him as \u201ca tireless self-promoter\u201d. Long out of print, the book is based on a real disease outbreak in Germany in the late 1960s. Johnson denied being opportunistic in wanting his novel to be made available again. \u201cI\u2019m a professional writer,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it opportunistic for journalists and newspapers to be writing about the coronavirus?\u201d He pointed to his previous thrillers which have also tackled contemporary issues, including his latest book Kompromat, which tells a story of devious Russian influence on western politics. Johnson said his novel had a prescience, in that the plot was driven by the desperate need to find a vaccine. \u201cI don\u2019t think the novel is far fetched because look at what is happening now,\u201d he said. The novel is a pacy environmental and medical adventure story involving illegal animal traders, corrupt pharmaceutical company bosses, the KGB and a US president desperate to come out on top. In Johnson\u2019s story, the equivalent of Wuhan is New York, the virus breaks out at the Bronx zoo. Soon the rest of the world bans planes travelling from the US. The main characters are involved in a desperate attempt to track down a rare breed of green monkey, which was the source of the virus. Some subplots are more improbable than others. One involves the Brazilian head of the World Health Organization and his deputy, a sinister, monocle-wearing Russian with an upper-class English accent, travelling to the Congo to personally oversee the destruction of monkeys responsible for the virus \u2026 or so they thought. Johnson said there were lessons to be learned from his story because he thought more effort should be being made today to tracking down the source of the current pandemic. \u201cInstead of focusing on the Wuhan \u2018wet\u2019 market, I think people should be looking for some release of the virus via an animal being used in the secretive Wuhan research laboratory,\u201d he said, in remarks echoing Donald Trump\u2019s so far unsubstantiated claim to have seen evidence that the virus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. \u201cThen of course the race will begin to find where the animal or batch of animals came from so that a world-saving vaccine can be developed in record time.\u201d The pitch to UK publishers by Johnson\u2019s literary agent, Jonathan Lloyd of Curtis Brown, urges publishers to purchase what he describes as \u201can unnervingly prophetic, intelligent thriller\u201d. It continues: \u201cWhen a young woman in New York City dies mysteriously after a trip to Europe, top epidemiologist Lowell Kaplan identifies the cause of death as the Marburg virus \u2013 a fatal strain that has surfaced only once before in history. \u201cDetermined to trace the source of the disease, Kaplan follows a trail of intrigue from the labs of Germany to the jungles of central Africa.\u201d Lloyd is \u201clooking for a publisher who can capitalise on the wonderful opportunity Stanley\u2019s profile presents and make this urgent, exhilarating novel quickly available to his wide audience, at a time when it feels eerily prescient\u201d, he writes. The pitch describes Johnson as \u201can excellent, tireless self-promoter\u201d and it hopes publishers \u201ccan agree that this is an exciting opportunity to have this book back in print again (firstly as an e book)\u201d. The book was published in the US in 2015 with the title The Virus but it remains to be seen whether UK publishers will bite. Johnson said Amazon was charging \u00a357 for the paperback edition. \u201cAll the more reason to produce a new version now,\u201d he said. \u201cI do hope it happens \u2026 I had such fun writing it.\u201d Reviews of the novel are sparse and mixed. On Goodreads coverage ranges from praise for its \u201cbreakneck action\u201d to a less glowing response: \u201cMade it about a third of the way through this before I got too annoyed with its stupidity and quit.\u201d But another reader on the site noted the book\u2019s possible prescience in 2015: \u201cThe scariest thing is, because we live in a scary world, I can totally envision every bit of it happening.\u201d They also said they had received a copy directly from the author. \u2018They made love in a brass four-poster bed\u2019: extracts from The Marburg Virus Doctor Lowell Kaplan, Head of the Bureau of Epidemiology at the National Center for Disease Control at Atlanta, Georgia, was on the telephone to Japan. He sounded worried. He was worried. He pushed back a lock of thick greying hair which had fallen over his forehead and hunched forward as he spoke, the suppressed energy visible in every line of his body. \u201cOkay,\u201d he shouted into the phone. \u201cIt differs from A-Brazil, but does it have pandemic potential? That\u2019s the question.\u201d She pleaded with him. \u201cLowell, don\u2019t go. Not now. I need you tonight.\u201d They made love in a brass four-poster bed which Stephanie had bought in an antique shop off Les Halles when she first came to Paris. Kaplan stayed the night. They had breakfast in bed. Then, pushing the tray aside, they made love again. There was none of the urgency there had been the previous evening. It was though a dam had burst on a river. Now, after a temporary turbulence, the water was flowing smoothly again.\u201d The President\u2019s reaction, once he was informed of the crisis, was immediate. \u201cWhy in God\u2019s name don\u2019t we have a vaccine? You people\u201d \u2013 he was addressing an emergency meeting of Federal and state health officials \u2013 \u201chave a vaccine for polio and flu and whooping cough and even the goddam common cold. So why haven\u2019t you got a vaccine for Marburg if it\u2019s the deadliest disease known to man?\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s difficult to imagine that Britain was, until very recently, regarded as a leader in preparing for pandemics. Countries such as Singapore once looked to the UK for lessons in how to prepare for and respond to outbreaks. Now, it\u2019s the other way around. With its number of coronavirus cases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-uk-how-many-confirmed-cases-are-there-in-my-area\">exceeding 170,000</a>, and deaths set to climb above 40,000, the UK appears to be playing catch-up with the rest of the world.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s failure to shatter the coronavirus curve couldn\u2019t be further out of step with its past reputation as a leader in this area. The UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130105191920/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_088702\">global health strategy</a>, launched under New Labour in 2008, was a game-changer in the field of global health. The strategy identified how, in an interconnected world, an infectious outbreak in another country was a direct threat to the UK. By building health capacity elsewhere in the world, the government recognised that it could protect its own borders from infectious outbreaks \u2013 reflecting the Blairite logic that interventions abroad would bolster security at home.</p> <p>Over the past two decades, the<strong> </strong>UK has been a trailblazer in funding global health. It\u2019s one of the only countries to have <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn03714/\">0.7% of GDP earmarked</a> for overseas development assistance. Public Health England has a global team advising countries across the globe in building capacity to respond to disease, while the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres-projects-groups/uk-phrst\">public health rapid support team</a> is frequently deployed around the world to support countries\u2019 response efforts to emerging pathogens. During the Ebola crisis in 2014, for example, the government deployed PHE <a href=\"https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2015/02/03/feature-phes-ebola-response-the-people-behind-the-scenes/\">epidemiologists</a> to work with Sierra Leone\u2019s health ministry, while the Ministry of Defence sent troops to build treatment centres and NHS staff <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/blog/volunteer-ebola-j-cummings/\">volunteered</a> as healthcare workers. Meanwhile DfID supported clinical trials of <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/ebola-vaccine-shows-promising-results\">vaccines</a>, in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2016/final_trial_results_ebola_high_protection.html\">UK universities</a>.</p> <p>Of course, the UK\u2019s interests in this field were never just about health. Its 2008 strategy was criticised at the time <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3680218/\">for self-interest</a> \u2013 pursuing health policies abroad primarily as a means of protecting the UK from infection,<strong> </strong>and as a trade opportunity to commodify NHS expertise on the international market. In the febrile political climate that followed 9/11, the threat of an attack \u2013 whether in the form of a virus or a terrorist group \u2013 loomed large in governments\u2019 imaginations. The UK government saw policies to combat infectious diseases as an extension of this security mindset \u2013 in turn shaping how politicians came to view pandemics.</p> <p>This fear of existential risks forged the UK\u2019s global health strategy, but it also helps explain why we found ourselves on the back foot when coronavirus hit. By the time Covid-19 arrived, the memory of such dangers taking place at home had faded; outbreaks seemed like things that happened elsewhere in the world. The last major outbreaks to affect the UK were BSE in the early 1990s and the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in 2001. While these both posed significantly less of a risk to human mortality than Covid-19, they contributed to widespread disruptions and substantial economic losses for farmers. By the time the last foot-and-mouth case had been recorded, in Cumbria, more than <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35581830\">six million cattle, pigs and sheep</a> had been slaughtered. Yet in the years that followed these crises, successive governments became complacent \u2013 believing they could get away without funding preparedness, as outbreaks were unlikely to happen within their election cycle, if at all.</p> <p>This complacency was amplified by austerity policies. The NHS has endured the most <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/articles/does-nhs-need-more-money\">prolonged funding squeeze</a> in its history, which has meant that surge capacity in PPE, ventilators and ICU beds was not purchased, even when Operation Cygnus identified these areas as shortcomings in 2016. Meanwhile the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/ending-the-blame-game\">cuts to</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/ending-the-blame-game\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/ending-the-blame-game\">investment</a> in public health areas such as <a href=\"https://archive.bma.org.uk/collective-voice/policy-and-research/public-and-population-health/public-health-budgets\">smoking, alcohol and obesity</a> have contributed to a rise in entirely preventable chronic conditions, which are now proving significant risk factors for coronavirus.</p> <p>One of the few existential dilemmas the UK has faced over the last decade is Brexit. Somewhat paradoxically, in prioritising Brexit, government ministers dealt another blow to the UK\u2019s preparedness for a threat whose consequences would be deadly.<strong> </strong>Training for key workers to manage a pandemic was stalled<strong> </strong>to make space for <a href=\"https://archive.is/20200418182037/https:/www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/coronavirus-38-days-when-britain-sleepwalked-into-disaster-hq3b9tlgh\">contingency plans around no-deal Brexit</a>, while the UK missed opportunities for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/uk-missed-three-chances-to-join-eu-scheme-to-bulk-buy-ppe\">EU-level purchasing</a> of PPE, and parliamentary enquiries into preparedness for infectious disease were delayed and <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/inquiries/parliament-2017/biosecurity-human-health-inquiry-17-19/\">eventually halted</a> due to the 2019 election.</p> <p>Early in the pandemic, the UK made the significant \u2013 and potentially fatal \u2013 decision to ignore the advice of the WHO, an institution for which the UK is still a top <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/uk-to-continue-funding-who-saying-global-unity-essential-to-beat-covid-19\">government funder</a>, which recommended a strategy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/who-urges-countries-to-track-and-trace-every-covid-19-case\">testing, isolating and contact tracing</a>. This early move now seems like a grave mistake. Jenny Harries, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/england-coronavirus-testing-has-not-risen-fast-enough-science-chief\">stated that the UK</a> didn\u2019t need to follow WHO advice \u2013 \u201cThe clue with the WHO is in its title \u2013 it\u2019s a World Health Organization, and it is addressing all countries across the world,\u201d she said at the time.</p> <p>But the assumption that WHO guidelines didn\u2019t apply to us exposed a remarkable hubris in the UK government\u2019s approach to coronavirus. We were no better prepared than the rest of the world. Indeed, we were worse prepared than countries that once looked to us for lessons. On matters of pandemic preparedness, why would any government seek the UK\u2019s advice again?</p> <p>\u2022 Clare Wenham is assistant professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics</p> <p><br></p>",

While these both posed significantly less of a risk to human mortality than Covid-19, they contributed to widespread disruptions and substantial economic losses for farmers. By the time the last foot-and-mouth case had been recorded, in Cumbria, more than six million cattle, pigs and sheep had been slaughtered. Yet in the years that followed these crises, successive governments became complacent \u2013 believing they could get away without funding preparedness, as outbreaks were unlikely to happen within their election cycle, if at all. This complacency was amplified by austerity policies. The NHS has endured the most prolonged funding squeeze in its history, which has meant that surge capacity in PPE, ventilators and ICU beds was not purchased, even when Operation Cygnus identified these areas as shortcomings in 2016. Meanwhile the UK\u2019s cuts to investment in public health areas such as smoking, alcohol and obesity have contributed to a rise in entirely preventable chronic conditions, which are now proving significant risk factors for coronavirus. One of the few existential dilemmas the UK has faced over the last decade is Brexit. Somewhat paradoxically, in prioritising Brexit, government ministers dealt another blow to the UK\u2019s preparedness for a threat whose consequences would be deadly. Training for key workers to manage a pandemic was stalled to make space for contingency plans around no-deal Brexit, while the UK missed opportunities for EU-level purchasing of PPE, and parliamentary enquiries into preparedness for infectious disease were delayed and eventually halted due to the 2019 election. Early in the pandemic, the UK made the significant \u2013 and potentially fatal \u2013 decision to ignore the advice of the WHO, an institution for which the UK is still a top government funder, which recommended a strategy of testing, isolating and contact tracing. This early move now seems like a grave mistake. Jenny Harries, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, stated that the UK didn\u2019t need to follow WHO advice \u2013 \u201cThe clue with the WHO is in its title \u2013 it\u2019s a World Health Organization, and it is addressing all countries across the world,\u201d she said at the time. But the assumption that WHO guidelines didn\u2019t apply to us exposed a remarkable hubris in the UK government\u2019s approach to coronavirus. We were no better prepared than the rest of the world. Indeed, we were worse prepared than countries that once looked to us for lessons. On matters of pandemic preparedness, why would any government seek the UK\u2019s advice again? \u2022 Clare Wenham is assistant professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics",

      "bodyText": "Cities around the world are already planning for life after Covid-19, with a series of environmental initiatives being rolled out from Bogot\u00e1 to Barcelona to ensure public safety and bolster the fight against climate breakdown. Mayors from cities in Europe, the US and Africa held talks this week to coordinate their efforts to support a low-carbon, sustainable recovery from the crisis as national governments begin to implement huge economic stimulus packages. Many cities have already announced measures, from hundreds of miles of new bike lanes in Milan and Mexico City to widening pavements and pedestrianising neighbourhoods in New York and Seattle. The initiatives are designed to allow people to move around urban spaces safely in a world where physical distancing will be the norm for the foreseeable future \u2013 and do so without sparking a drastic increase in air pollution. The mayors who took part in the newly formed economic taskforce this week believe these initial schemes point the way to more radical long-term measures that will help tackle inequality and the climate crisis. The mayor of Milan, who is heading the taskforce run by the C40 group of cities, said: \u201cOur immediate priority is to protect the health of our residents and overcome the Covid-19 pandemic.

Establish safe cycle routes to and from work for key workers, especially hospital staff, by closing roads and carriageways where necessary so people have a safe alternative to private cars and public transport. Create safe walking and cycling routes to and from schools, and close down streets around schools to motor vehicles at drop-off and pickup times. Use libraries, schools and sports stadiums to distribute nutritious, sustainably produced food to communities that need it most, and scale up food waste collection and treatment, including distributing household composting kits and guidance. Retrofit all public buildings, many of which are empty now, drastically improving energy efficiency and creating thousands of green jobs.

      "bodyText": "Even as world leaders gradually consider easing the lockdowns imposed on major economies, the economic consequences of the pandemic are barely started. The airline industry today illustrated that there could be much more pain ahead. Irish budget airline Ryanair said it would cut 3,000 jobs, Aer Lingus is reportedly considering cutting 900 jobs, while Heathrow Airport warned that mass redundancies could also be on the cards. Here are some of the other major developments from today: US stock markets fell after Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on China in retaliation for its role in the coronavirus crisis, citing an unproven theory on its origin. Royal Bank of Scotland took an \u00a3800m profit hit because of the pandemic\u2019s economic effects - and it also ended a short-lived experiment to create an app-based bank to rival the likes of Monzo. British households repaid \u00a33.8bn of consumer credit, including \u00a32.4bn on credit cards and \u00a31.4bn on car finance and other personal loans, during March - the largest since records began in 1987 and a sign of the massive drop in consumption prompted by the pandemic. ExxonMobil, the US supermajor oil producer, took a $3bn charge in the first quarter as the coronavirus outbreak pushed it to a $610m loss - its first loss in three decades.

JJ The woes of the US manufacturing sector were laid bare by a PMI reading that was the worst since 2009, as employment prospects in the sector were decimated. The April purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) reading was 41.5, down 7.6 points from the March reading of 49.1, according to the US Institute of Supply Management. Economists had expected a reading of 35, far below the 50 mark that denotes expanding output in the sector. IHS Markit\u2019s separate US manufacturing PMI hit 36.1 in April, down from 48.5 in March and the previously released \u201cflash\u201d figure of 36.9. That was the lowest for just over eleven years as well. Binay Chandgothia, portfolio manager at Principal Global Investors, said: A 12.4-point drop in the U.S. PMI is an absolute outlier for a single month. Even during the global financial crisis, it dropped by a max of 5.9 points from September 2008 (44.8) to October 2008 (38.9). However, we\u2019ve seen similar data across global markets over the last few weeks, so there is little shock value in today\u2019s numbers. The markets have already moved beyond analysing the anticipated immediate collapse in economic activity to focusing on the duration of it. While there are some initial signs of stabilisation in indicators that have already dropped precipitously, the markets would like to see continued progress \u2013 moving from a stabilisation phase to a recovery phase. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: April saw the manufacturing sector struck hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with output falling to an extent surpassing that seen even at the height of the global financial crisis. With orders collapsing at a rate not seen for over a decade, supply chains disrupted to a record degree and pessimism about the outlook hitting a new survey high, rising numbers of firms are culling payroll numbers. One for the committed central bank watchers among our readers: Tiff Macklem is the new governor of the Bank of Canada (Mark Carney\u2019s alma mater). Wall Street has followed the lead of London and fallen, after disappointing corporate earnings and Donald Trump\u2019s threat to put tariffs on China in retaliation for its role in the crisis. The US indices: S&amp;P 500 .INX DOWN 55.82 POINTS, OR 1.92 PERCENT, AT 2,856.61 NASDAQ .IXIC DOWN 205.32 POINTS, OR 2.31 PERCENT, AT 8,684.23 DOW JONES .DJI DOWN 422.82 POINTS, OR 1.74 PERCENT, AT 23,922.90 White House adviser Larry Kudlow has been speaking on US television, indicating that the US government is concerned about a lack of transparency from China. There is no rush to put in place new tariffs, he said, and he added that full faith in US debt is sacrosanct - addressing speculation the US government could unilaterally write off China\u2019s massive Treasury debt holdings. Aer Lingus, British Airways\u2019 stablemate, has reportedly told unions it is seeking staff cuts of around 20% due to the coronavirus pandemic. Cuts of that scale at the Irish flagcarrier would be roughly in line with British Airways, which plans to make 12,000 redudancies, about a quarter of its workers. Reuters reported the plans, citing a source close to the talks. It said: Aer Lingus, part of International Airlines Group (IAG), which also owns British Airways, declined to comment, saying it was \u201ccontinuing to communicate directly with our employees and engage with their representative bodies.\u201d Cuts of 20% would represent around 800-900 staff, with management promising to offer a voluntary redundancy programme, the source said. International Airlines Group, BA and Aer Lingus\u2019s owner, has gained state aid for its Spanish airlines, Iberia and Vueling. The crisis has proved to be something of a reckoning for the oil industry, and ExxonMobil in particular. The company is facing increasing investor pressure to act on the climate crisis, with the Church of England\u2019s investment fund targeting Exxon\u2019s board over their lack of movement to tackle the biggest issue of the time. At the same time, ExxonMobil pretty much missed the shale boom in its own back yard, and debt-fuelled expansion has left it vulnerable. In a symbol of the times, Netflix, last month overtook Exxon by market capitalisation. And that was all before oil prices plunged. One barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the North American benchmark, will set you back less than $20 (even after rising by 6% today). Here are WTI futures prices this year, down from above $60: ExxonMobil, the US supermajor oil producer, took a $3bn charge in the first quarter as the coronavirus outbreak pushed it to a $610m loss - its first loss in decades. Oil producers have been plunged into chaos as the pandemic has drastically reduced demand for energy. US oil prices have even turned briefly negative, in an indication of the strains on the industry. In the first three months of 2020 Exxon\u2019s oil drilling made only $536m, compared to $2.9bn the year before. It is a sign of the strange times that investors around the world are closely following the progress of drug development. The ups and downs of the testing process for remdesivir have caused billions of pounds of money to shift around the world as people hope for an effective antiviral treatment. Shares in the drug\u2019s maker, Gilead, have risen by 29% this year thanks to hopes the drug (previously developed to fight Ebola) will prove effective at fighting Covid-19. On Friday its chief executive said he expected the US Food and Drug Administration to act quickly over the company\u2019s application for approval. Gilead would try to get the drug to as many people as possible if it was approved, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re moving very quickly with the FDA,\u201d Daniel O\u2019Day said in an interview with NBC\u2019s Today show, via Reuters. \u201cAnd I expect that they\u2019re going to act very quickly.\u201d Sterling has slipped to a one-week low against the euro, with analysts blaming Brexit back-and-forth and a general aversion to riskier assets (as evidenced by the stock market selloff). And remember, with many investors in Europe on holiday (even if confined to their homes) it is likely that trading is thinner than normal. The pound lost 0.7% to hit a low of \u20ac1.1408. Against the dollar sterling lost 0.5% to hit lows of $1.2525, after gaining strongly yesterday. Reuters\u2019 summary of the latest Brexit shenanigans said: A source close to Britain\u2019s negotiating team said the country was confident it can get a deal on future ties with the European Union if Brussels started treating it as an independent negotiator. But, underlining what sources in Brussels say is an impasse at talks since Britain left the EU in January, French officials later reiterated the 27-nation bloc\u2019s position that London must make concessions for a deal to be reached this year. The two sides have been unable to find any compromise on three main areas - the so-called level playing field guarantees of fair competition, governance and fisheries policy, according to the sources in Brussels and London. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, a trading platform, said the pound was hit because it is seen as less of a safe haven given the added political risk. He said: The main driver for sterling\u2019s weakness is the change in market sentiment to a more sombre mood, and this won\u2019t support currencies that are more closely linked to risk. Heathrow airport has warned that it may soon follow British Airways in announcing mass redundancies unless the government restores confidence by planning for how flying could restart. The chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said physical distancing measures could not work in airports and common international standards for health controls were needed, such as temperature screening at the entrance to airports and the wearing of face masks throughout the process to ensure a low risk of transmission. Passenger numbers at the UK\u2019s largest airport fell by 97% in April, and Holland-Kaye urged the government to take a lead in developing a global agreement for new measures. Full report here: An interesting side note to Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s results this morning: as well as a big impairment for bad debts related to the crisis, it is closing its effort to create a digital-first lender to rival the likes of Monzo, Revolut and Starling. That project, named (fairly inexplicably) as B\u00f3, appears to have failed - although RBS said it was just deciding to roll the technology and the brand under its Mettle brand for lending to small businesses. You can read the full report on the RBS results here: The unions have had some time to swallow the bitter pill that is Ryanair\u2019s decision to cut as many as 3,000 jobs. Unite will argue that the decision should be reversed. Referring also to British Airways\u2019 decision to cut 12,000 jobs, Unite national officer for aviation Oliver Richardson said: This is another premature announcement, especially while the government\u2019s job retention scheme remains fully up and running. Ryanair has significant cash reserves and is in a better place than many airlines to cope with the challenges that the Covid-19 pandemic has created. The union also called for the government to intervene with aid for the sector, despite concerns over its environmental impact. Most of Europe may be on holiday today, but for investors in the UK and US May day is not looking very relaxing. The FTSE 100 has lost 2.1% so far, to 5,775 points. The FTSE 250 is down by 1.7%. Markets in the US open in just over three hours, and stock market futures are pointing to heavy declines. The Nasdaq is set to fall 2.5%, the Dow Jones industrial average is expected to lose 1.9% and the S&amp;P 500, the most important benchmark, is set to lose 2%. An interesting story on the insurance industry this morning: the Financial Conduct Authority wants the courts to clarify whether businesses can claim money for business interruption caused by the coronavirus. The Cit watchdog also told all insurers to assess whether they should be giving partial policy refunds during the pandemic. A lot of companies have been distraught to hear that their insurance will not pay out because pandemics are not covered by their terms. Fine print like that has helped the insurance industry to weather the first storm (although recession will likely weigh on their profits eventually). Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive of the FCA, said: We have been clear that we believe in the majority of cases, business interruption insurance was not purchased to, and is unlikely to, cover the current emergency. However, there remain a number of policies where it is clear that the firm has an obligation to pay out on a policy. In addition to this court action, the current emergency has altered the value of some insurance products and we believe that insurers should be looking at both whether their products still offer value. Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: This is a welcome step from the FCA and insurers will look to work closely with the regulator to make this process a success. Although the vast majority of business interruption policies do not cover pandemics and the Government has confirmed it will not seek to retrospectively amend contracts, we support any process that will provide clarity and certainty for the minority of customers who are disputing whether they should be covered. Battening down the hatches is the metaphor of choice to describe the Bank of England\u2019s lending data, as the coronavirus storm hit. The data don\u2019t contain any of the government\u2019s emergency loan schemes, so expect much more in April. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: April data will be more illuminating, as they will reflect the impact of the furlough scheme and rising unemployment on households\u2019 incomes and cash holdings. But with all households seemingly running a very tight ship at present, excess savings should accumulate this year, potentially laying the ground for a strong rebound in spending in 2021, when the virus should no longer be a threat. Back on those extraordinary Bank of England data, households paid back \u00a32.4bn of credit card debt - suggesting a huge fall in consumption that almost certainly augurs a recession. There was \u00a35.4bn less lending to households than February - and that was with only a week of full lockdown. April\u2019s data will certainly be interesting... Businesses work differently to households: they took on new loans at record rates as they tried to secure liquidity, while also piling up as much cash as possible in their bank accoutns. Overall sterling money holdings and borrowing - basically what cash companies and households have easily to hand - both rose to their all-time series highs, of \u00a357.4bn and \u00a355.3bn respectively. It is a torrid time for Trafford Centre owner Intu, facing the prospect of companies unable or refusing to pay rent in its shopping centres. The Guardian\u2019s Joanna Partridge writes: Intu says it\u2019s offering monthly rental payments to its retail tenants, but is scathing about \u201clarge, well-capitalised brands who have the ability to pay but have chosen not to\u201d. As it grapples with a collapse in rental income, the owner of the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex has agreed waivers with some of its lenders, particularly the seven banks which provide its overdraft facility, to prevent potential breaches. It had warned in late March that it would breach the terms on its debt commitments following a collapse in rent. The final reading of IHS Markit\u2019s manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) confirms what we already knew: it is a dire situation for British factories. The UK\u2019s manufacturing PMI reading came in at 32.6 in April, slightly worse than the flash reading of 32.9. That\u2019s confirmed as a record low. A reading of 50 is expansion, so 32.6 is... very low. There were survey-record contractions in output, new orders, employment and new export business. Lead times for products were also at record levels as supply chain disruptions hit. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit,said: UK manufacturing suffered its worst month in recent history in April, as output, orders books and employment all fell at rates far surpassing anything seen in the PMI survey\u2019s 28-year history. Huge swathes of industry were hit hard by company closures, weak global demand, lockdowns and social distancing measures in response to COVID-19. The only pockets of growth were seen at firms making medical and food products. UK consumers\u2019 credit card debt fell in annual terms for the first time since the Bank of England started tracking the data in 1987 in March, as lockdown froze spending but job guarantees kept millions in work. The annual growth rate of credit card lending fell to -0.3%, the first negative annual growth since the series began. British households repaid \u00a33.8bn of consumer credit, which also includes personal loans, during the month - the largest on record. The amount of credit offered to UK consumers grew at the slowest pace since 2013 in March, while the number of mortgage approvals fell to its lowest in the same period, according to the Bank of England. Mortgage approvals for house purchase fell to 56,200, their lowest level since March 2013. The weak net flows of consumer credit meant that the annual growth rate fell to 3.7% in March, lowest since June 2013. Some interesting moves on currency markets after Donald Trump last night suggested that he might try to hit China with more tariffs in retaliation for its role in the crisis. The US president said last night that a trade deal with China was now of secondary importance to the coronavirus pandemic. He also threatened new tariffs on Beijing and said he had seen evidence for the unproven theory that Sars-CoV-2 originated in a Wuhan infectious disease lab. The prospect of another bout of economic warfare has weighed on the Chinese yuan traded in Hong Kong. The British and Irish aviation industry appears to be running what basketball fans might term a full court press when it comes to requesting state aid: Heathrow Airport\u2019s boss is also asking for help. John Holland-Kaye, according to Reuters, has said the government maybe doesn\u2019t understand how important aviation is for the rest of the economy. Virgin Atlantic (a major presence at Heathrow) may go bust without help, he said. It is disappointing that the UK stands out from other countries in not offering state aid to its airline industry, he said. That echoes the criticisms of Ryanair\u2019s chief executive. However, the UK government has been wary of bailing out airlines and their wealthy shareholders - particularly the billionaire-controlled Virgin Atlantic. There has also been sustained pressure for the government not to help some of the economy\u2019s biggest polluters without conditions that they cut emissions. Heathrow\u2019s comments came as it reported that passenger numbers declined by 18.3% during the first three months of 2020 to 14.6m and are expected to bedown by around 97% in April. Spending has been reduced by \u00a3650m. The airport could sustain itself for 12 months even with no passengers, it said. In the barrage of corporate news earlier, we didn\u2019t cover Nationwide\u2019s house price index, which showed that the housing market was actually heating up before the crisis. Annual house price growth increased to 3.7% in April, up from 3% in March-the fastest pace since February 2017 (when annual growth was 4.5%). That was the seventh month of growth in a row. The average price was \u00a3222,915. But with something of a caveat: it didn\u2019t take into account the biggest health and economic crisis of our lifetime. Before the lockdown unemployment and borrowing costs were low, while the general election had given buyers some short-lived certainty. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: It\u2019s important to note that the impact of the pandemic is not fully captured in this month\u2019s figures. This is becauseour index is constructed using mortgage approval data, and there is a lag between mortgage applications being submitted and approved. Indeed, circa 80% of cases in the April sample relate to mortgage applications that commenced prior to the lock-down, and hence before the full extent of the impact of the pandemic became clear. Here are the graphs. Note the recent pick-up: Refunds for customers with cancelled flights will be issued \u201cin a month or two\u201d, O\u2019Leary added. Ryanair\u2019s regional bases (outside major hubs such as Stansted, Gatwick, Manchester and Birmingham) could shut, O\u2019Leary said. There will be final announcement by 1 July, he said: Some of the other regional bases will be very marginal this winter. The return to normal tourism volumes could take as long as three years, O\u2019Leary said. Ryanair\u2019s O\u2019Leary has also hammered home his point about state aid, saying that his airline and others that don\u2019t have government support face a \u201ctorrid couple of years\u201d. He said: When we have to come back we\u2019ll have to compete with airlines that have limitless state aid funds to enable them to engage in below-cost selling. It\u2019s going to be a torrid couple of years for airlines like Ryanair, BA, and others who don\u2019t get state aid. It\u2019s going to be a great couple of years for passengers: you will see lower air fares, you will see, certainly this summer, lower hotel prices in place like Spain, Portugal and Italy as they try to recover something of their tourism season. Ryanair chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary has raised the prospect of further job cuts down the line if the a coronavirus vaccine is not found quickly. The airlines has cut 15% of its staff, and O\u2019Leary said that is \u201cthe minumum we need to survive the next 12 months\u201d. Speaking on BBC TV, he added: If a vaccine is found, then clearly the recovery will be stronger. If a vaccine isn\u2019t found then clearly we may have to announce more cuts and deeper cuts into the future. The airline will carry fewer than 140,000 passengers in April, May and June, against pre-crisis forecasts of 42m. For the year passenger numbers will be less than 100m versus the 155m forecast. O\u2019Leary said: While we expect to be back flying some services in July and August we think that the build-up will be slow. Passengers will be wearing face masks, there will be temperature checks at airports. Ryanair\u2019s job cuts will start in July, subject to consultations with unions. The airline said: As a direct result of the unprecedented Covid-19 crisis, the grounding of all flights from mid-March until at least July, and the distorted state aid landscape in Europe, Ryanair now expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing (to 2019 levels) will take at least two years, until summer 2022 at the earliest. The job cuts will hit pilot and cabin crew jobs mainly. There will also be unpaid leave, and pay cuts of up to 20%, and the closure of a number of aircraft bases across Europe until traffic recovers. Job cuts and pay cuts will also be extended to head office, Ryanair said. Group chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary has extended a 50% pay cut from May until the end of March 2021. Our early report is available here: While British Airways has just moved to lay off 12,000 staff, telling them that there was no government help available, its sister airlines in parent company IAG in Spain have just been granted \u20ac1bn in state-backed loans. Iberia has signed a financing agreement for \u20ac750m and Vueling for \u20ac260m for bank loans guaranteed by the Spanish Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial, under a Covid-19 scheme set up by Spain to help business. The loans have restrictions to stop the cash being shared with BA or others at IAG. The news came as Ryanair hit out at state aid being given to rival European carriers, with Lufthansa, Air France and KLM expected to share the bulk of around \u20ac30bn in bailouts. Ryanair - announcing 3,000 job cuts due to the crisis - said it would challenge this \u201cstate aid doping\u201d in European courts. The FTSE 100 has lost 2.1% in the opening minutes of trading. RBS is actually one of only four risers this morning - thanks largely to its continued profitability. Oil companies are dragging back the index, while Ryanair\u2019s budget airline rival easyJet is down 4.9%. Royal Bank of Scotland suffered a near-50% drop in first quarter profits after putting aside \u00a3802m to help cover a potential surge in bad debts due to the Covid-19 outbreak, making it the latest UK bank to reveal the mounting cost of the pandemic. The majority state-owned bank announced on Friday that pre-tax profits had fallen to \u00a3519m in the first three months of the 2020, compared to just over \u00a31bn a year earlier. It was hurt by the \u00a3802m charge, which was driven by forecasts for potential loan losses due to an economic downturn that could make it harder for it retail and business customers to repay their debts. The bank, soon to be renamed NatWest, said: [The group] has significant exposures to many of the commercial sectors that are already being impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, including property, retail, leisure, travel and shipping. It brings the total loan loss charges announced by the five largest UK banks to around \u00a37.4bn for the first quarter. Ryanair is planning to cut 3,000 jobs and reduce staff pay by up to a fifth in response to the Covid-19 crisis, which has grounded flights. The no-frills airline said it did not expect a recovery in passenger numbers or pricing to return to pre-coronavirus levels for at least two years \u2013 until summer 2022 \u201cat the earliest\u201d. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. It\u2019s May Day, and those stock markets that are not on holiday have started the month with a nasty fall, taking their lead from disappointments last night on Wall Street. Wall Street recorded its best month since 1987 in April - thanks to the timing of the rebound from the market bottom in March - and easing lockdowns is the talk of major economies. Yet corporate earnings are reflecting the grim reality of the costs being borne by companies. In Japan the Nikkei fell by 2.8%. The FTSE 100 is expected to suffer a jolt when it opens in a few minutes\u2019 time. Most other European markets are closed for the holiday, but the following data based on spreadbetting activity gives a rough indication of sentiment: US tech giants Amazon and Apple both disappointed investors last night. Amazon has seen a massive 26% increase in its revenues but there has been a cost: $4bn, to be precise. Meanwhile, Apple refused to give guidance for the current quarter - perhaps understandable in these circumstances, but not reassuring for investors. In the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland has reported an operating profit before tax of \u00a3519m and an attributable profit of \u00a3288m. However, the bank also took a big impairment to account for the hit from the all-but-certain UK recession: it wrote down \u00a3802m eight times higher as a proportion of its loan book than last year. Some \u00a3628m relate directly to coronavirus. More details to follow. Ryanair said that it expects some flights to start again in July, but with only half as many passengers in the July to September period as it previously expected.

      "bodyText": "Why are the origins of the pandemic so controversial? How Covid-19 began has become increasingly contentious, with the US and other allies suggesting China has not been transparent about the origins of the outbreak. Donald Trump, the US president, has given credence to the idea that intelligence exists suggesting the virus may have escaped from a lab in Wuhan, although the US intelligence community has pointedly declined to back this up. The scientific community says there is no current evidence for this claim. This follows reports that the White House had been pressuring US intelligence community on the claim, recalling the Bush administration\u2019s pressure to \u201cstove pipe\u201d the intelligence before the war in Iraq. What\u2019s the problem with the Chinese version? A specific issue is that the official origin story doesn\u2019t add up in terms of the initial epidemiology of the outbreak, not least the incidence of early cases with no apparent connection to the Wuhan seafood market, where Beijing says the outbreak began. If these people were not infected at the market, or via contacts who were infected at the market, critics ask, how do you explain these cases? The Wuhan labs Two laboratories in Wuhan studying bat coronaviruses have come under the spotlight. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) is a biosecurity level 4 facility \u2013 the highest for biocontainment \u2013 and the level 2 Wuhan Centre for Disease Control, which is located not far from the fish market, had collected bat coronavirus specimens. Several theories have been promoted. The first, and wildest, is that scientists at WIV were engaged in experiments with bat coronavirus, involving so-called gene splicing, and the virus then escaped and infected humans. A second version is that sloppy biosecurity among lab staff and in procedures, perhaps in the collection or disposal of animal specimens, released a wild virus. Is there any evidence the virus was engineered? The scientific consensus rejecting the virus being engineered is almost unanimous. In a letter to Nature in March, a team in California led by microbiology professor Kristian Andersen said \u201cthe genetic data irrefutably shows that [Covid-19] is not derived from any previously used virus backbone\u201d \u2013 in other words spliced sections of another known virus. Far more likely, they suggested, was that the virus emerged naturally and became stronger through natural selection. \u201cWe propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of Sars-CoV-2: natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic [animal to human] transfer; and natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\u201d Peter Ben Embarek, an expert at the World Health Organization in animal to human transmission of diseases, and other specialists also explained to the Guardian that if there had been any manipulation of the virus you would expect to see evidence in both the gene sequences and also distortion in the data of the family tree of mutations \u2013 a so-called \u201creticulation\u201d effect. In a statement to the Guardian, James Le Duc, the head of the Galveston National Laboratory in the US, the biggest active biocontainment facility on a US academic campus, also poured cold water on the suggestion. \u201cThere is convincing evidence that the new virus was not the result of intentional genetic engineering and that it almost certainly originated from nature, given its high similarity to other known bat-associated coronaviruses,\u201d he said. What about an accidental escape of a wild sample because of poor lab safety practices? The accidental release of a wild sample has been the focus of most attention, although the \u201cevidence\u201d offered is at best highly circumstantial. The Washington Post has reported concerns in 2018 over security and management weakness from US embassy officials who visited the WIV several times, although the paper also conceded there was no conclusive proof the lab was the source of the outbreak. Le Duc, however, paints a different picture of the WIV. \u201cI have visited and toured the new BSL4 laboratory in Wuhan, prior to it starting operations in 2017- \u2026 It is of comparable quality and safety measures as any currently in operation in the US or Europe.\u201d He also described encounters with Shi Zhengli, the Chinese virologist at the WIV who has led research into bat coronaviruses, and discovered the link between bats and the Sars virus that caused disease worldwide in 2003, describing her as \u201cfully engaged, very open and transparent about her work, and eager to collaborate\u201d. Maureen Miller, an epidemiologist who worked with Shi as part of a US-funded viral research programme, echoed Le Duc\u2019s assessment. She said she believed the lab escape theory was an \u201cabsolute conspiracy theory\u201d and referred to Shi as \u201cbrilliant\u201d. Problems with the timeline and map of the spread of the virus While the experts who spoke to the Guardian made clear that understanding of the origins of the virus remained provisional, they added that the current state of knowledge of the initial spread also created problems for the lab escape theory. When Peter Forster, a geneticist at Cambridge, compared sequences of the virus genome collected early in the Chines outbreak \u2013 and later globally \u2013 he identified three dominant strains. Early in the outbreak, two strains appear to have been in circulation at roughly at the same time \u2013 strain A and strain B \u2013 with a C variant later developing from strain B. But in a surprise finding, the version with the closest genetic similarity to bat coronavirus was not the one most prevalent early on in the central Chinese city of Wuhan but instead associated with a scattering of early cases in the southern Guangdong province. Between 24 December 2019 and 17 January 2020, Forster explains, just three out of 23 cases in Wuhan were type A, while the rest were type B. In patients in Guangdong province, however, five out of nine were found to have type A of the virus. \u201cThe very small numbers notwithstanding,\u201d said Forster, \u201cthe early genome frequencies until 17 January do not favour Wuhan as an origin over other parts of China, for example five of nine Guangdong/Shenzhen patients who had A types.\u201d In other words, it still remains far from certain that Wuhan was even necessarily where the virus first emerged. If there is no evidence of engineering and the origin is still so disputed, why are we still talking about the Wuhan labs theory? The pandemic has exacerbated existing geopolitical struggles, prompting a disinformation war that has drawn in the US, China, Russia and others. Journalists and scientists have been targeted by people with an apparent interest in pushing circumstantial evidence related to the virus\u2019s origins, perhaps as part of this campaign and to distract from the fact that few governments have had a fault-free response. What does this mean now? The current state of knowledge about coronavirus and its origin suggest the most likely explanation remains the most prosaic. Like other coronaviruses before, it simply spread to humans via a natural event, the starting point for many in the scientific community including the World Health Organization. Further testing in China in the months ahead may eventually establish the source of the outbreak. But for now it is too early.",

      "bodyText": "A head of procurement for the NHS has set up a business to profit from the private sale of huge quantities of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, an undercover investigation by the Guardian can reveal. David Singleton, 42, a senior NHS official in London who has been working at the capital\u2019s Covid-19 Nightingale hospital, launched the business two weeks ago to trade in visors, masks and gowns. Asked about the findings of the investigation, Singleton said he disclosed his business to superiors in the NHS, in accordance with the rules, and was told there was \u201cunlikely to be a conflict\u201d. However, the NHS launched an immediate investigation. \u201cWe take any potential conflicts of interest extremely seriously and as soon we became aware of these allegations an internal investigation was started,\u201d a spokesperson said. A website for Singleton\u2019s company, Sure Stock, which marketed PPE to private sector and NHS clients, made no reference to Singleton or his role in the health service. But in a phone call with an undercover reporter posing as a potential client, Singleton confirmed he was running the business. He said he was trading as a \u201csales agent\u201d between suppliers and buyers of PPE. According to Singleton\u2019s LinkedIn profile, which he deleted shortly after the Guardian told him about its investigation, he is a head of procurement for the NHS in London. He works within a large commissioning support unit (CSU) that covers the capital\u2019s north and east and surrounding areas. It is understood the investigation is being conducted by his employer, the NHS north and east London CSU. During the conversation with the undercover reporter, Singleton said he was \u201ccurrently an NHS employee\u201d but said his role did not involve buying \u201cany products\u201d. \u201cI deliver services,\u201d he said. \u201cSo none of the suppliers that I\u2019m working with do I have any interactions with during my day job.\u201d Asked later whether he was exploiting his NHS expertise and contacts, Singleton said in a statement that he was not \u201cdirectly involved\u201d in responding to the PPE shortage in the NHS \u201cas my role does not involve purchasing or procuring of these products\u201d. However, information collated by the Guardian, including internal NHS email evidence, suggests Singleton may have been involved in procuring PPE supplies. Asked to respond to a request for comment about the email evidence, Singleton replied \u201cno comment\u201d and hung up the phone. The NHS declined to comment on the email evidence. Singleton created his PPE company on 15 April, as the shortage of protective equipment for NHS and other health and care workers working on the frontline of the coronavirus outbreak was reaching crisis point. His company, Sure Stock Limited, originally registered to Singleton\u2019s home in Essex, launched a website that same week, marketing PPE products for \u201cmedical, dental, adult social care, the food industry and personal use\u201d. The website offered large amounts of PPE and hygiene products for sale, including protective face shields, or \u201csmart visors\u201d, which were priced at \u00a319,500 for minimum orders of 10,000 units. Posing as an agent for a meat processing factory, a Guardian reporter approached Sure Stock claiming his client urgently needed large quantities of PPE to protect about 800 workers and return the facility to full production. Sure Stock\u2019s salesperson, a friend and associate of Singleton, confirmed the company had been created by Singleton and said he could help source batches of 20,000 visors, masks, gowns and gloves \u2013 as well as 1,000 litres of hand sanitiser \u2013 as part of an initial order. The sale would have totalled more than \u00a3100,000. The salesperson told the undercover reporter: \u201cEssentially a friend of mine is head of procurement for NHS London. He has really struggled to get stuff to people in the right timeframe. So essentially what we decided to do was set up a little company and become sales agents for people in the UK who have got stock. And then essentially we would help in linking up the supply chains that are massively disastrous at the moment.\u201d The undercover reporter then asked to talk to Singleton directly. During a 40-minute telephone conversation, Singleton told the undercover reporter: \u201cWhat we do is we work with the supplier and then our margin, our commission, our referral, comes from them before the prices go out. So we just work as a sales agent.\u201d He also disclosed he was an NHS employee. \u201cWe want to nurture relationships like yours. Because people like you can open doors for some of my suppliers into areas that they don\u2019t currently reach into,\u201d he told the undercover reporter. \u201cSo it\u2019s growing a network of trusted suppliers and buyers because you can\u2019t be a supplier unless you\u2019ve got a buyer. You can\u2019t be a buyer unless you\u2019ve got a supplier. You need to have these things. You need to connect up.\u201d Towards the end of the call, Singleton emphasised how competitive his visor prices were and encouraged the undercover reporter to \u201cpiggyback\u201d a large order \u201ccurrently \u2026 going through with the Far East [and a UK importer]\u201d. He added: \u201cWhat I\u2019d close off by saying is when you are in a position where you know you want to place an order, rest assured that you are going to be dealing with a UK company.\u201d Singleton told the undercover reporter that during the Covid-19 outbreak he had been \u201credeployed\u201d to the Nightingale hospital at the Excel Centre and the Royal London hospital and was \u201chelping them set up their pop-up ITU [intensive treatment unit] wards and their stock rooms\u201d. In his statement to the Guardian following the undercover investigation, Singleton said he had not set up ITUs or stock rooms and had not been involved in any procurement at the the hospital. He said he had notified his employer about Sure Stock, as is required, and had been informed by a superior that \u201cthere is unlikely to be a conflict\u201d, as it was perceived there would be no crossover in terms of customers. Singleton said declaring the directorship was the main step towards compliance and this had been completed. However, the Guardian understands that while Singleton recently declared his new business via an internal online NHS reporting system, the disclosure was under review and had not yet been approved. In his conversation with the undercover reporter, Singleton\u2019s salesperson appeared to give conflicting accounts of whether or not the firm planned to market to the NHS. At one point he said: \u201cWe\u2019re not really wanting to approach anyone in the NHS, because there is a bit of conflict of interest, so we are sort of staying out of that.\u201d But during another part of the conversation, about the scarcity of gowns on the market, the salesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of NHS trusts frantically phoning around trying to get hold of these and they can\u2019t.\u201d He added: \u201cNow what we are doing with those, we are offering the NHS 30 days to pay.\u201d In his emailed statement, Singleton said Sure Stock \u201chas not and will not sell PPE and related equipment to the NHS, or any NHS organisation\u201d.

Why did it initially tell people to stay away from pubs and restaurants, but simultaneously allow those places to stay open? Why did the government call a halt in March to testing and tracing? If the answer is a lack of capacity, then why did it not immediately set about recruiting the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/political-imagination-end-lockdown-mass-testing-contact-tracing\">army of cont</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/political-imagination-end-lockdown-mass-testing-contact-tracing\">act tracers</a>\u201d that will be required if we are ever to emerge from our homes?

The outpouring of sympathy while he clung to life in intensive care was real; some of it lingers when he briefs the nation from No 10 and grows visibly tired before the hour is up.

      "bodyText": "This government should be on the rack. The evidence that it botched crucial decisions at crucial moments is piling up. The litany is now so familiar it barely needs repeating, from the failure to secure personal protective equipment for frontline workers in health and social care to the 11 lost days of delay before imposing a lockdown that has proved essential for saving lives. You can focus on specific judgments: why did ministers allow mass gatherings, from racing at Cheltenham to a Stereophonics gig in Cardiff, ignoring the warnings that such events would be a virus-fest? Why did it initially tell people to stay away from pubs and restaurants, but simultaneously allow those places to stay open? Why did the government call a halt in March to testing and tracing? If the answer is a lack of capacity, then why did it not immediately set about recruiting the \u201carmy of contact tracers\u201d that will be required if we are ever to emerge from our homes? Why the focus on mega-labs, rather than seizing on the offer of small laboratories to do testing for their local hospitals, which, as Paul Nurse, director of the Francis Crick Institute, has argued, could have made those hospitals \u201csafe places\u201d?

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said on Tuesday that the Nova Scotia gunman, Gabriel Wortman, had been armed with two semi-automatic rifles and several semi-automatic pistols. Supt Darren Campbell said that one of the guns could be described \u201cmilitary-style assault rifle\u201d. The new ban would probably not have stopped Wortman from obtaining his weapons: he did not have a license to possess or purchase firearms, and police have said they believe the guns were obtained illegally in Canada and the United States. The prime minister announced a two-year \u201camnesty period\u201d to allow gun owners to comply with the law. The ban covers 1,500 models and variants of firearms.

With the government set to decide next week whether to ease restrictions put in place at the end of March, the consultancy firm Capital Economics said each additional month of full quarantining would knock 1.5 percentage points off annual growth. It said even with severe containment measures remaining in place only until the end of June and with some easing of restrictions in the coming weeks, the economy would shrink by 12% this year. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said there would be a much bigger hit if multiple peaks of the virus forced ministers to keep stringent measures in place until April 2021. In those circumstances, Gregory said, the economy would contract by 19.6% this year, a recession three times as severe as that which followed the global financial crisis in 2008. In addition, the expected bounceback in the economy would be delayed with the level of output still more than 6% below where it would have been in the absence of the pandemic by the end of 2022. On his return to work this week, Boris Johnson said that it was too soon to ease the lockdown despite signs that physical distancing had led to a fall in the number of hospital deaths and the number of new cases of Covid-19. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent body that provides economic forecasts for the government, has pencilled in a fall of 35% in gross domestic product in the second quarter on the assumption that a full lockdown remains in place until the end of June. The OBR is assuming half the restrictions will be lifted between July and September, with the rest being removed in the final three months of the year. On that basis, output would return to its pre-crisis level by the end of the year, with an annual fall in GDP between 2019 and 2020 of more than 13%.

In the unlikely event of an immediate end to the lockdown, recovery would begin at the start of May but the economy would still shrink by 8.2% during 2020. Gregory said that all the scenarios outlined in her report were simplified versions of what the reality is likely to be: \u201cThe restrictions are unlikely to be relaxed all at once and there is already evidence that even while the economy is shut down some activity is trickling back.\u201d She added: \u201cThe longer the restrictions are in place, the longer it may take the economy to recover to pre-recession levels because of scarring effects.

They are exposed to as many, if not more, risks of infection and seem to be at the end of the line when PPE is provided, yet are getting little, if any, recognition. And what about the district nurses? Jennifer Hewitt Wendover, Buckinghamshire \u2022 Joel Golby\u2019s comparison of Covid-19 with the Black Death (Opinion, theguardian.com, 27 April) seems a little facile. The Black Death killed 30-60% of Europe\u2019s population, affecting all age groups similarly. Covid-19 appears to kill 0.2-0.8% of the people it infects, the great majority towards the end of their lives. This is not sufficient to create the boom in graveyards he imagines. Simon Wood Professor of statistical science, University of Bristol \u2022 It\u2019s not just Ottolenghi: despite having just had my first large grocery delivery since January, I don\u2019t even have the ingredients for most of your \u00a32 lunches (In a lunch rut? 25 delicious \u00a32 dishes to help you escape it \u2013 from quiche to quesadillas, 30 April). Angela Lansley Liverpool \u2022 Sarah Moss suggests women and children leave lockdown first while men stay at home baking banana bread and clapping (Letters, 30 April). Isn\u2019t this multitasking a step too far? Toby Wood Peterborough, Cambridgeshire \u2022 I assume Thursday 30 April was Colonel Tom Moore\u2019s debut in your birthdays column.

The move will come as welcome news to people who were forced to put their IVF treatment on hold during the crisis. Clinics across the UK can apply to reopen from 11 May, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has confirmed, if they ensure the safety and protection of staff and patients. Both private and NHS clinics will be required to show they are able to provide safe treatment during the outbreak before they are given the green light to restart. Physical distancing must be observed in waiting rooms, telephone appointments should be used when suitable and personal protective equipment used when necessary. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: \u201cNow that we are past the peak, I am delighted to announce the restoration of fertility services. \u201cPeople who are relying on fertility treatment have been worried during these unprecedented times not knowing when they could continue their journey to start a family. \u201cWe wanted to open these clinics as soon as it was safe to do so, and our strict guidelines will ensure staff and patients remain safe as we continue to tackle this virus.\u201d HFEA, which regulates Britain\u2019s fertility industry, ordered both NHS and private clinics to suspend treatment for those undergoing IVF from 15 April. Prior to this, all new IVF treatment was banned. The news caused heartache for many women desperately trying to conceive, with many fearing they could miss their chance by the time the restrictions were lifted. Data from the HFEA showed that more than 54,000 patients underwent 75,000 fertility treatments in 2017, resulting in 20,500 births. Sally Cheshire, the HFEA chair, said: \u201cOur priority throughout the pandemic has been to consider how treatment could resume quickly and safely for as many patients as possible and our clear plan sets out how clinics can treat and care for patients safely during the continuing Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cI know that the closure of clinics has been extremely distressing for patients and this will be good news for those wanting to resume treatment and have the opportunity to try for their much longed for family.\u201d",

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014/15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far.

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer, gave members of his fresh frontbench team some gentle advice when he began chairing shadow cabinet meetings by videoconference last month: you don\u2019t have to speak for the sake of it. While Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s consensual chairing style involved hearing lengthy contributions from colleagues with contrasting views, Starmer reminds shadow ministers they shouldn\u2019t feel obliged to chip in. With the nation gripped by the Covid-19 crisis, he has taken an equally restrained approach to Labour\u2019s contribution to the national debate \u2013 to varying reviews from those on his own side. \u201cOur pragmatic decision is, first of all to engage on the practical things the government could do that would make people\u2019s lives easier,\u201d says Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow work and pensions secretary. \u201cIn my area for instance, that\u2019s uprating legacy benefits and ending the benefit cap and the two-child limit in universal credit \u2013 rather than saying, \u2018Let\u2019s have a universal basic income [UBI]\u2019, or \u2018Let\u2019s have a minimum income guarantee.\u2019\u201d But while his supporters have applauded Starmer\u2019s approach and argued that a more aggressive line will simply alienate the public at a time of high government popularity, Labour leftwingers have been frustrated at the party\u2019s refusal to seize on the crisis as a moment to propose a radical overhaul of the economy and society. Jon Trickett, now relegated to the backbenches from his position of shadow cabinet office minister, says: \u201cThe country\u2019s crying out for a longer-term vision. We need to map out a great vision for the kind of new normal that can exist after this pandemic. Perhaps the leadership doesn\u2019t feel now\u2019s the right time to do that.\u201d Reynolds says those are arguments Labour can make later. For now, the priority is pressing for urgent assistance for struggling households and families. \u201cI\u2019m very sympathetic to UBI, but realistically you\u2019ve got to use the channels we\u2019ve got,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact that we have come out with pragmatic suggestions of how to help people right now, does not take away from the fact that we want and are committed to a full alternative to universal credit: we want to work with people and build a big coalition around that. That approach has been replicated across the shadow cabinet. Annaliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, has praised the chancellor\u2019s economic rescue schemes but pointed out the gaps in them. And Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, has lauded frontline police officers but demanded more action to protect domestic violence victims. Labour believes this is what the public expects of the official opposition at a time of national crisis. Starmer held the first two of a string of planned \u201cCall Keir\u201d virtual meetings, with voters from Bury and the Tees Valley this week. These meetings, and polling seen by Labour strategists, are telling them the public don\u2019t want to hear knee-jerk criticism of the government. \u201cThe approach we\u2019re getting from the public is, \u2018All of us need to be together, getting through this,\u2019\u201d said a party source. They also say the public believe the right time to challenge the government\u2019s handling of the outbreak head-on will be after the worst has passed \u2013 though Starmer has stepped up his attacks in the past week, telling Johnson the UK had been slow into lockdown, and now risks \u201cfalling behind the rest of the world\u201d. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth \u2013 one of the few frontbenchers to remain in the same job when Starmer took over \u2013 has been praised by Matt Hancock for his constructive approach; but his frustration with the government\u2019s stance also appeared to bubble over this week. Ashworth has been calling for the test-and-track approach now being pursued by Hancock for some time \u2013 and believes the health secretary should have started much earlier to recruit the necessary army of contact-tracers he has now acknowledged will be needed. \u201cThis lockdown is not a strategy in itself to defeat the virus,\u201d Ashworth told the Guardian. \u201cThis lockdown buys us time to put in place a strategy.

And Reynolds says these private conversations are no substitute for asking a question publicly, in parliament \u2013 even virtually. Boris Johnson briefed Starmer directly this week, as part of what the prime minister claimed was part his effort to \u201cbuild the biggest possible consensus,\u201d for how to manage the next phase of the crisis. Both sides insist that falls far short of coopting Labour into decision-making, however, with Starmer\u2019s team regarding chatter about a \u201cnational government\u201d as a Westminster bubble fantasy.\ufeff When Johnson returned to the Downing Street press conference on Thursday, he appeared to reflect Labour\u2019s repeated recent calls for an \u201cexit strategy\u201d, avoiding the phrase repeatedly used by Starmer but promising a \u201croad map\u201d and a \u201cmenu of options\u201d.

The latest figure of 122,000 tests were carried out on 73,000 people, with the remainder being retests.</p> \n<p>Hancock praised colleagues and private sector partners for the rapid increase in testing capability, which has seen mobile testing units and new labs created \u2013 and defended the target itself.</p> \n<p>\u201cSetting stretching, ambitious goals in a national crisis has a galvanising effect on everyone involved,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew that it was an audacious goal but we needed an audacious goal,\u201d he said. \u201cI can announce that we have met our goal.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, Hancock was criticised by his Labour shadow, Jon Ashworth. \u201cMany would have expected the 100,000 promise to have been met by actually carrying out testing, not simply because 39,000 kits had been mailed out,\u201d Ashworth said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis headline figure shouldn\u2019t count tests that hadn\u2019t been used or indeed might never be used.

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014/15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hancock announced that 27,510 people have now died from Covid-19: an increase of 739.

      "bodyText": "Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was accused of artificially inflating the number of coronavirus tests, as he hailed the rapid expansion that allowed him to reach a self-imposed 100,000-a-day target as a \u201cnational achievement\u201d. It emerged that a third of the 122,347 tests included in the final 24-hour period before the deadline were counted before they had been carried out. Around 39,000 had been sent out to households and satellite testing locations, with no guarantee of the timescale for their completion, but were still included in the count. The figure marked a significant rise on Thursday\u2019s total of 81,611 tests, and comfortably exceeded the 100,000 daily target. The latest figure of 122,000 tests were carried out on 73,000 people, with the remainder being retests. Hancock praised colleagues and private sector partners for the rapid increase in testing capability, which has seen mobile testing units and new labs created \u2013 and defended the target itself. \u201cSetting stretching, ambitious goals in a national crisis has a galvanising effect on everyone involved,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew that it was an audacious goal but we needed an audacious goal,\u201d he said. \u201cI can announce that we have met our goal.\u201d However, Hancock was criticised by his Labour shadow, Jon Ashworth. \u201cMany would have expected the 100,000 promise to have been met by actually carrying out testing, not simply because 39,000 kits had been mailed out,\u201d Ashworth said. \u201cThis headline figure shouldn\u2019t count tests that hadn\u2019t been used or indeed might never be used. Ministers promised us transparency, the public and NHS deserve clarity.\u201d He also complained that the target was \u201cnever a strategy,\u201d saying ministers should be using the lockdown period to \u201cput the fundamentals of infectious disease control in place\u201d. Earlier on Friday, the Health Service Journal (HSJ) claimed that, until recently, tests were only recorded in the daily count once they had been sent to a laboratory for analysis. The government denied there had been a change. An unnamed senior source told the HSJ that the change had been made because Hancock, the health and social care secretary, was \u201cobsessed\u201d with honouring his testing pledge. Last week, an online portal was launched allowing drive-through tests and home testing kits to be booked by symptomatic key workers and, later, over-65s, those needing to work outside the home, care home staff and residents. Hancock has come under intense pressure over the 100,000-a-day target since making it. At the time, the government was clear that the figure represented the number of people having a test. The current testing total used by ministers includes tens of thousands of retests. Recently, Hancock stressed that his aim was to have in place by the end of April the capacity to undertake 100,000 daily tests. According to the HSJ, Chris Wormald, the Department of Health\u2019s permanent secretary, signed off what appeared to be a major and previously unannounced change to the way the headline daily number is calculated. Challenged about the HSJ story, Hancock said: \u201cIt\u2019s not something I recognise.\u201d The government\u2019s testing tsar, John Newton, appearing alongside Hancock said: \u201cThere\u2019s been no change to the way tests are counted. \u201cThat\u2019s the way they are counted, have always been counted, and that\u2019s the way we were advised to count them by officials.\u201d However the numbers of home testing kits being mailed out was not included in figures before last week as the items were not available. The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, said Hancock\u2019s target \u201cwas always a hostage to fortune, and the truth is, he missed it\u201d. He said it was disappointing the government had chosen to \u201cmassage the metrics\u201d rather than admit failure as this would undermine public confidence. Despite the row about how the tests are accounted for, Hancock said the significantly increased capacity would allow the government to track the progress of the disease more accurately, and to control its spread, once lockdown restrictions are eased. Boris Johnson announced on Thursday that the government will set out next week a \u201croad map\u201d for reopening schools and businesses, once the government\u2019s scientific advisers deem it safe to do so. This will include what he called a \u201cmenu of options\u201d. The prime minister said the public were likely to be encouraged to wear masks, as part of the plan for easing restrictions: but his official spokesman insisted on Friday that no formal decision had been made. Johnson said at Thursday\u2019s press conference: \u201cI do think face masks will be useful, both for epidemiological reasons, and to give people the confidence that it is safe to go back to work.\u201d But his spokesman said no final decision had yet been taken. \u201cMinisters are still considering how we move forward with face coverings, in terms of the precise advice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe advice we have received, based on the science, shows a weak but also positive effect in reducing transmission from \u2026 asymptomatic members of the public, where social distancing is not possible.\u201d The lockdown restrictions imposed on 23 March are set to be reviewed by ministers next Thursday. Hancock announced that 27,510 people have now died from Covid-19: an increase of 739. The figures have risen significantly since the government began including deaths taking place in care homes, as well as those in hospitals. The health secretary reiterated the government\u2019s determination to recruit 18,000 people to help track the progress of the disease by mid-May, as part of what he called a \u201cfull-scale test, track and trace model\u201d. \u201cIf it needs to be bigger, we\u2019ll scale it up as required,\u201d he added. He also said the government will shortly release the app it has been trialling, which is aimed at identifying sufferers and warning those they have met. \u201cPeople will be able to know if they\u2019ve been in close contact with someone who\u2019s transmitting the disease, and take action if they need to,\u201d he said. The government has come under mounting pressure to explain why it didn\u2019t build up the capacity to track the infection earlier \u2013 instead, halting the tracing of individual cases in March. The Conservative MP Greg Clark, who chairs the science and technology committee, wrote a testy public letter to Public Health England on Friday to urge it to publish more evidence about why that decision was made, after it declined to do so. \u201cIt is important that the bodies responsible for UK policy and practice are transparent about the basis of vital decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is disappointing that Public Health England has still not disclosed the assessment they made which led them to reject the South Korean approach to testing. \u201cSo I ask again for PHE to publish the evidence which informed UK testing strategy, without further delay.\u201d The plea followed a hearing with PHE officials last month.",

      "bodyText": "The government is facing a challenge to the legality of the coronavirus lockdown by a wealthy businessman who fears it will kill more people than it saves. Simon Dolan, whose Jota Aviation company has been delivering personal protective equipment (PPE) to the NHS, has put the health secretary on notice that he intends to issue proceedings for a judicial review, unless the government reverses some of the lockdown measures and reinstates freedom of movement. He is taking the action, which echoes that taken by Gina Miller over Brexit, on the grounds that the lockdown was both legally defective and disproportionate in law. He is also seeking minutes of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) meetings this year, some of which involved Boris Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings. \u201cFailure to do so [release the minutes] will result in an application for disclosure if proceedings have to be issued,\u201d says the \u201cletter before action\u201d that has been sent to Matt Hancock. Dolan, the author of a book called How to Make Millions Without a Degree, says he is not taking the case to throw the country into chaos, but to restore the public\u2019s right to decide for themselves if they want to visit friends, go to work or stay indoors, according to a crowdfunding page. He has offered to \u201cconsider not issuing proceedings if serious, alternative, less draconian suggested restrictions were imposed\u201d. His lawyer, Michael Gardner, said the government had been given until Thursday to reply to the letter. If it does not come back with a satisfactory answer, he will apply for an urgent court hearing in the same way Miller did when she challenged the prorogation of parliament last year. Dolan runs his chartered airline business out of Southend in Essex and employs about 600 people across 10 companies. He said he had no political affiliation but mounted the action because he feared the cure for coronavirus would be \u201cworse than the disease\u201d, with cancer referrals and chemotherapy down and as many as 18,000 extra cancer deaths predicted, according to recent research by University College London. Reports of domestic violence have risen, and police reported early signs of an increase in suicides and suicide attempts. \u201cThe lockdown is telling us to stop living to avoid dying,\u201d Dolan said. \u201cTo imprison people in their homes is an extremely dramatic decision to make.

Why are we prevaricating? It\u2019s like the government is now keeping this going to justify their original decision, whereas what they should do is say we did this and now we are doing something different.\u201d His action comes as pressure to relax lockdowns extends around the globe, with the most extreme examples in the US, where gun-toting protesters entered Michigan\u2019s state building on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s not storming the city halls with guns like in America, but British people have done their bit, made their sacrifices but life has to go on and it\u2019s going to be really hard for years to come,\u201d said Dolan. He said the crowdfunding drive was an attempt to test British people\u2019s \u201cbackbone\u201d as he was \u201camazed nobody else was doing something\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Some British Airways staff were volunteering in hospitals serving drinks to NHS nurses; about half were furloughed on coronavirus lockdown; a scant few were actually operating flights when a life-changing email was sent their way. One pilot, on unpaid leave, was having tea at home when his daughter burst in, upset, to relay news reports that 12,000 BA staff faced the sack \u2013 more than one in four of the workforce. Only a little later did the message arrive from the airline\u2019s chief executive, Alex Cruz, confirming \u201cpossible reductions in headcount\u201d. Although ominous warnings about aviation\u2019s biblical losses and bankrupt airlines had been ringing out for weeks, the announcement to the stock exchange by BA\u2019s parent company, International Airlines Group (IAG), still came as a shock. Until that moment the biggest, most profitable carriers, had made only smaller cuts, furloughing staff and reducing fleet orders. And around Europe, governments were rushing to guarantee the survival of their flag carriers, with billions of state aid. As Air France and KLM sealed a \u20ac10bn package between them, and German ministers pledged to back Lufthansa, Cruz told his staff that there was \u201cno government bailout standing by for BA\u201d. But why? A refrain echoed by several past and present employees is that BA was \u201cnever an airline to let a crisis go to waste\u201d. The situation was, as Cruz headlined a previous all-staff memo in March, a matter of survival. But, if convincing the government to resist bailing out all airlines meant BA could ultimately survive a crisis that might fatally wound its nemesis, Virgin Atlantic, and let it force through unwelcome changes on its own unionised workforce \u2013 for BA bosses, recovery would be sweet indeed. Despite Cruz\u2019s blunt words on state aid, the decision was a matter for owners IAG, which also owns Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus. So far it has remained tight-lipped \u2013 but on Friday it accepted a \u20ac1bn loan backed by the Spanish government, just three days after the BA redundancies were announced. IAG\u2019s chief executive, Willie Walsh, has long set out his stall against handouts in the UK. In January, when most carriers were still regarding coronavirus as a blip that might impact long-haul routes to China, the future of one regional carrier, Flybe, was deemed significant enough for government intervention. But as ministers looked set to offer assistance, IAG cried foul. Flybe was owned by a consortium led by Virgin Atlantic, BA\u2019s old rival, which had grand visions of the doomed airline being its own domestic feeder network as it became a \u201csecond flag carrier\u201d at Heathrow. Later, when the full extent of the coronavirus crisis hit, and airlines led by Virgin called for a bailout for the beleaguered sector, IAG was quick to distance itself. Walsh said they were having \u201cno dialogue with any governments\u201d for handouts, adding: \u201cI think governments would expect airlines to look at self-help before they would call on governments to provide state aid.\u201d They did, however, \u201cavail of general facilities\u201d offered in Rishi Sunak\u2019s economic stimulus: about 22,000 BA staff were furloughed, worth up to \u00a3110m. Meanwhile, in a sealed IAG office inside BA\u2019s Waterside HQ near Heathrow, a team of around 80, largely the bean counters of the group, set to work on emergency plans that would revive a long-held vision on how to slash BA\u2019s costs. What emerged later on Tuesday night in an email to unions was a proposal of not just job losses but vastly reduced terms and conditions for long-serving pilots, cabin crew and ground staff. Far from cushioning those made redundant, or incentivising voluntary redundancy, the airline said it could now afford to only pay the bare statutory minimum. Unite denounced it as \u201cunlawful and immoral\u201d; other employees described it as \u201ca bloodbath\u201d and \u201cbeing thrown to the wolves\u201d. Staff that keep their jobs will be forced onto the inferior contracts offered to new entrants since 2010.

However, some in the City and at BA believe that the airline might yet change its tune on state aid once Virgin is either bailed out \u2013 or no longer exists. Nonetheless, some carriers expecting state aid are taking decisions that Lobbenberg says would \u201cbe challenging for labour or governments\u201d, such as Lufthansa closing its no-frills operation Germanwings. With the entire sector in such upheaval and no clear, imminent route back to mass travel, it is hard to see what kind of industry, let alone BA, will emerge. Yet few believe BA would abandon Gatwick, or give up valuable Heathrow slots \u2013 and losing a quarter of the workforce may not mean shrinking operations by the same amount.

The US oil company reported a loss of $610m for the first quarter of the year following the outbreak of coronavirus, compared to a profit of $2.4bn in the same months last year. The financial slump includes a $2.9bn writedown to the value of its oil reserves after oil prices tumbled by more than 70% this year due to the sudden drop in demand for oil and transport fuels as major economies impose Covid-19 lockdowns. In the US, oil prices turned negative for the first time owing to a catastrophic oversupply of oil that risks overwhelming traditional oil storage facilities and has forced traders to turn to empty crude tankers, rail freight containers and salt caverns to store the unwanted crude. Darren Woods, Exxon\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cCovid-19 has significantly impacted near-term demand, resulting in oversupplied markets and unprecedented pressure on commodity prices and margins.\u201d The price of US oil, known as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), climbed to around $20 a barrel on Friday ahead of planned production cuts from the world\u2019s largest oil producers which are due to begin this month. The global oil price, Brent crude, rose to more than $26 a barrel. Chevron, the second largest oil company in the US, said it would rein in its annual spending plans by a further $2bn this year to $14bn, down sharply from its original $20bn spending budget, in order to safeguard the company\u2019s shareholder dividends.

Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the CCDH, said that Facebook must now look at what he described as a vast network of pages and groups in which Icke\u2019s content was being shared. \u201cWhile people around the world make enormous sacrifices to stall this pandemic, social media firms are instead profiting from the proliferation of misinformation on their platforms,\u201d he said. \u201cMisinformation puts all of our lives at risk by encouraging the public not to comply with clinical guidance. The action against Icke\u2019s social media presence was also welcomed by Hope Not Hate, which said: \u201cIcke\u2019s deluded, often antisemitic, posts encourage harmful lies to spread. Other platforms should follow Facebook\u2019s lead.\u201d The local television station London Live was sanctioned recently after the media regulator, Ofcom, found it had posed a threat to the public\u2019s health by showing a lengthy interview with Icke about the coronavirus pandemic. Icke, who has repeated discredited claims that the pandemic is linked to 5G, had used the broadcast to claim without evidence that the pandemic was cover for a supposed global world order to crash the economy, end the use of cash payments and track people.",

While the coronavirus has spread widely across the UK, the pandemic has taken a huge toll on the area where Islam lives, the east London borough of Newham, which has recorded the worst mortality rate in England and Wales.</p> <p>The borough\u2019s rate \u2013 144.3 deaths per 100,000 people \u2013 is closely followed by Brent in north London (141.5), and Newham\u2019s neighbour Hackney (127.4), according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics.

They are young and old. It\u2019s been really tough,\u201d Islam said. His wife, who wished to remain anonymous, said: \u201cYou hear sad stories of people dying and no one was with them. It does affect people mentally.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07d1cc9110fd5a8d476291eb86fbf714c3d60ebf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07d1cc9110fd5a8d476291eb86fbf714c3d60ebf/0_333_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A closed corner shop in Newham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A closed corner shop in Newham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The deaths from the coronavirus include Betty and Ken Hill, who were together for more than 40 years and died hours apart; Dr Yusuf Patel, who was the fifth GP to succumb to the virus in the UK; \u201cexceptional\u201d secondary school English teacher Dr Louisa Rajakumari; and Abdul Karim Sheikh, the former ceremonial mayor who founded one of the first mosques in the area. </p> <p>The pandemic comes nearly a decade after the area hosted the 2012 Olympic Games, and has become a stark reminder that the better jobs, housing and quality of life that were promised have failed to materialise. Though parts of the borough have undergone regeneration and housing prices have rocketed, the legacy of the games wasn\u2019t felt by all.</p> <p>Rokhsana Fiaz, who was elected mayor of Newham nearly two years ago, said: \u201cI\u2019ve grown up in the borough and lived here all my life. Like many of my friends, the opportunities that were promised with regards to the Olympics weren\u2019t necessarily felt by me or my peer group. There\u2019s a real sense of haves and have nots in the community. My promise has been we\u2019re going to reverse that because everyone in Newham needs to have a stake.\u201d</p> <p>The borough\u2019s deprivation and diversity makes it particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus. More than half of children live in poverty, while the rate of households in temporary accommodation is one of the highest in England. A study commissioned by the council found that up to 36,000 people are not paid the legally required national minimum wage.</p> <p>Newham has the most diverse population profile of any local authority in the country. Some 78% of residents are from ethnic minority communities, which has been reported as a risk factor for the coronavirus. Many live in intergenerational households and there are longstanding health inequalities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c66e5ac340b5f16c0d6b3fff3712732f96a3f9e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c66e5ac340b5f16c0d6b3fff3712732f96a3f9e4/400_573_4600_2760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tahir Mirza, chair of East Ham Labour party.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tahir Mirza, chair of East Ham Labour party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tahir Mirza, Newham resident and chair of the local Labour party in East Ham, described the deaths in his area as \u201ctruly shocking\u201d and called for more efforts for people in the community to get guidelines on social distancing in their own language. He said many didn\u2019t speak English and were simply unaware of the dangers they faced. The consequences of failing to reach these people will be dire, he said: \u201cPeople will continue to die otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Zubaida Haque, deputy director of the Runnymede Trust, said areas like Newham show the discussion about PPE and testing needs to go much further than just the NHS. Key workers, from taxi drivers and care workers to grocery shop owners, who are disproportionately from a BAME background, also require protective equipment. \u201cBAME key workers aren\u2019t just NHS staff. We need to start asking whether they are getting proper PPE equipment. Are they being protected? Are they being tested? Is that infrastructure there?\u201d</p> <p>Peter Raison, a 58-year-old train driver for Transport for London who lives across the road from Islam, is also not surprised by the high level of mortality. Many like him on their street have to go to work and even he isn\u2019t being provided with PPE. He is upset that there are people still failing to socially distance as the death tolls increase. \u201cPeople are just assuming it\u2019s not going to happen to me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Kamrul Islam doesn\u2019t dare visit his local supermarket. Over the last few weeks, he said three of his closest friends fell ill with the coronavirus shortly after shopping there. One friend\u2019s mother became seriously unwell after contracting the virus and died. The 40-year-old former cab driver says a day doesn\u2019t go by when he isn\u2019t aware of a death or infection of someone he knows. While the coronavirus has spread widely across the UK, the pandemic has taken a huge toll on the area where Islam lives, the east London borough of Newham, which has recorded the worst mortality rate in England and Wales. The borough\u2019s rate \u2013 144.3 deaths per 100,000 people \u2013 is closely followed by Brent in north London (141.5), and Newham\u2019s neighbour Hackney (127.4), according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics. The data confirms what Islam has suspected all along: people living in the poorest parts of the country are dying from Covid-19 at a much higher rate than those in the richest. On Islam\u2019s road and neighbouring street, 22 people have died after contracting coronavirus. \u201cEvery day I get a message from someone in my community telling me of people who have died. They are young and old. It\u2019s been really tough,\u201d Islam said. His wife, who wished to remain anonymous, said: \u201cYou hear sad stories of people dying and no one was with them. It does affect people mentally.\u201d The deaths from the coronavirus include Betty and Ken Hill, who were together for more than 40 years and died hours apart; Dr Yusuf Patel, who was the fifth GP to succumb to the virus in the UK; \u201cexceptional\u201d secondary school English teacher Dr Louisa Rajakumari; and Abdul Karim Sheikh, the former ceremonial mayor who founded one of the first mosques in the area. The pandemic comes nearly a decade after the area hosted the 2012 Olympic Games, and has become a stark reminder that the better jobs, housing and quality of life that were promised have failed to materialise. Though parts of the borough have undergone regeneration and housing prices have rocketed, the legacy of the games wasn\u2019t felt by all. Rokhsana Fiaz, who was elected mayor of Newham nearly two years ago, said: \u201cI\u2019ve grown up in the borough and lived here all my life. Like many of my friends, the opportunities that were promised with regards to the Olympics weren\u2019t necessarily felt by me or my peer group. There\u2019s a real sense of haves and have nots in the community. My promise has been we\u2019re going to reverse that because everyone in Newham needs to have a stake.\u201d The borough\u2019s deprivation and diversity makes it particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus. More than half of children live in poverty, while the rate of households in temporary accommodation is one of the highest in England. A study commissioned by the council found that up to 36,000 people are not paid the legally required national minimum wage. Newham has the most diverse population profile of any local authority in the country. Some 78% of residents are from ethnic minority communities, which has been reported as a risk factor for the coronavirus. Many live in intergenerational households and there are longstanding health inequalities. Tahir Mirza, Newham resident and chair of the local Labour party in East Ham, described the deaths in his area as \u201ctruly shocking\u201d and called for more efforts for people in the community to get guidelines on social distancing in their own language. He said many didn\u2019t speak English and were simply unaware of the dangers they faced. The consequences of failing to reach these people will be dire, he said: \u201cPeople will continue to die otherwise.\u201d Dr Zubaida Haque, deputy director of the Runnymede Trust, said areas like Newham show the discussion about PPE and testing needs to go much further than just the NHS. Key workers, from taxi drivers and care workers to grocery shop owners, who are disproportionately from a BAME background, also require protective equipment. \u201cBAME key workers aren\u2019t just NHS staff. We need to start asking whether they are getting proper PPE equipment. Are they being protected? Are they being tested? Is that infrastructure there?\u201d Peter Raison, a 58-year-old train driver for Transport for London who lives across the road from Islam, is also not surprised by the high level of mortality. Many like him on their street have to go to work and even he isn\u2019t being provided with PPE. He is upset that there are people still failing to socially distance as the death tolls increase. \u201cPeople are just assuming it\u2019s not going to happen to me.\u201d",

Despite world leaders starting to outline plans to lift lockdown measures more than a month on from the depths of the crisis, the economic fallout from tight controls on social and business activity during the Covid-19 outbreak are now becoming increasingly clear. Faced with a deep recession in an election year, Trump escalated his attack on Beijing by claiming he had seen evidence showing the virus originated in a Chinese laboratory. The US president is increasingly making China\u2019s handling of the pandemic a major issue as his ratings sag ahead of his November re-election campaign. Reports suggested the White House is crafting renewed import tariffs that would be applied to Chinese imports in retaliation, in a major escalation of the trade standoff. The US and China had signed the first phase of a trade deal earlier this year to de-escalate trade tensions between Washington and Beijing that had damaged global growth last year and sapped business investment around the world. However, progress has been derailed at the onset of a blame game over Covid-19 as the number of infections around the world climbs, with the US recording the highest official death toll of any country so far.

      "bodyText": "The government must prioritise health funding for the most deprived regions in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, politicians and public health experts have demanded, after new data analysis revealed the devastating scale of the death toll in the poorest parts of England and Wales. In findings one expert said highlighted the fact that Covid-19 \u201cis not a leveller\u201d as politicians have repeatedly claimed, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that those living in the poorest parts of England and Wales were dying at twice the rate of those in the richest areas. With 55.1 deaths per 100,000 people in the most deprived places compared with 25.3 in the least deprived, the King\u2019s Fund health thinktank demanded the government focus new resources to reverse health inequalities as the crisis eases. The findings came as another 739 people died across the UK, bringing the total to 27,510. They echo last week\u2019s report from the Guardian that members of ethnic minority groups were particularly badly affected by the virus, with those from BAME backgrounds overrepresented in the toll by 27%. Responding to the analysis at the government\u2019s briefing on Friday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, acknowledged the issue, saying: \u201cThis is something we are worried about and looking at.\u201d He added, however, that the findings should be seen in the context of disproportionate deaths among men, older people, minorities and other subgroups. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it in the context of all of the different ways that this disease seems to have a different impact,\u201d he said. Critics said impact of austerity in the poorest communities was behind the new data. Steve Rotheram, the Labour mayor for the Liverpool city region argued that deprivation must be a factor in how spending is allocated to deal with costs incurred during the crisis.. Liverpool has one of the highest Covid-19 death rates outside London, with 303 deaths, amounting to 81.8 deaths per 100,000 people, and is the local authority to have suffered the biggest cuts to its budget since 2010. The city region\u2019s councils are already warning of a \u00a3137m funding gap between the money they have spent dealing with coronavirus and the funds pledged to them by government, said Rotherham. He called for a change in the methodology of the Treasury\u2019s \u201cgreen book\u201d, which guides government spending, in order to prioritise the most deprived areas \u2013 rather than the per capita approach it currently takes. \u201cDeprivation should be factored into Treasury-book methodology across the board but specifically in relation to this. Local authorities were promised \u2018whatever it takes\u2019. The first allocation of fund was given on a needs basis but the second wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said.

However, the <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-performance/revealed-how-government-changed-the-rules-to-hit-100000-tests-target/7027544.article\">HSJ reported</a> that the government was including home-testing kits sent out by post in the tally of tests to reach the target, even if the recipient has not yet provided and returned their sample.

London had the highest mortality rate, with the highest age-standardised mortality rates in the borough of Newham (144.3 deaths per 100,000), followed by Brent (141.5) and Hackney (127.4).</li> \n   <li><strong>Nicola Sturgeon adopted a cautious tone warning that it was \u201cnot safe\u201d to lift lockdown restrictions for some time yet.</strong> This was in striking contrast with Boris Johnson\u2019s optimistic tone yesterday that the UK is \u201cpast the peak\u201d. The first minister of Scotland appeared concerned at the suggestion that the worst is over, later saying, \u201cProgress is fragile and if we ease up it will be reversed. So we need to encourage maximum compliance with current restrictions\u201d.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Face coverings have a \u201cweak but positive effect\u201d in slowing the spread of the virus, the PM\u2019s spokesman told the lobby briefing.</strong> Ministers have not yet made a final decision on whether the public will be advised to wear face coverings or not, but the advice suggests they have a weak but also positive effect in reducing transmission from asymptomatic people where physical distancing isn\u2019t possible. The housing secretary Robert Jenrick also said this morning wearing one was a \u201cpersonal choice\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Ryanair announced plans for 3,000 job cuts as a direct result of the pandemic.</strong> The airline said it expects to operate under 1% of its schedule between April and June, and expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing to 2019 levels to take at least two years. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from us on the UK side.

However, the recent reports of growing alcohol sales and our own research showing that one million of us in Scotland are drinking more under lockdown, highlight the ongoing issue we still have with alcohol in this country. It remains to be seen what impact social distancing will have and what new challenges it will throw up. But it is unlikely that Scotland\u2019s unhealthy relationship with alcohol will be changed for the better.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Discussions are currently taking place in the Scottish government about a

      "bodyText": "The government said it passed its 100,000 tests per day target, amid claims the tally has been artificially boosted. At the daily press briefing Matt Hancock said as of 9am today there were 122,347 tests in the UK, a significant rise on Thursday\u2019s figure of 81,611. However, the HSJ reported that the government was including home-testing kits sent out by post in the tally of tests to reach the target, even if the recipient has not yet provided and returned their sample. It was claimed that, until recently, tests were only recorded in the daily count once they had been sent to a laboratory for analysis. The government, however, denied there had been a change. Deprived areas have double the death rate of affluent ones, new figures from the ONS revealed. The most deprived areas registered 55.1 coronavirus-related deaths per 100,000 people, 118% times that in the least deprived areas where the rate was 25.3 per 100,000. London had the highest mortality rate, with the highest age-standardised mortality rates in the borough of Newham (144.3 deaths per 100,000), followed by Brent (141.5) and Hackney (127.4). Nicola Sturgeon adopted a cautious tone warning that it was \u201cnot safe\u201d to lift lockdown restrictions for some time yet. This was in striking contrast with Boris Johnson\u2019s optimistic tone yesterday that the UK is \u201cpast the peak\u201d. The first minister of Scotland appeared concerned at the suggestion that the worst is over, later saying, \u201cProgress is fragile and if we ease up it will be reversed. So we need to encourage maximum compliance with current restrictions\u201d. Face coverings have a \u201cweak but positive effect\u201d in slowing the spread of the virus, the PM\u2019s spokesman told the lobby briefing. Ministers have not yet made a final decision on whether the public will be advised to wear face coverings or not, but the advice suggests they have a weak but also positive effect in reducing transmission from asymptomatic people where physical distancing isn\u2019t possible. The housing secretary Robert Jenrick also said this morning wearing one was a \u201cpersonal choice\u201d. Ryanair announced plans for 3,000 job cuts as a direct result of the pandemic. The airline said it expects to operate under 1% of its schedule between April and June, and expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing to 2019 levels to take at least two years. That\u2019s it from us on the UK side. Thanks to everybody who got in touch throughout the day with tips and suggestions, and to all of you for reading along. If you would like to continue following the Guardian\u2019s coronavirus coverage, head over to our global live blog for the worldwide picture. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the government has gone well past its goal of 100,000 tests a day to combat coronavirus, but faced claims that the number had been artificially inflated. In his press briefing on Friday at 5pm, Hancock said in the 24 hours up to 9am on Friday there were 122,347 tests in the UK, a significant rise on Thursday\u2019s figure of 81,611. \u201cI knew that it was an audacious goal but we needed an audacious goal,\u201d he said. \u201cI can announce that we have met our goal.\u201d Hancock immediately hailed the outcome as an \u201cincredible achievement\u201d and vindication for his strategy of focusing on a goal that had seemed well out of the government\u2019s reach as recently as last week. But earlier on Friday, the Health Service Journal (HSJ) reported that the government was including home-testing kits sent out by post in the tally of tests, even if the recipient has not yet provided and returned their sample. It was claimed that, until recently, tests were only recorded in the daily count once they had been sent to a laboratory for analysis. The government, however, denied there had been a change. This is from the shadow health secretary The number of confirmed cases among prisons in England and Wales continues to rise, a daily update from the Ministry of Justice shows. As of 5pm on Thursday, there were 345 prisoners who had tested positive for Covid-19 across 73 prisons, a rise of 1% in 24 hours, while the number of infected prison staff rose 2% in the same period to 371 in 64 prisons. A Public Health England paper published earlier this week said there was cause for \u201ccautious optimism\u201d across the prison estate as deaths and cases were lower than expected. But the same paper warned that some of the measures currently in place would have to continue until April next year. Q. A Nursing Times survey indicates nurses are feeling more anxious at work and their mental health is suffering, what will be done about this in the long-term to retain nurses? Hancock says nurses have shown great bravery during the pandemic. He says increasing the number of nurses is an important part of the plan. Q. Have BAME nursing staff been put at greater risk? Powis says they recognise the disproportionate effect the virus is having on BAME staff. Work is being done to understand why this is, he says. Newton says the virus is present in different ways in different parts of the country, which are comprised of people from different backgrounds. The underlying risks need to be identified and understood, he says. Some ethnic groups have different risks of underlying conditions, he adds. PHE and universities are looking at this, and feeding back to NHS England, he says. Powis adds this data isn\u2019t needed to provide support and specialist assistance is being offered. Local healthcare leaders are being told to do what\u2019s necessary to protect BME workers. And that\u2019s it, the press conference has ended. Q. The impact in Northern Ireland has been lower than in the rest of the UK. Is there any merit in eventually easing restrictions here at a different pace? Hancock says the virus has affected different regions differently but the fall has been basically the same throughout the country. Moving together was the right approach, he says. He says he sees the case that could be made for lifting restrictions at a different pace. Q. Would it be better for Stormont to work on an all-Ireland basis to fight the pandemic rather than following the UK lead? Hancock says the relationship with the Republic of Ireland is important but the relationship is intensive within the UK. Q. Can you reassure over-70s they will treated the same as the rest of the population when lockdown is over? Hancock says it was clear from the start that specific groups need to shield. Powis adds that the over-70s can be fit and healthy, not everybody at that age has a chronic health condition or underlying disease. A group of individuals, some of whom are in that age bracket, needed to shield because underlying conditions put them more at risk, he says. Everybody is being asked to stay at home so we\u2019re all in the same boat in that sense, he adds. As the infection rate comes under control going forward, this will be under consideration. Q. Is late summer a realistic timescale for people to be able to make plans to meet up with friends and family or go on holiday? Hancock says it\u2019s tempting to speculate on this but it\u2019s still too early to say, we just don\u2019t know, he says. The five tests are there partly to give people a sense of when we can make those next decisions, he says. We\u2019ll only lift lockdown measures when it\u2019s safe to do so, he says. As of today, it\u2019s too soon to say. Q. A report in the HSJ says tests are now being counted once posted out rather than once the sample has been processed, is that true? Newton says there has been no change to the way tests are counted. With new ways of delivering tests, officials have given advice on how they should be counted, he says. The majority are counted in labs, but for any test which takes place outside the programme they\u2019re counted when they leave the programme, he says. So tests that are mailed out or go out by satellite, have always been counted that way. That\u2019s the way they are counted, have always been counted and were advised to count them by officials. Q. What\u2019s your reaction to the report that you\u2019re twice as likely to die from Covid-19 if you live in a deprived part of the country, what policy implications does that have? Hancock says this is something we\u2019re worried about and looking at. It has a bigger impact on older people, men, people from BME backgrounds, people who are obese, and new evidence from the ONS suggests there is a correlation with deprivation \u2013 these are all being looked at, he says. Q. The daily testing figure is a massive increase in a short period of time. How many of those are home testing kits that were mailed out yesterday but haven\u2019t actually been yet returned and analysed by labs? Newton says the NHS and PHE labs across the four nations have done 39,753 tests between them. A partnership with Roche undertook 13,723 tests. The tests undertaken by the new Lighthouse labs total 79,522, he says. These include drive-through, mobile units and research nurses for the ONS. There were 27,497 home kits delivered, and 12,782 delivered through the satellite process. Under the surveillance tests (antibody testing) there were 3,072 undertaken. That makes up the breakdown of today\u2019s testing figure, he says. Q. How much weight do you put on a South Korean study that suggests you cannot get the virus a second time? Newton says the science on immunity is still emerging and not precise. You would never make a decision based on a single study, he says. These results would need to be replicated elsewhere, but it is surely promising and encouraging, he adds. Q. Was a Public Health England official wrong to suggest that children don\u2019t seem able to transmit the disease? Powis says if a child is symptomatic, there\u2019s no reason to think they won\u2019t transmit like anyone else. The question is for children who don\u2019t have any symptoms who get the virus, he says. How transmissible the virus is in these cases is a key question we\u2019re still learning about, the evidence is still emerging, he says. Newton says this is his understanding also. Q. Can you ensure that health and care workers get priority so they can get tested? Hancock says yes, either through the NHS itself or through the employer route which will give them priority for getting a drive-through slot. Once we have contact tracing in place on a large-scale, we need to test them as soon as possible so they can isolate and not pass on the disease, he adds. This is a new priority for testing, once it\u2019s up and running by the middle of the month, he says. They are taking questions from the media now. Q. How do you intend to further develop and extend the testing network? Hancock says very soon we should get the results of surveys to show how many people have the disease across the country. A new lab is coming on stream next week in Cambridge, he says. Capacity needs to focus on care homes to tackle the epidemic there, he says. Newton says the work of the new labs must integrate with the existing structures to help use the new capacity to maximum benefit, e.g. getting results back to GPs, he says. The rollout of home testing will be useful for contact tracing and rapid, he adds. Stuart from Redditch asks if the Nightingale hospitals will be used going forward to help reduce NHS waiting lists as we come through the pandemic? Hancock says the Nightingales were designed specifically for patients with Covid-19. Powis adds they were created to provide extra capacity for ventilated patients. They are designed in a particular way for a particular purpose, so they wouldn\u2019t necessarily be appropriate for other uses, he says. They are also there as an insurance policy, he says. They are taking questions from members of the public now. Andrew from Leeds asks if there will be fines if people choose to keep their children off school once the lockdown is lifted and schools have reopened. How will the government make sure the public is confident it\u2019s safe? Hancock says when it is safe to do so, the government will make recommendations on this. We\u2019re not going to reopen schools if it isn\u2019t safe, he says. This disease doesn\u2019t appear to give children symptoms nearly as bad as adults, he says. Powis says the virus affects children much less than adults and the elderly. There have been rare reports about complications in children, which are being looked at, he says. The science is still evolving about transmission in children, but the key thing is the disease is not serious for the vast majority of younger people, he says. Hancock says the decision to close schools was down to the impact of schools on transmission, not on the safety of children, he says. Powis says most people are avoiding contact with vulnerable people, including 84% of adults have only left their for permitted reasons or not left their home. More people (45%) are working from home since the measures were introduced, he says. The number of tests have increased \u201cdramatically\u201d in the last few days, he says. The number of new cases as determined by positive tests have increased in recent days. This should be seen in the context of more testing, he says. Overall, the number is relatively stable, he says, which reflects the number of infections is falling. Hospital admissions have been falling, particularly in London. It\u2019s moving down in other regions too more slowly, but overall the trend is downwards. The number of people in critical care is falling in the four nations, he says. Deaths in all settings is overall showing a downward trend. Prof Powis is going through the slides now. The transmission rate, the reproduction rate, the number of new infections is falling, keeping pressure off the NHS, he says. The five tests for adjusting the lockdown are: the NHS continues to have sufficient capacity sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths reliable data to show rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board PPE and other factors including testing must be in hand with supply to meet future demand a second peak must be avoided as it runs a risk of overwhelming the NHS Prof Newton is speaking now. The decision to enter lockdown was not linked to the lack of tests, he says. Access to limitless testing, even if we had had it, would not have made a difference, he says. The decision to enter lockdown would have been the same, and at the same time, he says. We can relax social distancing only when the five tests are met, he says. That means getting the infection rate right down. We now have a flexible and substantial testing capability in the UK, he says, to tell us how the virus is spreading across the country. The new NHS app is \u201cmaking rapid progress\u201d. He encourages people to sign up. Hancock says he knew the goal of 100,000 tests by the end of the month was \u201caudacious\u201d. He says the government has met its goal. The number of tests yesterday was 122,347, he says. The health secretary is speaking now. Hancock says he will talk about testing, after the daily statistics. Now that we\u2019re past the peak, the restoration of NHS fertility services can begin, he says. 177,454 people have tested positive, an increase of 6,201 since yesterday. 15,111 people are currently in hospital, and 27,510 people have now died across all settings, an increase of 739. In a race to meet the government\u2019s target of 100,000 coronavirus tests per day by this evening\u2019s deadline, hospitals appear to have ramped up testing. A reader has been in touch to report a sudden surge in the number of samples arriving for analysis at the laboratory for Great Ormond Street children\u2019s hospital. Demand for tests had been surprisingly low until this week, and staffing was more than halved as a consequence. On Sunday 18 April, the lab apparently received no samples at all. However, since Wednesday the situation has reversed, with technicians now processing as many as 600 samples a day. The Guardian understands that all patients and staff, whether they have Covid-19 symptoms or not, have been encouraged to take the test, along with the families and carers of patients. This follows guidance from NHS England asking hospitals to expand testing to all non-elective (serious and emergency) patients from Monday this week. Testing has apparently included children being shielded from infection on isolation wards. The procedure involves inserting a q-tip shaped swab into the nose, and another into the throat - an uncomfortable experience even for adults. A spokesperson for the hospital said: In line with national guidance we are testing all non-elective in-patients for Covid-19. Where possible we are taking the additional step of testing the parents and carers who accompany them. The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, will front this afternoon\u2019s daily government news briefing, which is due to begin shortly. He will be joined by Prof John Newton, co-ordinator of the UK coronavirus testing programme, and Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director for NHS England. The Premier League\u2019s 20 clubs outlined at a meeting on Friday their determination to complete the season amid the pandemic. Although no decisions were taken on the next steps, the participants are understood to have been pleased with the progress made. A lengthy meeting included plenty of discussion about logistics, including how to lock down grounds and create safe environments, the possibility of playing matches at neutral venues, and protocols around testing, including the regularity with which those should be done. In a statement the league said: The clubs reconfirmed their commitment to finishing the 2019-20 season, maintaining integrity of the competition and welcomed the government\u2019s support. The league and clubs are considering the first tentative moves forward and will only return to training and playing with government guidance, under expert medical advice and after consultation with players and managers. NHS staff from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds may be given roles away from the frontline under plans to reduce their disproportionately high death rate from Covid-19. The Guardian revealed last week that minority groups were over-represented by as much as 27% in the overall Covid-19 death toll. Additionally, 63% of the first 106 health and social care staff known to have died from the virus were black or Asian, according to the Health Service Journal. In this explainer, my colleague Haroon Siddique looks at the figures and explains why BAME people may be more at risk. Care workers in Wales will each receive a \u00a3500 bonus to reflect their \u201cvalue\u201d during the pandemic, the first minister has announced. Mark Drakeford said the payments would be made to around 64,000 care home workers and domiciliary care workers who provide the \u201cscaffolding\u201d of services across the country. He told the Welsh government\u2019s daily Covid-19 briefing on Friday: This payment is designed to provide some further recognition of the value we attach to everything they are doing. This group of people, usually women, often not well paid, are providing the invisible scaffolding of services which support both our NHS and our wider society. Without this small army of people, large numbers of others would not be able to continue to live independently at home, or receive everyday support with basic needs by living in a residential care home. Drakeford noted some of the social care workforce were among the lowest paid in Wales, and that the picture contrasted with the Welsh NHS where there are pay bands, and salaries meet or exceed the living wage. He also called on the UK government to waive tax and national insurance deductions from the one-off payment, on the basis the country was experiencing \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d. Local authorities are expected to administer the payments but no date was given as to when they will be made. Some mid-afternoon joy. This is from Palmerston, the Foreign Office mouser More than two-thirds of London\u2019s pavements are not wide enough to allow people to follow physical distancing advice to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission, according to new research. Only 36% of pavements in Greater London are at least 3 metres wide, allowing pedestrians to meet the government\u2019s advice for people to stay at least 2 metres apart when outdoors, found researchers from University College London. There are also broad variations of the proportion of pavements wide enough to allow physical distancing in different London boroughs, according to the Streets research group, which includes academics from UCL\u2019s Bartlett school of architecture. The City of London has the highest percentage (51%) of streets that meet the minimum requirement, while Hammersmith and Fulham, Wandsworth, Richmond upon Thames and Newham and Haringey all have the lowest (between 26-28%), according to their analysis. Dr Ashley Dhanani, a member of the project team and a research associate at the Bartlett\u2019s Space Syntax Laboratory, said: While some may opt to walk in the road, this is not possible for people with pushchairs or with mobility impairments. Our research shows that there is an urgent need to reallocate street space in London so everyone can use streets safely. You can download a map of London that shows all the streets where there are at least six metres of non-road space here. These are the streets that have enough space on either side for pedestrians to stay 2 metres apart. NHS England has announced 352 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 20,483. The 352 patients were aged between 30 and 103 years old, and 18 of them (aged between 43 and 98 years old) had no known underlying health condition. Of the 352 new hospital deaths announced today by NHS England: - 70 occurred on 30 April - 148 occurred on 29 April - 39 occurred on 28 April The figures also show 70 of the new deaths took place between 1-27 April, while the remaining 25 deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 16 March. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks earlier. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for postmortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated. Today\u2019s figures published by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day, with a current total of 863. Magdalen College, Oxford did their traditional May morning celebrations virtually this year. Researchers are to launch a new trial of a Japanese-manufactured drug they believe could be a \u201cpromising\u201d treatment for Covid-19. A total of 450 hospital inpatients with mild to moderate symptoms of the disease will be recruited to take part in the study in the UK. The randomised control trial will see some receive favipiravir, an anti-viral drug produced by Fujifilm Toyama Chemicals in Japan. Other patients will received a combination treatment of hydroxychloroquine, zinc and azithromycin, while a third group will be given existing standard care for Covid-19. Chelsea and Westminster hospital and West Middlesex university hospital in London are participating in the trial, which also involves Imperial College and the Royal Brompton hospital. University Hospitals Leuven in Belgium aims to start a trial on up to 200 patients at a later date. Pallav Shah, a professor in respiratory medicine at Chelsea and Westminster hospital and the study\u2019s chief investigator, said the study will target early cases of Covid-19 in the hope of finding a treatment which prevents patients progressing into intensive care, reduces the length of their hospital stay and limits their infectiousness. Patients with symptoms such as breathlessness and a fever will be approached to take part in the study before swab results even come back to ensure treatment can be given early. There have been 18 further deaths in Northern Ireland of patients who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total deaths in the region recorded so far by the Department of Health to 365. The award-winning Scottish orchestra Nevis Ensemble launched the Living Room Ensemble with the aim of putting together a series of performances by musicians and music lovers from across the country, performing at home and shown online. They asked people to submit videos of themselves playing instruments, banging pots and pans, singing along or dancing to the same piece of music. The finished product is now on YouTube, featuring 160 musicians and singers from 15 countries performing I\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles) by The Proclaimers.

McDonald\u2019s is to reopen a number of UK restaurants for delivery from 13 May after closing all of its sites due to the coronavirus lockdown. The locations of the 15 restaurants will be announced next week. The fast food chain has spent this week testing its operations behind closed doors in preparation to reopen sites, PA reports. Paul Pomroy, the chain\u2019s boss for the UK and Ireland, said the tests were successful, after the company said it had incorporated feedback from staff after the tests and worked closely with the government and trade bodies regarding its reopening plans. All restaurants will be deep cleaned prior to reopening, with new safety measures such as perspex screens, floor markings and smaller teams. The chain will also serve a limited menu and will not be serving breakfast. Staff will also receive protective equipment, such as non-medical-grade face masks, and have their temperatures taken with \u201ccontactless thermometers\u201d before shifts. Social distancing measures will be introduced for all delivery and service partners including Uber Eats and Just Eat. Pomroy added: Slowly, but safely, we will return to towns and cities across the UK and Ireland and thank you for your continued support as we work through this crisis.\u201d The general public should turn to reusable face masks, not single-use surgical masks, if face coverings become part of the UK\u2019s exit strategy for the Covid-19 pandemic, experts have said in a new report, revealing the move would save 128,000 tonnes of un-recyclable plastic waste. At a press conference yesterday, Boris Johnson said face masks could be useful as part of the UK\u2019s exit strategy, suggesting they may help people have confidence in returning to work. However expert advice on the use of face masks among the general public has been mixed. It is understood the UK\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has advised the government there is weak evidence face masks can reduce the spread of infection \u2013 a stance similar to that of the World Health Organization and others who say there is little evidence they reduce the risk of a wearer becoming infected. Concerns have also been raised that any recommendation for the public to use face masks could lead to shortages of surgical masks among health and social care workers. But some scientists have said the public should wear masks as a part of the \u201cprecautionary principle\u201d, adding these can be homemade since cloth masks are better than no covering in reducing the amount of droplets sprayed from people\u2019s mouths. Now the Plastic Waste Innovation Hub at University College London has issued a report revealing that cloth masks would save vast quantities of plastic, and that washing them means they can be re-used. \u201cIf every person in the UK used one disposable surgical mask each day for a year, this would create over 128,000 tonnes of un-recyclable plastic waste (66,000 tonnes of contaminated waste and 57,000 tonnes of plastic packaging),\u201d the report notes, adding that while contaminated waste from medical settings is collected and incinerated, no such facilities operate for the public which could result in public health problems. The report also reveals how the team carried out a careful analysis to explore the scenario with the lowest environmental impact, noting machine washing masks, used in rotation, is preferable to hand-washing, which is an inefficient way to clean them. \u201cWe\u2019d recommend that people have four and that they use one a day, [then] they put that one straight in the washing basket and they wash it with their other [laundry],\u201d said materials scientist Prof Mark Miodownik who led the work, adding that he welcomed the local manufacture of such cloth masks. In addition, the report contains advice on how a public campaign could be rolled out, noting it is important the public know how to put on and take off such masks, and that the use of masks doesn\u2019t lead people to becoming complacent. \u201cSingle-use PPE undoubtedly has its place, particularly as an immediate measure to protect those at the greatest risk of infection,\u201d the authors add. \u201cHowever, any wide-scale public policies that are implemented during this crisis will have serious long-term ramifications, not only for public health but the health of the natural environment.\u201d The government has changed the way it is counting the number of Covid-19 tests carried out, in a bid to hit its self-imposed 100,000 tests per day target, the Health Service Journal reports. Previously, a test would be counted once the sample had been processed in a lab, but this definition has been changed in the last few days, a senior source has told the HSJ. According to the source, the Department of Health and Social Care is now including tests that have been posted or delivered to people\u2019s homes in its figures \u2013 which means tests that are sent to people are counted before the recipient has done their test and returned their sample to the lab. The HSJ understands that up to 50,000 of the tests that will be reported as having taken place on 30 April will actually represent the mailing of, or the agreeing to the mailing of, a home testing kit.

British Airways\u2019 parent company has signed agreements for \u20ac1bn (\u00a3900m) of loans backed by the Spanish government, but the money cannot be used to help its UK airline, which is cutting up to 12,000 jobs, PA reports. IAG said the money could be used to help its Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. There are \u201crestrictions on the upstream of cash to the rest of the IAG companies\u201d, the firm added. IAG has not requested a loan from the UK government. It announced this week that up to 12,000 jobs would be lost at BA, representing more than a quarter of its workforce. On Thursday it emerged that the airline may not resume operations at Gatwick, the UK\u2019s second busiest airport. In a letter to staff, the BA chief executive, Alex Cruz, wrote: There is no government bailout standing by for BA. Pilots\u2019 union Balpa has vowed it will fight to \u201csave every pilot job at BA\u201d. This is from the first minister of Scotland Speaking to the health and social care select committee on Friday, Claire Murdoch, national mental health director for NHS England, confirmed the NHS is planning for PTSD referrals for frontline staff. She said: We know it\u2019s been a high stress environment. We\u2019re planning mental health support right now. She said ensuring hospital teams offered support through good supervision, debriefs after shifts and making sure shift patterns allowed staff to recuperate would be crucial. \u201cThe military are very good at this,\u201d she said. Murdoch added that trusts were investing more in occupational and mental health support for staff and that national helplines with third sector organisations, such as Samaritans, had been set up to support staff. Responding to MPs\u2019 questions, Murdoch also said that there appeared to have been an overall drop of around 30-40% in referrals of members of the public to mental health services. But she added that there was no evidence currently for a spike in suicides or self-harm: We absolutely have not seen that. We\u2019re pretty certain that levels of anxiety and distress will have increased for young people. Everyone\u2019s more worried. Lots of people are sleeping less. The committee heard further evidence that cancer services were being disrupted, with urgent two-week referrals dropping by 63% last week, which Dame Cally Palmer, the national cancer director for NHS England, said was a concern: Early detection is vital for survival. She added that it was crucial that screening programmes, many of which have been paused, be restarted. There have been no national instructions on screening. It\u2019s important to make sure that rescheduled screening take place, especially bowel cancer. Cancers are slow growing so 4-6 weeks should not affect survival but we need to get that turned back on. Lifetime Isas are effectively being unlocked temporarily for savers whose incomes have been hit by coronavirus. The rule changes will mean people can access their funds early without facing the usual hefty withdrawal penalty. The Treasury will legislate for a temporary reduction in the Lisa withdrawal charge to 20% between 6 March 2020 and 5 April 2021. This will generally mean account holders will only have to pay back any government bonus they have received, and they will not have to pay the additional withdrawal charge of 5%. A further 17 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19 in Wales, taking the total there to 925, Public Health Wales said. Another 160 cases were reported, bringing that total to 9,972. It is easy to see why it could be thrilling fiction for our times: it has a mysterious and fatal virus, an epidemiologist hero, a desperate search for a vaccine and murky political skulduggery. It also features a green monkey. But whether it is the moment for Stanley Johnson, the father of Boris Johnson, to be pushing his 40-year-old novel for a new release is another question. Nonetheless, British publishers have been invited to consider reissuing Johnson Sr\u2019s 1982 thriller The Marburg Virus, the Guardian has learned. His agent is so convinced of his ability to effectively publicise a reissue that his pitch describes him as \u201ca tireless self-promoter\u201d. The Rugby Football League has been handed a \u00a316m emergency loan from the government to help \u201cprotect the entire sport\u201d throughout the pandemic. Many clubs within the professional game had expressed fears that without external financial support the sport faced a bleak future. The RFL chief executive, Ralph Rimmer, has warned clubs not to see the money as a \u201cgravy train\u201d and has made it clear the cash needs to last as long as possible to ensure clubs survive. He said: It\u2019s not about dropping a lump sum in a club\u2019s bank account and telling them to carry on as normal; we have to be far more meticulous. Needleworkers at Exeter Cathedral, the Company of Tapisers, have been making scrubs for the NHS and have completed 10 sets, with another 14 in progress, since beginning production two weeks ago. The group said the biggest challenge had been finding suitable fabric for volunteers to work on, with materials from as far away as Bradford being requested to meet specifications. The Company of Tapisers has been making vestments, kneelers, banners, cushions, and even rugs and ropes at the cathedral since 1933. At her daily briefing, Nicola Sturgeon was probed about overnight briefings suggesting that Boris Johnson\u2019s optimistic tone yesterday was putting at risk her own message that progress remains very fragile and could easily be reversed if people relax their adherence to lockdown guidelines. The first minister said she was \u201cnot convinced there is a huge substantive difference\u201d between what she and the prime minister were saying, adding that she was \u201cchoosing to use my own words\u201d. Insisting that she did not want to diminish positive messages from the downward trend in hospital and intensive care admissions, she reiterated \u201cit is too early to say that the light is not going to be extinguished\u201d. She also warned: \u201cIf we are premature in these decisions and the virus runs away from us ... it will do even more damage to the economy.\u201d Announcing the increase in testing capacity and eligibility, Sturgeon also underlined this \u201cshould not be an exercise in driving up the numbers\u201d. Sturgeon warned the tests can be unpleasant and invasive, especially for frail older people, adding: \u201cYes, volumes are important ... but these must be clinically-driven decisions.\u201d She said the focus on capacity and objectives of testing was more important than the numbers. McDonald\u2019s has revealed it will reopen its first UK restaurants for delivery on 13 May after shutting sites due to the coronavirus lockdown. The fast-food giant said it would reopen 15 restaurants for delivery only, with the locations of these restaurants being announced next week, after it spent this week testing its operations behind closed doors in preparation to reopen sites. Two-thirds of Britons would feel uncomfortable attending large public gatherings, such as sports events or concerts, a new poll suggests, amid warnings the government\u2019s \u201cstay home\u201d advice might have been \u201cslightly too successful\u201d. A recent survey for Ipsos Mori suggested that more than 60% of Britons would feel uncomfortable carrying out their usual activities \u2013 such as going to bars or restaurants, or using public transport \u2013 if the lockdown was eased. It suggests the public is nervous about a quick return to normality, with 61% saying they would feel uncomfortable using public transport or going to bars and restaurants. Young people are most at ease with going to bars and restaurants. Thirty-six per cent of 18-34-year olds would feel comfortable doing so, compared with only 22% of 55-75s. The polling comes as Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, of Cambridge University, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: It\u2019s much harder to frighten to people to stay at home than it is to reassure them they can go out again. Maybe our whole campaign has been, if anything, slightly too successful. At this afternoon\u2019s lobby briefing, Downing Street declined to contradict Donald Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claims that coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory. The PM\u2019s spokesman said: There are clearly questions that need to be answered about the origin and spread of the virus, not least so we can ensure that we\u2019re best prepared for a future global pandemic, this work will need to be done with our international partners. Budget airline Wizz Air will resume some flights from Luton airport on Friday with passengers and crew required to wear face masks. The Hungarian carrier will introduce the new hygiene measures when it reopens its base at the airport, including the wearing of face masks, physical distancing between passengers during boarding and an enhanced cleaning regime. Flights are due to operate to Budapest, Lisbon and Sofia on Friday. Other routes, such as Tenerife and Tel Aviv, will resume in the coming weeks, pending travel restrictions. UK lockdown restrictions prevent Britons from being allowed to travel to airports for a holiday. But people are able to fly for other reasons, such as to return home after being stranded overseas or if they are travelling for work. Customers are also being urged to use online services for checking in and making purchases such as additional bags to \u201creduce non-essential interaction at the airport\u201d, and to use contactless payment methods if they buy anything while on flights. Here are the main takeaways from this afternoon\u2019s Downing Street briefing: Ministers have not yet made a final decision on whether the public will be advised to use face coverings, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman has insisted at the daily lobby briefing. Boris Johnson told yesterday\u2019s press conference: I do think face masks will be useful, both for epidemiological reasons, and to give people the confidence that it is safe to go back to work. But his spokesman said no final decision had yet been taken: Ministers are still considering how we move forward with face coverings, in terms of the precise advice. The advice we have received, based on the science, shows a weak but also positive effect in reducing transmission from ... asymptomatic members of the public, where social distancing is not possible. And he suggested the prime minister was not referring to medical masks. We\u2019re talking about face covering. We\u2019re certainly not thinking about anything that might take PPE supplies away from the NHS, or care workers, or others. With the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, expected to host this evening\u2019s daily press conference, the PM\u2019s spokesman did not reveal whether the 100,000-a-day testing target had been met. But he said: The health secretary\u2019s target has been very effective in driving up capacity in the system. Capacity is what\u2019s really important.\u201d He confirmed that 81,611 tests had taken place in the 24 hours to 9am on Thursday. The spokesman also didn\u2019t rule out government support for ailing airlines: We\u2019ve been clear we\u2019re prepared to enter discussions with individual companies seeking bespoke support as a last resort. Although, he also pointed out the firms are eligible for many of the government\u2019s other business support measures. A brand new edition of the popular Top Trumps card game, honouring Covid-19 key and essential workers, hits the shops on Monday. It hails key and essential workers working on the frontline during the pandemic, from doctors and nurses to less high profile sectors such as pest controllers, midwives and sea merchants. Politicians and journalists are also included. One of the four scoring sections in the new game is \u201cunsung heroes\u201d, where the partners of key workers come out top with a maximum 10 out of 10. Nicola Sturgeon has started her daily briefing by confirming 11,654 positive cases of coronavirus in Scotland, an increase of 301 from the day before. There are now 1,809 patients in hospital with suspected or confirmed Covid-19, an increase of 61 from the previous day; of these patients, 110 are in intensive care. The first minister also said that 2,659 patients who had the virus had left hospital since 5 March. In the last 24 hours there were a further 40 deaths registered of patients who had a positive test for the virus, taking that daily total to 1,515. Sturgeon also set out a chunk of detail on testing, as promised. Active lab capacity in NHS Scotland is now at 4,350 tests a week, and added to the UK\u2019s Lighthouse lab in Glasgow this means that the country now has the capacity for 8,350 tests a day. In terms of actual tests carried out, a total of 4,661 were carried out yesterday, a combination of 2,537 NHS tests and 2,124 from the UK government\u2019s regional drive-through centres. She also announced a significant expansion in eligibility for testing \u2013 all residents and staff in care homes with cases will now be tested. There will also be sample testing in other care homes, access to drive-through centres for the over-65s and those few workers who have to leave home for work but aren\u2019t already eligible. Yesterday we reported that the Children\u2019s Commissioner Scotland and a coalition of charities had written to supermarket chief executives urging them to stop the barring and abuse of single parents shopping for essentials with their children. As of this morning, three have replied to the letter. Marks and Spencer was first off the mark, saying they had given \u201cclear guidance...that it may be necessary for parents to bring their children shopping with them and under no circumstances should a family be turned away\u201d. Co-op acknowledged the points made and gave assurances for the future, while ScotMid insisted that children would not be restricted in stores. A head of procurement for the NHS has set up a business to profit from the private sale of huge quantities of personal protective equipment in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, an undercover investigation by the Guardian can reveal. David Singleton, 42, a senior NHS official in London who has been working at the capital\u2019s Covid-19 Nightingale hospital, launched the business two weeks ago to trade in visors, masks and gowns. Several readers have been in touch about what the R number, or effective reproduction number, of coronavirus means. This piece from our science correspondent Hannah Devlin provides a very handy explanation. In a nutshell, it\u2019s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. Heathrow airport has warned that it may soon follow British Airways in announcing mass redundancies unless the government restores confidence by planning for how flying could restart. The chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said physical distancing measures could not work in airports, and common international standards for health controls were needed, such as temperature screening at the entrances to airports and the wearing of face masks throughout the process to ensure a low risk of transmission. Passenger numbers at the UK\u2019s largest airport fell by 97% in April, and Holland-Kaye urged the government to take a lead in developing a global agreement for new measures. He said while forward bookings implied there was still \u201cmassive demand for travel\u201d, it was vital to plan ahead. Full story here: One of the UK\u2019s largest providers of care homes, which has lost more than 300 residents to Covid-19, has responded angrily to Boris Johnson\u2019s claim the pandemic is on a downward slope, saying this is not true in care homes and lambasting the newly announced testing regime as \u201ccompletely shambolic\u201d. MHA, which has 222 facilities, said the prime minister was being \u201cat best disingenuous\u201d when he told the Downing Street press briefing the UK had come through the peak and there was sunlight ahead. Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of the network, said: We are now 43 days in from lockdown, yet still our residents and staff have not received the enhanced level of protection that they need. The government will be held to account for this. Confirmed or suspected coronavirus deaths in care homes have been running at around 2,400 a week, according to official figures published on Tuesday. Monaghan said that despite nursing dementia homes being by far the worst hit by the virus \u201cno consideration has been given to prioritising tests for those settings, nor the suitability of administering tests to our residents\u201d. This cannot surely be beyond the ability of our policymakers, scientists and government. We said weeks ago that we were being treated as the poor relations to the NHS and the situation, despite our protestations, has not improved. On Tuesday, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, announced the rollout of testing of all residents and staff in care homes in England, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms, insisting \u201cthe spread of the virus though care homes is absolutely a top priority\u201d. But Monaghan said that while the long-called-for policy was laudable, \u201cin practice it remains completely shambolic, with many staff and residents unable to secure tests, inconsistencies between the nations, leaving homes unable to effectively control the virus\u201d. We cannot and will not accept assumptions that higher rates of death in care homes is somehow inevitable. With the right support, it isn\u2019t. Peers have announced plans to form a Covid-19 committee to scrutinise the government\u2019s response to the pandemic. A report by the Lords liaison committee recommended the new Covid-19 committee should undertake \u201ccross-cutting\u201d scrutiny of the government\u2019s response, developing understanding of the lessons learned and how they can be applied in the future. The recommendation to establish the new committee will be put to a motion for agreement in the House of Lords. Members will then be appointed to the committee in the coming weeks. Lord McFall of Alcluith, the senior deputy speaker of the House of Lords, said: This is the first time either house has sought to establish a new committee dedicated to the Covid-19 emergency and the government\u2019s response to it. Two key strengths of Lords committees are their cross-cutting nature, they are thematic in approach rather than set up to shadow government departments, and the real world experience our members can bring to them. These strengths will be much in evidence in the new Covid-19 committee which will be made up of experts across a whole range of relevant professional backgrounds and be free to consider all the aspects and impact of the current crisis, including on the economy, education and the social bonds between generations. I firmly believe the new committee will have a key role to play in ensuring we learn the right lessons from the crisis and understand to the fullest extent its effects upon our society, economy and way of life. Downing Street said the prime minister Boris Johnson chaired the daily Covid-19 meeting on Friday. Number 10 said the the government would announce that the Rugby Football League will receive a \u00a316m cash injection \u201cto safeguard the immediate future of clubs in England\u201d. A spokesman said: The emergency loan will help the sport deal with the extreme financial impact of the coronavirus outbreak while the season remains suspended, due to social distancing measures. High-risk pregnancies may be missed during the coronavirus pandemic because expectant mothers are too scared to pick up the phone to their midwife, according to Gill Walton, the chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM). Anxiety in the pregnant population is becoming more pronounced during the Covid-19 outbreak, a committee was told, with an increase in referrals to perinatal mental health services. Walton told MPs she was concerned this may be a factor which could lead to a potential rise in stillbirths and neonatal deaths. She told the Commons health and social care committee messaging is key in ensuring women come forward if they need help: Some of that is related to the fear of the pregnant population and presenting to maternity services during the pandemic, and that fear then prevents them even sometimes just picking up the phone to say they may be concerned. I believe that maternity services have tried their very best to try and keep providing as much of a normal service as possible. I do think it\u2019s really important to be getting that message out that maternity services are still open and that women should come forward so that we can keep them and their babies as well as possible. RCM members have reported many patients becoming more anxious during the pandemic, she added, emphasising the importance of directing pregnant women to call their midwives with mental health concerns in the first instance. Walton also said she was concerned about the apparent disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on BAME staff and pregnant women. She said expectant mothers from BAME backgrounds should be treated \u201cas more vulnerable than the general population and midwives are aware of that\u201d. Home births have faced the biggest impact from the pandemic, she said, with services disrupted due to reasons including staffing issues and paramedic ambulance capacity. She said returning to home births would require risk assessments, the return of staffing and testing of women in the community who want to have a baby at home. Olivia Strong, founder of the Run for Heroes 5km Challenge, which has raised \u00a35m for NHS charities, has received the prime minister\u2019s daily Point of Light award. In a personal letter to Olivia, Boris Johnson wrote: As we persevere with the restrictions to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives, I have been inspired by the ingenuity of your Run for Heroes 5km Challenge. Using your daily lockdown exercise to run 5K, donate 5 and nominate 5 people, you have raised more than 5 million to support the extraordinary work of our true heroes - the men and women of our unique NHS. With over a million participants from more than 20 countries, you have roused a global movement that has collectively run the entire distance to the moon and back! Thank you for your brilliant initiative and for all that you have done to support our wonderful NHS. Strong said: It\u2019s an absolute pleasure and delight to accept this award on behalf of the whole Run For Heroes community. Not only the amazing people who have helped with the campaign (India, Alice and my family), but everyone who has continued to run, donate and nominate! It\u2019s been so wonderful to see people coming together for such a worthwhile cause! Good morning!

Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Public health campaigners are calling on the Scottish government to keep focus on managing Scotland\u2019s problematic relationship with alcohol, on the second anniversary of the introduction of minimum unit pricing. Minimum unit pricing (MUP) came into force in Scotland on 1 May 2018, in an attempt to cut the country\u2019s higher-than average alcohol consumption and high death rates from alcohol-related diseases, and bars retailers from selling alcoholic drinks, including beers, wines, spirits and ciders, at less than 50p per unit of alcohol. Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said, \u201cThe initial results from the evaluation of minimum unit pricing are hugely encouraging as studies have found a significant decrease in consumption in the first year compared to England and Wales. However, the recent reports of growing alcohol sales and our own research showing that one million of us in Scotland are drinking more under lockdown, highlight the ongoing issue we still have with alcohol in this country. It remains to be seen what impact social distancing will have and what new challenges it will throw up. But it is unlikely that Scotland\u2019s unhealthy relationship with alcohol will be changed for the better.\u201d Discussions are currently taking place in the Scottish government about a possible relaxation of alcohol licensing restrictions during the lockdown, as elderly shoppers and others take advantage of early supermarket opening. The number of mortgages being approved to home buyers nosedived to a seven-year low in March. The sharp deterioration happened amid signs that households are running a \u201ctight ship\u201d by making large repayments on other types of borrowing such as credit cards. Figures from the Bank of England show that 56,161 mortgages were approved for house purchase in March. This was a drop-off of nearly a quarter (24%) compared with the previous month, and the lowest monthly total since 54,341 approvals were recorded in March 2013. The pause button has been pushed on the housing market as people and businesses adhere to lockdown measures imposed on March 23 to limit the spread of coronavirus. Dame Cally Palmer, national cancer director for NHS England, said chemotherapy treatments were running at 70% of normal levels but two-week referrals were down by 62%. She told MPs at the health and social care committee: \u201cBroadly, chemotherapy appointments are running at about 70% of normal levels and the reason for that, and we think we can set them back very quickly because, of course, is they use different facilities and workforce broadly from surgery and the other resources required to respond to Covid-19.\u201d She added: \u201cWe had just under 15,000 people booked for an appointment but that is a 62% reduction and clearly it\u2019s very important we address that because early detection is vital for increased survival.\u201d When asked if that meant up to two-thirds of cancers were being missed, Dame Cally replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case because the service has roughly an 8% conversion rate for urgent referrals. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to state that urgent referrals and urgent cancer treatments are continuing \u2013 obviously we need to tailor that to patients\u2019 individual risk but I think it would be wrong to make a mathematical calculation on that basis. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we get people coming forward but I think to translate that into missed diagnosis and poor survival would not be a responsible position at this point.\u201d Flights between Britain and Northern Ireland will continue to operate through \u00a35.7m of taxpayer funding, the transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced. The package is being funded by the UK government and the Northern Ireland executive to ensure airports and airlines do not axe \u201clifeline services\u201d because of the collapse in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Aer Lingus and Loganair will be subsidised to maintain London flights to and from Belfast City airport and City of Derry airport respectively. The Northern Irish airports involved will also be given funding to provide ground services for the flights. The Belfast-London route \u201cwould be at risk without financial assistance given low passenger numbers\u201d, the Department for Transport stated. Shapps said: \u201cMaintaining air links between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is vital. \u201cWe must ensure that critical workers can continue to fly over the Irish Sea and today\u2019s investment in these lifeline services guarantees that.\u201d When asked about the provision of mental health care for pregnant women, Walton said members of the Royal College of Midwives had reported many patients had become more anxious during the pandemic. She said: \u201cA lot of women get anxious during pregnancy anyway and I think the pathways for advice and referrals have got better over recent years. \u201cDuring the pandemic, women have become even more anxious because pregnant women are a vulnerable group, so there has been an increase in referrals to perinatal mental health services, we know that. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is bring some of that support and care back to the midwife. \u201cEvery woman has a midwife, midwives have training in supporting women who have anxiety and apprehension, and the ability to refer onwards if they believe a wider mental health team would be of assistance.\u201d Walton emphasised the importance of directing pregnant women to call their midwives with mental health concerns in the first instance. The chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives has told MPs she is concerned high-risk pregnancies may be missed due to the pandemic, leading to a potential rise in stillbirths and neonatal deaths. Addressing the health and social care committee, Gill Walton said: \u201cSome of that is related to the fear of the pregnant population and presenting to maternity services during the pandemic, and that fear then prevents them even sometimes just picking up the phone to say they may be concerned. \u201cI believe that maternity services have tried their very best to try and keep providing as much of a normal service as possible. \u201cI do think it\u2019s really important to be getting that message out that maternity services are still open and that women should come forward so that we can keep them and their babies as well as possible.\u201d Walton said that follow-ups on women who miss scans and appointments has been enhanced. She added: \u201cOne of the positives from the pandemic is the use of technology, so there has been more virtual contact and follow-up with women through midwives and maternity services than before.\u201d Residents in deprived areas have experienced double the death rates of those in affluent areas, new figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal. Of the 20,283 Covid-19 registered deaths in England and Wales to 17 April an overwhelming proportion of fatalities were of people from the poorest areas. The most deprived area had 55.1 deaths per 100,000 people, more than double (118%) that in the least deprived areas, where the rate was 25.3 deaths. London had the highest mortality rate, with 85.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The highest age-standardised mortality rate was in the London borough of Newham, with 144.3 deaths per 100,000 population, followed by Brent, with 141.5 deaths per 100,000 population, and Hackney, 127.4 deaths per 100,000 population. Manufacturing in the UK collapsed in April, hitting levels lower than during the height of the 2008 financial crisis, according to the latest IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index. The index recorded a score of 32.6 for February \u2013 anything above 50 is seen as growth \u2013 hitting the lowest level since the survey began 28 years ago, in the first significant sign of the impact of Covid-19 on the economy. Hello everyone, please do get in touch this morning to share your thoughts, comments and news tips with me while I run the live blog. Thanks. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com An online festival is being organised by the UK\u2019s specialist cheese community to urge the public to support small cheesemakers during the Covid-19 lockdown. The event will take place on the early May bank holiday and is being organised by the Specialist Cheesemakers Association (SCA), the Academy of Cheese, the Guild of Fine Food and cheese writer Patrick McGuigan. It invites cheese lovers to stock up on artisan cheese in the lead-up to the festival to raise awareness of the crisis that threatens to wipe out the previously thriving speciality cheese industry. The festival will be free and educational, organisers said. Tracey Colley, director of the Academy of Cheese, commented: \u201cWe are absolutely thrilled to see how many experts from across our industry have wanted to take part in the British Cheese Weekender. From cheesemakers to cheese distributors we now have a multitude of virtual cheese events for everyone to join in with. The Academy of Cheese community of over 2,000 members are busy planning where to buy cheese for the weekend and with so many fantastic artisan cheeses now available for direct delivery they are very excited\u201d. David Nabarro, the World Health Organization\u2019s special envoy on Covid-19, said it would be \u201cperfectly reasonable\u201d for the UK to start easing the lockdown before a full contact tracing system was up and running. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: \u201cEvery government is having to make a choice and I understand that the contact tracing process is now well advanced and so that\u2019s a reasonable time to be thinking through how lockdown can be eased, and it won\u2019t be eased all at once, it will be eased bit by bit.\u201d He added: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to have 100% contact tracing in order to get the R number down. The contact tracing is an absolutely essential part of reducing transmission, and getting that capacity as widely spread as possible is key to getting the transmission as low as you can. \u201cBut you certainly can release the lockdown while you\u2019re building up the case-finding and contact-tracing capacity - that\u2019s what most other countries are doing.\u201d Leaders of the UK town predicted to suffer the biggest economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic have issued an urgent plea for help from the government. More than 50% of jobs in Crawley are at risk of being lost or furloughed, according to a recent report. There are fears that the West Sussex town, located close to Gatwick airport, could experience an \u201cemployment catastrophe\u201d as the economy \u201cmost affected\u201d by the Covid-19 lockdown. The leader of the borough council and the town\u2019s MP have called on the government to take rapid action and \u201censure that Crawley\u2019s amazing economic success, built up over many decades, is not lost in a matter of weeks\u201d. The letter states: \u201cIt is quite clear that the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the national economy and indeed the world economy is unprecedented. \u201cHowever, due to the business sectors located within the town, and the proportion of local jobs and economic output from these sectors, Crawley is undeniably being hit far harder than any other part of the United Kingdom.\u201d Heathrow\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, has described social distancing at airports as \u201cimpossible\u201d. He told the PA Media agency: \u201cSocial distancing does not work in any form of public transport, let alone aviation. \u201cThe constraint is not about how many people you can fit on a plane, it will be how many people you can get through an airport safely. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever been on holiday from Gatwick, you cannot imagine going through there and socially distancing in the summer. \u201cIt\u2019s just physically impossible to socially distance with any volume of passengers in an airport. The same applies with trains and tube stations. \u201cSo we need a better solution, which means that in a few months\u2019 time, when the disease is under control and with a low risk of infection, we can make it as low risk as possible for people to fly.\u201d After the striking difference in tone yesterday between Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cpast the peak\u201d optimism and Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s far more cautious warnings that it is \u201cnot safe\u201d to lift lockdown restrictions for some time yet, there are reports this morning of concerns within the Scottish government that Johnson risks jeopardising progress by suggesting that the worst is over. Scottish government sources have likewise raised doubt about an apparent shift in UK strategy after the wording of one of the five tests was tweaked to remove references to a second peak. While the UK government has denied that this was a meaningful change, Sturgeon said at her press conference yesterday that she was still trying to ascertain whether it was a significant shift, and that it was not one she agreed with, stating that while not overwhelming the NHS was a critical and necessary objective, \u201cI don\u2019t think it is a sufficient objective\u201d. Expect more questions on this at the first minister\u2019s briefing this lunchtime, when she has also promised to give a \u201csubstantial\u201d update on testing in Scotland. Coronavirus has killed tens of thousands of people in the UK. Each death is a person who was loved by someone. Guardian reporter Aamna Mohdin is writing tributes for those who died during the pandemic. Please email her (aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com) if you want to share your memories of someone who has passed away. Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said: It\u2019s a personal choice, if you have a face mask it\u2019s your choice whether you want to use them and if you walk around some of our towns and cities today you are seeing more people using them than ever before. The advice today is that the difference made by a face covering is quite modest - it doesn\u2019t make a huge difference but it does make some. So it\u2019s your choice. More than 13 million people have already been unable to pay, or expect to be unable to pay, at least one bill because of the coronavirus outbreak, according to research. Of these, almost 11 million have missed or expect to miss a bill that would leave them vulnerable to severe consequences \u2013 including eviction, bailiff enforcement or disconnection \u2013 when Covid-19 financial protections end. Some sectors, including energy, water and mortgages, have established frameworks for helping people out of debt in a sustainable way. Others, including the private rented sector and local authorities, do not. According to its research, commissioned by Citizen\u2019s Advice and conducted by Opinium among 2,016 nationally representative UK adults, those most at risk of severe consequences include 2.6 million private renters who have missed a rent payment already or expect to do so owing to coronavirus. Morning everyone and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s UK live blog. As ever, please do get in touch while I work this morning. It\u2019s always really useful to get any insight and news tips from readers. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com This morning the Commons Health Committee will hear evidence on core NHS and care services. There will later be a World Health Organisation briefing on Covid-19 and the usual 5pm (GMT) Downing Street press conference. Briefing in Wales and Scotland expected are expected at 12.30 pm (GMT). Britain has passed the peak of coronavirus infections, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday. He said that the government will set out a \u201croad map\u201d for easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions next week. Coronavirus fatalities among black and minority ethnic (BAME) groups are disproportionately high \u2013 and some are also bearing the economic brunt of the lockdown, a study has found. Stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies found that deaths of people from a black Caribbean background were 1.7 times higher than for white Britons. NHS England figures published last week showed that hospital deaths per 100,000 among British people of a black Caribbean background were three times the equivalent number among the majority white British population. However, unlike previous analysis, the IFS research, published on Friday, strips out the role of age, gender and geography and shows that they do not explain the disparities. Victims of domestic abuse will be able to seek help in Boots pharmacies in a bid to make it easier for them to access support during the coronavirus lockdown. The coronavirus crisis has sparked a huge increase in people using food banks for essential supplies, according to charities. The Trussell Trust, the UK\u2019s biggest food bank network, said it experienced its busiest ever period after lockdown was announced on 23 March, when it issued 50,000 food parcels in the space of a week, almost double its usual volume. Care homes will be the \u201cepicentres of transmission\u201d for coronavirus spreading back into society, according to a report quoting a senior NHS England director. Disabled people are struggling to get supermarket delivery slots and are being judged or challenged when they go out to buy food, according to a charity. The government is being urged to deliver pay rises and better conditions for the millions of people who are working through the Covid-19 crisis. Britain\u2019s manufacturers have suffered a \u201ccollapse\u201d in demand because of the impact of the global lockdown amid warnings that conditions are unlikely to return to anywhere near normal for some time, a new survey suggests. Ryanair has said it expects up to 3,000 jobs to be lost as part of a restructuring of the airline. Jenrick later told BBC Breakfast that the number of tests carried out were \u201cjust a stepping stone\u201d to more and that the foundations were in place for a strong national testing network. \u201cWe\u2019ve got labs across the country producing the equipment at pace and we\u2019re beginning to test essential workers,\u201d he said, adding that local government workers could now also apply for tests. \u2022 The total number of coronavirus deaths across the world has reached at least 232,817, according to Johns Hopkins University, which has tracked the spread of the virus during the pandemic. The US has the highest number of deaths with at least 63,763, followed by Italy with 27,967. \u2022 Germany is to reopen museums, galleries, zoos and playgrounds, and allow religious services to resume, in measures agreed by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the leaders of 16 federal states. This will take place under strict conditions. \u2022 Brazil reported a record 7,218 confirmed new cases of coronavirus, raising the total to 85,380. The death toll rose by 435 to 5,901, the health ministry said. There has been outrage in the country over the approach of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has previously attacked what he termed the \u201chysteria\u201d over Covid-19. \u2022 The Russian prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, has said he has been diagnosed with coronavirus and will self-isolate from the government, in the country\u2019s highest-profile case of the disease yet. Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said he thought government testing for coronavirus will have been a \u201csuccess\u201d even if the target of 100,000 tests is not met later today. \u201cI think we will either have met it or be very close, and in that sense the target will have succeeded because it will have galvanised people across government, in the private sector and across the country,\u201d he told Sky News on Friday. \u201cThis in itself is just a stepping stone, we need to go beyond 100,000, but we have seen now a very substantial increase in testing in quite a short period of time, so in that sense it\u2019s been a success, but there\u2019s more to be done.\u201d He said that the country now needed to \u201cbuild some head room\u201d between the rate of infection (R) and one before lockdown measures could be eased. \u201cThe R [value] is still below one but we need to build some head room, there isn\u2019t an exact figure as to where the R is - it\u2019s somewhere, the chief medical officer tells us, between 0.6 and 0.9,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to bring R down further than it is today and that matters so that the NHS has sufficient capacity, so that when we do start to ease the lockdown, there\u2019s some space, some room, for manoeuvre.\u201d He added that the government approach was a \u201ccautious easing over time\u201d so that such headroom for the NHS could be maintained and protected. The statistician Sir David John Spiegelhalter warned against taking a \u201cEurovision approach\u201d and making \u201cnaive comparisons\u201d between the UK\u2019s and other countries\u2019 Covid-19 deaths. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Today programme, the Cambridge University professor said: I think it\u2019s too early to tell our exact place in the league table. My article was arguing against this almost Eurovision approach of trying to say who\u2019s top, who\u2019s second and so on. It\u2019s just not appropriate to do at all. There are so many variabilities about how people record Covid deaths - even what the correct metric is for measuring the impact of the epidemic - that to start saying we\u2019re going to be worse or whatever is completely inappropriate.\u201d On the government\u2019s advice, Spiegelhalter said: \u201cIt\u2019s much harder to frighten to people to stay at home than it is to reassure them they can go out again. Maybe our whole campaign has been, if anything, slightly too successful. Jeremy Hunt said that the coronavirus outbreak has showed the importance of the social care sector and the need for funding. Speaking on the BBC Today programme and, the chair of the health and social care select committee said: If there is one thing this terrible crisis has brought home to us it is importance of the social care sector \u2026 and the crucial work done by those who care for them. They put lives at risk as NHS workers do, and often for low pay. So I will be asking for proper settlement for the social care sector... and the government will want to do that. He said that testing in the community, as has been done in South Korea, will be key. \u201cThat is what they did in South Korea so they could stop the virus in its track. It\u2019s locking down the people who might have the virus but not locking down the whole economy.\u201d Hunt said that contract tracing would need to be done through a combined method of technology and also people going door to door. He added that there would be a time when the government would need to change its messaging from \u201cstay at home\u201d to encourage people back out, but to date their approach has worked. Ryanair announced the planned job cuts as it revealed it expects to operate under 1% of its schedule between April and June. It said in a statement: As a direct result of the unprecedented Covid-19 crisis, the grounding of all flights from mid-March until at least July, and the distorted state aid landscape in Europe, Ryanair now expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing (to 2019 levels) will take at least two years, until summer 2022 at the earliest. The Ryanair Airlines will shortly notify their trade unions about its restructuring and job loss programme, which will commence from July 2020. These plans will be subject to consultation but will affect all Ryanair Airlines and may result in the loss of up to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs, unpaid leave and pay cuts of up to 20%, and the closure of a number of aircraft bases across Europe until traffic recovers. Job cuts and pay cuts will also be extended to head office and back office teams. Group CEO Michael O\u2019Leary, whose pay was cut by 50% for April and May, has now agreed to extend this 50% pay cut for the remainder of the financial year to March 2021. Morning everyone and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s UK live feed, keeping you up to date on all the latest developments around the coronavirus outbreak. As ever, please do get in touch while I work this morning. It\u2019s always really useful to get any insight and news tips from readers. I will try to respond to as many of you as I can. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com I\u2019ll begin with a little brightness today, and share an image I was sent yesterday after my shift ended of a rainbow over London. Welsh first minister Mark Drakeford has said he does not think certain parts of the UK should come out of lockdown before others. Speaking to the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, the Labour politician said: I agree with the prime minister, I am in favour of a four-nation approach. We went into lockdown together on the same terms, on the same day. I\u2019d like to see us come out of lockdown on the same basis. But we will use the powers we have to fine-tune the arrangements to make them right for Wales.\u201d He added: As we move to open up things again, we will be careful and cautious, we will have to take people with us. Our efforts over the last week have been directed at working with our trade unions, our local authorities and other stakeholders because you can open up anything you like, but if people don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe to take up what is now available to them, they won\u2019t come.\u201d",

Oxfam sends aid around the world, including funding work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Australia and fair trade producers in 18 countries. Guardian Australia has confirmed that discussions began with staff earlier this week, and Oxfam had decided to redesign the organisation. The charity is planning to reduce the number of full-time staff from 185 to 94 between now and October. Oxfam Australia chief executive Lyn Morgain said it was an \u201cexceptionally challenging financial environment\u201d, with the charity having a reduction in donations during the summer bushfires in Australia, leading into the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cOxfam Australia entered the coronavirus crisis in a weakened financial position because of multiple factors that are impacting on the sector, including the fallout from the Australian bushfires, several years of reduced fundraising income and a persistent decline in the overseas aid budget,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cOxfam\u2019s life-saving work is needed now more than ever to respond to the coronavirus and multiple other crises that threaten to increase the number of people living in poverty and exacerbate inequality. \u201cBut at the same time, the economic downturn caused by the pandemic has underscored the urgent need for changes that were already under way at Oxfam.\u201d Final decisions about the roles are yet to be made, with staff consultations under way, but Morgain said in order to be financially stable, Oxfam needed to reduce costs. \u201cIncredibly tough decisions are being made and there will be job losses.

Perhaps we should ditch the word entirely, and with it the forest of feelpinions about what governments \u201cmust\u201d do to advance an author\u2019s previously-held ideological positioning in the post-corona world. Imagine if we took just two lessons from the way Australian governments responded to the coronavirus: that good decisions are made when they consider the evidence and the best available expert advice; and that policy-making can accommodate reasonable differences of opinion, without becoming a \u201cwar\u201d. Think, as Laura Tingle did in a piece for the ABC\u2019s 7.30 this week, of the difference it would make if interviewers and commentators allowed room for discussion of complex and competing ideas, before demanding that politicians rule them \u201cin\u201d or \u201cout\u201d, or before finding a backbencher who will say they might cross the floor on a policy that conflicts with their ideological prejudice \u2013 even if that policy hasn\u2019t yet been outlined. Now consider if those principles were applied to climate policy in Australia. I concede that\u2019s quite a leap given the past decade of mind-numbing debate, during which experts have struggled to get a look in. But in the background, some have been giving it a shot. For six years now leading business, environmental, investor, union, farming and social welfare groups have been trying, largely in vain, to create a space for a sensible discussion about global heating, and to give Australian politicians a way to retreat from the self-defeating culture war that has scuppered all attempts at policy. They wouldn\u2019t put it this way, but in effect the environmentalists, desperate for Australia to make some meaningful move towards reducing emissions, and the business groups, desperate for some kind of investment certainty, have been trying to save Australia\u2019s politicians from themselves. The starting point for the Australian Climate Roundtable\u2019s deliberations is that Australia needs to reach net zero emissions, and that delaying action just increases the cost of reaching that goal. Unremarkable propositions in any fact-based forum, but in some Coalition circles, still close to heresy. Now the roundtable, including its business members, argues that this post-corona reconstruction is a chance to speed up decarbonising the economy. The Business Council of Australia chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, argued in an opinion piece that the post-corona discussion should divest itself of \u201cideological constraints\u201d. \u201cIn resuscitating our economy, we can tackle some of our most vexed problems. Every dollar we invest in energy should be a dollar towards a lower carbon economy and lower energy bills,\u201d she wrote. And expert evidence about what might be possible has been flooding in by the day. The Australian Energy Market Operator this week released its long awaited \u201crenewable integration study\u201d, which found Australia could accommodate levels of up to 75% \u201cinstant\u201d penetration of wind and solar in its main grid by 2025 \u2013 that we have the know-how, but need to update market and regulatory settings. Think about that next time someone starts burbling on about the impossibility of a renewable-dependent grid coping \u201cwhen the wind don\u2019t blow and the sun don\u2019t shine\u201d. Less than a year after an election in which Bill Shorten\u2019s target of 45% renewables by 2030 was attacked for being \u201cunachievable\u201d and \u201ceconomy wrecking\u201d, the expert market operator says 75% is technically achievable \u2013 and in just five years time. And then there was the advice from the International Energy Agency this week that renewable electricity will be the only energy source resilient to the biggest global energy shock in 70 years, triggered by the pandemic. The Morrison government is supposed to be working on a \u201croadmap\u201d towards some kind of long-term emissions reduction policy, understandably delayed while it deals with the pandemic. It could draw on the work of a bunch of expert groups who have already had a go \u2013 the latest Climateworks report released earlier this month found that net zero emissions by 2035 is possible in Australia, using technologies that are mostly already mature and available. The CSIRO\u2019s roadmap released last year found there was no trade-off between economic growth and transitioning to zero emissions, and in fact strong action could lead to GDP growth, an increase in real wages and net zero emissions by 2050. But then, apparently pre-empting his own policy, and contradicting his own government\u2019s claim to be \u201ctechnology neutral\u201d, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, has spent the week calling for a \u201cgas-fired recovery\u201d, variously advocating more gas-peaking plants, more long-term gas supply for manufacturers and more onshore gas production.

Where in March reporters asked for tougher restrictions \u2013 (Why not an immediate four week lockdown? Why are schools still open?) \u2013 April sees calls for the lockdown measures to be lifted. Rightwing pundits reach for utilitarianism and argue the prime minister is letting his Christianity get in the way of economic pragmatism.</p> <h2>Day 31 \u2013 Sunday 12 April</h2> <p>Easter Sunday. There is an outbreak in Tasmania. The premier, Peter Gutwein, announces the immediate closure of two hospitals in the state\u2019s north-west and orders 1,000 healthcare workers \u2013 and the 4,000 people they live with \u2013 to quarantine for 14 days.

They are: boosting the testing regime to include extensive surveillance or sentinel testing of asymptomatic people; stronger contact tracing, including the use of a tracing app; and improved local response capability to quickly shut down any new outbreaks. If that happens and the basic reproduction number remains below one \u2013 meaning that each infection leads to less than one new infection \u2013 then, in four weeks, restrictions may be lifted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f865887dffed0a5a3f19d4e14e848de91c063b75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f865887dffed0a5a3f19d4e14e848de91c063b75/0_0_4387_2925/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A new COVIDSafe app by the Australian government as seen on an Iphone to install in Sydney on April 27, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Covidsafe app on an iphone in Sydney on 27 April, 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saeed Khan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every state except Tasmania currently has a reproduction rate of less than one.</p> <p>Restrictions will loosen gradually, Morrison says.

It\u2019s the first day without a new case in WA since 21 February. South Australia has just made three days in a row, despite expanding its testing regime.</p> <p>Nationally, it\u2019s the lowest daily new case count since early March, with just 26 new cases. For the past nine days, the average daily growth rate has been less than 1%. The curve is bent.

A few weeks ago I was literally being screamed at to lock down, lock down everything. Now the calls are that we need to open up.\u201d He said that schools were expected to return to onsite learning from Monday and parents should demand a refund from private schools that don\u2019t comply.</p> <p>The next day, Morrison rebukes the aged care sector for going above the recommended restrictions and denying visitors even when no outbreak has been detected. Murphy announces that all states have expanded their testing regimes, the first step in establishing sentinel testing.

      "bodyText": "On 12 March, two weeks after Australia declared the coronavirus would become a pandemic and 47 days after the first case in Australia was detected in Melbourne, the World Health Organisation made it official. That night, in Melbourne, organisers of the Australian Grand Prix were scrambling to keep the event open despite an 11th hour order from Victoria\u2019s chief health officer that they could run the race but had to turn spectators away. It would be the first major event in Australia to be cancelled by the coronavirus. Within 24 hours, almost every other flagship event planned for the next month would follow suit. This is the first 50 days of the shutdown. Day 1 \u2013 Friday 13 March Spectators queue outside Albert Park in Melbourne for two hours, before the organisers confirm the Australian Grand Prix has been cancelled. Six hours later, Scott Morrison and Australia\u2019s premiers and chief ministers announce that mass gatherings \u2013 events with more than 500 participants \u2013 should not take place from Monday onward. They also announce the establishment of a national cabinet to respond to the coronavirus crisis. A level three travel warning is placed against the whole world, with Australians told to avoid unnecessary international travel. Spectators queue to gain entry ahead of the Formula 1 Australian Grand Prix 2020 at the Albert Park Circuit in Melbourne. The announcement is made in the Council of Australian Governments meeting (Coag), held in person in Sydney. It is the last time they are all in one room. The prime minister goes in for a handshake with the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, but is rebuffed. Saturday is the round-one NRL match between Morrison\u2019s team, the Cronulla Sharks, and the South Sydney Rabbitohs. He tells reporters at the Coag press call at 4pm that he still intends to go. By 8pm, Morrison has reneged on his football attendance, saying it might be misinterpreted. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has tested positive to coronavirus, but his cabinet colleagues are not tested. And the Melbourne Comedy festival, Melbourne Fashion festival and Sydney Royal Easter Show have been cancelled. Australia has 156 cases of coronavirus. Round-one NRL match between South Sydney Rabbitohs and Cronulla Sutherland Sharks at ANZ Stadium in Sydney, Saturday, 14 March, 2020. Day 3 \u2013 Sunday 15 March National cabinet holds its first meeting on the anniversary of the Christchurch massacre. Australia now has 250 cases. Quarantine rules are broadened. From midnight, all international arrivals are required to self-isolate for 14 days, unless they are airline or maritime crew, or transitioning through Australia to the Pacific Islands. The order extends to cruise ship passengers. States and territories will enforce these rules under public health orders. Morrison says there is unanimous agreement from states and territories that schools should remain open following the advice of national cabinet\u2019s health advisory body, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. He says that once a shutdown measure is introduced it is likely to remain in place for six months. The next morning, Morrison does five media interviews. In four, he is asked why schools remain open. School attendance in NSW has dropped 25%. Day 6 \u2013 Wednesday 18 March Victorian school attendance has fallen by up to 50%. A fake text message is circulating warning the country would go into an immediate lockdown, and the prime minister bristles when asked about it. \u201cTwitter is not real life \u2026 so don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he says. The national chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, says a two to four week shutdown called for by many commentators \u201cdoes not achieve anything\u201d. Prime minister Scott Morrison (right) and chief medical officer Brendan Murphy speak to media at Parliament House in Canberra, Wednesday, 18 March, 2020. National cabinet meets. Travel advice to the whole world is upgraded to level four: do not travel. Domestic travel is still allowed. Indoor gatherings of more than 100 people are now banned. Schools can remain open, but assemblies are cancelled. Singapore is held up as an example \u2013 it has managed the virus effectively while keeping schools open. Anzac Day ceremonies are cancelled. Restrictions are placed on visiting aged care facilities. Visits are capped at a maximum of two people per day, with visits to be kept to a short duration. Recently returned travellers, anyone with a respiratory infection, and children under 16 are told to stay away. In the evening, the Ruby Princess cruise ship arrives in Sydney harbour. Day 7 \u2013 Thursday 19 March At 6am health officials give the all-clear for the 2,700 passengers aboard the cruise ship Ruby Princess to disembark. About 110 have influenza-like symptoms. Three are swabbed, but the rest are not made to wait for the results. They go home, many boarding domestic flights to other states, carrying the virus with them. Within five weeks at least 662 passengers on the Ruby Princess will have tested positive to Covid-19 and 21 will have died. Cruise ship passengers disembark from the Ruby Princess at Circular Quay in Sydney, Thursday, 19 March, 2020. Later, Scott Morrison announces that Australia\u2019s borders are now closed to non-citizens and residents. Australians are urged to return home as soon as possible. The Reserve Bank announces a $105bn boost to the economy and cuts the cash rate to 0.25%. The next day, after a national cabinet meeting, the ban on indoor gatherings is refined to include a requirement of 4sqm space per person. Restaurants will have to change their tables accordingly. Schools remain open, but Tasmania does not: the island state announces that anyone who enters will face a 14-day quarantine. Day 10 \u2013 Sunday 22 March The jobseeker payment is effectively doubled to a minimum base rate of $1,115.70, with an announcement of a fortnightly coronavirus support payment of $550. The payment will remain in place for six months. People queue outside a Centrelink office in Preston, Melbourne, 23 March 2020. It\u2019s part of the $66bn second economic stimulus package, which includes a provision to allow sole traders and those eligible for welfare to draw down their superannuation by up to $10,000 a year for the next two years. Loans for small and medium sized businesses are announced. National cabinet meets and decides on the first major round of closures: all pubs, clubs, cafes and restaurants, excluding takeaway, will be closed from 12pm Monday. Gyms, indoor sporting venues, cinemas, casinos, nightclubs and entertainment venues are also closed. Schools remain open, but are encouraged to provide access to online education. Crowds at Bondi beach on Saturday are blamed for the \u201cdraconian measures to enforce social distancing\u201d that will be introduced and policed by the states in coming weeks. Beachgoers at Sydney\u2019s Bondi beach despite the threat of coronavirus, Friday, 20 March, 2020. The national cabinet meeting is preceded by matching announcements from the NSW and Victorian premiers, saying they are considering a ban on all non-essential services. Victoria and the ACT will close schools from Tuesday, starting the Easter school holidays early. Morrison says he is not annoyed. At the press conference following the national cabinet meeting, ABC political editor Andrew Probyn inadvertently becomes a TikTok meme. Australia passes 1,000 cases on Saturday. By Sunday it\u2019s 1,316 cases \u2013 an increase of 213 in 24 hours. Twenty-six of those cases are from the Ruby Princess. On Monday, thousands of people queue for Centrelink. The queues start forming at 4am and stretch around the block. The pattern is repeated all week. Day 12 \u2013 Tuesday 24 March National cabinet decides on further restrictions. Auction houses, real estate auctions, eating in shopping centre food courts, amusement parks, play centres, beauty parlours, tattoo parlours, and haircuts that take longer than 30 minutes are banned. The haircut time limit is lifted two days later. Gatherings are restricted to groups of 10 when outdoors. That includes funerals. Weddings are limited to five people \u2013 the couple, the celebrant and two witnesses. Australians must stay home unless they\u2019re going out for an essential purpose, and the definition of essential is broadened. \u201cNow, if you ask me who is an essential worker?\u201d Morrison says. \u201cSomeone who has a job.\u201d Domestic travel restrictions on entering Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory come into force. Those who arrive after today will have to self-isolate for 14-days. Queensland is to follow on Wednesday. The international travel warning is upgraded to a travel ban. The next day, all non-urgent elective surgery is suspended. Shock jock Alan Jones, who usually shows little sympathy to those on welfare, says it should be easier to get the dole. In New Zealand, a four week lockdown is announced. It will begin on Thursday. Day 15 \u2013 Friday 27 March. Prince Charles and Boris Johnson have coronavirus. The United States passes China as the country with the most number of cases. Globally, the number of cases has topped half a million with 22,993 deaths. Australia\u2019s total case tally has topped 3,000, doubling in just three days. The daily incidence peak is hit on 28 March. National cabinet announces that from midnight Saturday, all returning international travellers will have to complete their mandatory 14-day quarantine in a hotel. A ban on non-essential travel into remote Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory comes into effect. Day 17 \u2013 Sunday 29 March Gatherings are now limited to two people, excluding people who live together. Some states will take this further to ban people from interacting unless they are exercising together or acting as a carer. People over the age of 70 are advised to effectively self-isolate, as are people with chronic disease or comorbidities who are over the age of 60, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples over the age of 50. The national cabinet announces a moratorium on evictions from commercial or residential tenancies for six months, but enforcement is slow and varies between jurisdictions. The curve is beginning to flatten, with the rate of growth dropping from 35% to 15%. To date, 208,000 tests have been conducted, and 3,898 cases have been confirmed. About 98% of tests are negative. Australia is testing more than four times the number of people per head of population than the UK, and more people per head of population than South Korea. Day 18 \u2013 Monday 30 March The Australian government announces a $130bn wage subsidy package called jobkeeper. Eligible businesses will receive $1,500 per employee per fortnight, to be paid in full directly to the employee, if they can show a significant loss in revenue. It brings the total value of economic stimulus packages announced to $320bn, or 16.4% of GDP. Victoria and Queensland both issue their first fine on a business for breaching social distancing laws. States and territories release new public health orders, detailing the strict enforcement of the stay at home rules, with on-the-spot fines of $1,000 or more. Journalists spend the next few days seeking clarity on whether the laws restrict visits from romantic partners. Three days later, the federal government announces that childcare will be free for six months. Day 24 \u2013 Sunday 5 April Police in New South Wales announce a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess cruise ship debacle, which is now the single largest source of coronavirus infections in Australia. Some 662 of the 5,687 coronavirus cases reported in Australia are from that ship, as are 11 of the 34 deaths. The global coronavirus tally passed 1 million cases two days ago. At 11.59pm the hard border in WA comes into effect. Only residents or those who meet a set criteria for entry are now allowed through. Queensland will strengthen it border restrictions from 11 April. NSW, Queensland and Victoria are stricter in their enforcement of social distancing rules than other states. Two days ago, the WA premier, Mark McGowan, was overcome with laughter at a description of a man in NSW being fined for stopping to buy a kebab on the way home from a run. Soon, police would be accused of being too heavy handed and discriminatory in their use of the unfettered powers to stop people and judge the reason for being outside. On 7 April, Scott Morrison says the Easter long weekend could cause another spike in cases. \u201cStay at home,\u201d he says. \u201cFailure to do so this weekend would completely undo everything we have achieved so far together, and potentially worse.\u201d April brings a change in the type of questions asked at press conferences. Where in March reporters asked for tougher restrictions \u2013 (Why not an immediate four week lockdown? Why are schools still open?) \u2013 April sees calls for the lockdown measures to be lifted. Rightwing pundits reach for utilitarianism and argue the prime minister is letting his Christianity get in the way of economic pragmatism. Day 31 \u2013 Sunday 12 April Easter Sunday. There is an outbreak in Tasmania. The premier, Peter Gutwein, announces the immediate closure of two hospitals in the state\u2019s north-west and orders 1,000 healthcare workers \u2013 and the 4,000 people they live with \u2013 to quarantine for 14 days. The area is now under the strictest lockdown provisions in the country. All non-essential business is banned. The North West Regional hospital is seen closed in Burnie, Tasmania, Tuesday, 14 April, 2020. The outbreak is traced back to two passengers of the Ruby Princess cruise ship, who were the first two people to die in Tasmania after testing positive to Covid-19. Murphy repeats rumours to a New Zealand parliamentary committee that the virus spread because healthcare workers held an illegal dinner party, but a police investigation would later find there was no evidence to suggest such a party occurred. The health services union says the spread was due to doctors and nurses working across infected wards. Five days later, the prime minister will also be slapped down by Tasmanian authorities for incorrectly suggesting a healthcare worker had deliberately withheld information from contact tracers. Day 35 \u2013 Thursday 16 April The first hearing of the royal commission into the summer bushfires, a crisis that was for one month the defining issue of the year, is held via videolink. The national cabinet agrees to lift social distancing restrictions if three conditions are met. They are: boosting the testing regime to include extensive surveillance or sentinel testing of asymptomatic people; stronger contact tracing, including the use of a tracing app; and improved local response capability to quickly shut down any new outbreaks. If that happens and the basic reproduction number remains below one \u2013 meaning that each infection leads to less than one new infection \u2013 then, in four weeks, restrictions may be lifted. Every state except Tasmania currently has a reproduction rate of less than one. Restrictions will loosen gradually, Morrison says. Singapore is now a warning: lift restrictions too quickly and you could face a second wave. Day 39 \u2013 Monday 20 April Western Australia and Queensland join South Australia and the Northern Territory in reporting no new cases of coronavirus. It\u2019s the first day without a new case in WA since 21 February. South Australia has just made three days in a row, despite expanding its testing regime. Nationally, it\u2019s the lowest daily new case count since early March, with just 26 new cases. For the past nine days, the average daily growth rate has been less than 1%. The curve is bent. More than two-thirds of the country\u2019s 6,613 cases have now recovered, and 434,000 tests have been completed. The next day, the national cabinet announces it will lift the ban on many types of non-urgent elective surgery from 27 April. Virgin Australia, Australia\u2019s second biggest airline, goes into administration. Virgin Australia Boeing 737-800 aircraft parked on one of the three runways at Sydney\u2019s Kingsford Smith airport. Day 42 \u2013 Thursday 23 April The Ruby Princess departs Australia for the Philippines with 500 crew members onboard. A NSW inquiry investigating the debacle holds its second day of hearings. The tax office has approved 456,000 applications from people seeking early access to their superannuation, with an average withdrawal of $8,000. Centrelink has processed 587,686 jobseeker applications, more than they usually would in a year. More than 900,000 businesses have expressed interest in the jobkeeper payment, and 275,000 have made formal applications. Brendan Murphy tells a parliamentary select committee that to ease restrictions Australia would have to be able to \u201ctest like we\u2019ve never tested before\u201d. WA premier Mark McGowan, asked at a Perth press conference when he would ease restrictions, says: \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing. A few weeks ago I was literally being screamed at to lock down, lock down everything. Now the calls are that we need to open up.\u201d He said that schools were expected to return to onsite learning from Monday and parents should demand a refund from private schools that don\u2019t comply. The next day, Morrison rebukes the aged care sector for going above the recommended restrictions and denying visitors even when no outbreak has been detected. Murphy announces that all states have expanded their testing regimes, the first step in establishing sentinel testing. Responding to comments made by US president Donald Trump, Murphy says he would \u201ccaution against the injection of disinfectants\u201d as a potential treatment for Covid-19. Another outbreak is unfolding at an aged care home in western Sydney. Day 44 \u2013 Saturday 25 April The prime minister\u2019s Anzac Day address from the Australian War Memorial is broadcast live into homes because ceremonies and marches are cancelled. Instead, lit candles are placed in driveways. Vietnam veteran David Milligan takes a minute\u2019s silence outside his home at dawn in Mallacoota, Far East Gippsland, Saturday, 25 April, 2020. The next day, the government releases the Covidsafe app, designed to assist contact tracing by making a record of everyone a user has been in contact with for more than 15 minutes. The information can only be accessed by state health authorities and is automatically deleted after 21 days. The use of the app is not compulsory, but it is linked to an easing of restrictions. \u201cIf we want to get back to sport then we need to download the app,\u201d Morrison says. By Wednesday evening, the app has three million downloads and the federal government has a new catchphrase: \u201cfor a covid-safe Australia, download the Covidsafe app. Day 47 \u2013 Tuesday 28 April Gladys Berejiklian follows Mark McGowan and Annastacia Palaszczuk in announcing a relaxation of social distancing laws. Berejiklian says the change \u2013 which allows people to visit family and friends without being penalised \u2013 is a mental health measure. \u201cI\u2019ll still be standing outside the house when I visit my parents,\u201d she says. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says he does not intend to loosen his state\u2019s lockdown provisions, which expire on 11 May. That\u2019s also the target date for the AHPPC reviewing stay-at-home measures. In Western Australia, people are now allowed to gather in groups of 10 either indoors or outdoors. Hiking, boating, fishing, camping, and holding a picnic or a barbecue are all now permitted, but regional travel restrictions and the hard border remain in place. Four people die at western Sydney aged care home Newmarch House in a 24-hour period, bringing the number of deaths at that facility linked to the coronavirus to 11. Managers at the centre say they expect more deaths to follow. A makeshift memorial honouring residents who died from the coronavirus at Newmarch House, an aged care home in western Sydney, 30 April, 2020. The Logies are cancelled, followed by the Royal Melbourne Show. The number of cases in the United States passes one million, with a death toll of 58,220 \u2013 more than the number of US lives lost in the Vietnam War. Day 50 \u2013 Friday, 1 May The Australian Capital Territory enters the day with no active cases of Covid-19, with 103 people recovered and three dead. Loosened restrictions in New South Wales and Queensland take effect. North of the border, family groups are allowed to go for picnics or to a national park; to eat a takeaway meal outside instead of scurrying back into their homes; to take a leisure drive within a 50km radius of their home address; and to shop for frivolities. In New South Wales, people are allowed to have up to two visitors in their home, or visit other people. In the Northern Territory, which has not had a new case of Covid-19 in weeks, the parks are reopened. Fishing, camping, outdoor weddings and funerals and attending the local swimming pool are back on the cards. In two weeks\u2019 time residents will be allowed to go to the pub, provided they only stay for two hours and also order food. By 18 June, according to a plan outlined by chief minister Michael Gunner, everything will be back to normal. The national cabinet moves forward its decision on easing restrictions to next Friday, 8 May. \u201cWe need to restart our economy, we need to restart our society. We can\u2019t keep Australia under the doona, we need to move ahead,\u201d Morrison says.",

We cannot depend on a fractured society or a fragmented economy to deliver collective healing and health. Or jobs. Or sustainability. Or social morale.</p> \n<p>We also know that the bushfire crisis, since it is a symptom of the climate emergency, has not gone away. It is, to use the prime minister\u2019s favoured concept, in hibernation.</p> \n<p>The Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz has recently written:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>... the first priority is to restore our balance: provide more funding for the public sector, especially for those parts of it that are designed to protect against the multitude of risks that a complex society faces, and to fund the advances in science and higher-quality education, on which our future prosperity depends \u2026 Even as we emerge from this crisis, we should be aware that some other crisis surely lurks around the corner. We can\u2019t predict what the next one will look like \u2013 other than it will look different from the last.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Alongside strengthening the social security system and expanding the wage subsidy to include casuals and visa holders the commonwealth government needs to expand the public sector.</p> \n<p>Not only to create jobs but to protect the community. We need, as a massive structural augmentation, a significantly enhanced and expanded public sector. I\u2019m not just talking about an expansion of infrastructure and staffing levels; we need to re-imagine the public sphere, expanding our view of its role in building a common future based on the common good, a view that has been displaced by the false construct of austerity coupled with the ideology of \u201cthe market knows (and does everything) best\u201d.</p> \n<p>I write this at a time when the government has shamefully allowed the austerity impulse to kick in <em>vis a vis</em> the public sector, imposing an economically irrational and socially harmful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/freezing-public-servant-wages-in-response-to-coronavirus-is-just-a-sop\">wage freeze</a> on public sector workers.</p> \n<p>It is not my intention to provide a comprehensive list of infrastructure projects. Because we need a robust, participatory and transparent process by which this is determined (as opposed to the sports rorts model!), rationally mapped out on the basis of current and projected social and economic need.</p> \n<p>This is work that must begin now. The first priority should be the provision of a significant social and economic infrastructure investment to First Nations communities, the shape of which, and this cannot be emphasised too strongly, should be determined by those communities. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/plea-for-tents-or-anything-to-help-with-self-isolation-in-overcrowded-indigenous-communities\">Lorena Allam</a> points out: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/20/we-are-begging-for-housing-the-crisis-in-indigenous-communities\">Crowding in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities</a> occurs at around three times the rate of the non-Indigenous population, with over 115,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander households living in overcrowded homes nationwide.\u201d</p> \n<p>We need a massive injection of public resources into the construction of public housing. The Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/australia-needs-to-triple-its-social-housing-by-2036-this-is-the-best-way-to-do-it-105960\">has estimated</a> that, facing a shortfall of 433,000 social housing dwellings, we need to triple our stock of social housing by 2036. If we fail to meet this housing need we are looking down the barrel of a worsening homelessness and housing stress crisis.</p> \n<p>Bad for the economy. Disastrous for people\u2019s lives.</p> \n<p>Other obvious and urgent areas of expansion include Services Australia (building on the government\u2019s recently announced boost to Centrelink staff, whilst cognisant of the staffing cuts since 2013 and the ridiculous capping of the APS to 2006-07 staffing levels or below) and the public health system (physical infrastructure and staffing levels, including community health and aged and community care). </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/28/jobactive-agencies-to-reap-millions-amid-soaring-coronavirus-unemployment\">Jobactive agencies to reap millions amid soaring coronavirus unemployment</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Also, the progressive replacement of the<a href=\"https://percapita.org.au/our_work/working-it-out-employment-services-in-australia/\"> jobactive network</a> with a fit-for-purpose commonwealth employment service, a good opportunity to scrape such barnacles as the hyper-exploitative PaTH, the dead-end work-for-the-dole, the inherently racist Community Development Program and the punitive ParentsNext.</p> \n<p>The centrepiece of reconstruction should be a social guarantee, with full employment at its heart.

      "bodyText": "We are all in danger. But some of us are in more danger than others: physically, mentally, socially, economically. Not only from the virus itself but from some of the social and political responses to it. From First Nations people experiencing homelessness being issued with move-on notices to asylum seekers in detention, from frontline health workers to frontline retail workers, from casuals and contractors to visa holders, Covid-19, while imposing a common danger upon all of us, heightens the pre-existing contrasts in society, forcing us to focus on the glaring structural inequalities upon which our economy is built. The danger we are all in, and the unequal distribution of this danger, means that the ideological fixation on \u201cgoing it alone\u201d has been blown out of the water. The common danger, and the hyper-danger for some of us within it, poses a singular social question, a social question so all-encompassing that it resonates with the plethora of personal questions each of us has. How do we protect ourselves as a society? We cannot depend on a fractured society or a fragmented economy to deliver collective healing and health. Or jobs. Or sustainability. Or social morale. We also know that the bushfire crisis, since it is a symptom of the climate emergency, has not gone away. It is, to use the prime minister\u2019s favoured concept, in hibernation. The Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz has recently written: ... the first priority is to restore our balance: provide more funding for the public sector, especially for those parts of it that are designed to protect against the multitude of risks that a complex society faces, and to fund the advances in science and higher-quality education, on which our future prosperity depends \u2026 Even as we emerge from this crisis, we should be aware that some other crisis surely lurks around the corner. We can\u2019t predict what the next one will look like \u2013 other than it will look different from the last. Alongside strengthening the social security system and expanding the wage subsidy to include casuals and visa holders the commonwealth government needs to expand the public sector. Not only to create jobs but to protect the community. We need, as a massive structural augmentation, a significantly enhanced and expanded public sector. I\u2019m not just talking about an expansion of infrastructure and staffing levels; we need to re-imagine the public sphere, expanding our view of its role in building a common future based on the common good, a view that has been displaced by the false construct of austerity coupled with the ideology of \u201cthe market knows (and does everything) best\u201d. I write this at a time when the government has shamefully allowed the austerity impulse to kick in vis a vis the public sector, imposing an economically irrational and socially harmful wage freeze on public sector workers. It is not my intention to provide a comprehensive list of infrastructure projects. Because we need a robust, participatory and transparent process by which this is determined (as opposed to the sports rorts model!), rationally mapped out on the basis of current and projected social and economic need. This is work that must begin now. The first priority should be the provision of a significant social and economic infrastructure investment to First Nations communities, the shape of which, and this cannot be emphasised too strongly, should be determined by those communities. As Lorena Allam points out: \u201cCrowding in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities occurs at around three times the rate of the non-Indigenous population, with over 115,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander households living in overcrowded homes nationwide.\u201d We need a massive injection of public resources into the construction of public housing. The Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute has estimated that, facing a shortfall of 433,000 social housing dwellings, we need to triple our stock of social housing by 2036. If we fail to meet this housing need we are looking down the barrel of a worsening homelessness and housing stress crisis. Bad for the economy. Disastrous for people\u2019s lives. Other obvious and urgent areas of expansion include Services Australia (building on the government\u2019s recently announced boost to Centrelink staff, whilst cognisant of the staffing cuts since 2013 and the ridiculous capping of the APS to 2006-07 staffing levels or below) and the public health system (physical infrastructure and staffing levels, including community health and aged and community care). Also, the progressive replacement of the jobactive network with a fit-for-purpose commonwealth employment service, a good opportunity to scrape such barnacles as the hyper-exploitative PaTH, the dead-end work-for-the-dole, the inherently racist Community Development Program and the punitive ParentsNext. The centrepiece of reconstruction should be a social guarantee, with full employment at its heart. The Curtin government\u2019s 1945 white paper on full employment saw an expanded public sector as a means not only of creating jobs but of building social and economic infrastructure. The times demand a 21st century vision akin to this. A vision that recognises and properly remunerates the heavily gendered work of caring, that values the role of arts workers in the public sphere, that treats broadband as essential infrastructure (and, given that it is right now the only highway we get anywhere on, removes the bloody tolls and ditches the digital divide!). We should address the obscene levels of casualisation and precarity, invest in community infrastructure, social services, disability services. We should have a vision with an actual industry policy that embraces the opportunities of a post-carbon economy, a vision that enables and encourages equitable access to higher education and that values and boosts research and innovation instead of lazily leaving it to a private sector that cannot be expected to fill the strategic role that government has so spectacularly abrogated. Although, as the economist Mariana Mazzucato points out, this abrogation is exactly what has been expected of governments according to the neoliberal framework conjured up by narrow interests: \u201cSince the 1980s, governments have been told to take a back seat and let business steer and create wealth, intervening only for the purpose of fixing problems when they arise.\u201d We have a right to expect more from government. We have a right to expect government to do what markets cannot, namely, achieve collectively what we cannot achieve alone: social and economic protection for all of us. A social guarantee encompasses all that makes people feel human and valued as members of a society. It means no one missing out on the essentials of life: a place to live, a place to work (and decent income support for those who cannot), a place to learn, a place to heal. It means, for example, an overhaul of education funding so that public schools and the education workforce are properly invested in, rather than being allowed to languish in fulfilment of the ideological fantasy that giving more to already well-resourced private schools is somehow equitable. As for Tafe, successive governments have allowed this national treasure to be denuded in the false interests of competition. It is time to right this wrong. The days of outsourcing the work of the public sector to labour hire companies and big consultancy firms must end. The days of using our social security system to harm and harass people through vicious policies such as robodebt, instead of helping them, must end. The days of running down the CSIRO and such research centres as the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre must end. The French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu defines neoliberalism as \u201ca program for destroying collective structures which may impede the pure market logic\u201d. It is this ideology that has been responsible for the piecemeal dismantling of the public sphere. It is reality itself that now calls for an historic shift. \u2022 Dr John Falzon is senior fellow, inequality and social justice at Per Capita.

      "bodyText": "How will you become a good ancestor? Kunggalu and Birri Gubba poet, actress, storyteller and great-great-grandmother, the late Maureen Watson, used to say we must all ask ourselves this question. In uncertain times, as Aboriginal people are bunkering down in their communities to protect the vulnerable from coronavirus, especially elders who are the keepers of important cultural knowledge, some are finding solace in being out on country that is closed to tourists. In South Australia, the Ngarrindjerri elder Major \u201cMoogy\u201d Sumner is spending time with his extended family, and learning how to deliver cultural lessons on \u201cthe Zoom\u201d. \u201cThis virus has interrupted ceremony, everything that we do, our right to travel across the country,\u201d Sumner says. \u201cBut you can learn things from this.\u201d Sumner is 72, a Ngarrindjerri cultural ambassador whose country is along the Murray river in the Coorong. He\u2019s an actor, on the London stage last year in Andrew Bovell\u2019s adaptation of Kate Grenville\u2019s The Secret River, and he has travelled Europe repatriating the remains of his ancestors, most recently from Leipzig, Edinburgh and London in 2019. Sumner\u2019s wings are clipped for now, though, as we talk about survival and resilience on the phone from his home in Adelaide, while he holds his sleepy two-year-old grandson on his lap. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived in this country for thousands and thousands of years and we\u2019ve come up against all sorts of things within our existence in this land. Even though this is a bad virus, we\u2019ll get through it because Aboriginal people don\u2019t realise how strong we are,\u201d Sumner says. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t realise, just because we\u2019re not up to number one on the western society\u2019s measuring stick. But we know how to survive in this land, we\u2019ve been here for a long time and the laws have been there with us, how we respected each other, how we did all sorts of ceremonies. We should really get back to that, because at the moment we\u2019re living in a way that is really alien to us.\u201d Sumner points out that Europeans may have been in Australia for 250 years on the east coast, but contact history is very recent elsewhere. Songlines are unbroken. \u201cIt\u2019s only a 100 years here, and further north it may be only 90 years. It\u2019s not that long. Even here in South Australia, we are still practising our ceremonies, we\u2019re still practising men and women ceremonies. \u201cWe are dancing about the land, about healing the land and healing the rivers. But most of all, we are dancing about healing ourselves, because we\u2019ve been damaged, our culture has been damaged. We have, as nations of people across this country been damaged, but by using ceremony, we can bring ourselves back to the land,\u201d he says. Sumner was among hundreds who gathered at a healing ceremony along the Baaka (Darling river) late last year, worried for the health of the Murray-Darling system, from Queensland to the Coorong. \u201cSome of the Murray cod [who died] were over a hundred years old. They died in their own environment. And I thought, when is it our turn? Because Ngarrindjerri, we consider some of the fish as ngarritji, which means \u2018my best friend\u2019. They are ngarritji and people would translate that to mean \u201ctotems\u201d. When our totems die, when is it our turn? Is it happening now, when we\u2019re dying in our own environment? \u201cWe need to take notice about the world, about the environment, about diseases. \u201cWhen did the first really bad disease come to this country?

The race between Biden and Donald Trump, who himself faces \u2013 and denies \u2013 accusations of sexual assault and misconduct from more than a dozen women, will be the first of the #MeToo era. Republicans have begun to weaponize Reade\u2019s story while Democrats stand behind Biden.

Then, Biden said \u201cit takes enormous courage for a woman to come forward under bright lights, with millions of people watching, and relive something that happened to her\u201d.

Women are among Trump\u2019s fiercest critics and have organized, voted and run for office in record numbers since his election. Biden has vowed to pick a woman as his running mate. On Friday, Biden pointed to his record as the author of the Violence Against Women Act, and his work as vice-president on combatting sexual assault on college campuses. Yet he has faced renewed scrutiny over his handling of Anita Hill\u2019s testimony during the supreme court nomination of Clarence Thomas, who she accused of sexual harassment, in the 1990s. Before Biden launched his campaign, eight women accused him of touching them or displaying affection in ways that made them uncomfortable. Reade was among them.

Tina Tchen, president of advocacy group Time\u2019s Up Now, said: \u201cToday, Vice-President Joe Biden sat down and directly addressed the allegation against him with the seriousness it deserves, something that the current president has never done.\u201d In an interview with conservative radio host Dan Bongino, Trump offered Biden advice: \u201cI would just say to Joe Biden, \u2018Just go out and fight it.\u2019 \u201cAll of a sudden you become a wealthy guy, you\u2019re a famous guy, then you become president, and people just \u2013 people that you\u2019ve never seen, that you\u2019ve never heard of, make charges,\u201d Trump said, before turning back to Biden: \u201cSo I guess in a way you could say I\u2019m sticking up for him.\u201d During a White House briefing, the press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, asserted that the American people have already rendered a verdict on the accusations against Trump, by electing him.

Malone\u2019s Liberty Global is ITV\u2019s largest shareholder, making him the kingmaker in any potential deal for the broadcaster.</p> <p>A deal between Virgin Media and O2 would bring together the mobile operator\u2019s 34m customers, the largest network in the UK, with the cable operator\u2019s 5.3m broadband, pay-TV and mobile users.</p> <p>O2 has been a target for a potential takeover since 2015 when a \u00a310.25bn bid by rival Three UK, which is owned by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/11/three-takeover-of-o2-blocked-by-european-commission-on-competition-concerns\">blocked by the European Commission on competition grounds.</a></p> <p>Telefonica subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/o2s-possible-ipo-depends-weakening-state-uk-economy\">explored a potential \u00a310bn spin-off of the business</a> on the London stock market to reduce debt. The initial public offering was subsequently put on hold as the impact of Brexit raised fears over the state of the UK economy.</p> <p>A combination of Virgin Media, which runs virtual mobile network Virgin Mobile using BT\u2019s network, and O2 has previously been seen in the city as a smart consolidation move in the UK telecommunications industry.</p> <p>In November, Telefonica, which is due to announce first-quarter earnings on 7 May, announced a major global restructuring plan to focus on four main markets including the UK, while selling off a number of assets in Latin America.</p> <p>Last year, Liberty Global sold its German and Eastern European cable assets to Vodafone for \u20ac18bn. As a result the company has about \u00a35.6bn in cash to deploy for potential investments. Liberty Global and Vodafone have previously held talks about a tie-up in the UK, similar to the current talks between Virgin Media and O2, but they did not progress to a deal.</p> <p>However, the two companies struck a joint venture deal in the Netherlands in 2016, combining cable and mobile networks, and a revival of talks in the UK cannot be ruled out now a potential deal with O2 has been made public.</p> <p>Last year, Vodafone and Virgin Media signed a deal in the UK to use each other\u2019s networks, which was viewed as a renewing of closer ties that could kick on to potential talks of a wider deal.</p> <p>Liberty Global, Virgin Media, O2 and Telefonica declined to comment.</p> <p><br><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The owners of Virgin Media and O2 are in talks to create a new TV and mobile power player to challenge BT and Sky in the UK. Billionaire John Malone\u2019s Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media and a 10% stake in ITV, is understood to be in talks with Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica to combine their UK assets in a joint venture. The talks will raise speculation about whether Liberty may be open to including ITV in the deal, as the share price of the broadcaster of shows including Coronation Street and Love Island has hit a 10-year low amid the fall in ad revenues due to the coronavirus. In 2006, Virgin Media\u2019s then owner Sir Richard Branson saw the benefits of a takeover of ITV, but Sky took a stake in the free-to-air broadcaster to thwart the move. Malone\u2019s Liberty Global is ITV\u2019s largest shareholder, making him the kingmaker in any potential deal for the broadcaster. A deal between Virgin Media and O2 would bring together the mobile operator\u2019s 34m customers, the largest network in the UK, with the cable operator\u2019s 5.3m broadband, pay-TV and mobile users. O2 has been a target for a potential takeover since 2015 when a \u00a310.25bn bid by rival Three UK, which is owned by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, was blocked by the European Commission on competition grounds. Telefonica subsequently explored a potential \u00a310bn spin-off of the business on the London stock market to reduce debt. The initial public offering was subsequently put on hold as the impact of Brexit raised fears over the state of the UK economy. A combination of Virgin Media, which runs virtual mobile network Virgin Mobile using BT\u2019s network, and O2 has previously been seen in the city as a smart consolidation move in the UK telecommunications industry. In November, Telefonica, which is due to announce first-quarter earnings on 7 May, announced a major global restructuring plan to focus on four main markets including the UK, while selling off a number of assets in Latin America. Last year, Liberty Global sold its German and Eastern European cable assets to Vodafone for \u20ac18bn. As a result the company has about \u00a35.6bn in cash to deploy for potential investments. Liberty Global and Vodafone have previously held talks about a tie-up in the UK, similar to the current talks between Virgin Media and O2, but they did not progress to a deal. However, the two companies struck a joint venture deal in the Netherlands in 2016, combining cable and mobile networks, and a revival of talks in the UK cannot be ruled out now a potential deal with O2 has been made public. Last year, Vodafone and Virgin Media signed a deal in the UK to use each other\u2019s networks, which was viewed as a renewing of closer ties that could kick on to potential talks of a wider deal. Liberty Global, Virgin Media, O2 and Telefonica declined to comment.",

His mother, 76-year-old Ann Fahey, had been found collapsed on the floor of her room at the Newmarch House aged-care home in Penrith, in Sydney\u2019s west, where she is a resident. Nurses feared she\u2019d fallen out of bed, but when he spoke to her on the phone Ann told Fahey that after waking during the night she\u2019d felt tired and dizzy and had laid down on the floor. \u201cShe had a 38.9 degree temperature so she was a bit off with the fairies, but all she kept saying was that she was tired,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cShe just wanted to get off the phone and sleep.\u201d By early afternoon staff confirmed what he\u2019d feared: more than a month after the aged-care home went into lockdown and after two previous tests came back negative, his mother was one of three new confirmed cases of Covid-19 recorded at Newmarch. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. She was a model patient, did everything right, she\u2019s shut herself in her room the entire time,\u201d Fahey said. \u201cThere\u2019s shitloads going through my mind. Why is it still happening? \u2026 How can they still be getting new cases after this long. I mean it\u2019s not rocket science. It\u2019s coming in from the outside because she\u2019s been meticulous following all their guidelines.\u201d The Covid-19 outbreak at Newmarch House, which has so far claimed the lives of 13 residents and threatens to overtake the Ruby Princess as Australia\u2019s deadliest wave of the virus, began when a part-time carer worked six shifts while symptomatic and infectious. Newmarch had already been in a type of lockdown before then. On 18 March the national cabinet announced rules placing strict limitations on the number of visitors allowed inside aged-care homes. The rules meant visits were limited to two adult visitors at once a day inside a resident\u2019s room. But when the staff member returned a positive diagnosis for Covid-19 on 11 April after being told she had come into contact with a confirmed case, a flood of cases within the home were quickly discovered. On 12 April the first resident returned a positive result for the virus. Six days later a 93-year-old man became the first to die. Despite efforts to isolate every resident and the federal government\u2019s introduction of surge workers from a private company, Aspen Medical, to help contain the outbreak, infections have risen steadily. There are now 61 confirmed cases of Covid-19 related to Newmarch House, including 24 staff and 37 residents. On Wednesday a 74-year-old man became the 13th resident to die and on Saturday, two further staff members tested positive. New South Wales health officials have said the staff member who first became infected had experienced only extremely mild symptoms before testing positive, and the state\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, told media the woman was \u201cmortified\u201d when she discovered she had the virus. In any case, the spiralling death toll inside the aged care home has left the families of some residents furious with Newmarch\u2019s operator, Anglicare. Families have been gathering outside the facility to hold a vigil every afternoon, with some lucky enough to catch a glimpse of their relative through a window. This week, a group of family members published an open letter to Anglicare\u2019s chief executive, Grant Millard, saying communication from within the home had been \u201cfar from satisfactory\u201d. \u201cPhones went unanswered day after day. Calls were not returned. Details about our individual loved ones were not provided regularly,\u201d the letter read. \u201cThe residents were reporting that the care was inadequate and they were becoming distressed.

In a statement, Anglicare said the new infections had occurred \u201cdespite us having strict procedures and enforced infection control practices in place\u201d. \u201cThese new cases may reflect historical transmissions and reflect the rigorous and ongoing testing at Newmarch House. We will be investigating further how this has occurred,\u201d the statement read. On Friday, when unveiling a national code for aged-care facility visitation, Colbeck said the government\u2019s assistance to Newmarch meant it was \u201ceffectively running a mini-hospital within the facility\u201d, but did not criticise Anglicare for its response to the situation. \u201cThere has been no limit on the resources made available to Newmarch in managing this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a finger-pointing or a blame exercise, it\u2019s a very, very unfortunate circumstance where somebody who was asymptomatic, but obviously had a very high viral load, was in contact with people for six days, residents and staff, and this is the very, very tragic outcome of that.\u201d On Saturday, Chant announced a further infection control review of Newmarch launched after a wave of infections this week had shown breaches of safety protocol \u201camongst particularly the staff\u201d. \u201cAnd that\u2019s obviously a concern. There have been some elements where consistent application of infection control practice has not occurred,\u201d Chant said. For the family of some residents, the situation is become increasingly desperate. \u201cI sort of lost my temper with it all the other night a bit. I just think, can\u2019t they bring the army in, get them all out of this toxic cesspit and take them somewhere else,\u201d Mark Fahey said. \u201cYou only get one mum. As soon as I found out, my first instinct is just to go and get her, but you can\u2019t get into the joint. It\u2019s the worst place in Australia to be unfortunately, and I can\u2019t get her out.\u201d",

It is the first drug shown to help fight Covid-19, which has killed more than 230,000 people worldwide. Donald Trump announced the news on Friday at the White House alongside Stephen Hahn, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner, who said the drug would be available for patients hospitalized with Covid-19. The president said the approval represented a \u201cvery promising situation\u201d in the country\u2019s fight against coronavirus, and Dr Deborah Birx added, \u201cI think this really illustrates what can happen in such a short time.\u201d The emergency approval comes days after Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, expressed cautious optimism about the results of a remdesivir drug trial. \u201cThe data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,\u201d Fauci said earlier this week. \u201cWhat it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.\u201d The FDA acted after preliminary results from a government-sponsored study showed that Gilead Sciences\u2019s remdesivir shortened the time to recovery by 31%, or about four days on average, for hospitalized Covid-19 patients. The study of 1,063 patients is the largest and most strict test of the drug and included a comparison group that received just usual care so remdesivir\u2019s effects could be rigorously evaluated. Those given the drug were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average versus 15 days for the comparison group. The drug also might be reducing deaths, although that\u2019s not certain from the partial results revealed so far. Fauci said the drug would become a new standard of care for severely ill Covid-19 patients like those in this study. The drug has not been tested on people with milder illness, and currently is given through an IV in a hospital. The FDA authorized the drug under its emergency powers to quickly speed experimental drugs, tests and other medical products to patients during public health crises. In normal times the FDA requires \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of a drug\u2019s safety and effectiveness, usually through one or more large, rigorously controlled patient studies. But during public health emergencies the agency can waive those standards, simply requiring that an experimental drug\u2019s potential benefits outweigh its risks. No drugs are approved now for treating the coronavirus, and remdesivir will still need formal approval. The FDA can convert the drug\u2019s status to full approval if Gilead or other researchers provide additional data of remdesivir\u2019s safety and effectiveness. Use of the drug will be authorized for adults or children who are hospitalized with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 and whose condition is \u201csevere\u201d, meaning they have low blood oxygen levels, need oxygen therapy or are on a mechanical ventilator, the FDA said. \u201cBased on evaluation of the emergency use authorization criteria and the scientific evidence available, it was determined that it is reasonable to believe that remdesivir may be effective in treating Covid-19, and that, given there are no adequate, approved or available alternative treatments, the known and potential benefits to treat this serious or life-threatening virus currently outweigh the known and potential risks of the drug\u2019s use,\u201d the FDA said in its statement. The emergency use authorization (EUA) also includes information about possible side effects, which include \u201cincreased levels of liver enzymes, which may be a sign of inflammation or damage to cells in the liver; and infusion-related reactions, which may include low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, sweating and shivering\u201d.

      "bodyText": "California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, promised \u201cmeaningful\u201d adjustments to stay-at-home orders in the coming days as thousands of protesters gathered across the state in defiance of the lockdown. Demonstrations took place from the capital of Sacramento to San Francisco and San Diego, while large crowds turned out in Orange county\u2019s Huntington Beach, a recent flashpoint after Newsom ordered beaches there to close. Newsom said that the state was \u201cgetting very close\u201d to making changes that would affect how businesses, including restaurants, could operate, and urged residents to be patient. He said the announcement of the changes would come in \u201cdays, not weeks\u201d. Nearly 3,000 people protested in Huntington Beach on Friday, the city\u2019s police chief told the OC Register. The Huntington Beach protest followed the closure of beaches in Orange county after a weekend when tens of thousands of people hit the sands south of Los Angeles county, which had been closed for weeks. Newsom scolded local residents for defying the spirit of the stay-at-home order, and responded by ordering all beaches in the county to temporarily close. \u201cI served in the army and fought tyrants and dictators overseas and this has gone too far,\u201d one protester told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI didn\u2019t do that to come back here and live under a tyrant in my own country.\u201d Many of the Huntington Beach protesters brought their children along with them, the Los Angeles Times reported, with one protester saying he had come with his wife and three young children because it was important to show that the protesters are \u201cnormal people\u201d. In Sacramento, the state\u2019s capital, a packed crowd of protesters faced off with lines of riot cops in a tense and chaotic protest on Friday afternoon. \u201cTraitors!\u201d the protesters screamed at police, according to a livestream of the protest produced by reporters from the Sacramento Bee. Some protesters held signs promoting anti-vaccine conspiracies or questioning whether the coronavirus is real, while others protested the closure of businesses during the pandemic, arguing that all jobs are essential. Almost none of the protesters were wearing masks, according to reporters and photographers at the scene. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) had announced that it would be barring protests at the capitol because of a lack of social distancing by participants at a previous rally, but protesters gathered on the steps of the building regardless, chanting \u201cWhose house? Our house!\u201d The CHP repeatedly ordered the protesters to disperse, the Sacramento Bee reported, and by 3pm, a line of law enforcement in full riot gear had slowly pushed protesters back from the capitol steps towards the street. Other protests were smaller: only about 150 people rallied in San Francisco, and hundreds in San Diego, according to local news reports. The rallies across California against Newsom\u2019s stay-at-home orders came as a rural county in northern California became the first to defy statewide orders by allowing nonessential businesses to reopen and diners to eat in restaurants. Modoc county, in the state\u2019s far north-east, near Oregon, had no Covid-19 cases, a local official told the Associated Press.

Asked about his response to protesters calling him a tyrant and a fascist, Newsom simply urged Californians to \u201ctake care of yourself\u201d. \u201cWear a face covering,\u201d he said. \u201cDo justice to physical distancing. You don\u2019t want to contract this disease.\u201d People who showed no symptoms could still spread the virus, Newsom warned the protesters. \u201cProtect yourself. Protect your family.

He said he could not possibly monitor and respond to every protest happening across the state. \u201cI have confidence in local law enforcement, incredible confidence,\u201d Newsom said. In Sacramento, where many protesters were flouting social distancing guidelines, at least one person had been arrested, according to the Sacramento Bee. Newsom defended his announcement that changes in shelter-in-place would come in \u201cmany days\u201d, rather than weeks, and said that the move was motivated by the data, not just by the political resistance bubbling up across the state. More than 2,000 people have died of coronavirus in California so far, including 91 people in the previous day, but the number of patients in intensive care units stayed flat, and the total number of hospitalizations had fallen slightly, both signs of progress justifying a move towards some changes in the emergency order, Newsom said.

It emerged this week that NSW police had told the state parliament there was no evidence the documents had been downloaded from the council website, leading to Taylor\u2019s distinction between \u201cdownload\u201d and \u201caccessing\u201d. Moore, who was also concerned by reports Taylor was not interviewed by police, said it was \u201cnearly beyond belief\u201d Taylor had still not explained the origin of the altered document. Obama White House team watched Gillard\u2019s misogyny speech \u2013 a lot In an interview with the podcast A Rational Fear, Obama White House adviser Ben Rhodes revealed the former president\u2019s team would often watch Julia Gillard\u2019s misogyny speech when they were \u201creally annoyed\u201d with Tony Abbott. Rhodes, Obama\u2019s former deputy national security adviser, said the team was often frustrated with the former Coalition PM over his positions on climate change, particularly during the lead-up to the Paris agreement. He did not say whether the former president was among the viewers of Gillard\u2019s speech. In the podcast, Rhodes also revealed how Obama \u201cwent way off the script\u201d to blast the Abbott government during a visit to Brisbane for the G20 summit. Investigation finds Taylor-linked company poisoned endangered grasslands A much-anticipated report by the federal environment department concluded a company part-owned by Angus Taylor illegally poisoned critically endangered grasslands in the New South Wales Monaro region. Jam Land, which Taylor part-owns with his brother Richard, was ordered to restore 103 hectares of native grassland three and a half years after poisoning the land on a property in Corrowong. The company avoided a fine and criminal finding, and the company intends to have the decision reviewed. Angus Taylor said he has no direct or controlling interest in the company. Labor the Greens have called for Taylor to resign, citing meetings he sought with senior environment officials about the grasslands while the review was under way. He denies any wrongdoing. McKenzie\u2019s sports grants submission fails to explain role PM\u2019s office Bridget McKenzie, who quit as sports minister while engulfed in the sports grants scandal, lodged a bulky response to a Senate inquiry that still failed to explain the role of Scott Morrison\u2019s office in rejigging sports funding on the day the last election was called. McKenzie insisted she was not aware of applications for funds being colour-coded according to the party representing the electorate. However, it is likely the former Nationals deputy leader will be directly questioned on matters by the committee next month. Leaked report shows government told to ban fracking in Lake Eyre basin The Guardian obtained a leaked report that revealed the Queensland government was urged by experts to ban fracking in the environmentally sensitive Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre basin. The government had blocked report\u2019s release after granting gas companies new exploration rights, infuriating conservation groups who called for the findings to be made public. Labor MPs quits, setting up Covid byelection Labor MP Mike Kelly, the member for Eden-Monaro, announced he would resign from parliament, citing health issues incurred while he was a serviceman. It sets up a federal byelection contest during the Covid-19 pandemic that could be expected to canvass the government\u2019s response to both the pandemic and the recent bushfires which ravaged the area, as well as other local issues. Labor is expected to preselect the mayor of Bega Valley shire, while the NSW deputy premier, Nationals leader John Barilaro, is considering whether to throw his hat in the ring.",

That has led to international criticism and wounded national pride, writes Gina Gustavsson, an academic at Uppsala University.

The policy is widely supported by the public, even though the Swedish Covid-19 <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">mortality rate</a> is among the 10 highest in the world, at <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/\">240 per million</a> population and steadily rising, and many of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/anger-in-sweden-as-elderly-pay-price-for-coronavirus-strategy\">nursing homes</a> in Stockholm are now affected.</p> \n   <p>The typical explanation for this continued public support is that Swedes are trusting and unflappable. The country\u2019s chief epidemiologist, <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-swedish-epidemiologist-anders-tegnell-the-target-of-praise-criticism/\">Anders Tegnell</a>, the public face of the Swedish response to the pandemic, is after all a dry scientist-turned-bureaucrat, not some populist politician trying to whip up nationalist go-it-alone emotion.</p> \n   <p>But beneath the surface, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sweden\">Sweden</a> is anything but calm. The public debate is inflamed with a sense of wounded national pride. As a believer in the kind of liberal nationalism that encourages self-critical national attachment, this pains me.

      "bodyText": "We are closing the blog now but coverage will continue over here. Reuters: Police in the Chilean capital Santiago detained more than 50 protesters on Friday, saying they had violated rules intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Protesters gathered on the Labor Day holiday in Santiago\u2019s central square, many shouting and displaying signs that railed against abuse of workers and a sharp rise in layoffs in the South American nation. Calls to protest on social media warned those who attended the rally to \u201cuse gloves, masks and alcohol gel,\u201d but police said demonstrators had failed to adhere to a nationwide rule against gatherings of more than 50 people. The Carabineros police force said on Twitter that one of the protesters detained had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and was meant to be in isolation for another week. Police officers clad in plastic-screened helmets and olive uniforms herded protesters into police vehicles, while water cannons mounted on trucks nearby dispersed others. Santiago is under partial quarantine, but scattered, small protests against the government of center-right President Sebastian Pinera have persisted in areas not under lockdown. Hello, this is Helen Davidson taking over the live blog for the next little bit. Thanks to Kevin Rawlinson for his coverage over the last few hours. Here is our latest catch-up on recent developments. The top US health official Dr Anthony Fauci will be prevented from testifying to a congressional committee examining the Trump administration\u2019s response to the pandemic next week, the White House has said. The Trump administration claimed it would be \u201ccounterproductive\u201d to have individuals involved in the response testify. The White House spokesman Judd Deere told Reuters: While the Trump administration continues its whole-of-government response to Covid-19, including safely opening up America again and expediting vaccine development, it is counter-productive to have the very individuals involved in those efforts appearing at congressional hearings. We are committed to working with Congress to offer testimony at the appropriate time. Trump said after the KCNA report that he will have something to say about Kim at the appropriate time. There has been speculation about Kim\u2019s health after he missed the birth anniversary celebrations of state founder Kim Il Sung on 15 April. The day is a major holiday in North Korea and Kim as leader usually pays a visit to the mausoleum where his grandfather lies in state. A source familiar with US intelligence analyses and reporting told Reuters they could not immediately confirm the KCNA report. The White House and State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. According to Reuters, the news of Kim Jong-un\u2019s appearance in public is now also being reported by North Korean sources. The state news agency KCNA says he attended the completion of a fertiliser plant in a region north of the capital, Pyongyang, on Friday. It is the first report of his public activity since 11 April. According to KCNA, Kim cut a ribbon at the ceremony and those in attendance \u201cburst into thunderous cheers of \u2018hurrah!\u2019 for the Supreme Leader who is commanding the all-people general march for accomplishing the great cause of prosperity\u201d. Kim was accompanied by several senior North Korean officials, including his younger sister Kim Yo Jong, KCNA said. Reuters said it could not independently verify the report. The US president Donald Trump has offered an increasingly bleak picture for the US, telling a White House event: Hopefully, we\u2019re going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number, nevertheless. Trump, who initially dismissed the outbreak as a \u201choax\u201d, has oscillated between claiming that a death toll of between 100,000 and 200,000 people would represent a success and predicting it could be as light as 60,000 or 70,000. According to the latest figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 62,406 people have died in the US since the outbreak began. The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has made his first public appearance in nearly three weeks, according to South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency. His absence amid the pandemic had been the cause of speculation, though South Korean and US officials had stressed their belief he was not ill and could simply have been sheltering from the pandemic. More than 70% of virus patients admitted to critical care are men, according to data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC). The research was based on a sample of 7,542 critically-ill patients confirmed as having Covid-19. It showed 5,389 of the patients were men compared to 2,149 women. The report also found that men were more likely to die in critical care, with 51% dying in care compared to around 43% of women. In total about 49% of the 5,139 patients admitted to critical care who had recorded care outcomes had died, it found. The FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn was careful to note that remdesivir has not received FDA approval as a coronavirus treatment and has only been approved for emergency use on severely ill patients who have been hospitalised. FDA approval requires a much more lengthy review process, while an emergency use authorisation is issued more quickly after the agency weighs the potential risks and potential benefits of a treatment option to help address an emergency situation. Today\u2019s action is an important step in our efforts to collaborate with innovators and researchers to provide sick patients timely access to new therapies where appropriate, while at the same time supporting research to further evaluate whether they are safe and effective. There\u2019s tremendous interest among all parties to identify and arm ourselves with medicines to combat COVID-19, and through our Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, the FDA is working around-the-clock and using every tool at our disposal to speed these efforts. More people stayed home in Brazil, Japan and Singapore in April as their numbers of cases surged, while people in the United States and Australia returned to parks and jobs as infection rates flattened, data from Google suggest. The latest weekly update of aggregated travel patterns Google collected from its users\u2019 phones points to increased disobedience with lockdown orders in place since March but rising compliance with those issued last month. The US president Donald Trump has told reporters the drug remedesivir has been approved for emergency use to treat coronavirus patients. The FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn clarified that the drug had specifically been cleared for emergency use on those in hospital. The president said the approval represented a \u201cvery promising situation\u201d and the White House\u2019s taskforce coordinator Dr Deborah Birx added: \u201cI think this really illustrates what can happen in such a short time.\u201d The emergency approval comes days after Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, expressed cautious optimism about the results of a remdesivir drug trial. The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery. What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus. Albania is relaxing some of its restrictions from Monday, its prime minister Edi Rama has said. It will enlarge its area of green zones and let taxis travel between cities. Then, from 11 May, it will allow shopping centres to open and cars to travel without permits. While still enforcing an afternoon-to-dawn curfew, Albania has eased its restrictions this week, letting many retailers open except for bars and restaurants, though they may offer deliveries. Some people wore masks, others did not. On 12 March, two weeks after Australia declared the coronavirus would become a pandemic and 47 days after the first case in Australia was detected in Melbourne, the World Health Organisation made it official. That night, in Melbourne, organisers of the Australian Grand Prix were scrambling to keep the event open despite an 11th hour order from Victoria\u2019s chief health officer that they could run the race but had to turn spectators away. It would be the first major event in Australia to be cancelled by the coronavirus. Within 24 hours, almost every other flagship event planned for the next month would follow suit. This is the first 50 days of the shutdown. Yemen has reported its first case in Taiz governorate, raising the number of diagnosed infections to seven with two deaths in the war-torn country that lacks medical care. The United Nations says it fears the virus could be spreading undetected among an acutely malnourished population with inadequate testing capabilities. The national emergency coronavirus committee tweeted: A new confirmed case of coronavirus was reported, the first in (southwestern) governorate of Taiz, in a man in his 40s. Yemen recorded its first case in southern Hadharamout province on 10 April. On Wednesday, it announced five infections in the southern port of Aden, with two deaths. Hundreds of people have gathered in a Berlin square to mark May Day in defiance of the ban on public gatherings of more than 20, exposing deep frustrations with physical distancing rules. Reuters reports that police blocked roads around a square in Kreuzberg, traditionally the centre of left-wing May Day protests to prevent more people from joining what a police spokeswoman called an illegal gathering. Leftist groups had called for the demonstration to denounce capitalism and urge solidarity, especially with refugees seeking to reach Europe. They had urged participants to wear masks and stay at least 1.5 metres apart. \u201cSaving lives is not a crime,\u201d read a giant red banner dangled from a window, in a reference to the rescue ships saving refugees trying to reach Europe. Most of those gathered appeared to be keeping a safe distance from one another. Riot police watched from a distance as a police helicopter circled overhead. \u201cWe have prevented the parade from growing bigger and are using loudspeakers to urge people to disperse,\u201d the police spokeswoman said, adding that the situation remained largely peaceful. An overwhelming majority of Germans back the lockdown enforced by the country\u2019s 16 states and backed by the chancellor Angela Merkel, despite its heavy toll on the economy, which is expected to contract by a record of more than 6% this year. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reiterated that the virus is of natural origin after the US president\u2019s uncorroborated claims he had seen evidence it originated in a Chinese lab, AFP reports. Scientists believe it jumped from animals to humans, emerging in China late last year, possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat. Trump has refused to offer any details of or evidence for his claim that he has proof that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was actually the source of the outbreak. Asked about Trump\u2019s claim during a virtual press conference, WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan stressed that the UN health agency had \u201clistened again and again to numerous scientists who have looked at the sequences\u201d of the virus. \u201cWe are assured that this virus is natural in origin,\u201d he said, reiterating a stance the UN agency has expressed previously. Varadkar\u2019s widely expected announcement was made in a solemn address that channelled the Vera Lynn song We\u2019ll Meet Again. Varadkar announced two tweaks to restrictions that are due to expire on 5 May: the 2km limit on exercise will extend to 5km and people aged over 70 who are cocooning will be allowed to exercise outdoors. I know it\u2019s been difficult. The uncertainty about when things will get back to normal and the fear of the virus itself. As a nation, our physical health has been attacked, our mental health eroded. Our economy battered and our society put to the ultimate test. Restrictions were working and had saved thousands of lives but progress could be \u201cswept away\u201d with premature relaxation, he said. It will take some time for our lives to get back to normal. To a new normal. But it will happen. The reopening will have five stages, three weeks apart, starting on 18 May. If Covid-19 surges, it may be necessary to reverse, said Varadkar. In the first phase outdoor workers, including builders and gardeners, will be able to return to work. Hardware shops, garden centres and other selected categories will be allowed to reopen and small outdoor gatherings will be permitted. \u201cNot long from now, some summer night, we will see our friends again,\u201d said Varadkar. US meat production has continued to decline as the coronavirus crisis forces the shutdown of more processing facilities, sparking fears of shortages at grocery stores nationwide, writes Guardian US reporter Kenya Evelyn. The US Department of Agriculture\u2019s weekly report found that from 27 April, beef production was down nearly 25% compared to the same time last year. Pork production was down 15%. While Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, has said the US has \u201cplenty of food for all of [its] citizens\u201d, fewer pigs are being slaughtered at processing plants, down by nearly 50% since mid-March. Meat processing companies have paused operations as some workers have tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Last month, Tyson Foods, one of America\u2019s largest meat producers, warned \u201cthe food supply chain is breaking\u201d in a full-page ad in newspapers including the New York Times. \u201cThere will be limited supply of products,\u201d the Arkansas-based company said, until it can reopen closed facilities. Restriction on movement are to continue for several more weeks in Ireland, although over-70s may now leaves their homes to exercise, Leo Varadkar has said. In an address to the nation on Friday evening, the Taoiseach said most restrictions would remain in place until 18 May, \u201cto weaken the virus further so it doesn\u2019t make a comeback,\u201d the Journal reported. Thirty-four more people have died from Covid-19 in Ireland, taking the country\u2019s total death toll 1,265, reports the Irish Department of Health. There is now a total of 20,833 confirmed cases in the country after 221 more were detected since Thursday. Donald Trump threatening to reignite the US-China trade war in reaction to coronavirus has triggered a sell-off in global financial markets, as the economic costs of the pandemic continue to mount, Richard Partington, the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent, reports. Against a backdrop of rising tension between the world\u2019s two biggest economic superpowers, share prices resumed a downward slide on Friday with the FTSE 100 falling by 144 points, or 2.5%, in London. Selling pressure resumed on Wall Street after recording gradual gains in recent weeks amid rising hopes a turning point had been reached for the coronavirus crisis. As fears over the economic costs from the disease mount and as the White House ramped up the threat of a renewed trade conflict with Beijing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 2% in afternoon trading in New York. Stock prices fell sharply in Japan, with the Nikkei index of leading Japanese company shares sliding by more than 500 points, or 2.8%. Markets in China, Hong Kong and South Korea were closed for public holidays. Despite world leaders starting to outline plans to lift lockdown measures more than a month on from the depths of the crisis, the economic fallout from tight controls on social and business activity during the Covid-19 outbreak are now becoming increasingly clear A US federal judge ordered authorities to release of people from three migrant detention centres in Florida to prevent a wider spread of the coronavirus and protect detainees with underlying conditions, the Associated Press reports. District court judge Marcia Cooke issued an order late on Thursday for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to begin the steps to bring down the number of detainees from 1,400 to about 350 within two weeks. Two others orders were also issued on Thursday by federal judges in California and Louisiana siding with groups seeking the release of immigrants at high risk. In Miami, seven detainees at the Krome detention centre have tested positive for Covid-19. According to court filings at least eight members of staff have also been infected there. The judge said she found violations of the Fifth and Eight Amendments that protect due process and against unusual punishment, as conditions are worsening each day at Krome and authorities have failed at practicing social distancing at one of the other facilities. These failures have placed petitioners at a heightened risk of not only contracting COVID-19, but also succumbing to the fatal effects of the virus as some of the petitioners have serious underlying medical illness, Cook wrote in the document. Such failures amount to cruel and unusual punishment because they are exemplary of deliberate indifference. ICE was ordered to submit a report on Sunday with the steps to release detainees. Here are the latest headlines in our global coronavirus news coverage: The global number of infections passed 3.2m, while at least 233,000 have died, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s tally of official figures. The UK death toll rose to at least 27,510 after officials reported 739 more deaths. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said 177,454 people have tested positive; an increase of 6,201 since Thursday\u2019s update. Of those, 15,111 are in hospital. The US military has developed as potential breakthrough test that could identify carriers before they become infectious. Researchers hope the blood test will detect the virus about four days before current tests can. Israel is to partially reopen schools on Sunday, with a full return for all students by 1 June. First, second and third graders as well as 11th and 12th graders can return to school from Sunday, the first day of the week in Israel. US activists plan biggest rent strike in decades, calling for state leaders to cancel rent during the pandemic. Activists in New York, Pennsylvania and California are encouraging tenants to withhold rent, even if they can pay. India extended its lockdown \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest by population \u2013 for two more weeks, but with some easing of restrictions in areas with few cases. South Africa began to ease its lockdown, with some industries allowed to reopen after five weeks. Africa\u2019s most industrialised nation was already struggling with low growth and high debts when the lockdown began on 27 March. The US handed $50m Covid-19 aid to fossil fuel firms, money that they are unlikely to have to pay back, according to a review of coronavirus aid meant for small businesses by investigative research group Documented and the Guardian. Japan is preparing for a month-long extension to its state of emergency, its prime minister, Shinzo Abe, says. He imposed an initial month-long emergency for seven regions on 7 April, before expanding it across the whole country. Six more people have died from coronavirus in Serbia, while 196 new infections were recorded, according to a report on local news site Telegraf. The latest update brings the total death toll in the Balkan country to 185, with the overall number of confirmed cases now at 9,205. Serbia has so far counted 113 male victims of the virus, and 72 female. Sixty-five patients are currently on respirators in the country. Egypt has reported 14 more deaths from Covid-19, bringing the country\u2019s total toll to 406. According to the health ministry\u2019s daily report, published on Facebook, 358 more confirmed cases of coronavirus were detected. So far 5,895 infections have been confirmed in Egypt, making it Africa\u2019s second-worst affected country. Deaths from the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy climbed by 269 on Friday, down from 285 the day before, the Civil Protection Agency said, while the daily tally of new infections stood at 1,965 against 1,872 on Thursday, Reuters reports. The total death toll since the outbreak came to light on 21 February now stands at 28,236, the agency said - giving it the second highest death toll from the virus in the world after that of the US. The number of officially confirmed cases, which includes those who have died or recovered, was 207,428, the third highest global tally behind those of the US and Spain. People registered as currently carrying the illness declined to 100,943 from 101,551 on Thursday. There were 1,578 people in intensive care on Friday against a previous 1,694, maintaining a long-running decline. Of those originally infected, 78,249 were declared recovered against 75,945 a day earlier. The agency said 1.399 million people had been tested for the virus against 1.355 million the day before, out of a population of around 60 million. Scientists in Germany have said children with the coronavirus may be as infectious as adults, and urged caution as schools and playgrounds across Europe start to reopen, Kate Connolly in Berlin and Kim Willsher in Paris report. Researchers who analysed data on infected people found that the viral loads in children differed little from those in adults. Opening schools on the assumption that children are less likely to spread the virus was therefore ill-advised, said Christian Drosten, a virologist and Germany\u2019s leading coronavirus expert, who led the team. \u201cIn the current situation, we must warn against the unlimited reopening of schools and kindergartens,\u201d he added. Drosten\u2019s study, which was released this week, examined the viral loads in the throats of 3,721 people, including more than 100 children, who tested positive for coronavirus in Berlin between January and April He said he had been able to carry out his analysis once the number of tests carried out by Labor Berlin, the largest laboratory of its kind in Europe, had reached the critical mass of 60,000 earlier this week. That gave him and his team, including Terry Jones, a mathematician from the Centre for Pathogen Evolution at the University of Cambridge, enough data to be able to carry out an analysis of children who have had the virus. The number of people who have died from Covid-19 in Turkey has risen by 84 in the last 24 hours to 3,258, with 2,188 new cases of the virus, Health Ministry data showed on Friday, according to Reuters. The total number of cases rose to 122,392, the data showed, the highest total outside Western Europe or the US. A total of 53,808 people have so far recovered. The number of tests conducted in the past 24 hours stood at 41,431, raising the total number of tests during the outbreak to 1.075 million. The UK has reported 739 more deaths from Covid-19, bringing the total death toll in the country to 27,510. In a daily briefing on the outbreak, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said 177,454 people have so far tested positive for coronavirus, an increase of 6,201 since yesterday. Of those, 15,111 patients are currently in hospital, Hancock said. You can see more more updates from the daily briefing on our UK blog. South Africa began to ease its strict coronavirus lockdown on Friday, allowing some industries to reopen after five weeks of restrictions, AFP reports. Africa\u2019s most industrialised nation was already teetering with low growth and high debts when the lockdown kicked in on 27 March. Its easing comes after the ratings agency S&amp;P on Wednesday downgraded the country\u2019s credit rating further to junk. President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a televised May Day speech: The poor and the working class are having to bear the burden of a global pandemic that has caused severe economic and social disruption \u2026 As we begin the process of easing the lockdown and many people start returning to work, we must remain vigilant and careful \u2026 The road ahead will be long and hard, and we will make mistakes. With 5,647 confirmed cases and 103 fatalities, South Africa has the continent\u2019s highest Covid-19 death toll. But a mid-April government survey published on Friday showed that respondents were more concerned about a potential economic collapse than contracting coronavirus. People living in the poorest parts of the UK are dying from Covid-19 at double the rate of people in the richest areas, a data analysis has found, writes Caelainn Barr, the Guardian\u2019s data projects editor. The most deprived areas had 55.1 deaths per 100,000 people \u2013 more than double that of people in the least deprived areas, where the death rate was 25.3, according to figures from England and Wales published by the Office for National Statistics on Friday. The findings have lead to calls for the government to support the most vulnerable and prompted questions about why poorer people appear to be dying in greater numbers than the wealthy. Javed Khan, the chief executive of Barnardo\u2019s, said the crisis highlighted \u201cdeep-rooted inequalities that have been papered over for decades\u201d. He went on: Vulnerable children and families \u2013 and those already experiencing disadvantage \u2013 risk becoming the forgotten victims. Without intervention this crisis will be devastating for a whole generation \u2013 their mental health, safety, education and job prospects are on the line. The government must ensure that the emergency funding and resources already announced reaches those in need without delay. And in the months ahead funding decisions should reflect the scale of the challenge now facing vulnerable children and families. India is to extend its coronavirus lockdown - the world\u2019s biggest by population - but with some easing of restrictions in areas with few cases, according to AFP. The home ministry said in a statement that in view of \u201csignificant gains in the COVID-19 situation\u201d, areas with few or no cases would see \u201cconsiderable relaxations\u201d. The lockdown imposed near the end of March has caused misery for millions of workers in India\u2019s vast informal sector and dealt a major blow to Asia\u2019s third-biggest economy. Air travel and passenger trains ground to a halt because of the lockdown and only the transport of \u201cessential goods\u201d was allowed, causing major problems as well as considerable confusion for industry and agriculture. However the stringent restrictions have been credited with keeping confirmed cases of coronavirus to about 35,000 cases as of Friday, with 1,152 deaths. The government said Friday that many activities will remain prohibited nationwide including air and rail travel - except for \u201cselect purposes\u201d - schools, restaurants and large gatherings such as places of worship. Restrictions are being lifted largely according to what colour an area has been assigned in a government rating system. India is split into red zones with \u201csignificant risk of spread of the infection\u201d; green zones with zero cases or no confirmed cases in the past 21 days; and those in between as orange. An outbreak of Covid-19 among workers in a meat factory in Tipperary has raised fears that the virus is spreading through abattoirs and meat-processing plants in Ireland, writes Ella McSweeney, for the Guardian\u2019s Animals Farmed project. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s spokesperson on agriculture, Brian Stanley, told the Irish parliament last night that 120 workers at the Rosderra Meats plant in Roscrea had tested positive for the virus. He also said that of 350 workers at the plant, up to 140 were off sick last week. Rosderra is the largest pork-processing company in Ireland. Michael Creed, Ireland\u2019s agriculture minister, told MPs that he was aware of six meat-processing plants with two or more confirmed cases of Covid-19 among workers, although he did not name them. A spokesperson for Rosderra Meats confirmed to the Guardian that a number of employees had tested positive for coronavirus. They said that the company had implemented stringent measures to ensure the safety of employees, and added that production will be scaled down until all staff return to work. The World Health Organization\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing is starting now. Today, the UN health agency is expected to announce a joint effort with the European Investment bank to support countries in addressing the health impact of Covid-19. The partnership between WHO and the world\u2019s largest international public bank is meant to boost cooperation to strengthen public health, supply of essential equipment, training and hygiene investment in countries most vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO said in a release on Friday. It will will benefit from the EIB\u2019s planned \u20ac1.4bn response to address the health, social and economic impact of COVID-19 in Africa. Efforts will include: scaling up investment to tackle antimicrobial resistance; improving the effectiveness of malaria treatment; scaling up investment to tackle antimicrobial resistance Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general, said: Combining the public health experience of the World Health Organization and the financial expertise of the European Investment Bank will contribute to a more effective response to COVID-19 and other pressing health challenges. WHO looks forward to strengthening cooperation with the EIB to improve access to essential supplies including medical equipment and training, and deliver better water, sanitation and hygiene where most needed. New initiatives to improve primary health care in Africa and support the EU Malaria Fund hint at the potential impact of our new partnership As of 30 April, Vietnam has a coronavirus death count of zero and only 270 cases. Trang Bui, a Vietnamese freelance journalist based in Ho Chi Minh City, has written for the Guardian\u2019s Comment section about how the south east Asian nation achieved it. Out of the key factors that contributed to Vietnam\u2019s successful coronavirus response, timeliness was the first. Vietnam acted early and did not hesitate to alert its citizens. On 28 January, when the country recorded only two cases, the government announced that it was planning for a scenario in which thousands of people could contract the virus. Rwanda is to ease its coronavirus lockdown from Monday, allowing limited movement of people and restricted re-openings of restaurants and hotels, according to Reuters. Movement between provinces in the central African country will still not be allowed, while schools will also remain shut until September, according to a government statement released late on Thursday. All resumed services must adhere to health guidelines ... mask wearing and social distancing. Rwanda alongside neighbouring Uganda implemented some of the strictest lockdown measures in Africa to help slow the spread of the coronavirus, including shuttering all but the most essential businesses. As of Thursday it had 243 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and no deaths. Scientists working for the US military have designed a new Covid-19 test that could potentially identify carriers before they become infectious and spread the disease, Giles Tremlett reports for the Guardian. In what could be a significant breakthrough, project coordinators hope the blood-based test will be able to detect the virus\u2019s presence as early as 24 hours after infection \u2013 before people show symptoms and several days before a carrier is considered capable of spreading it to other people. That is also around four days before current tests can detect the virus. The test has emerged from a project set up by the US military\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) aimed at rapid diagnosis of germ or chemical warfare poisoning. It was hurriedly repurposed when the pandemic broke out and the new test is expected to be put forward for emergency use approval (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within a week. \u201cThe concept fills a diagnostic gap worldwide,\u201d the head of Darpa\u2019s biological technologies office, Dr Brad Ringeisen, told the Guardian, since it should also fill in testing gaps at later stages of the infection. If given FDA approval, he said, it had the potential to be \u201cabsolutely a gamechanger\u201d. Comoros has reported its first case of coronavirus, the World Health Organization\u2019s Africa office said. Its daily round up of Covid-19 figures from Africa showed that South Africa and Egypt still have the most confirmed cases, while Algeria has recorded the most deaths. Riot police fanned out across Hong Kong on Friday after democracy activists threatened to defy a ban on gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic - but the streets remained largely calm, AFP reports. Activists in the semi-autonomous financial hub, which had for months protested against a strengthening of control by China\u2019s government, had issued calls to muster once more on May Day - despite emergency anti-virus laws banning more than four people gathering in public. The threat largely failed to materialise, although hundreds of protesters did however gather in small groups at a shopping mall in the town of Shatin, chanting slogans and holding protest flags. Riot police soon rushed into the mall and used pepper spray to disperse the crowd. One protester, a retired firefighter who gave his name as Lam, said: I feel that the movement has been watered down because of the pandemic, but I personally think we should keep fighting. If we shrink back and accept our fate, then we will be living under an authoritarian regime. A day after armed protesters against Michigan\u2019s stay-at-home order entered the statehouse in Lansing, Donald Trump has once again expressed support for the rightwing movement, writes Joan E Greve, a Guardian US politics reporter. Michigan\u2019s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, should, the president wrote in a tweet on Friday morning, \u201cmake a deal\u201d with the demonstrators. Some of the demonstrators in Lansing on Thursday carried assault rifles, causing alarm among legislators. Some protesters, many without face coverings, entered the statehouse and demanded to be let on to the House floor, which is not allowed. The gallery was closed to the public to allow room for representatives and reporters to spread apart. Cities around the world are taking the lead in post-coronavirus planning, with a raft of environmental initiatives being rolled out in places from Bogot\u00e1 to Barcelona to ensure public safety and bolster the fight against climate breakdown, Guardian environment correspondents Matthew Taylor and Sandra Laville report. Mayors from cities in Europe, the US and Africa held talks this week to coordinate their efforts to support a low-carbon, sustainable recovery from the crisis as national governments begin to roll out huge economic stimulus packages. Many cities have already announced measures, from hundreds of miles of new bike lanes in Milan and Mexico City to widening pavements and pedestrianising neighbourhoods in New York and Seattle. The initiatives are designed to allow people to move around urban spaces safely in a world where physical distancing will be the norm for the foreseeable future \u2013 and do so without sparking a drastic increase in air pollution. The mayors who took part in the newly formed economic taskforce this week believe these initial schemes point the way to more radical long-term measures that will help tackle inequality and the climate crisis. The mayor of Milan, who is heading the taskforce run by the C40 group of cities, said: Our immediate priority is to protect the health of our residents and overcome the Covid-19 pandemic. However, we must also look towards how we will keep our people safe in the future. How we structure our recovery efforts will define our cities for decades to come. Is expecting the worst the best way to handle the coronavirus crisis? During the pandemic, it\u2019s useful to see the role your coping mechanisms play, if only to stop yourself spiralling into anxiety, writes Oliver Burkemann, a Guardian writer based in New York, in his regular column on mental wellbeing. Exactly how terrible are the next months and years going to be? As a generally apocalyptically minded sort of person, I\u2019ve been feeling some pride in watching my favourite question become everyone else\u2019s favourite question, too; it\u2019s like being a 19th-century aristocrat and seeing your debutante daughter become the star of the London season. But in deciding who to listen to, and thus how alarmed to be, it\u2019s easy to overlook a crucial factor: in a crisis as all-consuming as this one, nobody \u2013 not academic experts, not media commentators, not that one friend who keeps urging you to be less (or more) worried than you are \u2013 is a completely neutral observer. Because predictions about the future aren\u2019t solely about the future. They\u2019re also coping mechanisms for dealing with the present.

Boris Johnson is of course no newcomer to Greece, a country he visited regularly in pre-corona times to sojourn at his father\u2019s villa in Pelion, the peninsula off the mainland overlooking the Aegean Sea. Greek diplomats and politicians voice admiration for his knowledge of the classics. But Britain\u2019s handling of the disease \u2013 its soft-touch approach and consequential catastrophic death toll - has been met with disbelief in a nation that, despite the odds has kept Covid-19 under remarkable control. In contrast to the 26,771 people who have succumbed to the pandemic in the UK which has registered 165,221 coronavirus cases so far, Greece has recorded 2,591 infections and a death toll of 140 after enforcing tough measures to curb the spread of the disease early on. Addressing reporters at his daily briefing on Thursday, the Greek health ministry spokesman and infectious disease expert professor Sotiris Tsiodras spoke of \u201cvictory\u201d saying incidents of the illness had clearly stabilised. The UK is home to a large Greek community many of whom fled to Greece before commercial air traffic was suspended in March. Indicative of the mood the popular Protothema newspaper reported the news of the birth of the prime minister\u2019s latest child under the headline: \u201cJohnson, father amid national sorrow over coronavirus.\u201d \u201cIn the midst of the national sorrow that has weighed down on British society, the birth of Boris Johnson\u2019s son has once again brought his personal life, one that is as unconventional as he is, back in the public eye,\u201d the paper wrote. \u201c[A life] with two marriages, an engagement, three extra marital affairs and at least six children.\u201d Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, continued to fly in the face of science on Thursday when he called social isolation measures introduced by state governors and mayors \u201cuseless\u201d. He said: We know that many people will die. I\u2019m sorry. Seventy percent of the population will be infected and, from what it seems, from what we are seeing now, up until now all this effort to flatten the curve was practically useless. What\u2019s the consequence, the collateral effect of this? Unemployment. The people want to go back to work. The president has consistently sought to downplay the impacts of the pandemic, arguing that Brazilians would be immune because they jump in sewage, and mixing with supporters. Brazil has 85,380 confirmed cases and 5,901 deaths with 435 reported in the last 24 hours as numbers accelerate. His new health minister, Nelson Teich, earlier contradicted this view. \u201cYou can\u2019t start freeing things up when you have a curve that is frankly ascending,\u201d he said. While there are no definitive studies about the impact of social isolation on the growth of Brazil\u2019s cases, experts believe it has had a positive impact. The worst-hit state of S\u00e3o Paulo, for instance, was supposed to see a peak in April but this has now been moved to May, the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported. \u201cBrazil had flattened the curve, yes, with isolation measures, but in the last two weeks we are seeing a loosening of isolation and what we are seeing is a new acceleration of the epidemic,\u201d Fernando Bozza,a researcher in infectious diseases at the government research institute Fiocruz in Rio de Janeiro who is modelling the pandemic, told the Guardian. Malaysia on Friday detained hundreds of refugees and migrant workers for illegally living in the country, rights groups said, at a time of movement and travel restrictions imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19. Malaysia has around two million registered foreign workers but authorities estimate many more are living in the Southeast Asian country without proper documents. Malaysia does not formally recognise refugees, regarding them as illegal migrants. The arrests followed immigration raids in a neighbourhood in capital Kuala Lumpur where thousands of migrant workers and refugees live, according to human rights groups and photos shared on social media. Human Rights Watch and the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network said over 700 migrants were taken into custody including young children. Malaysian police and the immigration department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Rachel Tan, programme officer at the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network, said the arrests were a \u201ccriminalisation of a people who toil in difficult and dangerous work conditions\u201d. The neighbourhood where the raids took place was close to an area with three buildings that had been placed under strict lockdowns last month after a surge in coronavirus cases there. Malaysia has reported a total of 6,071 coronavirus cases and 103 deaths, and its prime minister said on Friday that most businesses will reopen from Monday following six-week long curbs that have caused a damaging economic slowdown. Big Macs delivered on meal trolleys, hand washing stations at the entrance and designated waiting spots to separate customers could become a feature of McDonald\u2019s restaurants in the Netherlands when they are allowed to reopen. In a trial at a restaurant in the city of Arnhem, McDonald\u2019s has been looking for ways to maintain social distancing when the coronavirus lockdown is relaxed. McDonald\u2019s Netherlands spokeswoman Eunice Koekkoek told Reuters: We have tried to figure out how to keep our customers and employees safe, while maintaining a restaurant atmosphere. These are drastic changes, but we hope to make them in a way that customers don\u2019t notice them too much. Restaurants, bars and other public places in the Netherlands have been closed since 15 March. But new infections have been dropping, prompting calls to loosen the lockdown after its current deadline of 19 May. A decision on whether to reopen restaurants and bars is expected around 12 May, but the prime minister, Mark Rutte, has ruled out a return to normal. If they do reopen, they will have to keep customers and staff at least 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart to avoid a new wave of infections. McDonald\u2019s says it could introduce table service, with burgers and fries wheeled to customers on trolleys from which they can pick up their orders. Other new features would include hand-washing stations at the entrance and a host behind a plastic screen showing customers their place in line. Many restaurant owners in the Netherlands fear social distancing will simply put them out of business. But McDonald\u2019s expects its new set-up will work at 180 larger restaurants out of its 252 franchises in the country. Koekkoek said: On average this will allow us to serve around 66% of our normal number of customers. We don\u2019t expect reopening to be allowed before June. But even then, we will move in steps. Readjusting 180 restaurants is a tall order. The Hungarian budget carrier, Wizz Air, flew into London\u2019s Luton airport from Sofia on Friday, becoming one of the first European airlines to restart routes during the coronavirus pandemic. At least one person onboard seen through the window was wearing a face mask. There were also dozens of passengers within the airport, spaced out for social distancing, possibly for the return flight which took off shortly afterwards. European airlines have grounded the majority of their fleets over the last six weeks as governments imposed travel restrictions to combat the spread of the virus. But Wizz Air said last week it planned to put some of its planes back in the air for essential travel, restoring services to destinations in Romania, Budapest in Hungary, Lisbon in Portugal and Spain\u2019s Tenerife plus a few more. The London Luton arrivals and departures board showed three Wizz Air flights were due to arrive and depart on Friday. The airline says it is important to get the infrastructure operating and that there are people across Europe who need to travel for work. Across Europe, air traffic is down by about 90% according to global body IATA, with the flights that are still operating facilitating the repatriation of citizens, travel by medical experts and cargo supplies. Given ongoing travel restrictions - UK government advice for example is for Britons to avoid all non-essential global travel and Wizz has said that it does not expect flights to be full, enabling it to maintain social distancing onboard. The airline, whose geographic focus is on central and eastern Europe, has said all passengers must wear masks on flights while its crew will wear masks and gloves. When travel restrictions do start to ease, it is likely that there will be tougher measures for flying, which could affect demand. Britain is considering a two-week quarantine requirement for arrivals into the country. India is extending its nationwide lockdown for another two weeks after 4 May, but will allow \u201cconsiderable relaxations\u201d. These will apply in lower-risk districts marked as green and orange zones, under the government\u2019s plan to fight the Covid-19. Ural Airlines has begun delivering in-flight meals to travel-deprived Russians who miss the thrill of a catering cart rolling down the aisle because of coronavirus lockdown. The airline, which is delivering its in-flight meals to customers in Moscow, St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg, said the initiative was meant to provide people with \u201cthe taste of travel without leaving your home\u201d. \u201cEverything is just like on the airplane except for the view,\u201d it wrote on its Instagram page on Thursday. Russia has closed its borders to foreigners and grounded international flights, except those repatriating Russians or returning foreign nationals to their country of origin. Ural Airlines\u2019 service offers the staples of airline meals - chicken, meat and fish - as well as orange, apple and tomato juice. The meal is served on a traditional airline tray. US fossil fuel companies have taken at least $50m in taxpayer money they likely won\u2019t have to pay back, according to a review of coronavirus aid meant for struggling small businesses by the investigative research group Documented and the Guardian, writes Guardian US environment reporter Emily Holden in Washington. A total of $28m is going to three coal mining companies, including two with ties to Trump officials, bolstering a dying American industry and a fuel that scientists insist world leaders must shift away from to avoid the worst of the climate crisis. The other $22m is being paid out to oil and gas services and equipment providers and other firms that work with drillers and coal miners. Melinda Pierce, the legislative director for the Sierra Club, said: The federal money Congress appropriated should be going to help small businesses and frontline workers struggling as a result of the pandemic, not the corporate polluters whose struggles are a result of failing business practices and existed long before Covid-19 entered the public lexicon. This fascinating thread is an account of how a remote fishing village in Iceland dealt with its coronavirus outbreak. It is worth clicking through to read in full. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Netherlands has risen by 475 to 39,791 health authorities said on Friday, with 98 new deaths. The country\u2019s death toll stands at 4,893, the Dutch institute for public health and the environment (RIVM) said in its daily update. The RIVM cautioned it only reports confirmed cases, and actual numbers are higher. But it said the latest figures are \u201cin line with the impression that the measures [taken to deal with the outbreak] are working,\u201d adding: The number of new hospital admissions reported per day is still decreasing. The same applies to the number of reported deaths. The country is on course to reopen primary schools on 11 May, with secondary schools planned to reopen the following month. The world\u2019s largest public service union federation, Public Services International, has launched a 12-hour virtual May Day live stream to celebrate the public service workers who are keeping society going during the coronavirus pandemic. With more than 600 affiliated unions, PSI represents more than 20 million workers in 180 countries. They are calling on unions and workers across the world to take action from their homes rather than in the streets. In a blog posted to their website today, PSI general secretary, Rosa Pavanelli, said: This May Day, for the first time in a century, workers won\u2019t be in the streets. They\u2019re busy saving the world. They\u2019re keeping our relatives on life support. They\u2019re keeping food systems flowing. They are risking their lives to save lives - not as heroes, but as professionals. As Trade Unions, the only way we can do justice to these momentous efforts is by winning the deep, systemic change which workers, now more than ever, need and deserve. Anyone who wants to take part is encouraged to post a solidarity message to frontline workers to social media, using the hashtag #VirtualMayDay, or chat join the live chat on the stream on Vimeo or Facebook. By eschewing the kinds of lockdowns seen elsewhere in the world, Sweden has taken a different and controversial approach to tackling the coronavirus pandemic. That has led to international criticism and wounded national pride, writes Gina Gustavsson, an academic at Uppsala University. She asks: has Sweden\u2019s coronavirus strategy played into the hands of nationalists? Sweden has persisted with the strategy of coronavirus mitigation that the UK government eventually abandoned in March. The policy is widely supported by the public, even though the Swedish Covid-19 mortality rate is among the 10 highest in the world, at 240 per million population and steadily rising, and many of the nursing homes in Stockholm are now affected. The typical explanation for this continued public support is that Swedes are trusting and unflappable. The country\u2019s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, the public face of the Swedish response to the pandemic, is after all a dry scientist-turned-bureaucrat, not some populist politician trying to whip up nationalist go-it-alone emotion. But beneath the surface, Sweden is anything but calm. The public debate is inflamed with a sense of wounded national pride. As a believer in the kind of liberal nationalism that encourages self-critical national attachment, this pains me. But as a scholar of nationalism, I recognise the pattern. This is what Isaiah Berlin called the nationalism of \u201cthe bent twig\u201d, which lashes out against anyone who steps on it. Thousands of Indian students unable to leave the UK because of the coronavirus lockdown are relying on food donations from charities because they can no longer afford to eat, Anna Fazackerly reports for the Guardian. Student groups representing the students, from across Britain, have been coordinating emergency food drops with local community groups and charities. Many of the young people have lost their part-time jobs and can no longer afford even basic living costs. The Indian National Students\u2019 Association, one of the largest student groups, says so far it has helped to distribute food to more than 3,000 struggling students across the country. A second UK-wide students\u2019 group, the National Indian Students and Alumni Union, says it has also had calls from hundreds of students who cannot afford food. Charan Sekhon, the chair of an Anglo-Indian charity based in Bedford called the Seva Trust, which has delivered food parcels to more than 60 Indian students in its local area, says: \u201cWe have had lots of examples where students are actually starving. They haven\u2019t got anything at all to eat.\u201d India banned all international flights from 22 March, giving students only two days to arrange to get home. Flights that typically cost around \u00a3300 were selling for \u00a32,000, and thousands of students found themselves stranded in Britain. Singapore has begun moving migrant workers who have recovered from coronavirus infections to two cruise ships in an effort to curb its spread in workers\u2019 dormitories, AFP reports. After taking swift and aggressive measures that initially controlled its outbreak, Singapore has been hit by a bigger second wave among the work permit holders who carry out many of the basic services that keep the city running. On Friday, Singapore\u2019s ministry of health reported 932 new infections, the majority of which were among migrant workers, who are housed in sprawling dormitory complexes. Just five cases were found among Singapore nationals or so-called permanent residents. So far it has reported 17,101 cases but just 15 deaths. A group of migrant workers boarded the SuperStar Gemini, a mid-sized cruise ship, on Wednesday, and another vessel, the SuperStar Aquarius, is ready to receive more after undergoing assessments by government agencies, the Singapore Tourism Board said on Friday. Together, the vessels can accommodate up to 2,000. Fifteen people have been arrested in Istanbul, Turkey, for trying to stage a May Day march in defiance of coronavirus lockdown measures, according to the Associated Press. The Confederation of Progressive Trade Unions of Turkey, or DISK, tweeted that its head Arzu Cerkezoglu and several other union leaders were detained near Taksim Square, where they wanted to lay wreaths of carnations. The Istanbul governor\u2019s office said the demonstrators were later released. The statement added that various trade unions had left wreaths in Taksim Square, as permitted by the governor\u2019s office, but that DISK had insisted on collectively marching to the square, which was in breach of lockdown and social distancing rules. Taksim Square holds a symbolic value for Turkeys labour movement. In 1977, 34 people were killed there during a May Day event when shots were fired into the crowd from a nearby building. Turkey has imposed partial lockdowns in 31 provinces every weekend and on national holidays. Exemptions apply, including for many labourers who continue to work amid the pandemic. The ban on May Day demonstrations in Taksim has been in effect for several years, due to security concerns. Police closed all roads leading to Taksim Square with barricades and increased security presence Friday. Turkey ranks seventh in the world for the number of confirmed infections with 120,204 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University, although experts believe the actual toll of the pandemic is higher than the tally. The country\u2019s official death toll stands at 3,174. Here are the latest headlines in our international coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. China\u2019s Hubei province will lower its coronavirus emergency response from the highest to the second-highest level. The announcement follows months of strict lockdown. The virus was first detected in the province\u2019s capital, Wuhan, in late 2019. Deprived areas of England and Wales have double the death rates of affluent areas. Of the 20,283 Covid-19 registered deaths in England and Wales to 17 April, an overwhelming proportion of fatalities were of people from the poorest areas, figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed. Russia reported 7,933 new cases of Covid-19 in a record daily rise, bringing the nationwide tally to 114,431. The official nationwide death toll rose to 1,169 after 96 people with the virus died in the last 24 hours, Russia\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre said. Ryanair is to cut 3,000 jobs reduce staff pay by up to a fifth in response to the Covid-19 crisis, which has grounded flights. The no-frills airline said it did not expect passenger numbers or pricing to return to pre-coronavirus levels until summer 2022 at the earliest. Queensland, Australia, cleared way for the National Rugby League season to restart. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has opened the state border in preparation for restart of the National Rugby League (NRL) season on 28 May. One million people have recovered from coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Infections worldwide stand at 3,269,667. More than 233,700 people have died in the pandemic so far. Trump claimed he has seen evidence that Covid-19 originated in Wuhan lab. When the president was asked if he has seen anything that gives you a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Donald Trump replied: \u201cYes, I have.\u201d His own government experts say the virus was \u201cnot manmade or genetically modified\u201d. Israel\u2019s government just announced the country will partially reopen schools on Sunday, with a full return to for all students by 1 June, reports Oliver Holmes, the Guardian\u2019s Jerusalem correspondent. First, second and third graders as well as 11th and 12th graders can return to school as of Sunday, the first day of the week in Israel. Childcare and kindergartens, ages zero to six, will remain closed for at least another week, the government said. Despite seeing a drop in the number of daily virus infections during the past few days, the reopening of schools has been a contentious issue in Israel, with fierce debate within the government around whether it was a premature step. Following Friday\u2019s announcement, the mayor of Tel Aviv said he would not allow schools to open there. Ron Huldai was quoted by Haaretz newspaper as saying the plan \u201cdoesn\u2019t ensure the wellbeing and health of the children\u201d. A partial reopening has also been criticised by parents of children of different ages who will still not be able to work. The country has 15,946 total confirmed cases and 223 deaths. A report by Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) yesterday heighten concerns among US officials and lawmakers that the pandemic threatens to derail stalled US-led peace efforts, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports. The spread of COVID-19 already has significantly impacted Afghanistan, the report said, from complicating the peace initiative to forcing border crossing closures that have disrupted commercial and humanitarian deliveries. \u201cAfghanistan\u2019s numerous and, in some cases, unique vulnerabilities - a weak health-care system, widespread malnutrition, porous borders, massive internal displacement, contiguity with Iran, and ongoing conflict - make it likely the country will confront a health disaster in the coming months,\u201d the report said. Meanwhile Save the Children announced yesterday that around seven million children are at risk of hunger due to the lockdowns following spread Coronavirus in Afghanistan. \u201cAt a time when Afghan children need adequate daily nutrition to help strengthen their immune systems to fight the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the price of basic foods is rising under the lockdown, making it harder for families to feed themselves,\u201d the report said. The organization also warned that a third of the country will face food shortages. \u201cA third of the population \u2013 including 7.3 million children \u2013 will face food shortages in April and May due to the current pandemic,\u201d the organisation said. According to the organisation, even before the global COVID-19 crisis, the total number of children who needed some form of humanitarian support this year stood at 5.26 million, making war-torn Afghanistan one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a child. In case you needed it, here is a video explaining why the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory is false. France\u2019s education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, is today expected to announce strict rules for the reopening of cr\u00eaches, nursery and primary schools later this month, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent. A provisional document seen by Le Monde and AFP suggests rules will be strict in applying accepted barrier and social distancing regulations, but it has already been declared unworkable by teachers, especially for classes of younger children. Teachers are expected to return on 11 May to prepare for the restarting of classes the following day. The draft health protocol says children must wash their hands on arrival at school, before and after visiting lavatories, before and after each meal, after playtime, after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing and touching shared objects and before going home. Taps and running water are to be preferred but sanitising gel must be provided if this is not possible. Ball games and contact games are banned and there is to be no exchange of personal objects. If more than one child touches an object it should be disinfected. There must be staggered recreation and play breaks, and limited changes of room \u2013 French children tend to take different subjects in different classes \u2013 as well a one-way system organised in school buildings so pupils can maintain a 1-metre minimum distance from each other. Classes to be regularly disinfected and aired and doors left open to avoid pupils touching handles. The wearing of masks is not obligatory for nursery school children, but is advised, and staff must wear masks. There will also be a limit to the number of children in each class \u2013reportedly 10 children for those in cr\u00eaches and nurseries, and 15 in primary schools. It must be stressed these are details in the provisional protocol, which needs to be confirmed by the education minister today. The two lowest years in secondary schools will start back the following week, on 18 May. A decision on other years will be made at the end of May for a possible return to class on 2 June. Another unknown factor is what say local mayors will have in deciding whether schools in their areas should reopen or if restarting classes poses too much of a risk, particularly in areas designated \u201cred\u201d, where the virus is circulating. Japan is preparing for a month-long extension to its coronavirus state of emergency, prime minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday. Abe imposed an initial month-long emergency for seven regions on 7 April, before subsequently expanding it across the whole country. With measures due to expire next week, Abe said he had told his minister responsible for handling the outbreak, Yasutoshi Nishimura, to plan for an extension, AFP reports. He was quoted as saying: After receiving [a] report from the panel of experts, I asked Minister Nishimura to use extending the current framework of the state of emergency by about one month as the base scenario for swiftly drafting plans that will fit the needs of the regions An extension of the state of emergency had been widely expected, despite the comparatively small scale of the outbreak in Japan, with nearly 14,300 infections recorded and 432 deaths so far. Thousands of people in the US plan to take part in a rent strike on Friday, calling for state leaders to cancel rent during the coronavirus crisis, writes Guardian US reporter Adam Gabbatt. Activists in New York, Pennsylvania and California are encouraging tenants to withhold rent, whether they are able to pay or not, to draw attention to the plight of those unable to pay. The protest is expected to represent the largest coordinated rent strike in America in decades, and comes as the labor department announced another 3.8 million people lost their jobs last week, with pressure growing on state leaders nationwide to increase their efforts on housing. More than 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits in the past six weeks, as the coronavirus has caused widespread business closures. The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is among those voicing support for the strikes, which are being coordinated by an array of housing groups. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t striking because they don\u2019t feel like paying rent, they\u2019re striking because they can\u2019t,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. Sixty-three more people have died from Covid-19 in Iran, bringing the total death toll in the country to 6,091, health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said in a statement on state TV on Friday, according to Reuters. The total number of diagnosed cases of the coronavirus in the Islamic Republic, one of the Middle Eastern countries hardest hit by the outbreak, has reached 95,646, including 2,899 in critical condition, he added. Hello and happy International Workers Day to readers around the world. This is Damien Gayle taking control of the global live blog now for the next eight hours, bringing you the latest international news on the coronavirus outbreak. If you have any tips, comments or suggestions for coverage please drop me a line via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or in a direct message on Twitter to @damiengayle. Spain has recorded 281 coronavirus deaths over the past 24 hours, compared with 268 yesterday, as it prepares for the first phase of the lockdown exit strategy. The total number of deaths stands at 24,824. On Saturday, people of all ages will be allowed out for exercise for the first time in seven weeks, a week after children were allowed out to play if accompanied by an adult. To avoid overcrowding, separate time slots have been allocated for the elderly, people with the children and everyone else. Barcelona has opened half of its parks and closed 44 streets to traffic in order to facilitate social distancing. The Madrid region will monitor 2m mobile phones to observe how the relaxed lockdown is progressing. Today, Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, the Madrid regional president, formally closed the vast field hospital at the capital\u2019s IFEMA exhibition centre, which opened 41 days ago. The temporary hospital, which came to symbolise the nation\u2019s fight against the virus, had 5,500 beds. Of the thousands of coronavirus patients admitted, 98% survived. In a provisional assessment of the economic impact of the health crisis, the government estimates Spain\u2019s GDP will fall by 9.2% this year. Ministers said today the virus has so far cost the nation \u20ac139bn, of which around \u20ac17bn has gone on paying furloughed employees. After ending 2019 with a public deficit of 2.8%, this year it is expected to be 10.7%. In Afghanistan, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases continued to surge on Friday in Kandahar as nationwide number of infections reached 2,335, amid increasing number of health workers testing positive. A health ministry spokesman said 164 new Covid-19 cases were recorded in last 24 hours, most of which were new infections recorded in southern province of Kandahar as total number of confirmed cases reached 339 with 45 confirmed today in the province. Four patients died in the same period, taking the death toll to 68 in the war-torn country. There have so far been 310 recoveries, 50 of which have been in last 24 hours. Wahidullah Mayar, the health ministry spokesman, said 228 health workers have so far tested positive for Covid-19, most of them are confirmed in Kandahar with 38 cases. In Kabul, the country\u2019s worst affected area, the health ministry reported 44 new Coronavirus cases, bringing the total number to 617. Mayar said spread of the virus in Afghanistan is \u201cfast\u201d and asked people to stay at home as the country is yet to reach its peak in number of deaths and infections. Despite the lockdown, in most of cities streets were still crowded with vehicles and people walking freely around. Hundreds of workers at Amazon warehouses, Whole Foods grocery stores, Target retail stores, and shoppers at Instacart and Shipt called out sick on Friday as part of a coordinated one-day strike across the US in protest of working conditions and inadequate safety protections during the coronavirus pandemic. The 1 May walkout began after Amazon ended its unlimited unpaid time off policy for workers at the end of April. \u201cThe fact they took it away prior to the sick-out lets you know they\u2019re aware of the sick-out and trying to stop people from participating in that,\u201d said Derrick Palmer, an Amazon employee at the JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York, who has worked at Amazon for more than four years. \u201cNow they\u2019re forcing people to go to work because if you run out of unpaid time off, that\u2019s it, you\u2019re fired.\u201d Palmer was one of the workers who participated in protests outside of JFK8 warehouse a few weeks ago in demand of safety protections for Amazon workers. An assistant manager at JFK8, Chris Smalls, was fired shortly after he organised the protest. Palmer said that after the protests, Amazon began providing personal protective equipment to workers and enforcing social distancing rules and temperature checks, but he said cleaning procedures remain inadequate. The Office for National Statistics has published analysis on Covid-19 deaths by local areas and deprivation in England and Wales. The London mortality rate was significantly higher than any other region. The analysis found a strong link between how deprived an area is and the coronavirus mortality rate. In England, the mortality rate of deaths involving Covid-19 in the most deprived areas was more than double that in the least deprived areas: Most deprived: 55.1 deaths per 100,000 population Least deprived: 25.3 deaths per 100,000 population The Guardian will be digging into this data set throughout the day, but you can read it yourself here. Armed protesters enter Michigan\u2019s state capitol demanding an end to coronavirus lockdown. Hundreds of protesters, some armed, attempted to enter the legislative chamber of Michigan\u2019s state capitol, in response to moves to extend Covid-19 lockdown orders. The demonstrators gathered as the Democrat governor, Gretchen Whitmer, pushed for stay-at-home orders to continue to mid-May. The state has recorded 3,789 coronavirus deaths. China Xinhua News reports that Central China\u2019s Hubei province, where the coronavirus outbreak started, will lower its emergency response from the highest to the second-highest level starting on 2 May, following months of strict lockdown. Here\u2019s more information on Australia\u2019s road to recovery by Guardian reporter Paul Karp and Daniel Hurst. Scott Morrison has offered Australians an \u201cearly mark\u201d to ease Covid-19 restrictions next week while warning a return to normality will depend on uptake of the Covidsafe contact tracing app. The prime minister dangled the prospect of a potential loosening of the rules next Friday as he issued his strongest declaration yet that it was conditional on more downloads. Morrison also revealed that net overseas migration is down 30% and is expected to fall by 80% in 2020-21, both compared with 2018-19, in a sign the economic contraction from Covid-19 will last much longer than restrictions to social life. Treasury officials and the Reserve Bank both estimate that unemployment is set to top 10%. The first restrictions were eased this week with New South Wales allowing visits to friends and relatives, and a similar measure announced on Friday in the Australian Capital Territory, the first Australian jurisdiction with no active cases. In Greece, protesters have begun gathering in central Athens for traditional May Day marches, AP reports, despite authorities\u2019 pleas to unions to move their demonstrations to next week after lockdown measures begin easing. More than 100 people from the Communist party-affiliated PAME union gathered in Athens\u2019 main Syntagma Square, outside parliament. Holding banners and red flags, and most wearing masks and gloves, the protesters stood roughly 2 metres (6.5ft) apart from each other as they waited for the march to begin. The Philippines on Friday reported 284 new coronavirus infections and 11 more deaths, Reuters reports, bringing its total number of cases to 8,772 and fatalities to 579. It also said 41 more individuals had recovered, bringing total recoveries to 1,084. France\u2019s state-owned SNCF railways company estimates it will lose at least \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.6bn) in revenue as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, Les Echos daily newspaper reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources. Reuters reports the group has been running only 7% of its high-speed trains and 20% of regional services since mid-March and will be allowed to resume only about 30% of its network from 11 May as France seeks to manage the post-lockdown period. Les Echos newspaper said strikes over government pension reforms that started in early December in France has already cost the company \u20ac1bn in lost revenue. The newspaper said the company lost \u20ac700m in March, \u20ac1.4bn in April and expects losses to reach \u20ac3bn before a nationwide lockdown begins to ease from 11 May. EPA has this shot of a family wearing protective face masks while visiting Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China, on 1 May. China is loosening up nationwide restrictions after months of lockdown over the coronavirus crisis. Labour Day in the country kicked off with a long weekend and an extended holiday, from 1-5 May, after the tourism industry has been hit during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Rwanda will partially lift its virus lockdown from next week and allow people to move freely during the day more than six weeks after being confined, the prime minister\u2019s office said Friday, AFP reports. Rwanda was one of the first to impose strict lockdown measures in Africa, on 22 March, when it had only 19 cases, and to date has officially recorded 225 cases and zero deaths. From Monday 4 May, people will be allowed to move freely from 5am to 8pm, but will need permission to do so later in the evening, the prime minister\u2019s office said in a statement. Businesses, manufacturing and construction operations will be allowed to resume with essential workers, while markets will be allowed to open with no more than 50%t of traders operating. Hotels and restaurants will be allowed to operate but must close by 7pm. While people will be allowed to exercise in open spaces, sports facilities will remain closed. No more than 30 people will be allowed to attend funerals, and schools, churches, gyms and bars will remain closed. The speaker of Pakistan\u2019s national assembly said late on Thursday that he had tested positive for Covid-19, after hosting an iftar dinner to celebrate Ramadan, Reuters reports, and meeting prime minister Imran Khan and other high officials earlier in the week. It remains unclear if Khan will be tested after Faisal Edhi tested positive. Khan tested negative in April, after meeting with the head of Pakistan\u2019s biggest charity organisation, who was subsequently confirmed to have caught the disease. The assembly, the lower house of parliament, is in recess, though opposition parties have been calling for it to convene to discuss the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak in the country, where the number of cases has risen to 16,817, including 385 deaths. Russia reported its biggest daily rise of confirmed coronavirus cases on Friday , with 7,933 new cases. The record daily rise brings the nationwide tally to 114,431, Reuters reports. The official nationwide death toll rose to 1,169 after 96 people with the virus died in the last 24 hours, Russia\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre said. AFP have put together a brilliant photo gallery of May Day workers confronting coronavirus around the world. It is a celebration of the cleaners, transport workers, shop assistants, tradespeople, health workers and more who continue to serve despite the difficulties and risks of the pandemic. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Germany increased by 1,639 to 160,758 on Friday, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases. The daily update showed the death toll rose by 193 to 6,481. Mikhail Mishustin, the Russian prime minister, who was tasked by Vladimir Putin with leading the response to the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, has been diagnosed with Covid-19 and will self-isolate. Mishustin, Russia\u2019s most-high profile Covid-19 patient so far, disclosed the diagnosis during a televised video call with President Putin on Thursday evening. It was not immediately clear how severe Mishustin\u2019s symptoms are, though one news agency reported that he had an elevated temperature of 39 degrees. Putin indicated during the call that Mishustin would be taken to hospital. Confirmed coronavirus cases in Russia passed 100,000 on Thursday. The first deputy prime minister, Andrei Belousov, would take on Mishustin\u2019s duties in his absence, Putin said. Ryanair is planning to cut 3,000 jobs and reduce staff pay by up to a fifth in response to the Covid-19 crisis, which has grounded flights. The no-frills airline said it did not expect passenger numbers or pricing to return to pre-coronavirus levels until summer 2022 at the earliest. As part of a programme of sweeping cost cuts, Ryanair said it could close a number of bases across Europe until air travel recovers. The company, which expects to report a net loss of more than \u20ac100m (\u00a387m) for the first quarter and through the summer, said restructuring and job losses would start in July. The job cuts will affect mostly pilots and cabin crew, although the measures will also hit head office and back office teams. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has opened Queensland\u2019s border in preparation for next month\u2019s restart of the National Rugby League (NRL) season. Palaszczuk not only gave the green light for the state\u2019s three NRL clubs to train at their base and travel interstate, but also host home games. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison had said earlier on Friday it would be a matter for state jurisdictions to clear any resumption of sporting activities, following a meeting of the national cabinet. Hungary needs to prepare for a potential second wave of the coronavirus outbreak in October-November, even though the spreading of the virus will likely slow in the summer, prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n told state radio on Friday, according to a report by Reuters. Orban also said if authorities manage to reduce the death rate from the pandemic in Budapest, where 80% of deaths have been recorded, only then will current restrictions be eased in the capital city. Hungary will lift a large part of restrictions in the countryside from Monday. Migrant workers on Spanish farms that provide fruit and vegetables for UK supermarkets are trapped in dire conditions under lockdown, living in cardboard and plastic shelters without food or running water. Thousands of workers, many of them undocumented, live in settlements between huge greenhouses on farms in the southern Spanish provinces of Huelva and Almeria, key regions for European supply chains. Local union activists have been supporting the migrants, bringing them water, food and basic supplies since Spain declared a lockdown in mid March. Clare Carlile from Ethical Consumer, a UK charity supporting the local activists, says the situation is the result of years of neglect of workers. \u201cThey got visited by the Spanish army on 18 March and told to stay put, even though in some places running water is several kilometres away. Now, with Covid fears, a water truck comes twice a week. If you are at work and miss it you must walk several kilometres for water after a hard day. \u201cFailure of employers provide basic rights has for years created dire circumstances for the inhabitants of the settlements. Now, the pandemic has pushed the situation to crisis point.\u201d London\u2019s Heathrow airport, traditionally the busiest in Europe, said passenger numbers were expected to be down by around 97% in April. Reuters reports that for the first quarter, revenue fell 12.7% to \u00a3593m ($745m) and adjusted EBITDA fell by 22.4% to \u00a3315m. Heathrow expects passenger numbers to remain weak until governments across the world fighting the coronavirus outbreak deem it safe to travel. The airport said it had \u00a33.2bn in liquidity, sufficient to maintain the business at least over the next 12 months, even with no passengers. Morning, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin taking over the liveblog from my colleague Helen. Please do send tips and comments to aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com or you can tweet me at @aamnamohdin Carmela Fonbuena reports for the Guardian: Philippine provinces considered to have a low to moderate number of coronavirus cases began easing lockdowns on Friday 1 May, amid concerns from local officials and residents who are wary that the real scale of the outbreak cannot be known until the country conducts more testing. \u201cMany provinces are still just seeing imported cases from other areas. When [strict lockdowns are] lifted they expect imported cases to come in,\u201d said former health secretary Manuel Dayrit. The rules remain unclear. The government initially said religious gatherings will be allowed provided physical distancing is observed, but it\u2019s now under review following concerns raised. The Philippines recorded 8,488 cases as of 30 April, including 568 deaths. The numbers are believed to be higher as the country of 110 million people has tested less than 100,000 individuals. It\u2019s a testament to its poor healthcare system as many hospitals struggle to meet requirements for coronavirus testing. The decision made by a national government taskforce on coronavirus put several local officials in a difficult position. In the provinces of Ilocos Norte, La Union, and Albay, where residents oppose the government decision, local leaders cannot extend strict lockdowns without government approval. \u201cLifting will only return the virus into a second wave,\u201d said Joey Salceda, a lawmaker from Albay province, which recorded three deaths among total 28 cases but he is afraid there are undetected cases. Metro Manila will remain in strict lockdown but certain restrictions will be lifted to allow some government infrastructure work to continue. Groups of overseas Filipino workers stranded in the capital due to provincial lockdowns have been allowed go home, too. Although this development is definitely worth mentioning again, too: With that, I\u2019m ducking away. My colleague Aamna Mohdin will be with you for the next few hours. Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: 1 million people have recovered from coronavirus. According to Johns Hopkins University data, more than a million people have now recovered from coronavirus infection, with the total at 1,014,524. Infections worldwide stand at 3,256,570. More than 233,300 people have died in the pandemic so far. Boris Johnson says UK \u2018past the peak\u2019. The prime minister promised to set out next week how schools and workplaces could safely reopen once lockdown restrictions were eased, as he claimed the UK was past the peak of the coronavirus outbreak. Despite announcing an increase of 674 in the death toll of the virus, taking it to a total of 26,771, Johnson suggested the worst was over. US jobless toll amounts to 18.4% of working-age population. Thirty million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since 21 March. The White House let its two-week-old economic reopening guidelines expire on Thursday as half of all US states forged ahead with their own strategies for easing restrictions on restaurants, retail and other businesses shuttered by the coronavirus crisis, Reuters reports. Trump claims he has seen evidence that Covid-19 originated in Wuhan lab. When the president was asked if he has seen anything that gives you a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Donald Trump replied: \u201cYes, I have.\u201d His own government experts say the virus was \u2018not manmade or genetically modified\u2019. US intelligence agencies have been under pressure to link coronavirus to Chinese labs. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, later said of the lab theory: \u201cWhat we have before us doesn\u2019t suggest that is a likely source\u201d. Protesters, some armed, gather inside Michigan state capitol. Hundreds of protesters, some armed, gathered inside Michigan\u2019s state capitol on Thursday as state lawmakers debated the Democratic governor\u2019s request to extend her emergency powers to combat coronavirus. Major US airlines will require passengers to cover their faces during flights. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines said on Thursday they will soon require passengers to cover their faces during flights, following the lead of JetBlue Airways, Reuters reports. British BAME Covid-19 death rate \u2018more than twice that of whites\u2019. The death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis from coronavirus in English hospitals is more than 2.5 times that of the white population, according to stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies. UK food banks face record demand. The first two weeks of the coronavirus lockdown triggered an unprecedented rise in food bank use as the economy was hit and household incomes plunged, data from hundreds of emergency food aid charities reveals. Jacinda Ardern\u2019s popularity surges during lockdown. An opinion poll in New Zealand has found the prime minister\u2019s approval rating jumped to 65% during the country\u2019s nearly five-week strict lockdown. It puts her in a strong position ahead of this year\u2019s general election. Her Labour party also did well, achieving a 55% approval rating. \u2018Australia has earned an early mark\u2019 Australia has brought forward its decision on easing restrictions to next Friday 8 May in a further sign that the country is successfully flattening the curve. Australia, which in late March recorded around 400 new cases of the virus a day, now consistently has fewer than 20 new cases daily. Restrictions on movement were put into place at the end of March, including the closure of schools in some states, as well as restaurants, pubs and some businesses, as well as restrictions on the number of people who can gather together. Prime Minister Scott Morrison was due to announce which of these restrictions would be lifted on 11 May after discussion with state premiers, but says the announcement has been brought forward three days, with a cheerful Morrison telling a press conference on Friday that \u201cAustralians have earned an early mark.\u201d He added that \u201cwe didn\u2019t expect to be in this position six weeks ago\u201d. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said Australia will begin testing cohorts of asymptomatic people in an attempt to ensure early detection of any new outbreaks and avoid a second wave. That cluster testing will be focused on groups that have a high risk of exposure or work with vulnerable people, like aged care workers or healthcare workers. Teachers are among those who might get tested. Says Murphy: We need to test more people. If we are going to get on top of those small outbreaks ... we cannot afford to have an outbreak that takes off so that we get a second wave when we reduce restrictions such as a number of other countries have seen. So our testing has to be very good. He says that the case data shows that most people who transmit the virus do still have symptoms, so anyone with any symptoms should get tested. The most important thing in testing is for anyone who has respiratory symptoms, a cough or a cold or a sore throat, to get tested ... get tested and don\u2019t go to work. Cholera and coronavirus: why we must not repeat the same mistakes Coronavirus is not the only pandemic the world faces. There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away. While I will surely be able to offer my patients in England a coronavirus vaccine in a year or two, and while western health systems will be reinforced to be more ready for a potential future outbreak, I worry that we may repeat the mistakes of cholera: conquering coronavirus everywhere except for the poorest parts of the world. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is addressing the media now. He has been asked about US President Donald Trump\u2019s comments late on Thursday. Trump said he had seen evidence that Covid-19 emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan, contradicting experts in his own administration who said it was not man made or genetically modified. Morrison said he has not seen any evidence to suggest that\u2019s the case, but says Australia is still pushing for an independent investigation into the origin of the disease. What we have before us doesn\u2019t suggest that that is the likely source. There\u2019s nothing that we have that would suggest that that is the likely source but you can\u2019t rule anything out in this scenario. He says the virus did originate in Wuhan, but \u201cthe most likely scenario that has been canvassed related to wildlife wet markets\u201d. That is why Australia wants an \u201cobjective independent\u201d investigation, he says. While that can\u2019t be ruled out its not something we have seen any hard evidence of that that is the position. Morrison says an independent investigation would look at what happened and why it happened. So we can learn if something similar could happen in any part of the world so the world will be able to respond quicker. Because clearly in these cases time is everything. 1 million people have recovered. According to Johns Hopkins University data, more than a million people have now recovered from coronavirus infection, with the total currently at 1,014,524.Infections worldwide stand at 3,256,570.233,363 people have died in the pandemic so far. UK prime minister says the country now \u201cpast the peak\u201d. Boris Johnson defended the decisions the UK government has taken. Speaking at the UK government\u2019s daily press conference, Johnson said that the NHS has not been overwhelmed at any stage. US jobless toll amounts to 18.4% of working-age population. The White House let its 2-week-old economic reopening guidelines expire on Thursday as half of all US states forged ahead with their own strategies for easing restrictions on restaurants, retail and other businesses shuttered by the coronavirus crisis, Reuters reports. Trump to leave White House on Friday for first time in a month. US President Donald Trump will leave the White House on Friday for the first time in a month when he travels to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland. Trump claims he has seen evidence of Covid-19 originating in Wuhan lab. When asked if he has seen anything that gives you a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, President Trump replied: \u201cYes, I have.\u201d His own government experts say the virus was \u2018not manmade or genetically modified\u2019. US intelligence agencies have been under pressure to link coronavirus to Chinese labs. Protestors, some armed, gather inside Michigan state capitol. Hundreds of protesters, some armed, gathered inside Michigan\u2019s state capitol on Thursday as state lawmakers debated the Democratic governor\u2019s request to extend her emergency powers to combat coronavirus. Major US airlines will require passengers to cover their faces during flights. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines said Thursday they will soon require passengers to cover their faces during flights, following the lead of JetBlue Airways, Reuters reports. British BAME Covid-19 death rate \u2018more than twice that of whites\u2019. The death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis from coronavirus in English hospitals is more than 2.5 times that of the white population, according to stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies. UK food banks face record demand. The first two weeks of the coronavirus lockdown triggered an unprecedented rise in food bank use as the economy was hit and household incomes plunged, data from hundreds of emergency food aid charities reveals. Germany eases lockdown measures. Germany is to re-open museums, galleries, zoos and playgrounds and allow religious services to resume, in measures agreed by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the leaders of 16 federal states. Spain allocates times slots for outdoor activities, as death toll falls.

Eurozone records 3.8% slump, as European Central Bank chief warns of worse to come, with the eurozone potentially on course for a 15% collapse in output in the second quarter. Covid-19 outbreak increasing across Africa, WHO warns. World Health Organization officials in Africa have said the Covid-19 outbreak is still increasing across the continent despite widespread efforts at containment. Russian prime minister diagnosed with coronavirus. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has said he has been diagnosed with coronavirus and will self-isolate from the government in the country\u2019s highest-profile case of the disease yet. Demand for coronavirus tests raises concerns over HIV and malaria Governments were caught out when Covid-19 hit, having overlooked the need to be able to test for new diseases because they were focused on drugs and vaccines for those they already knew about. Now there are fears that the rush to supply wealthier countries pressing for more tests may destabilise the fight against HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, illnesses that kill millions, mostly in low- and middle-income countries. \u201cSome companies are planning to reduce or stop malaria, HIV and TB test production,\u201d said Dr Catharina Boehme, the chief executive of the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (Find) and an adviser to the World Health Organization. \u201cThey are shifting their production to Covid-19 tests.\u201d Boehme said companies could get about 18 cents for a rapid malaria test and $10 for a Covid-19 test. The Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria said it was concerned about \u201cany action that might reduce the availability of tests or treatment for HIV, TB or malaria\u201d The eels at a Japanese aquarium are lonely \u2013 and the aquarium staff are urging people to video call the creatures so that they do not grow too shy, AFP reports. The Sumida Aquarium, housed in the landmark Tokyo Skytree tower, has been closed since the start of March and its animals have become used to a largely human-free environment during the two-month calm. The \u201cunprecedented situation\u201d was having some unexpected downsides. \u201cCreatures in the aquarium don\u2019t see humans except keepers and they have started forgetting about humans,\u201d it said on its Twitter account this week. \u201cGarden eels in particular disappear into the sand and hide every time the keepers pass by.\u201d That is causing difficulties for keepers trying to check on the health of the animals. In a bid to reacquaint the eels with humans, the aquarium is setting up five tablets facing the tank housing the delicate creatures, with eel enthusiasts asked to connect through iPhones or iPads via the FaceTime app. Once the video calls start, people are supposed to show their faces, wave and talk to the eels. But given the tender nature of the animals, callers are asked not to shout. Whistleblower complaint set to lift lid on Trump pressure to push untried drug Donald Trump\u2019s musing over whether cleaning people\u2019s lungs with disinfectant might treat the coronavirus caused a furore but it may be the US president\u2019s pushing of anti-malarial drugs that does far more lasting damage to his administration. There is building anticipation over the content of an upcoming whistleblower complaint by Dr Rick Bright, who last week was abruptly removed as the head of the federal government office working on a vaccine for Covid-19. It is understood that Bright is still working on the details of the complaint before lodging it with the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 inspector general. Bright, a vaccines expert, has claimed he was removed as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda) because he resisted an effort to expand the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat Covid-19. The drugs, approved to treat malaria, have yet to be proven effective for this new use but have been repeatedly promoted by Trump, who has called them a \u201cgame-changer\u201d. Tony Allen, legendary drummer and Afrobeat co-founder, dies aged 79 The Nigerian drummer Tony Allen, who is credited with creating Afrobeat along with his old bandmate Fela Kuti, died suddenly at the age of 79 in Paris on Thursday, his manager said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the exact cause of death,\u201d Eric Trosset said, adding it was not linked to the coronavirus. \u201cHe was in great shape, it was quite sudden. I spoke to him at 1pm then two hours later he was sick and taken to Pompidou hospital, where he died.\u201d Allen was the drummer and musical director of Fela Kuti\u2019s band Africa \u201970 in the 1960s and 70s, AFP reports. During that time the pair created Afrobeat, combining west African musical styles such as highlife and fuji music with US jazz and funk. Afrobeat went on to become one of the totemic genres of 20th century African music. Over Allen\u2019s thrilling beat, Kuti laid out his revolutionary and pan-African message, which led him to become one of the abiding icons of the struggle for freedom across the continent. US President Donald Trump claims he has seen evidence of Covid-19 originating in a Wuhan lab. When asked at a press briefing if he has seen anything that gives you a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, President Trump replied: \u201cYes, I have.\u201d He added that he was \u201cnot allowed\u201d to tell reporters what that evidence was: The White House let its 2-week-old economic reopening guidelines expire on Thursday as half of all US states forged ahead with their own strategies for easing restrictions on restaurants, retail and other businesses shuttered by the coronavirus crisis, Reuters reports. The enormous pressure on states to reopen, despite a lack of wide-scale virus testing and other safeguards urged by health experts, was highlighted in new Labor Department data showing some 30 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits since 21 March. The jobless toll amounts to more than 18.4% of the US working-age population, a level not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Physical separation of people - by closing schools, businesses and other places of social gatherings - remains the chief weapon against a highly contagious respiratory virus with no vaccine and no cure. But with economic pain reaching historic proportions, agitation to relax stay-at-home orders and mandatory workplace restrictions has mounted. For the second time in two weeks, hundreds of protesters - including armed militia group members - thronged Michigan\u2019s state Capitol in Lansing demanding an end to Governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home orders. The latest protest was sparked by the Democratic governor\u2019s request, ignored by Republican lawmakers, to extend emergency powers she had invoked in a state hard hit by both the virus and closures to combat it. US President Donald Trump will leave the White House on Friday for the first time in a month when he travels to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland. Trump will make the 70-mile (113 km) trip to Camp David on Friday evening, according to a schedule released by the White House on Thursday night. The schedule did not indicate how long Trump would stay at Camp David. Trump has been holding regular press events at the White House to highlight his administration\u2019s efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Trump\u2019s last trip away from the White House was on 28 March to Norfolk, Virginia, where he bid farewell to the Navy\u2019s USNS Comfort hospital ship as it sailed to New York City to help take the pressure off civilian hospitals. Trump, who faces re-election in November, said on Wednesday he would visit Arizona next week for an \u201cindustry\u201d-related event. Dan Collyns reports for the Guardian from Lima: Municipal authorities in Peru shut down a bustling street market in Lima on Thursday after a spot test for Covid-19 revealed one in five stallholders were infected with the virus. Out of 842 stallholders, 163 tested positive for the virus when a team of medics with military backup descended on the Caqu\u00e9ta food market in the working-class San Mart\u00edn de Porres district in downtown Lima on Wednesday. Most Peruvians shop in open-air or covered food markets rather than supermarkets, where prices are more negotiable and markedly cheaper. But social distancing and sanitary guidelines are regularly flouted as punters haggle for bargains and stallholders make special offers to attract more customers. Markets were \u201chot spots\u201d for Covid-19, Peru\u2019s defence minister Walter Martos told journalists as he took part in the surprise inspection on Wednesday which revealed the virus\u2019 increasing hold on the country\u2019s population even as a stringent lockdown was nearing the end of its seventh week. \u201cWe know that this market is major convergence point and we have seen on our hotspots map that around this market there\u2019s a large number of infected [people],\u201d Martos said. Peru\u2019s President Mart\u00edn Vizcarra said it was a stern warning to maintain social distancing: \u201cThese 163 [stallholders] have to stay at home and keep their distance to avoid infecting others.\u201d \u201cWhen you go to buy potatoes or lettuce, you could be taking Covid-19 into your homes as an extra,\u201d he said, using the Quechua word \u2018Yapa\u2019, which means a bonus portion offered to loyal customers. President Vizcarra has been praised by Peruvians for his swift and decisive response to Covid-19 enforcing one of the earliest lockdowns in Latin America. Nonetheless, the Andean country\u2019s curve of infection has continued to rise and it had Latin America\u2019s second-highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases after Brazil, with 36,976 confirmed cases and 1,051 deaths on Thursday. Poverty has been a major obstacle to the enforcement of the lockdown. Thousands have been trying to leave Lima in recent weeks, many saying they had to choose between hunger or homelessness in the city or the risk of exposure to Covid-19 as they attempt to return to their rural hometowns. Podcast: Who is Covid-19 killing? More than 26,000 people in the UK have officially been recorded as having died from the coronavirus. In this episode we look beyond the headline figure at who is dying \u2013 and hear from friends and family about the lives cut short: According to Johns Hopkins University data, more than a million people have now recovered from coronavirus infection, with the total currently at 1,014,524. Infections worldwide stand at 3,256,570. 233,363 people have died in the pandemic so far. Jacinda Ardern and her government soar in popularity during coronavirus crisis Charles Anderson reports for the Guardian: New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, reached an almost record-breaking approval rating while the country was in its strictest lockdown, according to a new leaked poll. The poll, which was conducted by UMR and leaked to the New Zealand Herald, shows that Ardern\u2019s Labour party has reached 55% approval, while the opposition National party has dropped to 29% \u2013 its lowest rating in more than a decade. The Greens were on 5% and New Zealand First \u2013 Labour\u2019s Coalition partners \u2013 on 6%. Ardern\u2019s personal approval rating was 65% while the opposition leader, Simon Bridges, sat on 7%, according to the poll. It puts the PM close to her high of 70% approval in UMR polls during her term in office. The poll also shows that 78% of New Zealanders believe the country is heading in the right direction \u2013 the highest since 1991. Nature is healing: China reported 12 new coronavirus cases for 30 April, up from four a day earlier, data from the country\u2019s health authority showed on Friday. Six of the cases were imported, the National Health Commission (NHC) said, up from four a day earlier. Of the domestic transmission cases, five were in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang and one in the northern region of Inner Mongolia. China reported no domestic transmission cases a day earlier. The NHC also reported 25 new asymptomatic cases for April 30, down from 33 a day earlier. The total number of confirmed cases in the country has reached 82,874. With no new deaths on Thursday, the toll remained at 4,633. Jair Bolsonaro says footballers in Brazil have \u2018a small chance of dying\u2019 from Covid-19 Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro wants to see football competitions restart soon despite the country\u2019s high number of coronavirus cases, arguing that players are less likely to die from Covid-19 because of their physical fitness, Associated Press reports. Bolsonaro is one of the few world leaders that still downplays the risks brought by the coronavirus, which he has likened to \u201ca little flu\u201d. Most leagues in Brazil were suspended on 15 March. The Brazilian championship was scheduled to begin in May, but that looks unlikely as the country has become a coronavirus hot spot with more than 5,900 deaths. Doctors say the peak of the pandemic is expected to hit within two weeks. Brazil\u2019s president said his new health minister will issue a suggestion that games return without any fans in the stadiums, but he acknowledged many players might be reluctant. \u201cThe decision to restart soccer is not mine, but we can help,\u201d Bolsonaro said, adding he has spoken with Gremio coach Renato Portaluppi about the issue and was told that players are still worried about the virus. Neighbouring Argentina has already cancelled the rest of the 2019-2020 season because of the pandemic. France also decided to end the season, declaring Paris Saint-Germain as league champions on Thursday. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. India\u2019s film industry, purveyor of song-and-dance spectacles to millions, will take at least two years to recover financially from the coronavirus pandemic, which is threatening big-ticket projects, putting at risk tens of thousands of jobs, Reuters reports. That was the sombre assessment of about a dozen top producers, distributors and actors from Bollywood, the movie industry in India\u2019s commercial capital of Mumbai, during a video conference this week, one of the participants said. Such dim prospects, even after the lockdown is lifted, threaten the box-office takings that make up 60% of industry earnings, spurring producers to say big-budget films and extravagant shoots in foreign locations will be shelved. Bollywood has come to a grinding halt, with film production and theatres shut nationwide, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a 40-day lockdown to curb the virus, which has infected 31,000 people and killed more than 1,000 in India. About 9,500 theatres are shut, and business at multiplexes and single-screen cinemas is unlikely to bounce back for weeks or even months, as infection fears linger and discretionary spending plunges. Shares in India\u2019s two largest multiplex operators, PVR and INOX Leisure, have plunged more than 40% from all-time highs in late February. Brokerage Emkay also slashed its rating on both to \u201chold\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d, saying they would suffer declines of more than 50% in visitor numbers, ticket sales, advertising revenue and food and beverage sales in fiscal 2020-21. Trump claims to have evidence coronavirus started in Chinese lab but offers no details Donald Trump claimed to have seen evidence to substantiate the unproven theory that the coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite US intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that the virus was \u201cnot manmade or genetically modified\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see where it comes from,\u201d Trump said at a White House event on Thursday. \u201cWe have people looking at it very, very strongly. Scientific people, intelligence people, and others. We\u2019re going to put it all together. I think we will have a very good answer eventually. And China might even tell us.\u201d Pressed to explain what evidence he had seen that the virus originated in a Chinese lab, Trump responded, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that. I\u2019m not allowed to tell you that.\u201d Prior to the White House event, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the clearinghouse for the web of US spy agencies, issued a statement asserting that the intelligence community \u201cconcurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified\u201d. \u201cThe intelligence community will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,\u201d the statement added. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Ms Du, door sensors and me: life with a Beijing Covid-19 quarantine handler Every day for the last two weeks I have spoken with Ms Du, a mild-mannered, middle-aged woman who is my quarantine handler. She calls me in the morning to remind me to send her my temperature. She calls again if I forget to send the afternoon reading. She texts rose emojis, reminding me to \u201cplease cooperate\u201d with the rules. If I open my door, equipped with a sensor, to put the rubbish in the hall or pick up a delivery, she immediately calls and reminds me to let her know beforehand. After returning from a reporting trip to Wuhan, I have been in strict self-isolation in my apartment in Beijing. Most days I get calls not just from Du but the local police station, perhaps checking the spelling of my name, someone from the health department asking about my travel history, or other representatives from the neighbourhood committee. They send messages reminding me to cover my mouth when coughing and not to \u201cspit wherever you please\u201d. The calls and questions, politely made, are constant and after a few days I already feel harried. A pink slip of paper with hearts taped to my door alerts my neighbours how long my quarantine should last: France will contribute \u20ac50 per person towards bicycle repairs after a nationwide coronavirus lockdown ends on 11 May, taking an innovative step to encourage cycling and reduce overcrowding in metros and buses, where it is hard to practice the social distancing required to prevent virus transmission. Environment Minister Elisabeth Borne announced on Thursday a \u20ac20 million ($22 million) plan for repairing bicycles, installing temporary bike parking spaces and financing cycling coaching sessions. Borne said the government will also accelerate a programme allowing employers to cover up to \u20ac400 of travel costs of staff who cycle to work. \u201cWe want this period to be a new stage towards a cycling culture and we want the bicycle to be the queen of deconfinement,\u201d Borne said on her Twitter feed. Remdesivir: five Australian hospitals to receive experimental coronavirus drug The US pharmaceutical company Gilead is finalising the location of five hospitals in Australia to receive the highly sought-after experimental Covid-19 drug remdesivir. The only confirmed location is St Vincent\u2019s hospital in Sydney, a major tertiary hospital and the centre of many of the New South Wales outbreak areas. A NSW Health spokeswoman confirmed the health department \u201chas been engaging with Gilead on gaining access to the drug for Covid-19 patients\u201d. The news comes as the doctor informing the Covid-19 response in the White House, the immunologist Dr Anthony Fauci, promoted preliminary findings from a joint Gilead and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study that suggested remdesivir could improve recovery time of patients. His comments have revived global hope in the drug, with no treatments now available for the virus. The death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis from coronavirus in English hospitals is more than 2.5 times that of the white population, according to stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies. The highly respected thinktank also found that deaths of people from a black Caribbean background were 1.7 times higher than for white Britons. NHS England figures published last week showed that hospital deaths per 100,000 among British people of a black Caribbean background were three times the equivalent number among the majority white British population. However, unlike previous analysis, the IFS research, published on Friday, strips out the role of age, gender and geography and shows that they do not explain the disparities. The first two weeks of the coronavirus lockdown triggered an unprecedented rise in food bank use as the economy was hit and household incomes plunged, data from hundreds of emergency food aid charities reveals. The Trussell Trust, the UK\u2019s biggest food bank network, said it experienced its busiest ever period after lockdown was announced on 23 March, when it issued 50,000 food parcels in the space of a week, almost double its usual volume. A similar picture emerged from the Independent Food Aid Network (Ifan), which said its food banks recorded a 59% increase in demand for emergency food support between February and March \u2013 17 times higher than the same period a year ago. Just a donkey named Earl playing with a purple ball: Here\u2019s the full story on the armed protestors in Michigan: American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines said Thursday they will soon require passengers to cover their faces during flights, following the lead of JetBlue Airways, Reuters reports. The move comes as airlines big and small contemplate how to comply with social-distancing recommendations in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Most flights are nearly empty these days air travel is down 95% from a year ago, and the average domestic flight has 17 passengers, according to industry figures. This week, JetBlue became the first US airline to announce it will require passengers to wear face coverings during flights, starting next week. Wearing a face covering isn\u2019t about protecting yourself, its about protecting those around you, said JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty. This is the new flying etiquette. Earlier Thursday, Frontier Airlines said that it would begin requiring masks 8 May. Delta and United announced they would make masks mandatory starting Monday. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday that downstate New York\u2019s entire public transport system (which includes New York City and Long Island) would be disinfected every 24 hours. He also said he would need an \u201carmy\u201d of between 6,400 and 17,000 people to trace the contacts of people who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus as part of a strategy to limit outbreaks. Cuomo said that former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg would, in coordination with Johns Hopkins University, oversee the recruitment and training of these \u201ccontact tracers\u201d and make the program available to governments worldwide. Hundreds of protesters, some armed, gathered inside Michigan\u2019s state capitol on Thursday as state lawmakers debated the Democratic governor\u2019s request to extend her emergency powers to combat coronavirus. A tightly packed crowd of protesters, some carrying rifles, attempted to enter the floor of the legislative chamber, and were held back by a line of state police and capitol staff, according to video footage posted by local journalists. \u201cLet us in! Let us in!\u201d the protesters chanted, as they stood shoulder-to-shoulder inside the statehouse. Few of them were wearing face masks. Some of the protesters shouted anti-government slogans, including comparing Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer to Hitler. One Democratic state lawmaker posted a photograph of men with rifles standing in a gallery yelling down at lawmakers below. \u201cSome of my colleagues who own bullet proof vests are wearing them,\u201d state senator Dayna Polehanki, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter. A spokeswoman for the Michigan senate minority leader that at least one lawmaker was wearing a bullet-proof vest. The footage from the protest sparked strong reactions from many Americans. One Black Lives Matter organizer commented on the striking difference between the reaction to unarmed black Americans protesting police violence and armed white Americans protesting against public health measures. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of coronavirus news from around the world. I\u2019m Helen Sullivan, with you for the next few hours. Please do get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan.
