The Paul Nicholls/JP McManus runner is up 10lb but can go in again at even money.</p> \n<p>The winning run ended last week for <strong>Ballybreen (5.15) </strong>but he still ran a fine race and was beaten only by a 66-1 shot unexpectedly bouncing back to form. He gets to run off the same mark in today\u2019s hurdles contest and his slogging ability should stand him in good stead at 9-4.</p> \n<p>In Stratford\u2019s opener, there\u2019s been interest in <strong>Elysian Flame (2.10)</strong> but the 13-8 is still fair for this juvenile hurdle. Mick Easterby\u2019s chestnut gets a much more straightforward chance than he has so far faced over obstacles and the ground will not be as testing as when he got tired in a Grade One at Chepstow over Christmas.</p> \n<h2>This week \u2026</h2> \n<p>\u2026 it\u2019s that Cheltenham Festival thing you may have heard of.

My focus is at Taunton, though the ground there is a lot more testing than you\u2019d expect for mid-March, which may lead to the odd shock. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a problem for Nineohtwooneoh (4.05), who proved way ahead of his mark when scoring at Musselburgh last month. The Paul Nicholls/JP McManus runner is up 10lb but can go in again at even money. The winning run ended last week for Ballybreen (5.15) but he still ran a fine race and was beaten only by a 66-1 shot unexpectedly bouncing back to form. He gets to run off the same mark in today\u2019s hurdles contest and his slogging ability should stand him in good stead at 9-4. In Stratford\u2019s opener, there\u2019s been interest in Elysian Flame (2.10) but the 13-8 is still fair for this juvenile hurdle. Mick Easterby\u2019s chestnut gets a much more straightforward chance than he has so far faced over obstacles and the ground will not be as testing as when he got tired in a Grade One at Chepstow over Christmas. This week \u2026 \u2026 it\u2019s that Cheltenham Festival thing you may have heard of. We\u2019ll have our usual in-depth coverage on Talking Horses from Tuesday to Friday, including a tipping competition each day, the prize for which is a \u00a3100 account credit kindly offered by Betfair.",

He said the measures would be \u201cscalable\u201d.</p> <p>The treasurer said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/health-minister-calls-on-australians-to-be-their-best-selves-as-coronavirus-cases-rise\">the virus had inflicted supply and demand side constraints</a> on economies, including Australia, \u201cand that\u2019s where our package will be focused\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/stimulus-package-to-protect-economy-from-coronavirus-impact-expected-within-days\">The government has signalled</a> a new business investment allowance, a financial boost for pensioners through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/09/deeming-rates-explained-how-they-work-and-why-pensioners-want-them-changed\">changes to deeming rates</a>, and immediate support for small and medium-sized businesses will form part of the looming package.</p> <p>Frydenberg said on Monday the stimulus package, which is expected to be announced before the prime minister and the premiers meet this Friday in Sydney for the Council of Australian Governments, would not include updated economic forecasts taking into account the hits inflicted on the budget by the summer bushfire crisis and the virus. Forecasts, he said, would be updated in the May budget.</p> <p>Last week, the Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/mar/05/morrison-albanese-coronavirus-economy-politics-live?page=with:block-5e602a6a8f08c2df6d273635#block-5e602a6a8f08c2df6d273635\">revealed that the department was forecasting a 0.7% contraction in economic growth</a> in the March quarter, equivalent to lost activity worth about $3.5bn.</p> <p>Speaking in Brisbane, the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, encouraged the Morrison government to move quickly and substantively with the stimulus package. \u201cWe need to make sure that whatever the government announces is not too little too late.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to make sure that whatever they announce is big enough and fast enough to make a genuine difference in a floundering economy,\u201d Chalmers said.</p> <p>The shadow treasurer also advocated support for workers whose incomes will be disrupted by the illness, and for businesses. \u201cWe need the government to focus on those most affected by these challenges \u2013 whether it be workers without paid sick leave, whether it be businesses in the affected sectors having trouble with cashflow\u201d.</p> <p>The industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, will meet on Tuesday with unions and employer groups.

      "bodyText": "Josh Frydenberg says the Morrison government will use the tax and transfer system to get financial support to Australian households as quickly as possible as part of a looming stimulus package to counter the negative economic impact of the coronavirus. Ahead of a cabinet deliberation about the stimulus package expected on Tuesday, the treasurer was asked by reporters on Monday how the government intended to administer assistance to households, given the Coalition has criticised the Rudd government\u2019s stimulus package deployed during the global financial crisis. As recently as late last week, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, declared households should not expect Kevin Rudd-style cash payments to stimulate the economy in the wake of the coronavirus. Frydenberg told reporters on Monday when it came to households: \u201cWe have our existing systems, the tax and transfer systems. In terms of the specific details, I will leave that to our announcement, but what we will be focused is ensuring the support gets out there as fast as possible.\u201d The treasurer said the multibillion-dollar package, which the government has been working up over the past couple of weeks in anticipation of a sustained economic hit from both the bushfires and the coronavirus, would be \u201cvery comprehensive and very substantial\u201d. \u201cThe economic response will be substantial, it will be targeted and it will be focused on supporting those people and those businesses that need our support during this period,\u201d the treasurer said. Frydenberg hinted the government would roll out the first phase of assistance to households and business imminently, then likely revisit again at the May budget. He said the measures would be \u201cscalable\u201d. The treasurer said the virus had inflicted supply and demand side constraints on economies, including Australia, \u201cand that\u2019s where our package will be focused\u201d. The government has signalled a new business investment allowance, a financial boost for pensioners through changes to deeming rates, and immediate support for small and medium-sized businesses will form part of the looming package. Frydenberg said on Monday the stimulus package, which is expected to be announced before the prime minister and the premiers meet this Friday in Sydney for the Council of Australian Governments, would not include updated economic forecasts taking into account the hits inflicted on the budget by the summer bushfire crisis and the virus. Forecasts, he said, would be updated in the May budget. Last week, the Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, revealed that the department was forecasting a 0.7% contraction in economic growth in the March quarter, equivalent to lost activity worth about $3.5bn. Speaking in Brisbane, the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, encouraged the Morrison government to move quickly and substantively with the stimulus package. \u201cWe need to make sure that whatever the government announces is not too little too late. \u201cWe need to make sure that whatever they announce is big enough and fast enough to make a genuine difference in a floundering economy,\u201d Chalmers said. The shadow treasurer also advocated support for workers whose incomes will be disrupted by the illness, and for businesses. \u201cWe need the government to focus on those most affected by these challenges \u2013 whether it be workers without paid sick leave, whether it be businesses in the affected sectors having trouble with cashflow\u201d. The industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, will meet on Tuesday with unions and employer groups. Australia\u2019s 3.3-million-strong casual workforce is posing particular challenges now the coronavirus is being transmitted in the community. The government\u2019s advice to workers to self-isolate and work from home in the event of illness is not a solution available for many casual and service industry workers. Labor has proposed a Newstart-like payment be made available to workers forced to self-isolate. The ACTU national secretary, Sally McManus, wants to put compensation for casual workers on the table, highlighting the flow-on effects from workers suddenly being denied an income. \u201cIt should be just paid leave,\u201d McManus said, suggesting employers be compensated by the government once the crisis has passed. Porter\u2019s office said Tuesday\u2019s meeting was a first-step discussion about the potential issues facing Australia\u2019s business community and workforce. Frydenberg said the government was \u201cvery conscious\u201d workers would be concerned about job security, and would be an issue discussed at Porter\u2019s roundtable on Tuesday. The treasurer urged businesses to be cooperative and flexible. Advocates have also drawn attention to the government\u2019s plan to scrap the sickness allowance, as part of a plan to roll seven social services payments into the one JobSeeker payment. That is due to take affect on 20 March, with those impacted being told to apply for the JobSeeker payment, which comes with mutual obligations those self-isolating will most likely be unable to meet. The social services minister, Anne Ruston, has already ruled out any changes to Newstart, saying any future raises to the rate would be part of measures separate to the coming stimulus plan.",

      "bodyText": "Panic-buying toilet paper in response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has become a meme on social media, with young Australian TikTok users mocking those who are stripping supermarket shelves bare. Last week Woolworths announced it would be rationing toilet paper after people began stockpiling the domestic essential, causing supplies to dwindle in many shops. The #ToiletPaperEmergency or the great #ToiletPaperApocalypse, as it was dubbed on Twitter, has inspired a wave of content on TikTok, the video app popular among teenagers and younger users. TikToks are short videos, between 15 and 60 seconds, where users create content to the backing of film dialogue or music. One, set to the tune made for TikTok, It\u2019s Corona Time, has been liked more than 70,000 times and shows dozens of shoppers running towards a freshly stocked shelf of toilet paper. Another, set to the Avengers theme song and showing a flood of customers with empty trollies, has stacked up over 18,000 likes. This one shows a young Woolworths worker listing sold-out items such as long-life milk and hand sanitiser, and has gained over 114,000 likes. Woolworths said it was working to restore supplies, with long-life food also in high demand. Another, set to the theme music used in the You Wouldn\u2019t Steal a Car anti-piracy campaign of the 2000s, received 33,000 likes and features a young man parodying the ad. One TikTok user also captured a serious dispute. Two women, at a Coles in Melbourne, are shown fighting over the last available packet of toilet rolls. One woman, with five packs in her trolley, says \u201cI was here first\u201d, before they both grab the tissue. Other customers step in to pull her away and she leaves disgruntled. On Sunday police charged two women over a separate incident, an alleged fight over toilet paper in a Chullora supermarket. \u201cWe just ask that people don\u2019t panic like this when they go out shopping,\u201d New South Wales police acting inspector Andrew New said. \u201cThere is no need for it. It isn\u2019t the Thunderdome, it isn\u2019t Mad Max, we don\u2019t need to do that.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A charity led by the archbishop of Canterbury is preparing to help feed children if schools are closed by coronavirus, amid fears the withdrawal of free school dinners could leave up to 3 million children at risk of hunger. Feeding Britain, which runs food poverty schemes in 12 areas of England including Cornwall, Leicester, Barnsley and South Shields, is exploring how to set up emergency programmes similar to those used to feed the poorest children during the summer holidays. The Akshaya Patra Foundation, which serves thousands of hot meals to children every summer in London boroughs, is also \u201cprepared to enter crisis mode\u201d, while food projects in Bristol and Huddersfield said they were exploring how their schemes to feed hundreds of children in school holidays could be adapted to help cope with emergency closures. \u201cFor so many families now, schools are the first line of defence against hunger,\u201d said Andrew Forsey, the national director of Feeding Britain, whose president is the Most Rev Justin Welby. \u201cIn many cases it is breakfast as well as lunch, so if the schools close it\u2019s two meals we have to find. There is early-stage planning going on around ensuring supplies of food and the extent of voluntary support that could be drawn upon if some schools do need to close.\u201d Downing Street said on Tuesday that school closures would be among \u201cdistancing strategies\u201d used if the virus became established in the UK. On Thursday, Italy closed all of its schools and colleges for a month. FareShare, a charity that distributes food to more than 700 holiday food projects, has said it wants to recruit more volunteers to tackle the fallout from coronavirus. An immediate challenge is likely to be finding a way to deliver meals in a way that maintains the distance between people that school closures are meant to achieve. The Bristol project said it could involve delivering food parcels door-to-door. Forsey also said panic-buying that cleared supermarket shelves could hinder efforts as many free meal programmes relied on retailers\u2019 donations. MPs have estimated 3 million children are at risk of being hungry in the school holidays \u2013 made up of more than a million children who qualify for free school meals, and about 2 million who are disqualified from free school meals because their parents work but remain in poverty. Donna Sealey, a charity worker at the Ambition Lawrence Weston food project in Bristol, which fed 175 children over the summer, said: \u201cIf it is a week off, many can scrape along, but a month would be a significant amount of time. By the second week, you haven\u2019t got any money or food. We would kick in the programme to do something similar to the six-week school holiday.\u201d Sealey said problems could be worsened because many families relied on money from zero-hours contract work, which meant if they had to look after their children their earnings would dry up. Teachers have said that closures are likely to most disadvantage the educations of pupils at state primaries because they lack the IT infrastructure of private schools and state secondaries. A survey has found that while a majority of state secondary school teachers said they could set work for their pupils remotely, fewer than one in 10 state primary school teachers said their school was able to broadcast lessons to pupils by video. Only about one in six said they had the technology to set and receive work from pupils, according to the survey by the Teacher Tapp app. Nearly 30% of teachers at primary and secondary independent schools said they already had the capacity to deliver lessons by video. \u201cState schools can\u2019t take for granted that every child has their own device at home and limitless data access,\u201d said the former teacher Laura McInerney, a Guardian education columnist and co-founder of the app.",

Last year it predicted demand would grow by 825,000bpd in 2020.</p> <p>Fatih Birol, the IEA\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cThe coronavirus crisis is affecting a wide range of energy markets \u2013 including coal, gas and renewables \u2013 but its impact on oil markets is particularly severe because it is stopping people and goods from moving around, dealing a heavy blow to demand for transport fuels.\u201d </p> <p>A barrel of Brent crude has been almost halved in price since the start of December, when it stood at more than $66.

In the past couple of months, Saudi Arabia has been pumping 9.7m bpd.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia has an oil output capacity of 12m bpd, giving it the ability to swiftly increase production.</p> <p>China\u2019s fast-growing economy was responsible for around 80% of global oil demand growth last year according to the IEA, but the coronavirus has forced the country to shut factories and refineries across the key industrial province of Hubei, and left tankers of crude stranded off its coast.</p> <p>The IEA\u2019s latest report pins global oil demand at 99.9m barrels a day this year, but it admitted that Covid-19 could drive demand lower than these predictions if countries failed to contain the virus.</p> <p>The world\u2019s oil demand could contract by as much as 730,000 barrels a day in 2020 in a \u201cworst case\u201d scenario. If the virus is contained quickly around the world, global oil demand could grow by 480,000 barrels a day, according to the IEA.</p> <p>\u201cThe coronavirus crisis is adding to the uncertainties [which] the global oil industry faces as it contemplates new investments and business strategies,\u201d the IEA\u2019s Birol said. \u201cThe impact of the coronavirus on oil markets may be temporary. But the longer-term challenges facing the world\u2019s suppliers are not going to go away, especially those heavily dependent on oil and gas revenues.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "The price of crude oil has plunged by almost 27% after Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s top oil exporter, said it would step up production from next month, flooding global markets and most likely depressing petrol and diesel prices. Brent crude was at $33.09 a barrel on Monday morning, a fall of 27%. It was the worst one-day fall for Brent since the start of the first Gulf war in 1991. US crude fell 27% to $30. The safe-haven yen surged against emerging market currencies that have a large exposure to oil, including the Russian rouble and Mexican peso, as analysts saw danger ahead. Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said: \u201cToday\u2019s price action puts at risk the fiscal health of the vast majority of sovereign producers and budget cuts and increased debt loads are now looming in the event of a prolonged period of low prices. For the most politically and economically fragile producer states, the reckoning could be severe.\u201d The shock decision by the state oil company Aramco over the weekend came in response to Russia\u2019s refusal to join an Opec plan to cut supplies. Aramco will boost its crude output significantly above 10m barrels per day (bpd) in April, after a previous agreement to limit supplies agreed by Opec and Russia expires at the end of March. As oil prices plunged, the International Energy Agency (IEA) \u2013 a body established to monitor the security of global oil supplies \u2013 said demand for oil would shrink for the first time in a decade this year because of the impact of the coronavirus. The Paris-based agency expects global oil demand to fall by 90,000bpd. Last year it predicted demand would grow by 825,000bpd in 2020. Fatih Birol, the IEA\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cThe coronavirus crisis is affecting a wide range of energy markets \u2013 including coal, gas and renewables \u2013 but its impact on oil markets is particularly severe because it is stopping people and goods from moving around, dealing a heavy blow to demand for transport fuels.\u201d A barrel of Brent crude has been almost halved in price since the start of December, when it stood at more than $66. Prices dropped by almost 10% on Friday after news broke that the planned Opec deal had foundered. On Saturday, Aramco slashed its official selling price for April for all its crude grades to all destinations. Higher production and price cuts by Aramco are likely to push world prices down further, hurting countries that rely on oil exports for tax income and foreign exchange, especially in Africa, south-east Asia and South America. The new strategy adopted by Riyadh appears to target Russia and US shale oil firms, many of which are known to have high production costs and lose money when crude prices fall below $50 a barrel for more than a few months. Other Opec producers, such as Iraq, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, are expected to follow Saudi Arabia\u2019s lead with price cuts and increased production from April. The Saudi decision came after marathon talks at the Opec headquarters in Vienna, when the Russian energy minister, Alexander Novak, said that from 1 April neither Opec nor non-Opec countries had any restrictions on production. The sources said April\u2019s production would be significantly higher than 10m bpd, possibly closer to 11m bpd. In the past couple of months, Saudi Arabia has been pumping 9.7m bpd. Saudi Arabia has an oil output capacity of 12m bpd, giving it the ability to swiftly increase production. China\u2019s fast-growing economy was responsible for around 80% of global oil demand growth last year according to the IEA, but the coronavirus has forced the country to shut factories and refineries across the key industrial province of Hubei, and left tankers of crude stranded off its coast. The IEA\u2019s latest report pins global oil demand at 99.9m barrels a day this year, but it admitted that Covid-19 could drive demand lower than these predictions if countries failed to contain the virus. The world\u2019s oil demand could contract by as much as 730,000 barrels a day in 2020 in a \u201cworst case\u201d scenario. If the virus is contained quickly around the world, global oil demand could grow by 480,000 barrels a day, according to the IEA. \u201cThe coronavirus crisis is adding to the uncertainties [which] the global oil industry faces as it contemplates new investments and business strategies,\u201d the IEA\u2019s Birol said. \u201cThe impact of the coronavirus on oil markets may be temporary. But the longer-term challenges facing the world\u2019s suppliers are not going to go away, especially those heavily dependent on oil and gas revenues.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets in Europe and the US are braced for their biggest falls since the 2008 financial crisis after the trading week began with panic selling amid the double threat of a coronavirus-driven global recession and an oil-price war. The FTSE 100 was projected to plunge by 6.3% when trading begins on Monday, while the Dow Jones industrial average was on course to lose 4.9% in New York. It follows huge losses on Asian markets on Monday, where fears about the worsening worldwide economic slowdown were exacerbated by the shock decision by Saudi Arabia over the weekend to increase oil production in an attempt to drive competitors such as Russia and the US out of the market. The price of Brent crude oil fell nearly 30% to $31.14 on Monday, its biggest single fall since the start of the first Gulf war in 1991. Some experts predicted it could fall even further unless the Saudis and Russians returned to the bargaining table. \u201cI think all forecasts are out the window,\u201d said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Probis Securities in Sydney. \u201cIt seems like a race to the bottom to secure order(s).\u201d The turmoil on international markets came as the outbreak continued to deepen around the world and bring more restrictions on movements from governments: Italy was plunged into chaos as the number of fatalities increased by more than 50% to 366 and government plans to lock down large parts of the country\u2019s north, or about 25% of the population, were leaked to the media. The stranded cruise ship Grand Princess was expected to finally dock in Oakland, California on Monday as arrangements were made for its 3,500 crew and passengers, some of whom have contracted the virus. The number of deaths in the US rose to 21 with more than 550 confirmed cases. Saudi Arabia cordoned off the oil-rich, predominantly Shia region ofQatif, suspended air and sea travel to nine countries and closed schools and universities as the number of cases in the kingdom continued to increase. Organisers of the Australian Grand Prix, set to kick off the Formula One season in Melbourne on Sunday, said there was \u201cno chance\u201d the race would be called off despite rising concerns about the event\u2019s large crowds facilitating the spread of the disease. As concern grew over a possible recession in Australia as a result of the virus, a wave of selling on stock markets in Asia Pacific was the worst since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 heralded the onset of the global financial crisis. The Australian share market closed down 7.33% as energy companies saw double-digit losses. The Nikkei in Japan was down 5% while shares in Hong Kong were off 3.5%. US 10-year government bond yields fell to fresh record lows and the Japanese yen and gold spiked as investors piled into safe havens. Futures trading in Wall Street\u2019s benchmark S&amp;P500 index of leading companies was suspended when losses reached the so-called \u201climit down\u201d of 5%. \u201cThere is genuine panic in the price action \u2026\u201d said Chris Weston, head of research at the web trading platform Pepperstone in Melbourne. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything like this for years.\u201d David Bassanese, chief economist at BetaShares Capital in Sydney, said the market would not bottom out until the US situation was clearer. \u201cWe need a clear sign that the outbreak in the US is contained but we\u2019re not there yet because the number of cases and deaths is still on the rise. We have to see what happens with containment measures there, such as travel restrictions and shutdowns.\u201d The ratings agency Moody\u2019s said on Monday that the risk of a global recession was rising as the spread of the coronavirus causes a simultaneous supply and demand shock throughout the world economy. Joachim Fels, the chief economist of the world\u2019s biggest bond trader, Pimco, said in a note to clients that a recession in the US and Europe was a \u201cdistinct possibility\u201d. \u201cThe worst for the economy is yet to come over the next several months,\u201d he said, according to Bloomberg, citing the impact of the virus on demand and supply, weaker Chinese manufacturing and a hit on the global tourism industry. The OECD said last week that a severe outbreak of the coronavirus could cut global growth by 0.5 to 1.5%. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank said they were setting aside billions of pounds for developing world countries to support ailing health systems and offset the worst of the impact from falling commodity prices. The accountants BDO said a dramatic rebound in optimism among British businesses since the beginning of the year could be jeopardised by a more severe outbreak of the virus. It said the services sector enjoyed the biggest rise in optimism last month following the end of the Brexit stalemate. The report said the rise in confidence reflected the underlying improvement in business conditions as a result of a more certain political and economic outlook. It follows three months of marginal increases in optimism, as businesses appeared to be in wait-and-see mode in the immediately after the general election, the firm said. Kaley Crossthwaite of BDO LLP said: \u201cWe have just witnessed the most significant uplift in business optimism in 10 years, and the impact of greater political and economic certainty brought by a new majority government should not be underestimated. \u201cHowever, businesses will now be spending the coming weeks focused on mitigating the uncertainty caused by coronavirus. \u201cThe next month will be crucial in determining whether this optimism can remain, or if the \u2018Boris bounce\u2019 will be brought back down to earth by the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Top story: Boris Johnson to chair Cobra meeting Hello, Warren Murray here with a stockpile of news \u2013 plenty to share round. Share markets are braced for their biggest falls since the global financial crisis after the trading week began with panic selling amid the double threat of coronavirus-driven recession and a Saudi-triggered oil price war. There are early projections for the FTSE100 to plunge by more than 6% at the open, while the Dow Jones is on course to lose 4.9% in New York later in the day. Turning away from the markets for a moment: Boris Johnson will this morning chair his first emergency Cobra meeting on the coronavirus in a week to consider whether tougher measures are needed. The number of British cases has increased by a third to 278 while the number of deaths has risen to three. Charities are working out plans to feed up to 3 million disadvantaged students who rely on free school meals and might be left to go hungry if there are school closures. Meanwhile a cross-Whitehall unit has been set up to counter coronavirus-related disinformation, including from Russia and China, with civil servants working closely with social media companies to rebut false and inaccurate claims. Further afield, Italy has been plunged into chaos as fatalities increased more than 50% to 366 and government plans to lock down large parts of the country\u2019s north, holding about 25% of the population, were leaked to the media. The stranded cruise ship Grand Princess is expected to finally dock in Oakland, California today. Saudi Arabia has cordoned off the oil-rich region of Shia Qatif, suspended air and sea travel to nine countries and closed schools and universities. The wave of selling on stock markets in the Asia-Pacific was the worst since the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008, with Australia losing 7.33%, the Nikkei down nearly 6% and Hong Kong down 3.5%. The Japanese yen and gold have spiked as investors seek safe havens. Follow all coronavirus developments today at our live blog. * * * Man \u2018carrying knives\u2019 shot dead \u2013 Overnight, police in Westminster have shot dead a man who they said produced knives when he was approached. The Metropolitan police said the case was not terror-related. The shooting is understood to have happened in the Whitehall area of London, which is packed full of sensitive government and official buildings. Under the law, any shooting by the police has to be investigated by the independent police watchdog. * * * Salmond trial begins \u2013 Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland, goes on trial today on multiple charges of sexual assault, including one of attempted rape \u2013 charges he has strongly denied, and to which he has pleaded not guilty. Salmond is accused of assaulting 10 women over an eight-year period, including nine incidents alleged to have taken place at Bute House, the first minister\u2019s official residence in Edinburgh. The crown case will be led by Alex Prentice QC while Scotland\u2019s most senior advocate, Gordon Jackson QC, will appear for Salmond. The trial will be overseen by Lady Dorrian. Our Scotland editor, Severin Carrell, sets the scene. * * * \u2018Waive veteran visa fees\u2019 \u2013 Commonwealth veterans who served with the UK military are facing visa fees of thousands of pounds if they want to stay following discharge. On Commonwealth Day the Royal British Legion is calling for the immediate abolition of the fees, which have left some facing deportation. The armed forces recruit up to 1,350 Commonwealth personnel each year, mostly from Africa, the Caribbean and Fiji. After four years or more they are eligible to apply to stay but, as an example, a service leaver and partner with two children face nearly \u00a310,000 in fees. Charles Byrne from the Legion said: \u201cThis is a poor way of saying thank you to people we encouraged to leave their countries and come to serve in the British armed forces \u2026 we urge the home secretary to take action to help Commonwealth military veterans who have served this country loyally and abolish all visa application fees.\u201d * * * Missile salvo \u2013 North Korea has fired three unidentified projectiles off its eastern coast, a week after launching two short-range missiles, South Korea\u2019s military has said. The projectiles were launched on Monday from the coastal town of Sondok, which has a military airfield. Britain, Germany, France, Estonia and Belgium have raised last week\u2019s missile firings at the UN security council, calling them a provocative action violating UN resolutions. * * * Renewables fill coal hole \u2013 Carbon emissions from the global electricity system fell by 2% last year while power from coal plants fell 3%, the climate thinktank Ember says. The biggest drop in almost 30 years came as the US and the EU turned to cleaner energy sources \u2013 and despite China\u2019s use of coal plants actually climbing. Ember has warned that its findings rely on many one-off factors including milder winters across many countries. \u201cProgress is being made on reducing coal generation, but nothing like with the urgency needed to limit climate change,\u201d said the report, which reveals that renewable wind and solar power rose by 15% in 2019 to make up 8% of the world\u2019s electricity. Today in Focus podcast: Hadley Freeman\u2019s family secrets When the Guardian writer found an old shoebox full of pictures and documents in the back of a wardrobe, it began a quest to find the real story of her family\u2019s history and her grandmother\u2019s escape to America from the Nazis. Plus: Annette McGivney on the problem with almond milk. Lunchtime read: China\u2019s blanket security may not go away Chinese citizens are living under a new level of government intrusion: getting into one\u2019s apartment or workplace requires scanning a QR code, and writing down your name and ID number, temperature and recent travel history. Phone companies track people\u2019s movements and social media platforms are used to report others who may be sick. Some cities are offering people rewards for informing on sick neighbours. Chinese companies are rolling out facial recognition to detect elevated temperatures and people not wearing face masks. Apps can alert people to whether they are near or have been in contact with an infected person. From top officials to local community workers, those enforcing the rules repeat the same refrain: this is an \u201cextraordinary time\u201d, feichang shiqi, requiring extraordinary measures. But as the number of new infections appears to fall, residents and observers are asking whether these new measures might be here to stay. Sport Eddie Jones has revealed he will hold talks with the Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney, over potentially extending his contract through to the 2023 World Cup. The England coach has improved the national side, writes Robert Kitson, but calamitous PR, the perverse selections and occasional verbal excesses overshadow his role. Joe Marler will discover today if he faces punishment for grabbing Alun Wyn Jones\u2019s genitals during the Six Nations victory over Wales, while Gregor Townsend insisted that Mohamed Haouas\u2019s first-half red card was not the determining factor in Scotland\u2019s 28-10 victory over France. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r believes Manchester United are heading back towards the top after his team, inspired by Bruno Fernandes, recorded a third victory over Manchester City this season at Old Trafford. The Englishman Tyrrell Hatton claimed his first win on the PGA Tour by one shot from Marc Leishman at the Arnold Palmer Invitational but Rory McIlroy failed to mount a challenge. A narrow 1-0 win over Japan at the SheBelieves Cup did little to answer the numerous questions asked about England\u2019s future under coach Phil Neville. Wigan returned to the top of Super League and underlined their early-season position as the team to beat, although they were given a stern test by an injury-hit, resilient Hull KR side. Lastly, Italian Formula One teams have started arriving in Australia, and there is no chance of the opening grand prix of the season being cancelled or being held behind closed doors despite fears over the coronavirus, say race organisers. Business As if the coronavirus wasn\u2019t enough to shake the business world, February\u2019s poor weather and the burden of business rates are creating a perfect storm for the retail sector. Research out today shows that footfall on the high street fell 7.8% last month thanks to the wet weather and swingeing rates continue to cost jobs. The pound is buying $1.306 and \u20ac1.144.

      "body": "<p>If the period between the referendum and leaving the EU was when the seeds of a new political culture were sown, the season since the general election last December is when they have borne fruit. Downing Street\u2019s consolidation exercise has not only extended to the purging of ministers who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/sajid-javid-resigns-as-chancellor-amid-boris-johnson-reshuffle\" title=\"\">refuse to become vassals</a> of No 10.

A Kremlin-style monitoring of those with EU sympathies stalks public figures</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In an episode right out of a cold war movie, last week it emerged that classics scholar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/01/british-museum-put-mary-beard-on-the-board-despite-downing-st-veto\" title=\"\">Mary Beard</a> was blocked by Downing Street from becoming a British Museum trustee last year. Whitehall sources told the Observer the decision was made because of Beard\u2019s pro-European views, ones that she had felt free to express on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wmarybeard\" title=\"\">social media</a> and are shared by half the country. But the country in which she lives has changed. The social media walls have ears. A Kremlin-style monitoring of those with EU sympathies stalks public figures. Whether her views have any bearing on her ability to do the job is neither here nor there.</p> <p>Even the job of protecting the public has been affected. The<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak/all\" title=\"\"> coronavirus outbreak</a> too has fallen victim to the obsession with blocking anything EU-related, no matter whether it could cost lives. Downing Street is now locked in a row with the Department of Health over access to the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/03/01/downing-street-department-health-locked-row-access-eu-pandemic/\" title=\"\">EU pandemic early warning system</a>. No 10 is allegedly preventing the department from attending meetings with EU officials to coordinate a response to the crisis. The reason for this reckless politicisation of a medical emergency is that it would risk giving the EU leverage in negotiations. Strengthening Britain\u2019s position against the EU will happen literally over our dead bodies.</p> <p>Soon, there will no criteria for how a public interest role is filled other than the candidate\u2019s fealty and acquiescence to the control centre of a government that has put ideological loyalty above professional ability.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b7f74f67e62363d5a7f700019b550e16f9142f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b7f74f67e62363d5a7f700019b550e16f9142f9/0_105_3326_1996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings listens to a press conference in Downing Street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He and Cummings have built a team around themselves that is more fortress than government.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Augstein/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Consider <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/alok-sharma-appointed-chair-of-cop26-climate-conference-in-reshuffle\" title=\"\">Alok Sharma</a>, the secretary of state for business and new, UK-appointed president of the vital UN <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2020\" title=\"\">climate conference </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2020\" title=\"\">in Glasgow</a> at the end of this year.

      "bodyText": "If the period between the referendum and leaving the EU was when the seeds of a new political culture were sown, the season since the general election last December is when they have borne fruit. Downing Street\u2019s consolidation exercise has not only extended to the purging of ministers who refuse to become vassals of No 10. It has weaponised the Brexit mandate it received by in effect turning the EU into a loyalty test. Based on who passes it, the Tories can then impose limitations on who has the right to assume government-vetted jobs, and how those jobs are fulfilled. In an episode right out of a cold war movie, last week it emerged that classics scholar Mary Beard was blocked by Downing Street from becoming a British Museum trustee last year. Whitehall sources told the Observer the decision was made because of Beard\u2019s pro-European views, ones that she had felt free to express on social media and are shared by half the country. But the country in which she lives has changed. The social media walls have ears. A Kremlin-style monitoring of those with EU sympathies stalks public figures. Whether her views have any bearing on her ability to do the job is neither here nor there. Even the job of protecting the public has been affected. The coronavirus outbreak too has fallen victim to the obsession with blocking anything EU-related, no matter whether it could cost lives. Downing Street is now locked in a row with the Department of Health over access to the EU pandemic early warning system. No 10 is allegedly preventing the department from attending meetings with EU officials to coordinate a response to the crisis. The reason for this reckless politicisation of a medical emergency is that it would risk giving the EU leverage in negotiations. Strengthening Britain\u2019s position against the EU will happen literally over our dead bodies. Soon, there will no criteria for how a public interest role is filled other than the candidate\u2019s fealty and acquiescence to the control centre of a government that has put ideological loyalty above professional ability. Consider Alok Sharma, the secretary of state for business and new, UK-appointed president of the vital UN climate conference in Glasgow at the end of this year. Yet he has voted against setting decarbonisation targets, and has opposed incentives for renewable energy, and requiring the energy industry to have a carbon capture and storage strategy. Under Johnson\u2019s government of vassals, the ability to do a job well seems to have become a disqualifying feature, lest someone\u2019s vocational excellence and integrity undermine their pliancy. It was only a matter of time before \u201chaving enough of experts\u201d turned into blocking those experts from doing their jobs \u2013 whether to make our lives safer, or our cultural life richer. It\u2019s hard to keep up with all the ways the country\u2019s political culture has deteriorated over the relatively short period since the referendum.

      "bodyText": "Female asylum seekers have staged a demonstration at the Turkish border demanding to be let into the EU as part of protests around the world on International Women\u2019s Day. All over the globe, thousands of women took to the streets, including South Americans campaigning for access to abortions and topless demonstrations in London and Paris. Women and children carried placards with the words \u201cHelp us\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Kill Us \u2014 We Are Human\u201d at the Pazarkule border crossing between Turkey and Greece on Sunday, where thousands of migrants have gathered since Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan decided to open the Turkish side of the border. In France a clutch of virus deaths on Saturday took the death toll to 16, but Paris hosted several rallies \u2014 one of which was marred by violence that organisers blamed on police. Other protests around the world were also met with force. In Istanbul, Turkey, police fired teargas on a crowd and pushed protesters away after local officials closed down streets leading to the city\u2019s main square. A demonstration in Kyrgyzstan also turned violent as police detained dozens of protesters \u2013 mainly women \u2013 after masked men attacked them and tore up their placards in the capital Bishkek. A police spokesman said they were detained for their own safety and because police had not been warned about the rally. In Santiago, Chile, thousands gathered in the capital, Santiago, demanding access to abortion and an end to violence against women. Police used water hoses and teargas in attempts to disperse crowds. Many women came prepared, wearing gas masks and even sling shots to fight back. In Mexico City, a huge rally marched to the public square in front of the national palace, where they painted the first names of victims of femicide since 2016, from a list that included over 3,000. Femicides have more than doubled in the country over the past five years. In Milan in northern Italy, a small group of women \u2014 some wearing pink face masks \u2014 came out to show their support for the celebration, despite the region being under lockdown amid the rapid spread of coronavirus. The Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, released a video message in which he expressed regret at the need to avoid large-scale gatherings. He said he was giving \u201ca grateful thought to the women \u2014 and there are many \u2014 who are working in hospitals ... in the red [quarantine] zones to fight the spread of the virus that worries us today\u201d. In the Philippines, a group of anti-imperialists, dissidents and feminists burnt an effigy of President Rodrigo Duterte, who has been criticised for misogyny. In London, 31 women from the Extinction Rebellion group formed a topless chain across Waterloo Bridge, saying their bare breasts symbolised \u201cthe vulnerability of women around the world in the face of climate breakdown\u201d. Many had written slogans across their naked chests including \u201cClimate Rape\u201d, \u201cClimate Murder\u201d and \u201cClimate Abuse\u201d. In London and other cities the women\u2019s strike took place, encouraging women to withdraw all work \u2014 whether paid or unpaid domestic work. \u201cThe women\u2019s strike rejects the decades of economic inequality, criminalisation and policing, racial and sexual violence, and endless global war and terrorism,\u201d the group said in a statement.

Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo, currently seeking re-election, said she was shocked at the \u201cunacceptable and incomprehensible\u201d violence and expressed her solidarity with the demonstrators.

Thousands of women and allies gathered in cities across the world to protest for women\u2019s rights and protection against violence. Demonstrations were seen in over a dozen countries, from Pakistan to Argentina. </p> \n  <p>For some, the risks of protesting were great. In many cities, women were often met with counter-protestors, sometimes in the form of riot police who used tear gas to disperse crowds. </p> \n  <p>No matter the risk, women showed up and demanded to be heard, showing the fight for rights will continue well past this day for women. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e655b818f087df56e4c4af0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/joe-parkin-daniels\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T20:58:09.505Z\">8.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Bogot\u00e1, Colombia</h2> \n  <p>In Bogot\u00e1, Colombia\u2019s capital, today\u2019s demonstrations had a timely significance following the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision not to modify the restrictive abortion law last Monday.</p> \n  <p>\u201cToday\u2019s marches show that the fight for our rights is not over,\u201d said Gina Borre, a pro-choice activist with the Viejas Verdes movement. \u201cEach year we are more united, more powerful.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Demonstrators, many wearing green bandanas, gathered at the Centre for Peace and Memory near downtown Bogot\u00e1 on Sunday morning, before marching towards Parque Olaya in the city\u2019s south.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is a debate that always gets politicized, and their are many powerful interests, like the catholic and evangelical churches,\u201d said Olga Amparo, the coordinator of local women\u2019s rights group Casa de la Mujer. \u201cBut we are talking about healthcare and rights - which are universal.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Abortion is currently illegal in Colombia, except in cases where the life and health of the pregnant woman or the fetus are at risk, or in cases where the conception was the result of incest or rape. The court had an opportunity to loosen the law, though ultimately decided to maintain the status quo, disappointing watchdogs and activists across the region.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cBy failing to take this historic opportunity to move towards the decriminalization of abortion in Colombia, the Constitutional Court has turned its back on women and their struggle to end the cycle of violence and the control mechanisms of which they have been the victims,\u201d said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International, in a press release following the decision on Monday.</p> \n  <p>With the law so restrictive, many women are forced to seek clandestine, illegal abortions. Over the last decade or so, Colombia has investigated 4,802 people for having or aiding in illegal abortions, according to the country\u2019s attorney general.

The country has been seized by mass demonstrations for for over 4 months. </p> \n  <p>Chile\u2019s women share the demands of their regional peers \u2014 legal abortion, against violence, against impunity for abusers, greater equality \u2014 on top of this we\u2019ll be seeing demands for justice for women who have been assaulted by the state. </p> \n  <p><em>Violence against women in Chile</em></p> \n  <p>Since October, when Chile\u2019s uprising first broke out, the National Human Rights Organization (INDH) are investigating 433 cases against state officials to women: 247 for torture and cruelty, 112 for torture with sexual violence, 20 for unnecessary violence, 3 for frustrated homicide. </p> \n  <p>The two cases of frustrated homicide against women I know of are of 15-year-old Geraldine Alvarado, who was in Santiago\u2019s main protest square Plaza Italia, 10 dec, when a tear gas canister was shot at her head. It left a wound so deep that her skull was exposed. She was left in a coma and was on the verge of death for 5 days. </p> \n  <p>Fabiola Campillai was waiting for a bus to work when police shot her directly in the face on 26 November. Her face was completely crushed by the impact, losing vision in both eyes and her sense of smell. She\u2019s had one high-risk surgery, and soon she will need another. Still no police officer has been named or brought to trial for what they did, speaking recently Fabiola said \u201cjustice would be for them to give me back my eyes. There will never be justice for what they did to me\u201d.</p> \n  <p><em>IWD march</em></p> \n  <p>Feminist groups have sent out guidelines and precautions to women about how to stay safe during the march. This includes bringing protective eye wear and tear gas masks. Bringing laurel water and sliced lemon for tear gas relief, Milk Of Magnesia for pepper spray. </p> \n  <p>I went to four hard wear stores yesterday and all the gas masks were sold out. In one store, a mother was buying protective wear for her daughter\u2019s first Women\u2019s Day march. She said her friend \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have to buy this so my daughter can protest safely\u201d. </p> \n  <p>The police are sending out women officers to guard the march, promising the event will be family friendly and safe. However protesters are highly distrustful of police. On Friday, a man died while protesting, caused by a tear gas canister impacting his head. <br></p> \n  <p>Women representing different causes will head today\u2019s march. There are representatives for trans and lesbians rights, for those representing victims of police oppression since October, migrant voices fighting against racism, sex worker groups. </p> \n  <p>All march for their own fights but unite against the violation of human rights inflicted by the state since October \u201cwe demand that they stop shooting at us mutilating us, raping us and commit to protecting humans rights\u201d, says march organiser, coordinadora 8m Santiago. </p> \n  <p>After the separatist segment of the march, all groups are welcome to join. Cis men, however, are discouraged from joining. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T14:16:29.484Z\">at 2.16pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e64f3438f087df56e4c47f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T13:31:59.428Z\">1.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Toledo, Spain</h2> \n  <p>A march is underway in Toledo, central Spain, creating a sea of purple.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8408b422f6aace2470c90d1a4322ac5e6f1594a9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8408b422f6aace2470c90d1a4322ac5e6f1594a9/0_250_3712_4640/800.jpg\" alt=\"General view of a march held to commemorate International Working Women\u2019s Day held in Toledo, central Spain, 08 March 2020.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">General view of a march held to commemorate International Working Women\u2019s Day held in Toledo, central Spain, 08 March 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ismael Herrero/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e64f1f98f08c2df6d2757d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T13:25:28.643Z\">1.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Paris, France</h2> \n  <p>Demonstrations are underway in the French capital.

      "bodyText": "Alright folks, we\u2019re signing off on what was an incredible International Women\u2019s Day. Thousands of women and allies gathered in cities across the world to protest for women\u2019s rights and protection against violence. Demonstrations were seen in over a dozen countries, from Pakistan to Argentina. For some, the risks of protesting were great. In many cities, women were often met with counter-protestors, sometimes in the form of riot police who used tear gas to disperse crowds. No matter the risk, women showed up and demanded to be heard, showing the fight for rights will continue well past this day for women. Bogot\u00e1, Colombia In Bogot\u00e1, Colombia\u2019s capital, today\u2019s demonstrations had a timely significance following the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision not to modify the restrictive abortion law last Monday. \u201cToday\u2019s marches show that the fight for our rights is not over,\u201d said Gina Borre, a pro-choice activist with the Viejas Verdes movement. \u201cEach year we are more united, more powerful.\u201d Demonstrators, many wearing green bandanas, gathered at the Centre for Peace and Memory near downtown Bogot\u00e1 on Sunday morning, before marching towards Parque Olaya in the city\u2019s south. \u201cThis is a debate that always gets politicized, and their are many powerful interests, like the catholic and evangelical churches,\u201d said Olga Amparo, the coordinator of local women\u2019s rights group Casa de la Mujer. \u201cBut we are talking about healthcare and rights - which are universal.\u201d Abortion is currently illegal in Colombia, except in cases where the life and health of the pregnant woman or the fetus are at risk, or in cases where the conception was the result of incest or rape. The court had an opportunity to loosen the law, though ultimately decided to maintain the status quo, disappointing watchdogs and activists across the region. \u201cBy failing to take this historic opportunity to move towards the decriminalization of abortion in Colombia, the Constitutional Court has turned its back on women and their struggle to end the cycle of violence and the control mechanisms of which they have been the victims,\u201d said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International, in a press release following the decision on Monday. With the law so restrictive, many women are forced to seek clandestine, illegal abortions. Over the last decade or so, Colombia has investigated 4,802 people for having or aiding in illegal abortions, according to the country\u2019s attorney general. Nearly 500 of those cases were women under 18 years old. \u201cOur bodies means our decisions,\u201d said Natalia L\u00f3pez, a student from Bogot\u00e1. \u201cThe fight goes on.\u201d Un Violador En Tu Camino \u2013 A Rapist In Your Path The anti-rape anthem, En Violador En Tu Camino, A Rapist In Your Path, became a viral phenomenon after it was first debuted by Chilean protestors in November. The anthem has since been performed across the globe, in front of presidential mansions to outside the courthouse where Harvey Weinstein was put on trial. The spread and impact of the anthem was clear on International Women\u2019s Day when women around the world stood in formation and performed the anthem, along with the choreography. Here are some images of women performing En Violador En Tu Camino across the world today. Police clash with protestors around the world While many of today\u2019s demonstrations have occurred peacefully, riot police in multiple cities have used forced against protestors in multiple cities. In Istanbul, Turkey, police dispersed tear gas into a crowd and pushed protestors away after local officials closed down streets leading to the city\u2019s main square. Police in Kyrgyzstan arrested several protestors after they clashed with a group of men in masks who started attacking demonstrators. Police say they arrested the women because they were causing public disruption. In Santiago, Chile, police had a full-on clash with protestors, using water hoses and tear gas in attempts to disperse crowds. Many women came prepared, wearing gas masks and even sling shots to fight back against the police. Sao Paulo, Brazil A huge demonstration in Sao Paulo has women protesting for women\u2019s rights and in criticism of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro for not responding to violence against women. In the beginning of 2019, four women in Brazil were being killed everyday. Bogot\u00e1, Colombia Marches swept Colombia on Sunday morning, with demonstrations taking place in city\u2019s across the Andean nation. In Bogot\u00e1, the capital, on a bright Sunday morning, thousands of people gathered at the Centre for Memory and Peace before making their way towards Parque Olaya, in the south of the city, where a market has been set up to raise funds for women\u2019s rights groups. \u201cWe are here to demand and end to the violence we face every day,\u201d said Carla P\u00e9rez, a public relations consultant. \u201cWe are here because the streets are ours.\u201d People were marching for various causes. Some protested the government\u2019s inability to protect female social leaders - who continue to be murdered at alarming rates. Others called for the relaxation of the country\u2019s restrictive abortion laws. Others took issue with the government\u2019s perceived slow-walking of the historic 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), a left rebel group. Colombia\u2019s conflict, in which 260,000 people were killed and over 7m displaced. Sexual violence was widespread, but amid massacres and mass kidnappings it tended to be ignored or met with impunity. \u201cViolence against women is systemic,\u201d said Angela Guerrero, a lawyer from Bogot\u00e1. \u201cToday we make ourselves heard.\u201d Meanwhile, Bogot\u00e1\u2019s newly elected mayor, Claudia Lopez - the city\u2019s first female mayor - gave a speech at the city\u2019s Parque Nacional across town. \u201cThe principal pandemic is brutal violence against women,\u201d she said to cheers. Santiago, Chile There are now clashes between police and protesters. Some girls told me that men are lighting barricades, provoking them. \u201cQue se vaya los machitos\u201d chant the women (get out, little men). Meanwhile women from Chile\u2019s frontline protesters move forward to confront the police. \u2018A Girl Inspiring the World\u2019 In honor of International Women\u2019s Day, British art group Sand In Your Eye made a 60-meter portrait of climate activist Greta Thunberg in Hebden Bridge earlier this week. The group worked with school children, who help the Sand In Your Eye artists with the portrait, which is made with line marker paint. Mexico City, Mexico From Maya Averbuch, who is in Mexico City: In front of Mexico\u2019s National Palace, women gathered in the morning to paint the names of victims of femicide since 2016. The used stencils to print the women\u2019s first names, from a list that included over 3,000. It was the first year they organized this protest action in the capital. Femicide, which is defined as killings of women because of their gender, has become a subject of debate in Mexico because of the rising number of dead. Last year, over 10 women were killed daily, in comparison with the six daily just three years earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s important for there to be a palace where the names of all the dead are visible,\u201d said Aurora Zarzosa, 50, one of the women who was painting. \u201cWe cannot pretend they do not exist.\u201d In recent months, women have protested not only against the fact that few of the perpetrators are ever convicted, but also that gruesome photos of the dead are printed in local newspapers. In Mexico City, the names \u2013 Diana, Rosario, Zoilae \u2013 appeared on the ground in all-white letters. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for the people who commit these crimes, because they do not have to pay a price,\u201d said Mariam Bujalil, 52. \u201cI never want to find my name here, or the names of my daughters, or of my granddaughters.\u201d Later, thousands of people marched through the historic center. In front of a pink monument of the Venus symbol that was erected in honor of victims of femicide, they took the microphone to call out people who had harmed them. Turning the private into the public was, at once, an act of catharsis, and a fierce rebuke. \u201cLast week, Citlali left the house to go to work,\u201d one woman said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible that they forced her into a car fifty meters from her office, and nobody in the hotel heard her screams.\u201d Much of the outcry this year was focused on physical violence: One woman called out the family member who had raped her as a child, another the man who had stabbed her sister, a third a university professors who told her she could not graduate unless she slept with him. Behind them, women who were walking toward the main plaza chanted slogans, as plumes of purple smoke rose from the crowds. A small portion of marchers graffitied statues and broke the glass covering advertisements on the sidewalk, as lines of police barricaded the entrance to historic sites. In the middle of the tumult, the women with the microphone also criticized those who failed to help them in the aftermath of crimes: the health system, for not covering the costs of psychological treatment; the government, for failing to investigate; and other women, for not believing their stories of abuse. \u201cHer daughter cries for her all the time,\u201d said Blanca Alicia Gomez Vargas, holding photos of her niece above her head. \u201cThey killed her in Quer\u00e9taro, which they say is a beautiful city.\u201d Santiago, Chile Here\u2019s a look at a huge group of women performing anti-rape anthem Un Violador en Tu Camino, A Rapist In Your Path, in Chile, where the viral anthem was created by Las Tesis, a Chilean feminist collective. Buenos Aires, Argentina Argentina is another country that has seen a dramatic rise in femicides recently. In the first two months of 2020, the country had 63 femicides. Today, protestors held red roses and signs with the names of women who were victims of femicide as they marched to the presidential palace in Buenos Aires. Mexico Protests are gearing up in Mexico and are focused on the country\u2019s alarming rate of femicides, gender-based murders of women. Last year over 1,000 of the country\u2019s murders were classified as femicides. Activists have been protesting for months, voicing their frustration over Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s underwhelming reaction to the murders. Today\u2019s demonstration will transition into a nationwide strike, where million of women are planning to stay home from work for 24 hours to protest the rise in violence. Read more about what\u2019s planned here: Amsterdam, the Netherlands A huge protest was held in celebration of International Women\u2019s Day in Amsterdam. Here\u2019s a look at the city\u2019s protest. Milan, Italy A small group of women in Milan, Italy (some wearing pink face masks) came out to show their support for International Women\u2019s Day, though huge chunks of northern Italy, including Milan, have been put under lockdown amid rapid spread of coronavirus in the country. Their signs read \u201cto all women\u201d and \u201cinternational day of beautiful women\u2019s rights\u201d. Santiago, Chile At the Presidential Palace, La Moneda, approximately 2 km from the main protest square, women from the Coordinadora 8m are performing A Rapist In Your Path on repeat. Written by Chilean activist group Las Tesis, women in Santiago are among the first women who performed the song, which has since gone viral across the world. \u201cThis is an emblematic place and the lyrics of the song speak about what is happening in there\u201d says Maria Victoria, one of the performers. They\u2019ve performed it 7 times so far today, under the scorching heat of Chile\u2019s capital. At the songs close protesters shout \u201cPinera murderer!\u201d and point toward the Palace. Hello everyone, this is Lauren Aratani in the US taking over. Demonstrations are still taking place all over the world. Here are some pictures of the massive protests that are happening in Chile. I\u2019m handing over to my colleagues in the US who will continue the blog from there. Thank you all for sharing your powerful photographs, and stories of your events. If you\u2019d like to see more of the powerful photographs from IWD around the world, take a look at our photo gallery here: Italy Whilst around a quarter of the Italian population is in lock down due to coronavirus, Italian President Sergio Mattarella released a video message in which he expressed regret at the need to avoid large-scale gatherings. He said he was giving \u201ca grateful thought to the women - and there are many - who are working in hospitals... in the red (quarantine) zones to fight the spread of the virus that worries us today.\u201d Paris, France Human rights groups and politicians have criticised alleged police violence at a women\u2019s march in Paris on the eve of IWD, after nine people were arrested during scuffles between police and protesters. Pictures on Twitter appeared to show marchers left battered and bruised. Paris mayor Paris Anne Hidalgo said she was shocked at the \u201cunacceptable and incomprehensible\u201d violence. She said she stood in solidarity with demonstrators. Europe Ecology-The Greens party secretary Julien Bayou described the events as: \u201cabsolutely unjustifiable police violence\u201d. Asia Whilst number of IWD events were cancelled across Asia due to the coronavirus, including South Korea which has the most severe outbreak outside of China. \u201cAlthough we can\u2019t be physically together, our minds for realising gender equality are stronger than ever,\u201d the country\u2019s gender equality minister Lee Jung-Ok said in a video message. However, marches took place in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, and Chinese state broadcaster CCTV took the opportunity to highlight the work of female medics tackling coronavirus. London, UK In London, the Women\u2019s Strike has just begun. It encourages women to withdraw all work - whether paid, or unpaid domestic work - on IWD. \u201cThe Women\u2019s Strike rejects the decades of economic inequality, criminalization and policing, racial and sexual violence, and endless global war and terrorism,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cThe Women\u2019s Strike is a strike for solidarity between women \u2013 women of colour, indigenous, working class, disabled, migrant, Muslim, lesbian, queer and trans women. On 8 March, in cities and towns across the UK we will meet each other on the streets and strike against a system of power that keep us isolated and divided from one another.\u201d \u201cWe say that when women stop, the world stops with us, so we\u2019re also saying that resisting women will change the world. We\u2019re not just in solidarity with each other here today, we\u2019re ready and we\u2019re starting a common struggle to make the twenty first century the era of women\u2019s liberation,\u201d said Elif Sarican, a Kurdish women\u2019s movement organiser and speaker at the protest. Manila, Philippines In the Philippines, feminist movements have linked up with anti-imperial movements, and dissidents against the Duterte regime. Hundreds took to the streets to call for an end to imperialism, and to Duterte\u2019s rule. A large effigy of President Rodrigo Duterte, who has been accused of misogyny, was also burnt. \u201cThe violence and poverty among women are getting worse,\u201d Joms Salvador of women\u2019s group Gabriela told AFP. \u201cWhile we have 37 laws related to women\u2019s rights, on the ground what is happening is a widespread violence in the forms of domestic abuse, sexual harassment and rape,\u201d he said. Berlin, Germany In the German capital, women have participated in a \u2018purple ride\u2019 - a bicycle demonstration. Edirne, Turkey Female asylum seekers who are waiting at Turkey\u2019s Pazarkule border crossing to reach Europe have staged a demonstration demanding the gate be opened on IWD. Chile Chile\u2019s main protest square, Plaza Dignidad, is now full\u2014 and the march hasn\u2019t even officially begun yet. There\u2019s a huge 8M flag, and women are spray painting signs on the roads. A woman is on top of the horse in the square\u2019s central statue of Baquedano. She\u2019s covering her eye, a tribute to over 400 victims who have had their eyes shot by police weapons since the unrest broke out in October. Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan Here is a video of the IWD protest in Kyrgyzstan, where predominantly female protesters were arrested after masked men attacked the demonstration. Glasgow, Scotland The Clydeside branch of the International Workers of the World Union have organised a demonstration in Glasgow. They are joined by the West Dumbartonshire branch of WASPI, Women Against State Pension Inequality, some of whom are dressed as suffragettes. Dhaka, Bangladesh In the early hours of the morning of March 8, women in Dhaka, Bangladesh held a candlelight vigil to mark IWD. Buenos Aires, Argentina The Argentine Armed Forces all-women orchestra played as part of IWD celebrations on March 6. The Women\u2019s Armed Forces Orchestra brings together officers from the Army, Navy and Air Force. Sydney, Australia IWD demonstrations also took place in Sydney, Australia. Lausanne, Switzerland On the eve of IWD, women in Switzerland took part in a flashmob. Yogyakarta, Indonesia Pakistan Marches have taken place in Pakistani cities to call for gender equality. In some areas, women are still put to death under ancient \u2018honour\u2019 codes. People all over the world are sharing photographs of themselves making an \u2018equal\u2019 sign with their arms, as part of the hashtag #EachforEqual, promoting gender inequality. Here is an Amnesty International community group based in Durban, South Africa, who have been operating for 30 year with members of all ages, right up to 89 year old Coral. Below is a Lean In circle in Penang, Malaysia. Lean In circles bring women from all backgrounds together and offer peer mentorship, skill development and a space to be \u201cunapologetically ambitious\u201d. There are 44,000 Lean in circles in more than 170 countries. Manchester, England A demonstration is taking place in Manchester with Sisters Not Strangers, a campaign led by refugee and asylum-seeking women, which aims to \u201cbuild solidarity for women who have come to the UK to seek safety but have instead been made destitute\u201d. The group are singing in the city\u2019s Piccadilly Gardens to mark IWD. Paris, France Women of General Confederation of Labour, a large labour union in France, have taken to the streets to demand equality, seemingly dressed like WWII feminist icon, Rosie the Riveter. Kyiv, Ukraine Demonstrations are also taking place in Kyiv, Ukraine. Activists are calling for an end to violence against women, and wider gender equality. Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia A march is taking place in Skopje, organised The Helsinki Committee for Human Rights of North Macedonia. The protest was created with the motto \u2018You are not guilty\u2019. Moscow, Russia A running event has been held on IWD in Moscow. Hundreds of men run with tulips and gift them to women on the finish line. Alongside the tulip races, a rally is taking place organised by the group of activists We Are Khachaturyan Sisters in Moscow\u2019s Sokolniki Hyde Park. Chile Chile\u2019s 8M comes at a politically tense time - amidst a social revolt and in the run up to a historic referendum vote in April to change the country\u2019s Pinochet-era constitution. The country has been seized by mass demonstrations for for over 4 months. Chile\u2019s women share the demands of their regional peers \u2014 legal abortion, against violence, against impunity for abusers, greater equality \u2014 on top of this we\u2019ll be seeing demands for justice for women who have been assaulted by the state. Violence against women in Chile Since October, when Chile\u2019s uprising first broke out, the National Human Rights Organization (INDH) are investigating 433 cases against state officials to women: 247 for torture and cruelty, 112 for torture with sexual violence, 20 for unnecessary violence, 3 for frustrated homicide. The two cases of frustrated homicide against women I know of are of 15-year-old Geraldine Alvarado, who was in Santiago\u2019s main protest square Plaza Italia, 10 dec, when a tear gas canister was shot at her head. It left a wound so deep that her skull was exposed. She was left in a coma and was on the verge of death for 5 days. Fabiola Campillai was waiting for a bus to work when police shot her directly in the face on 26 November. Her face was completely crushed by the impact, losing vision in both eyes and her sense of smell. She\u2019s had one high-risk surgery, and soon she will need another. Still no police officer has been named or brought to trial for what they did, speaking recently Fabiola said \u201cjustice would be for them to give me back my eyes. There will never be justice for what they did to me\u201d. IWD march Feminist groups have sent out guidelines and precautions to women about how to stay safe during the march. This includes bringing protective eye wear and tear gas masks. Bringing laurel water and sliced lemon for tear gas relief, Milk Of Magnesia for pepper spray. I went to four hard wear stores yesterday and all the gas masks were sold out. In one store, a mother was buying protective wear for her daughter\u2019s first Women\u2019s Day march. She said her friend \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have to buy this so my daughter can protest safely\u201d. The police are sending out women officers to guard the march, promising the event will be family friendly and safe. However protesters are highly distrustful of police. On Friday, a man died while protesting, caused by a tear gas canister impacting his head. Women representing different causes will head today\u2019s march. There are representatives for trans and lesbians rights, for those representing victims of police oppression since October, migrant voices fighting against racism, sex worker groups. All march for their own fights but unite against the violation of human rights inflicted by the state since October \u201cwe demand that they stop shooting at us mutilating us, raping us and commit to protecting humans rights\u201d, says march organiser, coordinadora 8m Santiago. After the separatist segment of the march, all groups are welcome to join. Cis men, however, are discouraged from joining. Toledo, Spain A march is underway in Toledo, central Spain, creating a sea of purple. Paris, France Demonstrations are underway in the French capital. A number of Mexican women are there protesting against femicide in Mexico. Baghdad, Iraq A demonstration is taking place in the capital of Baghdad to call for gender equality. If you\u2019re on the go, but still want to mark IWD, here\u2019s some podcast suggestions from Miranda Sawyer. This from Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent: Hundreds of rallies and demonstrations are kicking off across Spain, which has seen huge crowds gather to mark International Women\u2019s Day over recent years. Nationwide events are going ahead despite the coronavirus alert, although Spain\u2019s health authorities have asked people showing symptoms consistent with the virus to stay at home. Protests are due to be held in all the country\u2019s big cities and towns including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Granada, Bilbao, Palma de Mallorca, Valladolid and Santander. Fourteen women have been murdered by their partners in Spain so far this year, while 99 died at the hands of their partners in 2019. Since the government began recording gender-based violence deaths in 2003, a total of 1,047 women have been murdered. Organisers and campaigners have urged women across Spain to take to the streets \u201cto demand that the state, the Catholic hierarchy, the patriarchal powers - both economic and political - and the sexist culture (of our friends, fathers, brothers and neighbours) respect our autonomy and freedom to take decisions when it comes to our sexuality, our bodies and our life plans\u201d. Today\u2019s manifesto also roundly rejects those who seek to use women\u2019s rights as a means to justify violence against women. \u201cWe reject the use people make of the rights of women, lesbians and trans people to favour and legitimise racist and reactionary policies and discourses,\u201d it reads. \u201cWe want all of us to be free.\u201d Spain\u2019s equality minister, Irene Montero, tweeted: \u201cToday we are taking to the streets because they belong to us, too, and so that we can live free of sexist violence, so that we can share out time, riches and care provision, and so that we can love whoever we want and be whoever we want. We are doing it for those who came before and those who will coe in the future.\u201d Earlier on Sunday, Spain\u2019s health minister, Salvador Illa, called on anyone who thought they may have the coronavirus to \u201cavoid the demonstrations, stay home and self-isolate\u201d. London, UK Demonstrators from climate activist group Extinction Rebellion have been protesting in London for IWD, arguing that the \u201cclimate is a women\u2019s issue.\u201d Thirty one women formed a topless chain blocking Waterloo Bridge in London, with the words \u2018Climate Rape\u2019, \u2018Climate Murder\u2019, \u2018Climate Abuse\u2019, \u2018Climate Inequality\u2019 and \u2018Climate Justice\u2019 written on their bodies. The group said the action was to highlight \u201cthe disproportionate impact of the climate and ecological emergency on women, and the resulting increase in hardship, violence and rape.\u201d \u201cThe UK action is in solidarity with everyone on the streets for International Women\u2019s Day with the message that \u2018climate is a women\u2019s issue\u2019 and calls on women in the UK to recognise this is happening to our sisters in the global south now and will be a reality faced by all women if decisive action is not taken,\u201d a statement added. They chose Waterloo Bridge because of its nickname of \u2018The Ladies Bridge\u2019, as many of the welders, stonemasons and labourers that built the bridge during the second world war were women. The action in the UK is part of a wave of Extinction Rebellion IWD, spanning Colombia, Spain, Turkey, The Gambia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Uganda, DRC, Belgium, Israel, The Philippines, Switzerland, Argentina and the UK. Sarah Mintram, former teacher and member of the Extinction Rebellion International Support Team, who took part in the action in London, said: \u201cIt\u2019s mainly women in poorer countries in the global south that are experiencing the increase in violence but this will be the reality for all women if the climate and ecological crisis continues to go unaddressed.\u201d \u201cWe are here to raise the alarm about what is happening to our sisters around the world and to tell women in the UK the climate and ecological emergency is your issue \u2013 it will affect you as a woman if we do not persuade our government to take urgent action starting now.\u201d Baghdad, Iraq Celebrations have been taking place in Tahrir Square in the capital of Baghdad to mark IWD. Some were seen wearing face masks, seemingly in response to fears around coronavirus. Iraq currently has 47 confirmed cases, and four deaths from the virus. Scandinavia, Finland, and Iceland The Prime Ministers of Iceland, Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden have released a joint statement reaffirming their commitments to gender equality. The statement also highlights their \u201cgrave concern over the current pushback against women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights\u201d and calls on other world leaders to reject this. \u201cWe have witnessed a surge in regressive policies around the world, often undermining universal human rights,\u201d it says. You can read the full statement here. Iceland has topped the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Report for the past 11 years, with Nordic countries making up four of the top five gender equal countries. London, UK The March4Women is set to kick off in an hour\u2019s time in the British capital. The march combines feminist and climate movements, and will be joined by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan. Musicians and actors including Emeli Sand\u00e9, who will perform, and the Kaiser Chief\u2019s Ricky Wilson will be in attendance, as will activists including Sandi Toksvig, Bianca Jagger and Helen Pankhurst. The March4Women aims to spotlight on the women on the front lines of the climate crisis, and call for action from world leaders. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: \u201cI\u2019m proud to be marching alongside women and allies this International Women\u2019s Day. The gender inequality we still see in our city, country and globally is unacceptable. \u201cAs Mayor, and as a proud feminist, I\u2019m determined that no woman or girl should be disadvantaged just because of their gender and want London to lead the way in changing that.\u201d It will begin with an opening rally at Royal Festival Hall, as part of the Women of the World festival, and will march over the river Thames, meet crowds at Whitehall place, before moving to Parliament Square for music and a final rally. A new campaign to promote the National Domestic Abuse Helpline has been launched in the UK on IWD, with the support of celebrities including Olivia Coleman and Lorraine Kelly. The helpline\u2019s campaign has been launched by the charity Refuge, who provide specialist support for women and children experiencing domestic violence. They want every woman to know the number of the National Domestic Abuse Helpline, 0808 2000 247, and the charity will be projecting it on to the largest advertising display in Europe, London\u2019s Piccadilly lights, at midday. TV presenter Lorraine Kelly said: \u201cIt is a disgrace that in 2020 we live in a world where so many women experience domestic abuse - the numbers are shocking. No woman should live in fear. That needs to change - today.\u201d Kelly and Coleman have both changed the pictures on their social media profiles to the helpline, to help promote it. Chief executive of Refuge Sandra Horley said: \u201cRefuge\u2019s freephone 24 hour national domestic abuse helpline is at the heart of how this country responds to domestic abuse - it is a lifeline to hundreds of thousands of women across the country. \u201c0808 2000 247 is a number that every woman should know. Today, International Women\u2019s Day, Refuge and an amazing band of high-profile women will work to make this a reality. Women\u2019s lives depend on it.\u201d It is estimated that one in three women experience some form of domestic abuse in their lifetimes. Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan Dozens of protesters, mostly female, have been arrested at a rally calling for gender equality in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, after masked men attacked them and tore up their placards. The detentions came after the men wearing face masks and pointed national hats attacked the crowd, tearing up their posters, popping balloons with toy pistols and throwing eggs at the women before fleeing the scene, AFP report. Erlan Atantayev, deputy head of the Sverdlovsky police department where the women were taken, told AFP that the protesters had been arrested for their own safety, and because police had not been informed about the rally beforehand. \u201cClashes began between the demonstrators and men wearing the face masks,\u201d said Atantayev. \u201cWe detained (the women) for violation of public order.\u201d He added that some demonstrators could face fines for resisting arrest, and that police were conducting \u201cexplanatory work\u201d with the protesters they had detained. Police also detained three male attackers but allegedly did not chase after those who ran away. Journalist Nurjamal Djanibekova told AFP that one of the attackers broke her phone to stop her from filming the attack. She said that 70 people were being held in the Sverdlovsky police station. A ban was placed on demonstrations in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, apparently to stop the spread of coronavirus. However, this was later lifted after the city administration withdrew their request. David Schneider, co-writer of the screenplay for critically acclaimed comedy Death of Stalin, has poked fun at those complaining about the existence of IWD. Australia The Australian government has announced a number of new policies to support women in an IWD announcement. The federal government revealed the identity of the country\u2019s first Ambassador for Gender Equality. The role will be held by Julie-Ann Guivarra, a senior career officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and replaces the role of Ambassador for Women and Girls, a position that had been held by former Liberal MP Sharman Stone since 2017. As part of her role, Ms Guivarra will \u201cwork to ensure that gender equality, and empowerment of women and girls, is a central focus of Australia\u2019s diplomatic, development, and regional security efforts,\u201d Minister for Women, Senator Payne, said. The government has also pledged $20 million into an interest-free loan program to help victims of domestic violence pay for basic goods, such as furniture and bills. The scheme would make loans of up to $2000 available to women who have experienced domestic violence, Social Services Minister Anne Ruston announced on this years IWD day. \u201cWomen leaving violence often face financial hardship and we hope these loans go some way to help them meet the costs of the basics,\u201d she said. The announcement also revealed that women leaving abusive relationships would be given individual financial counsellors to help them get back on track. The government also said it would be providing $2.8 million over two years for local support services in each state and territory, including shelters and crisis help. Senator Ruston said with Sunday marking International Women\u2019s Day, it was important for Australians to reflect on what they could to stop family violence. \u201cWe should be ashamed of ourselves in Australia that we have the kind of domestic violence perpetration that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d she told Sky News. \u201cUntil we change people\u2019s behaviour, we\u2019re just going to be responding to domestic violence and we have to start preventing it.\u201d Paris, France Members of the women\u2019s movement FEMEN have staged a protest on the Place de la Concorde in Paris, calling for an end to patriarchy. The demonstration appears to reference the current outbreak of coronavirus, with some placards saying \u201cstop the patriarchal virus\u201d and \u201cstop the patriarchal pandemic\u201d. Whilst topless, the activists\u2019 outfits resemble hazmat suits. Russia The youth section of Russia\u2019s ruling party, United Russia Young Guard, has organised marches marking IWD. Want to celebrate IWD from the comfort of your sofa? My colleague Guy Lodge has compiled the best films to watch this IWD, celebrating the work of female directors. Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan A demonstration on Victory Square in the capital of Bishkek has led to the arrest of several protesters from the women\u2019s movement, FEMEN. FEMEN are known around the world for their protests, which are usually conducted topless by women with slogans written across their bodies. In 2015, studies showed that 11,800 women in Kyrgyzstan are kidnapped to be married, a process known as bride kidnapping, every year. One fifth of these are victims of violence including rape. You can read more about gender inequality and the fight against it in Kyrgyzstan and other former USSR countries in this article from Joanna Lillis, published on IWD five years ago. Chile More than a million women in Chile are set to take to the streets today, as IWD demonstrations build on a wave of social unrest that took off in October last year. The unrest began in response to rising metro fares, but has grown to address wider issues of social injustice, inequality and costs of living. You can read more about the social movement erupting in Chile, and its impact on IWD, from Charis McGowan here: Mexico City, Mexico Femicides in Mexico have more than doubled in the past five years, and this is set to be a theme of IWD events in the country. A march in Mexico\u2019s capital is expected to bring record numbers of women on to the streets. They\u2019re heading to the public square across from the national palace to call for an end to violence against women. \u201cI\u2019m going to march for each and every woman in this country, for the dead and the living, for the victims of violence,\u201d Carmen Rojas, 52, in Mexico City, told Reuters. \u201cWe have to raise our voices.\u201d Yesterday, on the eve of IWD, around 200 protesters made a \u201cfeminist chain\u201d in Mexico City to protest against gender-based violence. Hello, and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s coverage of International Women\u2019s Day (IWD) 2020. We\u2019ll be looking at the IWD events taking place around the world. If you\u2019re celebrating, protesting, or hosting, let us know! You can tweet me @mollyblackall. What is IWD? According to the United Nations, who sponsor the event, IWD is \u201cis a time to reflect on progress made, to call for change and to celebrate acts of courage and determination by ordinary women, who have played an extraordinary role in the history of their countries and communities.\u201d IWD has taken place each year on March 8 since 1977, when the UN General Assembly invited member states to announce the day as the UN Day for women\u2019s rights and world peace. This year\u2019s theme is \u201cI am Generation Equality: Realizing women\u2019s rights\u201d. UN coverage of the day highlights the obstacles still faced by women around the world, reminding us that women earn 23% less than men globally, and make up just 24% of parliamentary seats worldwide.",

      "body": "<p>For over 30 years, Joyce Barnes has worked as a home healthcare aide in Richmond, Virginia, without any paid sick days. She makes $8.25 an hour and often works through illnesses because she can\u2019t afford to lose income from taking the time off.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford to miss pay so I have gone to work before several times sick as a dog, masked up so my patients wouldn\u2019t catch what I have,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cEvery day I pray and I ask God to give me strength that I won\u2019t get sick so I can keep on making it and that\u2019s the way we have to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Last July, Barnes contracted an illness from one of her patients that caused her a stay in a hospital for over a week. She relied on family members to help with bills to make up for the income she lost from missing work, and still has to make regular monthly payments toward the thousands of dollars of medical debt she accrued, despite having health insurance.</p> <p>\u201cI have a lot of medical debt I have to pay. They had to do a test on my stomach when I was sick. That one test cost me $3,000 and I\u2019m still paying it because I can\u2019t afford to pay everything back,\u201d Barnes added.</p> <p>As the coronavirus outbreak (Covid-19) has begun to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6908e1.htm\">spread</a> through the US, millions of low-wage workers in service industries are left vulnerable due to lack of proper medical benefits and paid sick leave.

      "bodyText": "For over 30 years, Joyce Barnes has worked as a home healthcare aide in Richmond, Virginia, without any paid sick days. She makes $8.25 an hour and often works through illnesses because she can\u2019t afford to lose income from taking the time off. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to miss pay so I have gone to work before several times sick as a dog, masked up so my patients wouldn\u2019t catch what I have,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cEvery day I pray and I ask God to give me strength that I won\u2019t get sick so I can keep on making it and that\u2019s the way we have to do it.\u201d Last July, Barnes contracted an illness from one of her patients that caused her a stay in a hospital for over a week. She relied on family members to help with bills to make up for the income she lost from missing work, and still has to make regular monthly payments toward the thousands of dollars of medical debt she accrued, despite having health insurance. \u201cI have a lot of medical debt I have to pay. They had to do a test on my stomach when I was sick. That one test cost me $3,000 and I\u2019m still paying it because I can\u2019t afford to pay everything back,\u201d Barnes added. As the coronavirus outbreak (Covid-19) has begun to spread through the US, millions of low-wage workers in service industries are left vulnerable due to lack of proper medical benefits and paid sick leave. There are growing concerns that these workers will be extra vulnerable to the disease themselves, or, due to lack of health insurance and poverty, help its spread by continuing to work while ill. More than 32 million workers in the US have no paid sick days off, and low-wage workers are least likely to have paid sick time.

The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, called it \u201cEurope\u2019s man on the moon moment\u201d. Nothing similar has been attempted before, as the pattern of human progress since the industrial revolution has been one of relentless exploitation and despoilment of the natural world, filling the atmosphere with carbon and the seas with plastic.</p> <p>Nearly every major aspect of the European economy will have to be overhauled, from energy generation to food consumption, from transport to manufacturing and construction. In part, this will build on two decades of work in a few of these sectors, such as directives mandating renewable energy and cutting air pollution.</p> <p>Previous attempts were piecemeal, limited in scope and sometimes flaccid in execution. Energy-intensive industries, for instance, have been covered by an emissions trading scheme since 2005, but political pressure kept the price of carbon low, rendering it largely ineffectual.</p> <h2>How will it work?</h2> <p>The green deal will work through a framework of regulation and legislation setting clear overarching targets \u2013 a bloc-wide goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and a 50%-55% cut in emissions by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels) are supposed to be at the core \u2013 alongside incentives to encourage private sector investment, with action plans for key sectors and goals such as halting species loss, cutting waste and better use of natural resources.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-05T15:53:19/embed.html\" data-alt=\"chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-05T15:53:19/embed.html\">chart</a> </figure>  <p>All of the EU\u2019s budget will be subject to checks to ensure it is spent in ways that benefit the environment. That includes the common agricultural policy, scorned by green campaigners for promoting intensive farming, which will retain farm subsidies but direct more to green measures. Science, research and development budgets will take on more of a low-carbon slant, and there will be a detailed roadmap of \u201c50 actions for 2050\u201d for other sectors.</p> <p>Jobs will be created, the commission believes, in new high-tech industries from renewable energy to electric vehicle manufacturing and sustainable building, and efficiencies in resource use will repay the cost of the changes. \u201cThe European green deal is our new growth strategy \u2013 a strategy for growth that gives back more than it takes away,\u201d von der Leyen said.</p> <h2>What is the legal basis?</h2> <p>All of this will require myriad changes and detailed measures, which will have to pass through tortuous EU processes, requiring the approval of all member states and parliament, so the details will inevitably be subject to horse-trading and backroom deals.</p> <p>East European states have been promised financial incentives, as their economies are more fossil fuel dependent. The backing of the UK \u2013 which despite covertly watering down some measures in the past has broadly pushed for the low-carbon agenda \u2013 will be missed, predicts Jean Lambert, the former Green party MEP.</p> <p>The new European parliament also has more rightwing MEPs, so it may be harder to pass some measures, she says. The hole that Brexit has created in the EU budget will also be hard to fill.</p> <p>But what is clear is that the incoming presidency under von der Leyen and her vice-president, Frans Timmermans \u2013 charged with delivering the green deal \u2013 will throw all of its might behind the effort. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be straightforward to get all this through,\u201d says Tom Burke, co-founder of the environmental group E3G. \u201cIt will be a typical EU process. But it has become the touchstone issue for this commission.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7564b0a99db119b122cfb0db2eba11c9896bbe03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7564b0a99db119b122cfb0db2eba11c9896bbe03/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"What is the European Green Deal?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Will the green deal make a difference?</h2> <p>It needs to. Europe has cut emissions by roughly one quarter since 1990 \u2013 good but nowhere near enough to put the bloc on track to net zero by mid-century. Current measures will not suffice for that \u2013 disruptive change is required, which is why the green deal targets are key.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-05T15:55:40/embed.html\" data-alt=\"chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-05T15:55:40/embed.html\">chart</a> </figure>  <p>On other environmental scores, the EU\u2019s record is mixed. There have been vast improvements in areas such as air and water quality across EU states, western and eastern, in the past five decades, spurred by EU regulations since the 1980s.

Economists at the Bruegel thinktank say it is a stretch to consider the \u20ac503bn from the EU budget as \u201cgreen investment\u201d, as much of the money would be spent on traditional EU policies such as farm subsidies. Previous attempts to \u201cgreen\u201d the common agricultural policy have failed dismally. In a damning report in 2017, the EU\u2019s auditors<a href=\"https://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/INSR17_21/INSR_GREENING_EN.pdf\"> highlighted</a> how farmers were being paid to undertake environmentally friendly measures they would have done anyway, such as crop rotation, while governments handed out \u201cgreen\u201d cash with little oversight.</p> <p>Others fear that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/19/european-green-deal-polish-miners\"> carbon financiers will game the system</a>, meaning EU cash fails to trigger truly green investment from the private sector. And don\u2019t forget, EU governments last month failed to agree a new seven-year budget, with four \u201cfrugal\u201d net payers leading the charge to cut EU spending. The \u20ac503bn is not even in the bank.</p> <p>Even if the EU realised its \u20ac1tn plan, it wouldn\u2019t be enough. Bruegel argues the \u20ac1tn is only one third of what is needed, if the EU follows through with the commission\u2019s plan to reduce European greenhouse gas emissions by up to 55% by 2030. Meanwhile, critics in eastern countries complain there is not enough money to help coal regions. In 2015 there were 128 coal mines alone in the EU employing more than 238,000 people from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/26/spain-to-close-most-coal-mines-after-striking-250m-deal\">Arag\u00f3n</a> to Silesia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed054ca77c4077958a8d6d8ff654e3943dc5fb9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed054ca77c4077958a8d6d8ff654e3943dc5fb9b/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cows\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Why does the green deal matter internationally?</h2> <p>This year \u2013 coronavirus permitting \u2013 will see the most important international climate meeting since the landmark Paris agreement was signed in 2015. Then, all of the world\u2019s functioning states signed up to hold global temperature rises to no more than 2C, and preferably to below 1.5C, beyond which the ravages of climate breakdown become catastrophic and irreversible.</p> <p>But the national pledges made at Paris on curbing greenhouse gases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/world-on-track-for-3c-of-warming-under-current-global-climate-pledges-warns-un\">fell short of what is required to stay below 2C</a>, and since 2015 the world\u2019s carbon output has risen by 4%. At the Cop26 climate talks, to be held in Glasgow this November, nations are supposed to come up with tougher targets for 2030, and preferably also with goals for reaching net zero emissions by mid-century, or soon after.</p> <p>But enthusiasm has ebbed since Paris, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/04/donald-trump-climate-crisis-exit-paris-agreement\">Donald Trump\u2019s US</a>, to Brazil, India and big oil producers such as Russia and Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>The key player will be China, the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and second biggest economy. At Paris, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/30/obama-calls-paris-climate-talks-an-act-defiance-wake-recent-attacks\">pact between the US and China</a> was the core of the deal. This time, the EU must bring China to the table alone.</p> <p>\u201cEU climate leadership [in the form of] the green deal is crucial to putting pressure on China and other major emitters to make more ambitious climate commitments,\u201d says Paul Bledsoe, a climate adviser in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House, who has attended more than a dozen climate negotiations since the 1990s. \u201cIn the face of Trump\u2019s climate nihilism, only the EU can show that the world\u2019s largest economy can decarbonise while continuing to provide a high standard of living for its 500 million people.\u201d</p> <h2>What do critics say?</h2> <p>The EU will face a backlash from its citizens, fuelled by populist politicians, for persisting with green policies, predicts Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform thinktank.</p> <p>He points to the gilets jaunes protests in France, which took off after rises in fuel taxes intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and the rise of the AFD in Germany. \u201cThe AFD is fuelled partly by climate scepticism. Populists are keen to promote anti-greenery, as they listen to voters,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe green agenda will meet more and more opposition as voters start to realise it will make them poorer and affect their lifestyles, and they will worry about Europe becoming less competitive than, say, India and China, which won\u2019t be going carbon-neutral,\u201d says Grant. \u201cThis will increase the electoral strength of populists.\u201d</p> <p>Some leftwing campaigners have also attacked the plans. Taking issue with the \u201cjust transition\u201d mechanism, Yanis Varoufakis and David Adler of the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/eu-green-deal-greenwash-ursula-von-der-leyen-climate\">wrote in the Guardian</a>: \u201cWill there be justice for the communities across Germany and France that have been asked to shoulder the costs of the climate transition? Does it speak to the swathes of Greek or Portuguese people who cannot afford to care about carbon emissions in 2050, preoccupied as they are with making ends meet this week? The stark answer is no.\u201d</p> <h2>Will the UK be affected?</h2> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s government has made it clear that the UK wants to depart from EU environmental standards after Brexit. The post-Brexit environment bill, agriculture bill and fisheries bill now going through the British parliament contain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/these-three-post-brexit-bills-bulldoze-a-hole-through-environmental-protections\">various loopholes</a> that green campaigners say would reduce in the UK the environmental protections that current EU law guarantees.</p> <p>The UK does officially have a 25-year environment plan, with the government pledging to leave the UK\u2019s natural realm in a better state than this generation inherited, but how that will hold up after Brexit is moot.</p> <p>On the climate crisis, the UK is aligned with the EU. Last summer, a target of reaching net zero by 2050 was enshrined in law, and all major parties are pledged to uphold it. What\u2019s missing, though, is a clear plan of action to meet the net zero aim. That is what Europe\u2019s green deal is meant to provide, and unless the UK forms its own parallel plans soon, its 2050 target will look increasingly adrift.</p> <h2><strong>Who are the green agitators in Europe?</strong></h2> <p>The idea of a Green New Deal has been kicking around US politics since at least 2006. The European Green Deal (minus the word \u201cnew\u2019 with its radical overtones) is not yet one year old. The EU plan resulted when an unexpected political leader collided with newly-elected MEPs, energised by the global climate movement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=From%20coal%20to%20climate%20emergency&amp;description=The%20European%20project%20was%20forged%20in%20%3Cstrong%3Ecoal%20and%20steel%3C%2Fstrong%3E.%20By%202050%20-%20almost%20a%20century%20after%20the%20creation%20of%20the%20European%20Coal%20and%20Steel%20Community%20in%201951%20-%20the%20EU%20hopes%20to%20be%20all%20but%20free%20of%20fossil%20fuels.%20%0AGreen%20issues%20have%20never%20been%20this%20high%20on%20the%20agenda.%20The%20green%20deal%20is%20seen%20not%20just%20as%20a%20new%20strategy%20for%20economic%20growth%2C%20but%20a%20%3Cstrong%3Epeople%20pleaser%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20too.%20The%20EU%E2%80%99s%20in-house%20polling%20group%20Eurobarometer%20found%20in%202019%20that%20Europeans%20rated%20climate%20change%20as%20the%20second%20most%20serious%20problem%20in%20the%20world.%0ABut%20the%20EU%20has%20been%20here%20before.%20In%202008%20the%20then%20European%20commission%20president%20declared%20the%20EU%20was%20%E2%80%9Ctaking%20the%20lead%E2%80%9D%20on%20climate%20change%20with%20a%20plan%20to%20%E2%80%9Ctransform%20Europe%20into%20a%20low-carbon%20economy%E2%80%9D.%20Everyone%20watched%20%3Cstrong%3EAn%20Inconvenient%20Truth%3C%2Fstrong%3E.%20Everyone%20quoted%20%3Cstrong%3ENicholas%20Stern%E2%80%99s%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20landmark%20report%20on%20the%20cost%20of%20climate%20change.%20Then%20stock%20markets%20crashed%20and%20so%20did%20the%20climate%20imperative.%20Could%20it%20happen%20again%3F%20%E2%80%9CThat%20is%20my%20worry%20exactly%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20one%20EU%20official.%20In%202006-8%20%E2%80%9Cyou%20saw%20politicians%2C%20especially%20in%20the%20European%20continent%20moving%20towards%20a%20new%20priority%20in%20climate.%20And%20that%20was%20great%2C%20up%20until%20%3Cstrong%3ELehman%20Brothers%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20fell.%E2%80%9D&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"box\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=From%20coal%20to%20climate%20emergency&description=The%20European%20project%20was%20forged%20in%20%3Cstrong%3Ecoal%20and%20steel%3C%2Fstrong%3E.%20By%202050%20-%20almost%20a%20century%20after%20the%20creation%20of%20the%20European%20Coal%20and%20Steel%20Community%20in%201951%20-%20the%20EU%20hopes%20to%20be%20all%20but%20free%20of%20fossil%20fuels.%20%0AGreen%20issues%20have%20never%20been%20this%20high%20on%20the%20agenda.%20The%20green%20deal%20is%20seen%20not%20just%20as%20a%20new%20strategy%20for%20economic%20growth%2C%20but%20a%20%3Cstrong%3Epeople%20pleaser%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20too.%20The%20EU%E2%80%99s%20in-house%20polling%20group%20Eurobarometer%20found%20in%202019%20that%20Europeans%20rated%20climate%20change%20as%20the%20second%20most%20serious%20problem%20in%20the%20world.%0ABut%20the%20EU%20has%20been%20here%20before.%20In%202008%20the%20then%20European%20commission%20president%20declared%20the%20EU%20was%20%E2%80%9Ctaking%20the%20lead%E2%80%9D%20on%20climate%20change%20with%20a%20plan%20to%20%E2%80%9Ctransform%20Europe%20into%20a%20low-carbon%20economy%E2%80%9D.%20Everyone%20watched%20%3Cstrong%3EAn%20Inconvenient%20Truth%3C%2Fstrong%3E.%20Everyone%20quoted%20%3Cstrong%3ENicholas%20Stern%E2%80%99s%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20landmark%20report%20on%20the%20cost%20of%20climate%20change.%20Then%20stock%20markets%20crashed%20and%20so%20did%20the%20climate%20imperative.%20Could%20it%20happen%20again%3F%20%E2%80%9CThat%20is%20my%20worry%20exactly%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20one%20EU%20official.%20In%202006-8%20%E2%80%9Cyou%20saw%20politicians%2C%20especially%20in%20the%20European%20continent%20moving%20towards%20a%20new%20priority%20in%20climate.%20And%20that%20was%20great%2C%20up%20until%20%3Cstrong%3ELehman%20Brothers%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20fell.%E2%80%9D&link=false\">box</a> </figure>  <p>Von der Leyen, a German defence minister, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/02/ursula-von-der-leyen-merkel-ally-and-brexit-critic-set-for-eu-top-job\">a surprise choice to become European commission president</a>, leapfrogging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/13/manfred-who-weber-toils-raise-profile-race-top-eu-post\">candidates</a> who had run in the European elections in May.

Von der Leyen\u2019s last-minute elevation angered the European parliament, pressuring her to lean to the left, liberals and Greens to gain support. To win MEPs over, she promised a European Green Deal within 100 days of taking office.</p> <p>Beyond the Brussels power play, politicians were responding to the streets, as school children walked out of their classrooms, demanding action. The school strike was personal. Chief executives, heads of government and senior UN officials told EU officials their children were asking what they were doing to save the planet.

At least eight countries, including Spain, Sweden and Latvia, want the EU to increase its 2030 emissions reduction target. Poland and Hungary think that is too much. Divisions will also come when hard choices have to be made: from closing coal mines, demanding more from farmers, to tougher emissions standards for the car industry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b09638b149f4d303511e25cc6690077e5217d1fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b09638b149f4d303511e25cc6690077e5217d1fa/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"cars\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>What role will the European parliament play in the green deal?</strong></h2> <p>EU governments agree environmental laws with the European parliament.

      "bodyText": "What is Europe\u2019s green deal? The European Green Deal aims to transform the 27-country bloc from a high- to a low-carbon economy, without reducing prosperity and while improving people\u2019s quality of life, through cleaner air and water, better health and a thriving natural world. If that sounds ambitious, it is. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, called it \u201cEurope\u2019s man on the moon moment\u201d. Nothing similar has been attempted before, as the pattern of human progress since the industrial revolution has been one of relentless exploitation and despoilment of the natural world, filling the atmosphere with carbon and the seas with plastic. Nearly every major aspect of the European economy will have to be overhauled, from energy generation to food consumption, from transport to manufacturing and construction. In part, this will build on two decades of work in a few of these sectors, such as directives mandating renewable energy and cutting air pollution. Previous attempts were piecemeal, limited in scope and sometimes flaccid in execution. Energy-intensive industries, for instance, have been covered by an emissions trading scheme since 2005, but political pressure kept the price of carbon low, rendering it largely ineffectual. How will it work? The green deal will work through a framework of regulation and legislation setting clear overarching targets \u2013 a bloc-wide goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and a 50%-55% cut in emissions by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels) are supposed to be at the core \u2013 alongside incentives to encourage private sector investment, with action plans for key sectors and goals such as halting species loss, cutting waste and better use of natural resources. All of the EU\u2019s budget will be subject to checks to ensure it is spent in ways that benefit the environment. That includes the common agricultural policy, scorned by green campaigners for promoting intensive farming, which will retain farm subsidies but direct more to green measures. Science, research and development budgets will take on more of a low-carbon slant, and there will be a detailed roadmap of \u201c50 actions for 2050\u201d for other sectors. Jobs will be created, the commission believes, in new high-tech industries from renewable energy to electric vehicle manufacturing and sustainable building, and efficiencies in resource use will repay the cost of the changes. \u201cThe European green deal is our new growth strategy \u2013 a strategy for growth that gives back more than it takes away,\u201d von der Leyen said. What is the legal basis? All of this will require myriad changes and detailed measures, which will have to pass through tortuous EU processes, requiring the approval of all member states and parliament, so the details will inevitably be subject to horse-trading and backroom deals. East European states have been promised financial incentives, as their economies are more fossil fuel dependent. The backing of the UK \u2013 which despite covertly watering down some measures in the past has broadly pushed for the low-carbon agenda \u2013 will be missed, predicts Jean Lambert, the former Green party MEP. The new European parliament also has more rightwing MEPs, so it may be harder to pass some measures, she says. The hole that Brexit has created in the EU budget will also be hard to fill. But what is clear is that the incoming presidency under von der Leyen and her vice-president, Frans Timmermans \u2013 charged with delivering the green deal \u2013 will throw all of its might behind the effort. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be straightforward to get all this through,\u201d says Tom Burke, co-founder of the environmental group E3G. \u201cIt will be a typical EU process. But it has become the touchstone issue for this commission.\u201d Will the green deal make a difference? It needs to. Europe has cut emissions by roughly one quarter since 1990 \u2013 good but nowhere near enough to put the bloc on track to net zero by mid-century. Current measures will not suffice for that \u2013 disruptive change is required, which is why the green deal targets are key. On other environmental scores, the EU\u2019s record is mixed. There have been vast improvements in areas such as air and water quality across EU states, western and eastern, in the past five decades, spurred by EU regulations since the 1980s. Dozens of harmful chemicals have been phased out, farm animal welfare standards raised and recycling rates beat most of the world. But alongside those successes, the natural world has suffered a calamity across the continent: birds, insects, mammals, fish \u2026 few creatures (other than humans) have had a good time of it since the EU was created in 1992. How much will it cost and where will the money come from? At least \u20ac1 tn (\u00a3852bn) needs to be found over the next decade, according to the European commission. The biggest share, \u20ac503bn, should come from the EU budget, unleashing a further \u20ac114bn from national governments (because EU programmes often require a contribution from member states). The next \u20ac279bn would come mostly from the private sector: the idea is that companies would be encouraged to make risky green investments by loan guarantees from the European Investment Bank, the EU lender, which recently pledged to phase out loans to fossil fuel projects. On top of this Brussels has promised a \u20ac100bn \u201cjust transition\u201d mechanism to help retrain workers who lose jobs in shuttered coal mines or steel factories. But is it really \u20ac1 tn? Even friendly experts detect wishful accounting in Brussels\u2019 figures. Economists at the Bruegel thinktank say it is a stretch to consider the \u20ac503bn from the EU budget as \u201cgreen investment\u201d, as much of the money would be spent on traditional EU policies such as farm subsidies. Previous attempts to \u201cgreen\u201d the common agricultural policy have failed dismally. In a damning report in 2017, the EU\u2019s auditors highlighted how farmers were being paid to undertake environmentally friendly measures they would have done anyway, such as crop rotation, while governments handed out \u201cgreen\u201d cash with little oversight. Others fear that carbon financiers will game the system, meaning EU cash fails to trigger truly green investment from the private sector. And don\u2019t forget, EU governments last month failed to agree a new seven-year budget, with four \u201cfrugal\u201d net payers leading the charge to cut EU spending. The \u20ac503bn is not even in the bank. Even if the EU realised its \u20ac1tn plan, it wouldn\u2019t be enough. Bruegel argues the \u20ac1tn is only one third of what is needed, if the EU follows through with the commission\u2019s plan to reduce European greenhouse gas emissions by up to 55% by 2030. Meanwhile, critics in eastern countries complain there is not enough money to help coal regions. In 2015 there were 128 coal mines alone in the EU employing more than 238,000 people from Arag\u00f3n to Silesia. Why does the green deal matter internationally? This year \u2013 coronavirus permitting \u2013 will see the most important international climate meeting since the landmark Paris agreement was signed in 2015. Then, all of the world\u2019s functioning states signed up to hold global temperature rises to no more than 2C, and preferably to below 1.5C, beyond which the ravages of climate breakdown become catastrophic and irreversible. But the national pledges made at Paris on curbing greenhouse gases fell short of what is required to stay below 2C, and since 2015 the world\u2019s carbon output has risen by 4%. At the Cop26 climate talks, to be held in Glasgow this November, nations are supposed to come up with tougher targets for 2030, and preferably also with goals for reaching net zero emissions by mid-century, or soon after. But enthusiasm has ebbed since Paris, from Donald Trump\u2019s US, to Brazil, India and big oil producers such as Russia and Saudi Arabia. The key player will be China, the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and second biggest economy. At Paris, a pact between the US and China was the core of the deal. This time, the EU must bring China to the table alone. \u201cEU climate leadership [in the form of] the green deal is crucial to putting pressure on China and other major emitters to make more ambitious climate commitments,\u201d says Paul Bledsoe, a climate adviser in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House, who has attended more than a dozen climate negotiations since the 1990s. \u201cIn the face of Trump\u2019s climate nihilism, only the EU can show that the world\u2019s largest economy can decarbonise while continuing to provide a high standard of living for its 500 million people.\u201d What do critics say? The EU will face a backlash from its citizens, fuelled by populist politicians, for persisting with green policies, predicts Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform thinktank. He points to the gilets jaunes protests in France, which took off after rises in fuel taxes intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and the rise of the AFD in Germany. \u201cThe AFD is fuelled partly by climate scepticism. Populists are keen to promote anti-greenery, as they listen to voters,\u201d he says. \u201cThe green agenda will meet more and more opposition as voters start to realise it will make them poorer and affect their lifestyles, and they will worry about Europe becoming less competitive than, say, India and China, which won\u2019t be going carbon-neutral,\u201d says Grant. \u201cThis will increase the electoral strength of populists.\u201d Some leftwing campaigners have also attacked the plans. Taking issue with the \u201cjust transition\u201d mechanism, Yanis Varoufakis and David Adler of the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025, wrote in the Guardian: \u201cWill there be justice for the communities across Germany and France that have been asked to shoulder the costs of the climate transition? Does it speak to the swathes of Greek or Portuguese people who cannot afford to care about carbon emissions in 2050, preoccupied as they are with making ends meet this week? The stark answer is no.\u201d Will the UK be affected? Boris Johnson\u2019s government has made it clear that the UK wants to depart from EU environmental standards after Brexit. The post-Brexit environment bill, agriculture bill and fisheries bill now going through the British parliament contain various loopholes that green campaigners say would reduce in the UK the environmental protections that current EU law guarantees. The UK does officially have a 25-year environment plan, with the government pledging to leave the UK\u2019s natural realm in a better state than this generation inherited, but how that will hold up after Brexit is moot. On the climate crisis, the UK is aligned with the EU. Last summer, a target of reaching net zero by 2050 was enshrined in law, and all major parties are pledged to uphold it. What\u2019s missing, though, is a clear plan of action to meet the net zero aim. That is what Europe\u2019s green deal is meant to provide, and unless the UK forms its own parallel plans soon, its 2050 target will look increasingly adrift. Who are the green agitators in Europe? The idea of a Green New Deal has been kicking around US politics since at least 2006. The European Green Deal (minus the word \u201cnew\u2019 with its radical overtones) is not yet one year old. The EU plan resulted when an unexpected political leader collided with newly-elected MEPs, energised by the global climate movement. Von der Leyen, a German defence minister, was a surprise choice to become European commission president, leapfrogging candidates who had run in the European elections in May. Those elections resulted in a record number of seats for European Greens, as climate change topped the agenda in Germany and the Nordic countries. Von der Leyen\u2019s last-minute elevation angered the European parliament, pressuring her to lean to the left, liberals and Greens to gain support. To win MEPs over, she promised a European Green Deal within 100 days of taking office. Beyond the Brussels power play, politicians were responding to the streets, as school children walked out of their classrooms, demanding action. The school strike was personal. Chief executives, heads of government and senior UN officials told EU officials their children were asking what they were doing to save the planet. As one official recounts: \u201cYou can imagine a conversation with your own children is much more confrontational than a conversation with a shareholder, or a bad headline in a newspaper.\u201d Who\u2019s in favour, who\u2019s against? It\u2019s a bit like world peace: everyone backs the European Green Deal, in theory. But there is a big hole in the ambition to be net-zero by 2050: Poland, which says it will reach climate neutrality at \u201cits own pace\u201d. And beneath the surface, tensions over Europe\u2019s green ambitions are not hard to find. At least eight countries, including Spain, Sweden and Latvia, want the EU to increase its 2030 emissions reduction target. Poland and Hungary think that is too much. Divisions will also come when hard choices have to be made: from closing coal mines, demanding more from farmers, to tougher emissions standards for the car industry. What role will the European parliament play in the green deal? EU governments agree environmental laws with the European parliament. That gives MEPs a weighty role across a swathe of new laws expected to flow from the European Green Deal: a revision of the EU\u2019s heavily criticised carbon trading scheme, new performance standards for cars and vans, an overhaul of farm policy, changes to EU rules on state subsidies that will phase out support for fossil fuels. Typically, the parliament tends to raise the bar on green action \u2013 it last year declared a climate emergency. But MEPs often lose the battle against EU ministers, who usually get the upper hand in EU negotiations.

The force said the raids across 22 locations found electrical equipment, 1.5kg of explosives and 2.6 tonnes of chemicals. Twelve men and five women aged from 21 to 53 were arrested. A senior bomb disposal officer, Alick McWhirter, said officers retrieved three homemade bombs that were \u201cclose to completion\u201d. \u201cSignificant quantities of homemade explosives ready to be used were seized [along with] and an enormous quantity of precursor chemicals ready to be manufactured into yet more homemade explosives \u2013 over 2,500kg of chemicals\u201d, McWhirter said. He said Hong Kong had faced \u201can ongoing bombing campaign \u2026 that has been both violent and indiscriminate\u201d. The campaign was designed \u201cto intimidate in order to achieve political ends\u201d, he said. In late January, a small homemade bomb exploded at Caritas hospital, destroying a toilet cubicle and prompting the evacuation of some patients. In the following days unexploded devices were found at Shenzhen Bay control point and at a train station near the border with mainland China. Social media messages reportedly claimed responsibility for the devices and made further threats while calling for the closure of borders with mainland China owing to the coronavirus. Some in Hong Kong questioned the timing of the raids and accused police of being heavy-handed. There were also accusations, which the Guardian has not been able to verify, that some arrests were in connection with the pro-democracy protest movement that has swept the region since last June, and in particular the siege at Polytechnic University. Trust in the Hong Kong government and police force has plummeted over the past six months. Last week, three high-profile pro-democracy figures were arrested including Jimmy Lai, the head of the popular newspaper Apple Daily, on charges of illegal assembly. Police were accused of taking advantage of a lull in protests owing to coronavirus fears to target key figures. Also on Sunday, police were accused of a heavy-handed response to a protest in Tai Po, where people objected to the establishment of a clinic for suspected Covid-19 cases in a high-density residential area. Several people were taken away by police, and attendees including journalists were pepper-sprayed. Prior to the protest police said the gathering was unlawful and warned against violence and \u201cillegal acts of roadblocking\u201d. According to the South China Morning Post, protesters chanted pro-democracy slogans commonly heard over the past six months. Man Nim-chi, an opposition district councillor for Tai Po, told the paper she was pepper-sprayed despite standing near journalists to act as an observer. \u201cBut one officer rushed in my direction and pepper-sprayed me in the face. It is sheer abuse of power,\u201d she said. Hui Nick Lam, a district councillor for Tai Po, told Hong Kong Free Press the police had gone \u201coverboard\u201d. He said: \u201cThe protest had barely started before the clearance operation.\u201d On Sunday evening, large numbers of police and riot squad officers gathered in Tseung Kwan O in anticipation of a planned vigil for a 22-year-old student who died after falling from a building during last year\u2019s protests. Reports and social media footage showed arrests, mass stop-and-searches, and kettling of crowds in an effort to disperse the memorial to Alex Chow Tsz-lok. Police said they seized petrol bombs, glass bottles, lighters, a batch of bricks, umbrellas and helmets in a car park near the monthly vigil.",

They started well, imposed themselves up front and showed the kind of defensive appetite, in the face of a physical Welsh challenge, that distinguishes the best teams. If this was the last Twickenham hurrah for George Kruis and his long-time lineout guru Steve Borthwick, they went out in style; Tom Curry, Courtney Lawes, Maro Itoje, Kyle Sinckler, Ben Youngs and George Ford all had good games and the absence of Billy and Mako Vunipola was barely noticed.

They are playing with more daring and ambition, prepared to indulge in risky off-loads, but have retained elements of the Warren Gatland era, not least their ability to finish matches strongly. Their main problem is that by opening up they have opened up themselves. Mistakes have led to opposition tries, as again happened at Twickenham when George North\u2019s knock-on after Ross Moriarty had secured a turnover led to England\u2019s opener, and a team that conceded 65 points and seven tries in winning the title last year has leaked 84 and 10 in four matches this year. Their erstwhile defence coach Shaun Edwards said that conceding fewer than 20 points in a match enhanced the chance of victory: 19 was the most they shipped in last year\u2019s championship but the whitewashing of Italy was followed by opposition totals of 24, 27 and 33, which is why Wales have not defended their title. <strong>Paul Rees</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/07/welsh-flair-falls-short-in-the-face-of-englands-ferocity-despite-late-surge\" title=\"\">Michael Aylwin: Welsh flair falls short in the face of England\u2019s ferocity</a></em></p> <h2><strong>3) Defeat of France hands momentum to Scotland</strong></h2> <p>Under pressure after a traumatic World Cup and the dispute which has deprived Scotland of their key playmaker Finn Russell, Gregor Townsend has bought himself time with an accomplished victory over France.

Saudis spark oil price slump with vow to step up production The FTSE 100 share index followed huge losses in the Asian and European markets on Monday by plunging 8.5% as trading opened, putting the London Stock Exchange on track for its worst one-day fall since 2008. That\u2019s because the coronavirus panic already afflicting the global markets has been compounded by a 27% slump in the price of oil, after Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s top oil exporter, said it would step up production beginning next month. Barrelling downward. The decision by the Saudi state oil producer Aramco came in response to Russia\u2019s refusal to join an Opec plan to cut oil supplies; it represents an attempt by the Saudis to drive rivals such as Russia and the US out of the shale oil market. Shale firms have high production costs and lose money when crude prices fall below $50 a barrel for more than a few months. Leaked coronavirus quarantine plans spark chaos in Italy Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose from 233 to 366 on Sunday, a rise of more than 50% in 24 hours. The country was then plunged into further chaos by a leak to the media of plans to quarantine more than 16 million people across its worst-affected northern regions. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has cordoned off the oil-rich municipality of Qatif, home to 500,000 people, mostly Shia Muslims. Many of the 230 confirmed coronavirus cases in the Gulf region had recently returned from religious pilgrimages to Shia-majority Iran. China containment. The number of new Covid-19 deaths has continued to fall in China, with 22 reported on Sunday \u2013 the country\u2019s lowest toll since the start of the crisis. Low-wage workers. A lack of proper medical benefits and paid sick leave will leave millions of low-wage workers in the US vulnerable to the disease or its financial side-effects, as Michael Sainato reports. Bernie Sanders tries to slow the Biden surge in Michigan Bernie Sanders has asked for the backing of Elizabeth Warren and her progressive supporters, after Warren dropped out of the Democratic presidential race last week, leaving the Vermont senator as the sole standard-bearer for the party\u2019s left wing. Sanders has sharpened his attacks against the new frontrunner, Joe Biden, in hopes of an upset at the Michigan primary on Tuesday. But Biden, for his part, warned against a primary \u201cbloodbath\u201d before the general election. Kamala Harris. The California senator \u2013 whose own presidential campaign\u2019s biggest moment was arguably a debate-stage attack on Biden \u2013 endorsed the former vice-president on Sunday. Emissions fall as electricity producers shift to cleaner sources Carbon emissions from the global electricity system fell by 2% in 2019, the steepest drop in three decades, according to a report by the climate thinktank Ember. But while some of that decline can be attributed to countries turning from coal to cleaner energy sources, the report says there were also one-off factors at play last year, including mild winters. \u201cProgress is being made on reducing coal generation, but nothing like with the urgency needed to limit climate change,\u201d the report says. Coal plants. Coal generation in the US and Europe has halved since 2007 and, overall, power from coal plants fell by 3% last year. But China\u2019s reliance on coal plants rose again: the country now accounts for half the world\u2019s total coal generation.

North Korea has fired three unidentified projectiles into the sea off its eastern coast, the second missile test in two weeks. Female asylum seekers staged a protest at the Turkish border demanding to be let into the EU on Sunday, just one of multiple worldwide demonstrations organised to mark International Women\u2019s Day. Alabama lawmakers will consider a bill that would lift the state\u2019s ban on yoga in public schools. The ban was introduced in 1993 following complaints from parents that the practice endorsed a \u201cnon-Christian belief system\u201d.

From upgraded facial recognition tech to hotlines for reporting those who may be infected, Chinese citizens are facing a new level of government intrusion amid the coronavirus crisis. Experts say it has given Beijing a perfect excuse to accelerate its mass surveillance program, as Lily Kuo reports. Trump\u2019s businesses rake in millions from 2020 campaign The pro-Trump Super Pac America First Action has spent a total of more than $540,000 on events at the president\u2019s own Washington DC hotel since 2017. The figures highlight just how the president and his allies are using Trump properties to woo big donors before the 2020 election, writes Peter Stone.

A Derby d\u2019Italia that pitted Juventus and Inter against one another as genuine title rivals for the first time in almost two decades. A game that had already been postponed once and now, after a week of chaos and confusion, was finally taking place behind closed doors.</p> \n<p>As late as Sunday lunchtime, it was not clear whether this game \u2013 or any other in the Italian top-flight \u2013 would go ahead. After the previous week\u2019s string of cancellations, Serie A was supposed to resume at 12.30pm on Sunday with Parma hosting SPAL. Instead, after completing their warmups and gathering in the tunnel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/08/parma-v-spal-serie-a-match-delayed-amid-more-caronavirus-concern\">players were sent back to the changing rooms</a>.</p> \n<p>All domestic sporting activity at all levels in Italy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/09/all-sport-italy-suspended-until-3-april-coronavirus-serie-a\">has now been suspended until 3 April</a> at the earliest, the Italian national Olympic committee (CONI) announced on Monday, but this was not the case at the weekend. Kick-off had been thrown into limbo after Italy\u2019s sports minister, Vincenzo Spadafora, suggested that Italy\u2019s professional football leagues ought to be suspended while the nation works to contain the spread of the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Damiano Tommasi, the president of the Italian Footballers\u2019 Association, had written to him, as well as the prime minister and the heads of the sport\u2019s various governing bodies, requesting a halt.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe situation is grave and serious,\u201d read a statement from Tommasi on the Footballers\u2019 Association website. \u201cWe have already had cases of contagion in professional teams, greater attention is required. We cannot play football in this country, when players are not supposed to be touching each other.\u201d Three players on the Serie C team Pianese tested positive for Coronavirus last month and on Sunday another case was confirmed at Reggiana, who play in the tier below. Tommasi was responding in part to these cases but also to a government decree enacted in the small hours of Sunday morning, which placed the entire region of Lombardy into quarantine.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c8222c0f-918e-4c7f-a09f-901039bc83fc\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Beyond the headline measure of banning all but essential travel in or out of the region, the law closed down swimming pools and gyms, and stated that restaurants could only stay open (for limited hours) if able to guarantee at least one metre of space between each customer. If people were being told not to touch each other, asked Tommasi, how could it make sense for football to continue? Spadafora higlighted the same issue during an interview on Rai\u2019s 90\u00ba minuto, observing how Goran Pandev had been hugged by his teammates after scoring against Milan: \u201ca terrible example\u201d. He also delivered a scathing assessment of the Serie A president Paolo Dal Pino, accusing him of shirking his responsibilities.</p> \n<p>Football\u2019s handling of this crisis has left a lot to be desired, though Spadafora has hardly been consistent himself. He introduced legislation requiring games to be played behind closed doors just three days before. If he felt at the time that they ought to be cancelled altogether, why not specify as much, instead of holding discussions with broadcasters about getting them played free-to-air?</p> \n<p>An emergency meeting of the Italian Football Federation has been called for Tuesday. Although it is impossible to say anything with certainty in the current climate, a complete suspension of professional leagues \u2013 as has already happened in Switzerland \u2013 is at least a strong possibility. What that would mean for the eventual completion of this season is anyone\u2019s guess. With Euro 2020 looming and the virus continuing to spread across the continent, Italy is unlikely to face such conundrums alone.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5c40924498c1d02113dd48413369eb8ce6117cef\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c40924498c1d02113dd48413369eb8ce6117cef/640_520_2860_1716/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paulo Dybala celebrates in front of empty stands at the Allianz Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paulo Dybala celebrates in front of empty stands at the Allianz Stadium.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Massimo Pinca/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Players are more aware of this than anyone. It made for a bizarre Sunday, with games that felt more like training sessions surrounded by unnecessary pomp. Even without fans present, clubs followed the same routines as they would for any other matchday. Teams still lined up for the Serie A anthem before kick-off. Stewards still took up their positions in each stand.</p> \n<p>Most surreal might have been the music. AC/DC\u2019s Thunderstruck still boomed out before kick-off at Juventus\u2019s Allianz Stadium, as it does before every game.

      "bodyText": "Paulo Dybala did not require an audience. The Juventus forward was not thinking about the empty stand behind him as he accelerated down the right wing at the Allianz Stadium. He did not stop to contemplate the quiet as he cushioned Rodrigo Bentancur\u2019s cross-field pass on his instep and cut inside Ashley Young. Dybala was not dazzled by the banks of white seats before him as he exchanged a one-two with Aaron Ramsey, wrongfooted Young for a second time and slipped an outside-of-the-boot finish beyond Samir Handanovic in the Internazionale goal. It was a strike worthy of winning one of Serie A\u2019s most keenly anticipated matches in years. A Derby d\u2019Italia that pitted Juventus and Inter against one another as genuine title rivals for the first time in almost two decades. A game that had already been postponed once and now, after a week of chaos and confusion, was finally taking place behind closed doors. As late as Sunday lunchtime, it was not clear whether this game \u2013 or any other in the Italian top-flight \u2013 would go ahead. After the previous week\u2019s string of cancellations, Serie A was supposed to resume at 12.30pm on Sunday with Parma hosting SPAL. Instead, after completing their warmups and gathering in the tunnel, players were sent back to the changing rooms. All domestic sporting activity at all levels in Italy has now been suspended until 3 April at the earliest, the Italian national Olympic committee (CONI) announced on Monday, but this was not the case at the weekend. Kick-off had been thrown into limbo after Italy\u2019s sports minister, Vincenzo Spadafora, suggested that Italy\u2019s professional football leagues ought to be suspended while the nation works to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Damiano Tommasi, the president of the Italian Footballers\u2019 Association, had written to him, as well as the prime minister and the heads of the sport\u2019s various governing bodies, requesting a halt. \u201cThe situation is grave and serious,\u201d read a statement from Tommasi on the Footballers\u2019 Association website. \u201cWe have already had cases of contagion in professional teams, greater attention is required. We cannot play football in this country, when players are not supposed to be touching each other.\u201d Three players on the Serie C team Pianese tested positive for Coronavirus last month and on Sunday another case was confirmed at Reggiana, who play in the tier below. Tommasi was responding in part to these cases but also to a government decree enacted in the small hours of Sunday morning, which placed the entire region of Lombardy into quarantine. Beyond the headline measure of banning all but essential travel in or out of the region, the law closed down swimming pools and gyms, and stated that restaurants could only stay open (for limited hours) if able to guarantee at least one metre of space between each customer. If people were being told not to touch each other, asked Tommasi, how could it make sense for football to continue? Spadafora higlighted the same issue during an interview on Rai\u2019s 90\u00ba minuto, observing how Goran Pandev had been hugged by his teammates after scoring against Milan: \u201ca terrible example\u201d. He also delivered a scathing assessment of the Serie A president Paolo Dal Pino, accusing him of shirking his responsibilities. Football\u2019s handling of this crisis has left a lot to be desired, though Spadafora has hardly been consistent himself. He introduced legislation requiring games to be played behind closed doors just three days before. If he felt at the time that they ought to be cancelled altogether, why not specify as much, instead of holding discussions with broadcasters about getting them played free-to-air? An emergency meeting of the Italian Football Federation has been called for Tuesday. Although it is impossible to say anything with certainty in the current climate, a complete suspension of professional leagues \u2013 as has already happened in Switzerland \u2013 is at least a strong possibility. What that would mean for the eventual completion of this season is anyone\u2019s guess. With Euro 2020 looming and the virus continuing to spread across the continent, Italy is unlikely to face such conundrums alone. Players are more aware of this than anyone. It made for a bizarre Sunday, with games that felt more like training sessions surrounded by unnecessary pomp. Even without fans present, clubs followed the same routines as they would for any other matchday. Teams still lined up for the Serie A anthem before kick-off. Stewards still took up their positions in each stand. Most surreal might have been the music. AC/DC\u2019s Thunderstruck still boomed out before kick-off at Juventus\u2019s Allianz Stadium, as it does before every game. In Udine, goal celebration music was mistakenly played after Stefano Okaka thumped a header over the bar. Despite it all, the Derby d\u2019Italia still felt different. Although not the occasion that it would have been, there was still an edge here that had been missing elsewhere. Inter assaulted Juventus early with an atypical high press. The Bianconeri, after 11 days off, played with the sort of pace and commitment that seemed to have deserted them during their previous outing: a dismal 1-0 defeat in Lyon. Maurizio Sarri\u2019s decision to drop Miralem Pjanic, drafting Bentancur into the centre of midfield and deploying Ramsey in a box-to-box role on the right, felt decisive. After mixed performances in a No 10 role, Ramsey had asked for this opportunity to start deeper, telling his manager that he felt more able to make the line-breaking runs that the team wants from him when he can see more of the pitch ahead. Ramsey scored the opener, reacting fastest to a loose ball on the edge of the six-yard box. His was the assist on Dybala\u2019s goal, too. After a frustrating, injury-disrupted, first season in Turin, this feels like a moment for the Welshman to press on and really make his mark. Or it would, at least, if not for the uncertainty about whether the rest of this season will even go ahead. For now, Juventus are back on top of the table, one point ahead of Lazio but nine clear of Inter. The Nerazzurri have a game in hand, but have lost their last three domestic games. Defeat felt like a hammer blow to their title ambitions. Antonio Conte, returning for the first time to face the club that he led to three consecutive titles, was measured in his post-game comments, arguing nobody should be surprised that a team built over many years would hold the edge over his Inter side, whose personnel has been overhauled since his arrival. Both he and Sarri were asked about football\u2019s handling of the coronavirus. Where the Juventus manager suggested that he didn\u2019t know enough to offer an opinion, Conte acknowledged concerns. \u201cWe are all human beings, we all have a family,\u201d he said. \u201cAt times I would like to raise my voice, but I stop myself. Keeping one\u2019s concentration up is not simple. I hope that decisions will be taken that safeguard everyone, without distinctions.\u201d That much, frankly, ought to be a minimum standard.",

      "bodyText": "The time it took the coronavirus to go from the edges of US concerns to people in stores emptying shelves of hand sanitizer was roughly a week. In response to outbreaks, Italy has shut down its schools and quarantined 16 million people. China has blocked off whole cities. In the US, cruise ships have been blocked from docking, hard-hit King county in Washington state has advised workers to stay home and older and sick people to stay indoors. Elsewhere, many events have been cancelled and a handful of schools shut. With more than 500 cases in the US and the numbers rising, the question is: what measures will the US government take and will the country see widespread shutdowns? \u201cYou should absolutely have the expectation that at some point coming up, this will be necessary,\u201d Dr William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, told the Guardian. \u201cAnd have a plan for how you are going to do it, how you are going to look after the most vulnerable in the community, and how you are going to do it without turning your entire city and community upside down and inside out.\u201d As of Monday morning, at least 500 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the US and 21 had died. So far, 80% of patients experience a mild form of the illness, which can include a fever and pneumonia, and many of these cases require little to no medical intervention. But that has raised concerns it could spread to vulnerable groups because infected people assume they just have a bad cold. \u201cThis is an intensely serious situation. However, there\u2019s a lot you can do to reduce the risk to yourself and others,\u201d Hanage said. \u201cYour risk of getting it, per day, is actually quite low. So people should not panic but they should prepare.\u201d The top advice to prevent the spread of coronavirus is regular hand washing, changing to fresh clothes at home, coughing and sneezing into the crook of the arm, not shaking hands and avoiding touching the face. Are schools going to close? Steps have been taken in places such as Washington state and New York City. Some schools there have closed down after parents or students tested positive for coronavirus. Globally, however, nearly 300 million children are out of school because of the coronavirus, according to Unesco. Italy, where at least 366 people have died, has ordered the closure of all schools and universities in the country until 15 March. There are many unknowns about the role of children. At first, they appeared to not get the virus. Further investigation showed that it was because they have mild symptoms when infected and early research focused on the most dangerous cases. Now, the question is how much of a role children are playing in spreading the disease, if any. \u201cIf you don\u2019t close schools, you might run the risk having viral fountains in the middle of your community,\u201d Hanage said. Bioethicist Kelly Hills said school closures could lead some parents to form unofficial daycares with a few parents as supervisors of a group of kids while the others work. This could create a similar disease fountain as in school, just possibly without the education. The 29.7 million US children who rely on free or low-cost lunch at school could also suffer. \u201cToo many people in America live paycheck to paycheck for this [school closures] to really be something that is an easy answer,\u201d said Hills. She does expect more school closures in the near future and anticipated sports competitions, professional or amateur, to be cancelled or played in empty stadiums. In China, government officials went as far as to lock down the city of Wuhan, where the virus was first detected in December, in a practice known as cordon sanitaire. This concept dates back to the medieval ages, and while there is evidence it slowed the spread of coronavirus, public health experts said it was best for the US to avoid it. When more extreme measures are taken, particularly if they are poorly communicated, it can breed fear, stigmatization and violence. It can also create distrust in the government, media and healthcare institutions. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, tweeted: \u201cRather than playing cordon sanitaire whack-a-mole with communities across the country, I\u2019d like to see these resources go toward engaging the public on how to stop virus spread.

China was also successful at making testing widely available and free, something the US has failed to do. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initially prevented labs from developing their own tests, then sent out faulty kits and had strict guidelines for who should be tested. Once these issues were addressed, more than a hundred cases were identified in a few days. Even more coronavirus cases could be identified if local and federal government manage to address the expense of coronavirus testing in the US. California and Washington on Thursday ordered insurers to pay for the kits and some are starting to do it voluntarily, though hidden costs are a hallmark of the US healthcare system and it\u2019s not guaranteed treatment would be covered. In China, if someone was being treated for coronavirus and their insurance couldn\u2019t cover everything, the government would cover the rest, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The country was also able to move 50% of its medical care online, the WHO said. Mike Pence, who is overseeing the US response to coronavirus, said last week the country could test one million people by the end of the week. Within 24 hours, the vice-president admitted it was not actually possible. Hanage said without rigorous testing, it is difficult for local governments to determine how far they should go in closing schools and public gatherings. \u201cThe difficult situation remains that the lack of testing means we are still fumbling in the dark,\u201d he said. How to protect the most vulnerable One certainty with coronavirus is that the elderly and people with underlying conditions such as diabetes or heart and lung issues are the most vulnerable. The death rate for people 80 or over in China, in the government\u2019s study of more than 72,000 cases, was 14.8%. And because so many cases are mild, and people are capable of spreading it very early in infection, the most vulnerable and their loved ones are searching for answers about what extra precautions they should take. Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC under Barack Obama, told reporters this week he had advised his 90-year-old mother to cut down on her active social schedule, which includes three book clubs, because of the specific risks facing her age group. But Dr Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said it is difficult to offer concrete advice on how long these populations should avoid crowds and public gatherings because of how much is still unknown about coronavirus. Pandemic or not, it is always wise for people to stay home if they have a fever, for the safety of themselves and others. \u201cI really think the key here is isolation,\u201d Nuzzo said. \u201cAnd making it so people do possibly over-isolate themselves. They\u2019re not quite sure if they are coming down, but you know they might be sick so they are just going to stay home until they see how their symptoms pan out \u2013 certainly if they develop a fever, absolutely stay home.\u201d And if you aren\u2019t yet at the stage, and are wondering if you\u2019ll soon be working from home or dealing with a local school closure, do not underestimate the power of washing your hands.",

      "body": "<p>England may have to play five Tests in consecutive weeks in the autumn, with the Six Nations organisers considering rescheduling postponed matches for 31 October. The Guardian understands that the weekend before the November internationals has been discussed as a possible new date for postponed matches as Saturday\u2019s fixture between France and Ireland became the third to be called off because of the coronavirus outbreak on Monday.</p> <p>Ireland were due to play <em>Les Bleus</em> in Paris on Saturday but the French sports minister, Roxana Maracineanu, confirmed the match would be postponed after a crackdown on public gatherings of more than 1,000 people was announced in France on Sunday. The Six Nations confirmed that Wales v Scotland is still due to go ahead as planned, as Saturday\u2019s only fixture with organisers now facing the headache of rescheduling three matches.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/09/no-reason-yet-uk-sport-behind-closed-doors-says-culture-secretary-oliver-dowden-coronavirus\">'No reason' yet for UK sport to go behind closed doors, says culture secretary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While organisers insist that no dates have yet been finalised and while the unpredictability of the virus means the tournament may yet be washed out, the weekend at the end of October is considered a logical choice given it falls between the end of a European double-header and the start of the November Tests. As England have four autumn matches scheduled, there is less flexibility over their fixture against Italy in Rome and if it were played on 31 October, France v Ireland could take place on the same day. That would not solve the issue of when Italy\u2019s trip to Dublin takes place, however, and there appears no guarantee it would be before the other two rescheduled matches. Indeed, while England play Australia on 28 November, neither Italy nor Ireland have matches on that weekend so it is conceivable the tournament would not reach a conclusion until then.</p> <p>The Ireland head coach, Andy Farrell, admitted his side were \u201cgutted\u201d after having a second postponement confirmed on Monday but revealed they were \u201cvery open\u201d to rescheduling for the autumn. Whereas England and Wales have arranged four autumn internationals this year, Ireland have only three \u2013 against Australia, South Africa and Japan. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a window for that,\u201d he said. \u201cSome teams, they always schedule four [games] in there but we\u2019ve scheduled three in November so we\u2019ve got a window there so we\u2019re very open for that.\u201d</p> <p>England are slated to play New Zealand, Argentina, Tonga and the Wallabies in consecutive weeks but adding the Italy fixture to the start of that fixture list could raise concerns over player welfare. When World Rugby proposed the Nations Championship last year it was strongly opposed on welfare grounds by the international players\u2019 union. At the time, the Ireland fly-half, Johnny Sexton, said: \u201cTo suggest that players can play five incredibly high-level Test matches in consecutive weeks in November is out of touch and shows little understanding of the physical strain this brings.\u201d</p> <p>Scotland\u2019s trip to Wales will go ahead this weekend after the government insisted there was no reason yet to cancel sporting events or play them behind closed doors. Wales women v Scotland women has been postponed however, with seven members of the Scotland squad self-isolating after a player was diagnosed with coronavirus before their match against France last weekend, which was postponed as a result.</p> <p>The Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney, had earlier indicated Wales v Scotland would be going ahead when he spoke as he left a Department of Culture, Media and Sport meeting in London. Sporting bodies such as the RFU are under instruction from the government to strictly follow medical advice rather than adopt their own approaches, hence England\u2019s public rebuke for not picking Mako Vunipola last week because of a brief stopover in Hong Kong, only for Saracens to select him in accordance with guidelines from Public Health England.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>European Champions Cup organisers have said that all quarter-finals, scheduled for the first weekend of April, are currently still due to go ahead though Clermont\u2019s all-French affair against Racing 92 and Ulster\u2019s trip to Toulouse are likely to be behind closed doors. </p>",

      "bodyText": "England may have to play five Tests in consecutive weeks in the autumn, with the Six Nations organisers considering rescheduling postponed matches for 31 October. The Guardian understands that the weekend before the November internationals has been discussed as a possible new date for postponed matches as Saturday\u2019s fixture between France and Ireland became the third to be called off because of the coronavirus outbreak on Monday. Ireland were due to play Les Bleus in Paris on Saturday but the French sports minister, Roxana Maracineanu, confirmed the match would be postponed after a crackdown on public gatherings of more than 1,000 people was announced in France on Sunday. The Six Nations confirmed that Wales v Scotland is still due to go ahead as planned, as Saturday\u2019s only fixture with organisers now facing the headache of rescheduling three matches. While organisers insist that no dates have yet been finalised and while the unpredictability of the virus means the tournament may yet be washed out, the weekend at the end of October is considered a logical choice given it falls between the end of a European double-header and the start of the November Tests. As England have four autumn matches scheduled, there is less flexibility over their fixture against Italy in Rome and if it were played on 31 October, France v Ireland could take place on the same day. That would not solve the issue of when Italy\u2019s trip to Dublin takes place, however, and there appears no guarantee it would be before the other two rescheduled matches. Indeed, while England play Australia on 28 November, neither Italy nor Ireland have matches on that weekend so it is conceivable the tournament would not reach a conclusion until then. The Ireland head coach, Andy Farrell, admitted his side were \u201cgutted\u201d after having a second postponement confirmed on Monday but revealed they were \u201cvery open\u201d to rescheduling for the autumn. Whereas England and Wales have arranged four autumn internationals this year, Ireland have only three \u2013 against Australia, South Africa and Japan. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a window for that,\u201d he said. \u201cSome teams, they always schedule four [games] in there but we\u2019ve scheduled three in November so we\u2019ve got a window there so we\u2019re very open for that.\u201d England are slated to play New Zealand, Argentina, Tonga and the Wallabies in consecutive weeks but adding the Italy fixture to the start of that fixture list could raise concerns over player welfare. When World Rugby proposed the Nations Championship last year it was strongly opposed on welfare grounds by the international players\u2019 union. At the time, the Ireland fly-half, Johnny Sexton, said: \u201cTo suggest that players can play five incredibly high-level Test matches in consecutive weeks in November is out of touch and shows little understanding of the physical strain this brings.\u201d Scotland\u2019s trip to Wales will go ahead this weekend after the government insisted there was no reason yet to cancel sporting events or play them behind closed doors. Wales women v Scotland women has been postponed however, with seven members of the Scotland squad self-isolating after a player was diagnosed with coronavirus before their match against France last weekend, which was postponed as a result. The Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney, had earlier indicated Wales v Scotland would be going ahead when he spoke as he left a Department of Culture, Media and Sport meeting in London. Sporting bodies such as the RFU are under instruction from the government to strictly follow medical advice rather than adopt their own approaches, hence England\u2019s public rebuke for not picking Mako Vunipola last week because of a brief stopover in Hong Kong, only for Saracens to select him in accordance with guidelines from Public Health England. European Champions Cup organisers have said that all quarter-finals, scheduled for the first weekend of April, are currently still due to go ahead though Clermont\u2019s all-French affair against Racing 92 and Ulster\u2019s trip to Toulouse are likely to be behind closed doors.",

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil price war has wiped billions of pounds from the market value of the industry\u2019s biggest companies after oil markets recorded one of the biggest price slumps in history. The decision of the world\u2019s largest oil-producing nation to increase its production even as the coronavirus outbreak stalls global oil demand triggered a 30% drop in oil prices on Monday morning. The oil price shock caused the UK oil giants Royal Dutch Shell and BP to lose more than \u00a332bn from their combined market value within minutes of the London Stock Exchange opening. The pair led the FTSE 100 to its sharpest fall since the global financial crisis in 2008 as the index tumbled by 8.3% amid deepening fears over the economic impact of the coronavirus. It was down 6.8% at noon. In early trade, Shell lost a fifth of its market value, while BP\u2019s shares plummeted by 27%, after the global benchmark oil price recorded its deepest fall since the Gulf war in 1991. Industry experts fear that a prolonged oil price war could force companies to rethink their dividends and spell bankruptcy for smaller commodity trading houses. By mid-morning, BP, which was valued at \u00a379.5bn on Friday, was worth \u00a363.6bn after its share price fell by about 20% to 322p a share. The value of Shell\u2019s London-listed shares fell by more than 13% to about \u00a313 a share, effectively wiping \u00a316.8bn from the company, which is now worth \u00a3108bn. On the FTSE 250, shares in Premier Oil plunged 51%, while Tullow Oil was down 26%. Oil companies face an uncertain year after the outbreak of the coronavirus in China, which has wiped out oil growth forecasts for the year and may cause oil demand to contract. Analysts at Redburn warned that a six-month price war could take a major toll on oil company earnings, potentially bringing an end to dividends in favour of paying investors in company shares instead. Shell and the US oil giant ExxonMobil are considered the most exposed to the market crash because they have high breakeven oil prices.

      "bodyText": "Petrol prices at supermarkets could fall by 7p-8p to \u00a31.10 a litre if the dramatic fall in the price of crude oil is sustained over several weeks, the AA has predicted. Monday\u2019s 23% decline to less than $35 a barrel could save a family with two cars about \u00a315.50 a month, the motoring group said. Last month there was one of the largest drops in fuel prices in the past 20 years. Wholesale oil was trading at close to $60 a barrel as recently as 21 February. The decline in demand because of coronavirus and the row between Russia and Saudi Arabia resulted in the latest collapse in prices. Saudi Arabia slashed the cost of oil at the weekend after it failed to convince Russia on Friday to back sharp production cuts. The two countries had previously worked together on production curbs, which kept prices higher. Oil prices on Monday morning opened 30% lower, although by lunchtime they had regained some ground to be 23% down. \u201cThe spat between oil producers echoes the oil price crash in 2015, when \u00a31-a-litre fuel returned to UK petrol stations,\u201d said Luke Bosdet, the AA\u2019s fuel price spokesman. \u201cThere is still a long way to go and the chances of another major collapse in forecourt prices will depend on how long the oil price plunge continues and how quickly UK retailers take to pass on savings.\u201d The RAC\u2019s fuel spokesman, Simon Williams, said: \u201cThis is looking like the biggest single daily drop in the oil price in 20 years.

It said all the lawmakers the physician\u2019s office was monitoring \u201cremain in good health\u201d. The Republican representative Paul Gosar announced that he and three members of his senior staff were under self-quarantine after coming in contact with the person who has what the Arizona rightwinger chose to call \u201cWuhan virus\u201d, after the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak. Gosar tweeted that he and his staff were showing no symptoms but were \u201cbeing proactive and cautious\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Hospitals in the locked-down Italian region of Lombardy are beginning to run out of beds as the country recorded its highest day-on-day rise in deaths from coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Twenty days into its outbreak, Italy is grappling to contain the spread of the virus and find space and beds in intensive care units, which are dwindling day by day. To manage the emergency, the sick are being placed in operating rooms or in hospital corridors.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am very concerned,\u201d said Prof Massimo Galli, the director of infectious diseases at Sacco hospital in Milan. \u201cThe pressure on hospitals in Lombardy these days is enormous. I am very, very worried about the impact the virus will have on our health system.\u201d</p> \n<p>The whole of Lombardy, including Milan, Italy\u2019s financial capital, and 14 provinces across the worst-affected northern regions encompassing more than 15 million people, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/leaked-coronavirus-plan-to-quarantine-16m-sparks-chaos-in-italy\">have been shut down until 3 April</a>, under measures not seen since the second world war.</p> \n<p>Police checks are under way at railway stations, toll booths, roads entering and leaving internal cities, and airports. Those who have to leave the region out of serious necessity can do so only if they have self-certification stating that they must cross the Lombardy border for compelling business reasons, health reasons and or because they have to return to their homes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/lockdown-zip/giv-39024AU7FjE0q3VO/\" data-alt=\"Italian lockdown\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/lockdown-zip/giv-39024AU7FjE0q3VO/\">Italian lockdown</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, gloomily cited Winston Churchill as evidence that great nations persevere when the going gets tough. \u201cThese days, I have been thinking about the old speeches of Churchill \u2013 it is our darkest hour but we will make it,\u201d Conte told La Repubblica newspaper.</p> \n<p>The number of deaths from coronavirus in Italy rose from 366 to 463 on Monday, according to the head of the civil protection agency. The total number of cases in Italy rose by 24% to 9,172, and of those originally infected, 724 had fully recovered. Some 733 people were in intensive care against a previous total of 650.</p> \n<p>There are about 500 available beds for intensive care in Lombardy\u2019s public health sphere, with another 160 in private care facilities. Despite a massive effort to locate additional space there are still not enough.</p> \n<p>The emergency commissioner and civil protection chief, Angelo Borrelli, announced that 13 patients had been transferred or were on the way to neighbouring regions for their care.</p> \n<p>Negative-pressure isolation rooms, designed to contain airborne contaminants, are needed to treat coronavirus properly, to protect doctors and medical technicians from contracting the virus from the patients in their care.</p> \n<p>\u201cJust a small portion of the patients affected by Covid-19 in Lombardy are hospitalised in negative pressure rooms,\u201d said Galli. \u201cThe majority is not, and this is a dangerous problem because it can lead to transmission to other patients and medical staff throughout an entire hospital.\u201d</p> \n<p>Authorities in Lombardy are attempting to free up beds as quickly as possible. According to new guidelines, if a patient infected with Covid-19 has been without a fever for three days and appears to be getting better, then he or she will be released from intensive care and placed in a dedicated rehabilitative pulmonary ward for coronavirus patients.</p> \n<p>\u201cBeds in intensive care units and in hospitals in general must be freed quickly to make room for more patients,\u201d the health minister for the Lombardy region, Angelo Garra, told the Corriere della Sera.</p> \n<p>Dozens of doctors have contracted the virus. The government has allocated \u20ac600m (\u00a3522m) to recruit 20,000 doctors and nurses.</p> \n<p>There is a risk that the kind of pressure on hospitals experienced in Lombardy will spread to the south of the country after thousands of panic-stricken people travelled there on trains, buses and in their cars as news of spread of the impending government lockdown in the north.</p> \n<p>In southern Italy dozens of police officers and medics wearing masks and hazmat suits waited in Salerno, Campania for passengers who had boarded overnight trains from Lombardy.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis flight en masse is causing the opposite effect of the measures put in place in the north,\u201d warned Roberto Burioni, a professor of microbiology and virology at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan. \u201cUnfortunately, some of those who fled carry the disease.\u201d</p> \n<p>More than 9,000 people have arrived in Puglia from the north of the country in the last two days. The authorities have already registered them and placed many in quarantine.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n     <li>Advice about face masks varies.

      "bodyText": "Hospitals in the locked-down Italian region of Lombardy are beginning to run out of beds as the country recorded its highest day-on-day rise in deaths from coronavirus. Twenty days into its outbreak, Italy is grappling to contain the spread of the virus and find space and beds in intensive care units, which are dwindling day by day. To manage the emergency, the sick are being placed in operating rooms or in hospital corridors. \u201cI am very concerned,\u201d said Prof Massimo Galli, the director of infectious diseases at Sacco hospital in Milan. \u201cThe pressure on hospitals in Lombardy these days is enormous. I am very, very worried about the impact the virus will have on our health system.\u201d The whole of Lombardy, including Milan, Italy\u2019s financial capital, and 14 provinces across the worst-affected northern regions encompassing more than 15 million people, have been shut down until 3 April, under measures not seen since the second world war. Police checks are under way at railway stations, toll booths, roads entering and leaving internal cities, and airports. Those who have to leave the region out of serious necessity can do so only if they have self-certification stating that they must cross the Lombardy border for compelling business reasons, health reasons and or because they have to return to their homes. The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, gloomily cited Winston Churchill as evidence that great nations persevere when the going gets tough. \u201cThese days, I have been thinking about the old speeches of Churchill \u2013 it is our darkest hour but we will make it,\u201d Conte told La Repubblica newspaper. The number of deaths from coronavirus in Italy rose from 366 to 463 on Monday, according to the head of the civil protection agency. The total number of cases in Italy rose by 24% to 9,172, and of those originally infected, 724 had fully recovered. Some 733 people were in intensive care against a previous total of 650. There are about 500 available beds for intensive care in Lombardy\u2019s public health sphere, with another 160 in private care facilities. Despite a massive effort to locate additional space there are still not enough. The emergency commissioner and civil protection chief, Angelo Borrelli, announced that 13 patients had been transferred or were on the way to neighbouring regions for their care. Negative-pressure isolation rooms, designed to contain airborne contaminants, are needed to treat coronavirus properly, to protect doctors and medical technicians from contracting the virus from the patients in their care. \u201cJust a small portion of the patients affected by Covid-19 in Lombardy are hospitalised in negative pressure rooms,\u201d said Galli. \u201cThe majority is not, and this is a dangerous problem because it can lead to transmission to other patients and medical staff throughout an entire hospital.\u201d Authorities in Lombardy are attempting to free up beds as quickly as possible. According to new guidelines, if a patient infected with Covid-19 has been without a fever for three days and appears to be getting better, then he or she will be released from intensive care and placed in a dedicated rehabilitative pulmonary ward for coronavirus patients. \u201cBeds in intensive care units and in hospitals in general must be freed quickly to make room for more patients,\u201d the health minister for the Lombardy region, Angelo Garra, told the Corriere della Sera. Dozens of doctors have contracted the virus. The government has allocated \u20ac600m (\u00a3522m) to recruit 20,000 doctors and nurses. There is a risk that the kind of pressure on hospitals experienced in Lombardy will spread to the south of the country after thousands of panic-stricken people travelled there on trains, buses and in their cars as news of spread of the impending government lockdown in the north. In southern Italy dozens of police officers and medics wearing masks and hazmat suits waited in Salerno, Campania for passengers who had boarded overnight trains from Lombardy. \u201cThis flight en masse is causing the opposite effect of the measures put in place in the north,\u201d warned Roberto Burioni, a professor of microbiology and virology at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan. \u201cUnfortunately, some of those who fled carry the disease.\u201d More than 9,000 people have arrived in Puglia from the north of the country in the last two days. The authorities have already registered them and placed many in quarantine. Michele Emiliano, the president of Puglia, signed an order on Sunday obliging all those arriving from the north in the coming hours to go into quarantine. \u201cDo not bring the Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia epidemic to your Puglia,\u201d he wrote on Facebook, mostly addressing people from the region who live in the north. \u201cYou are carrying the virus into the lungs of your brothers and sisters, your grandparents, uncles, cousins and parents.\u201d \u201cPeople arriving in Sicily from the north must take care not to spread the disease,\u201d said Tullio Prestileo, a doctor in infectious diseases at Palermo\u2019s Benfratelli hospital. \u201cIf we want to avoid that the emergency affecting Lombardy reaches us, we all must be very responsible.\u201d Sicily is preparing for the worst, and the authorities have already doubled the number of beds in intensive care and infectious disease units in anticipation of a rise in patients affected with Covid-19.",

While the Coalition trumpeted the budget returning to surplus during last year\u2019s federal election, when the budget was actually in balance, Morrison will make it clear on Tuesday the government will bankroll the stimulus package, thought to be in the range of $5bn to $10bn, while maintaining social spending on health, disability support, infrastructure and defence, rather than look to claw back expenditure. While Labor argues the economy was already weak before the twin hits of the summer bushfire crisis and the coronavirus outbreak, Morrison will say on Tuesday both the government and the Reserve Bank were confident at the end of 2019 that a \u201cturning point had been reached\u201d. But that outlook changed radically in the opening months of 2020. \u201cWithin a month the bushfire crisis intensified and Covid-19 struck. Occurring simultaneously, they have dramatically impacted Australia\u2019s economy and finances.\u201d Morrison will characterise the current volatility on the financial markets as a combination of uncertainty and repricing risk. But he will say the markets continue to operate effectively \u201cand the Reserve Bank governor has noted the RBA will ensure the Australian financial system has sufficient liquidity\u201d. He will argue risk aversion is contagious. \u201cThere is the potential for heightened risk aversion to flow over into reduced business and consumer spending, reducing demand across our economy. \u201cThese effects would be greater if coronavirus were to have a significant impact on the health of our workforce \u2013 something that we are working very hard to prevent.\u201d The government has been flagging that the imminent stimulus package could be supplemented by another round of measures in the May budget. \u201cThe range of possible economic outcomes will depend on the spread, severity and duration of the health crisis and its interaction with demand-side and supply-side effects,\u201d Morrison will say on Tuesday. The prime minister will argue if the stimulus package is well designed, a longer term structural hit to the budget can be avoided. On Monday, the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, encouraged the Morrison government to move quickly and substantively with the stimulus package. \u201cWe need to make sure that whatever the government announces is not too little too late. \u201cWe need to make sure that whatever they announce is big enough and fast enough to make a genuine difference in a floundering economy,\u201d Chalmers said. The shadow treasurer also advocated support for workers whose incomes will be disrupted by the coronavirus, and for businesses. \u201cWe need the government to focus on those most affected by these challenges \u2013 whether it be workers without paid sick leave, whether it be businesses in the affected sectors having trouble with cashflow\u201d. The industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, will meet on Tuesday with unions and employer groups.",

      "bodyText": "If you have a trip planned, or are thinking of planning a holiday, either within Australia or overseas, here\u2019s what you need to know about how to best guard yourself against any issues arising from the spread of Covid-19. I booked a trip last year, am I still going to be covered for travel insurance? It will depend on a number of factors, most notably when you booked the travel. Lisa Kable, communications manager for the Insurance Council of Australia, told Guardian Australia in February that after Dfat made its announcement on 23 January about the risk of travel in relation to coronavirus it became a \u201cknown event\u201d for insurers. \u201cIf people are travelling and bought their travel insurance before it became a known event \u2026 the majority of travel insurance policies should cover people if they contract coronavirus overseas, or if their trips have to be moved around countries or places.\u201d If you bought it after the cut-off date, most travel insurers exclude pandemic, epidemic disease or infectious disease or a known event. The same rules apply if people are already travelling, or have yet to start travelling \u2013 it only matters when the insurance was purchased. Choice\u2019s travel insurance review found less than half of insurers cover cancellation as a result of a pandemic or epidemic, but that\u2019s only the case once it becomes a known event. The same rules apply to both domestic and international travel insurance. While companies like NRMA note that sickness is one of the biggest reasons people make a claim on their insurance, the product disclosure statement says pandemics and epidemics are not covered if you cancel. You can, however, get \u201ccancel for any reason\u201d cover as an add-on to your travel insurance. This allows you to claim up to 75% of your cancellation costs to $10,000 but it must be bought within 48 hours of paying for expensive items such as flights or accommodation. Insurer Cover-More explicitly names Covid-19 as a reason you may wish to purchase this add-on. The cost can vary depending on the insurer, but a quick quote online with one insurer suggests an increase in the price of the insurance by around 50%. If you are worried you\u2019ll die from coronavirus, life insurers in Australia have argued there is nothing in the exclusions to prevent them paying out life insurance in the case of a death from coronavirus. What should I do if I have a trip coming up within Australia? There aren\u2019t yet warnings in Australia about avoiding travel or being out and about in public, save for those who suspect they might have coronavirus, and you can find out what you should do in that situation here. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy has not recommended any changes to how people go about their life in Australia at the moment. The biggest factor to consider in domestic travel is the possibility your flight may be cancelled due to a downturn in the number of flight bookings. If it is a heavily travelled route, then it will likely not be a major inconvenience to book a different flight on the same day, but for routes with fewer flights you could end up with significant delays getting to or from your destination. In that case, the airline may have to refund your flight. It is something the Australian consumer watchdog has been keeping a close eye on. What should I do if I have a trip coming up overseas? The best course of action is to first check the travel advice for where you are planning to travel with the federal government. As of 9 March, Dfat says people should not travel to China, Iran or South Korea, and travel bans remain in place for foreign nationals who have travelled through these countries in the last 14 days. Australians can still return, but will be required to self-isolate. Dfat has also warned Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore and Thailand are at moderate risk for Covid-19. This could change, and more countries could be added to the lists, so it is best to keep an eye on the government advice as you get closer to the travel date. As with domestic flights, it is worth checking in with the airline to ensure you\u2019re not bumped to other flights due to lower bookings and cancellations. What about big conferences? A number of big international conferences like SXSW, Mobile World Congress and various tech conferences have been cancelled over the past two months, and more cancellations are likely. Check your emails and the conference website for updates. A new website, isitcanceledyet.com, is also keeping track. Is there anything I should look for when booking my trip? If you\u2019re not sure whether your trip is going to go ahead, you may be better off booking a fully flexible flight that will allow you to change or cancel the flight and get your money back, and the same for accommodation. When it comes time to travel, check in with the airline to ensure your flight is still going ahead, and the travel advice remains the same for where you\u2019re travelling. Hotels and airlines and other providers are currently offering better cancellation policies than many of the major booking companies due to the downturn in bookings since the crisis started, so best to check the cancellation policy before booking and see if you can get a better offer directly. Several cruise companies such as Regent and Norwegian are now allowing people to cancel bookings as late as 48 hours in advance with 100% refund. Airbnb has also changed its policy on cancellations, now allowing for guests travelling to or from severely impacted areas to cancel without charge, and the same for hosts in, or welcoming guests from, severely impacted areas. People who can\u2019t travel due to travel restrictions or suspected cases of Covid-19 can get a full refunds, hosts won\u2019t incur cancellation fees and it won\u2019t affect their status as a host.",

      "body": "<h2>Saturday 7 March \u2013 8am to 2pm shift</h2> <p>Bleary eyed as usual on an 8am Saturday morning start, I stumble into work, sit down at my desk and sip on the coffee my wonderful colleague has left for me. I glance at the screen and notice the familiar list of 30 patients booked in six hours. Sigh.</p> <p>My first patient, a delightful 11-year-old, smiles at me as she asks whether she is well enough to go to school camp next week after recovering from fevers, a dry cough and a runny nose. \u201cIt\u2019s not coronavirus!\u201d she smiles, her mum mirroring.</p> <p>\u201cIt probably isn\u2019t,\u201d I reply, \u201c but soon we won\u2019t be able to tell the difference.\u201d Her mum asks how I\u2019m coping with it all.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me started. We have been given 100 masks for our patients. I alone see more than 30 a day.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/doctor-who-had-coronavirus-demands-apology-from-victorian-health-minister-over-inaccuracies\">Doctor who had coronavirus demands apology from Victorian health minister over 'inaccuracies'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My next patient is a man in his 50s I haven\u2019t met. \u201cMy daughter thinks I need to start on antidepressants,\u201d he says, before I even get a chance to introduce myself. I steady, have another quick glance at his file and ask him some questions.</p> <p>He answers: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m that bad. My daughter sees you and told me to come talk to you. I\u2019m OK. I just need to get through this.\u201d</p> <p>I start asking more specific questions. He says, \u201cI just work too much, I have no relationship with my wife. I have no time to do my own thing ... The other day a stranger asked how I was and I almost cried.\u201d</p> <p>As his eyes start welling up with tears, I offer some tissues. \u201cYou do sound depressed, and I think you\u2019ve had it for many many years,\u201d I say. \u201cI agree with your daughter that antidepressants will help in your case but we also need to discuss a long-term plan, including a psychologist.\u201d</p> <p>I call my colleague\u2019s room and ask her to see my next patient so I don\u2019t fall too far behind. I know I can\u2019t fully help this man today but I certainly need more than the 10-minute appointment he booked. I turn back to him and assure him that I am here for him.</p> <p>Moments later, I get a frantic knock on my door. It\u2019s my colleague who has just picked up the patient I was meant to see. She\u2019s wearing her N95 mask \u2013 one of only five for each doctor that the government has so diligently provided our practice.</p> <p>My heart sinks. This is it \u2026 my first real foray onto the frontlines of coronavirus. I\u2019ve talked about this moment with colleagues. I\u2019ve tried to read up on it as best as I can. I know where this is going. But do I actually know what I need to do? I am not prepared for this, I think to myself.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a mess. Put on your mask,\u201d she says. \u201cThis should never have gotten past the front door. Public health aren\u2019t picking up their phone! We can\u2019t do this,\u201d she adds. I briefly talk to her patient, a woman in her 30s who has just come back after two weeks in Japan. She has a sniffle. She wants clearance for work because she had this sniffle since before leaving Australia.</p> <p>We decide that she needs a swab and to self-quarantine for 14 days. Not sure if that was the right answer but it sounded reasonable. We quickly send her on towards the nearest private laboratory collection centre that would test for coronavirus \u2013 at least we knew where that was!</p> <p>My colleague panics as the patient leaves. \u201cI\u2019m a diabetic! Will I get it? I didn\u2019t touch her. I wore a mask. How do I clean the room now?\u201d she asks me.</p> <p>I honestly don\u2019t know the correct answer but I have to try. Despite being younger, I am the more senior doctor working today. I decide that we will stop using her room and that she will consult instead in the psychologist\u2019s room. I remind the receptionist of the importance of asking everybody when they walk in whether they have a chance of contracting coronavirus. I ask her to print out some more signs for the front door \u2013 clearly the existing ones weren\u2019t adequate.</p> <p>\u201cHow we clean the room will be for our future selves to figure out,\u201d I think to myself.</p> <p>I let out another sigh, put on a smile before returning to my depressed patient. I finish the consult, promising to see him for a long appointment in the coming few days. He thanks me for taking the time out to listen to him.</p> <p>As I distractedly see my next few patients \u2013 a urinary tract infection, a snotty child (\u201cNo, she does not need antibiotics for her runny nose\u201d) and teaching stretches to two separate patients with muscular back pain \u2013 I try and read up the NSW Health guidelines on how to disinfect the other room. There are pages and pages of information on everything but I don\u2019t find my answer. Where are the flow charts? Where are our clear guidelines? Where do I look now? Do we have a CDC? Do I just google it? Public health won\u2019t answer their phones ... what now?</p> <p>A 26-year-old gentleman comes in next. He is requesting medications for his severe anxiety. He has never been on any before. I know I\u2019m running behind, that again, this will take more than the allotted 10 minutes and the spectre of a \u201ccontaminated\u201d room is still at the back of my mind but I resist the temptation to just write a script and let him go. We talk. We find out about each other and we formulate a plan on how to tackle his anxiety.</p> <p>He walks out happier. If only I could feel the same sense of relief.</p> <p>I send a quick text to vent to a doctor friend. \u201cJust scrub the surfaces,\u201d he says. Yeah OK ... with what? What about the upholstery on the chair? Where are the cleaning materials? I decide to call the practice owner who is working the next day. \u201cI\u2019ll sort it out,\u201d he says. Phew. How will he sort it out? I decide for my sanity not to think about that one.</p> <p>The next patient comes in for a quick issue, but we get talking about coronavirus. He says that it\u2019s probably all hysteria and that his extended family, including elderly parents, were still going ahead with a Greece trip. I burst his bubble. \u201cYou\u2019d likely be fine, and your kids too, but I wouldn\u2019t want my elderly patients potentially being hospitalised overseas without insurance.\u201d</p> <p>Thankfully there is not much more excitement after this and as 2pm approaches I know the end is near. I inject some steroid into a man\u2019s knee. I counsel someone about their worsening diabetes. My final patients are 2- and 4-year-old siblings. They have minor colds. I do my usual virus spiel, safety net and mention that they should all have flu shots this year. Their mother asks me whether they should all be tested for coronavirus for their colds. \u201cProbably not right now ... but who knows what next week\u2019s guidelines will be?\u201d</p> <p>I settle down in my chair and start my usual post-work routine of writing my notes for the day. I hate the thought of typing while consulting, or making a patient wait for a little longer as I finalise notes between patients, so I have always settled for staying back after work.</p> <p>I briefly glance at the news and read the Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos\u2019s comments on Dr Chris Higgins \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/doctor-who-had-coronavirus-demands-apology-from-victorian-health-minister-over-inaccuracies\">how she is \u201cflabbergasted\u201d that a doctor with symptoms has returned to work</a> and insinuating that she would work with AHPRA to make sure the message is spread.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/07/it-isnt-mad-max-police-warning-after-shoppers-brawl-over-toilet-paper-in-sydney\">'It isn't Mad Max': women charged after fight over toilet paper in Sydney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More questions swirl around my head. Is this seriously happening? Did she just throw someone under a bus? If my hayfever goes off tomorrow and I have a sniffle, do I further cripple the frontlines by self-quarantining for two weeks? Did she really say that GP practices are \u201cwell equipped\u201d? Can I really be reported to AHPRA for trying to do the right thing?</p> <p>I am absolutely seething by now. I finish my notes much slower than usual, leaving the now empty medical centre at close to 4pm.</p> <p>I text my girlfriend, telling her I\u2019ll be late to a family dinner and get in my car. I am exhausted. My mind is spent.</p> <p>I am happy to be the frontline in the government\u2019s war with coronavirus but I am being sent out there with no armour, no weapons and no leadership. I am 30 years old, a fully qualified GP, presumably diligent, passionate about primary care and still at the early stages of my career. For the first time in a long, long time I question my choice to become a doctor.</p> <p>I am burnt out.</p> <p>Some days I feel like I sacrifice my time, sanity and energy into looking after other people. But who will look after me?</p>",

There are pages and pages of information on everything but I don\u2019t find my answer. Where are the flow charts? Where are our clear guidelines? Where do I look now? Do we have a CDC? Do I just google it? Public health won\u2019t answer their phones ... what now? A 26-year-old gentleman comes in next. He is requesting medications for his severe anxiety. He has never been on any before. I know I\u2019m running behind, that again, this will take more than the allotted 10 minutes and the spectre of a \u201ccontaminated\u201d room is still at the back of my mind but I resist the temptation to just write a script and let him go. We talk. We find out about each other and we formulate a plan on how to tackle his anxiety. He walks out happier. If only I could feel the same sense of relief. I send a quick text to vent to a doctor friend. \u201cJust scrub the surfaces,\u201d he says. Yeah OK ... with what? What about the upholstery on the chair? Where are the cleaning materials? I decide to call the practice owner who is working the next day. \u201cI\u2019ll sort it out,\u201d he says. Phew. How will he sort it out? I decide for my sanity not to think about that one. The next patient comes in for a quick issue, but we get talking about coronavirus. He says that it\u2019s probably all hysteria and that his extended family, including elderly parents, were still going ahead with a Greece trip. I burst his bubble. \u201cYou\u2019d likely be fine, and your kids too, but I wouldn\u2019t want my elderly patients potentially being hospitalised overseas without insurance.\u201d Thankfully there is not much more excitement after this and as 2pm approaches I know the end is near. I inject some steroid into a man\u2019s knee. I counsel someone about their worsening diabetes. My final patients are 2- and 4-year-old siblings. They have minor colds. I do my usual virus spiel, safety net and mention that they should all have flu shots this year. Their mother asks me whether they should all be tested for coronavirus for their colds. \u201cProbably not right now ... but who knows what next week\u2019s guidelines will be?\u201d I settle down in my chair and start my usual post-work routine of writing my notes for the day. I hate the thought of typing while consulting, or making a patient wait for a little longer as I finalise notes between patients, so I have always settled for staying back after work. I briefly glance at the news and read the Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos\u2019s comments on Dr Chris Higgins \u2013 how she is \u201cflabbergasted\u201d that a doctor with symptoms has returned to work and insinuating that she would work with AHPRA to make sure the message is spread. More questions swirl around my head. Is this seriously happening? Did she just throw someone under a bus? If my hayfever goes off tomorrow and I have a sniffle, do I further cripple the frontlines by self-quarantining for two weeks? Did she really say that GP practices are \u201cwell equipped\u201d? Can I really be reported to AHPRA for trying to do the right thing? I am absolutely seething by now. I finish my notes much slower than usual, leaving the now empty medical centre at close to 4pm. I text my girlfriend, telling her I\u2019ll be late to a family dinner and get in my car. I am exhausted. My mind is spent. I am happy to be the frontline in the government\u2019s war with coronavirus but I am being sent out there with no armour, no weapons and no leadership. I am 30 years old, a fully qualified GP, presumably diligent, passionate about primary care and still at the early stages of my career. For the first time in a long, long time I question my choice to become a doctor. I am burnt out. Some days I feel like I sacrifice my time, sanity and energy into looking after other people. But who will look after me?",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hanage added that there are \u201cboth selfish and societal benefits\u201d to working from home where possible. \u201cThe selfish ones are obvious: if you don\u2019t leave the house you are less likely to be infected.

      "body": "<p>In the face of more than 320 confirmed diagnoses of coronavirus, Britain has almost immediately become as British as possible. A very particular kind of panic now reigns. Last week, we started slow: as a nation, we all learned about this fun new thing called \u201cwashing your hands\u201d, and got so into it that it was bordering on fetishistic. Now we\u2019ve moved on from the \u201cmedically advised prevention\u201d stage and crashed the car straight into \u201cpanicked buying of toilet paper, dry pasta and bleach\u201d, and as a result Tesco and Waitrose have already had to limit how many essential items customers can buy at once. At one point Ocado limited shoppers to a maximum of 24 rolls of toilet paper at any one time, no more. How much more than that you can possibly need, I don\u2019t know.</p> <p>I have a working theory about the root of this shopping stampede groupthink, and it\u2019s the war. There is a prevalent mindset in Britain that a good old war (not one of these new wars, obviously; if a modern war happened right now we\u2019d all be attacked by machine-gun drones and nuked to death in seconds, and the whole thing would be over in about a day and a half), but a proper Vera-Lynn-and-paint-your-tights-on war, would be good for us.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-stockpiling-supermarkets-toilet-paper-hand-gel\">UK supermarkets ration toilet paper to prevent stockpiling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Think how good a war would be. We\u2019d all eat boiled grey mince for four years and solemnly rinse our underwear in our leftover bathwater like the martyrs we are, and we\u2019d bloody well muddle through it, wouldn\u2019t we, because we\u2019re British. I don\u2019t want to say that the people who think Old War Britain would be great are many of the same people who voted for Brexit, but only because I\u2019m not YouGov, and me saying so would be a hunch not backed by data. But if you did the polling, you\u2019d find out that I\u2019m right. The Venn diagram of people who currently have a garage full of toilet roll, those who think national service would \u201csort the youth out, because they have too many iPads\u201d and those who would ideally quite like a wall built between us and France, is basically a Covid-19 virus-particle shaped circle.</p> <p>As supermarket shelves start to clear of essentials, price-gouging has become de rigueur, and that classic marker of an impending crisis, essential items selling for 5,000% of the RRP on eBay, is now in full swing. You can, if you want to, currently buy 49p hand sanitiser for \u00a324.99 a throw on an online auction site. May I offer my hearty congratulations to those eBaying while Rome burns. When the population is decimated and money becomes a meaningless token, I\u2019m sure that \u00a324.50 profit will come in handy in keeping the feral gangs of roadhogs away from your toilet paper fortress.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/09/coronavirus-live-updates-outbreak-italy-lockdown-quarantine-uk-usa-america-australia-recession-fears-update-latest-news\">Coronavirus live updates: fourth death confirmed in UK, as head of New York's airports tests positive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, to stay healthy, it makes more sense to let other people buy soap so they can wash their filthy hands with it instead of me having a stockpile of soap while everyone around me is sick. I mean, I\u2019m no doctor. But then we live in an age of disinformation, and it\u2019s inevitable that that will have a part to play in The Coronapanic. Last month, doctors had to issue a warning to refute a Facebook meme that claimed putting a frozen potato up your hole could cure haemorrhoids.</p> <p>It can be startling to realise that these people are out there, wandering among us, bums full of rosti and hands filthy with germs, and the health of the herd is as reliant on them as it is on you. \u201cThere is no medical evidence that putting frozen potatoes inside the anus can help cure piles,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/doctors-warning-people-not-insert-17802129\" title=\"\">Dr Diana Gall told WalesOnline</a>, \u201cso I would urge caution to anyone thinking of doing it.\u201d Wise words indeed.

      "bodyText": "In the face of more than 320 confirmed diagnoses of coronavirus, Britain has almost immediately become as British as possible. A very particular kind of panic now reigns. Last week, we started slow: as a nation, we all learned about this fun new thing called \u201cwashing your hands\u201d, and got so into it that it was bordering on fetishistic. Now we\u2019ve moved on from the \u201cmedically advised prevention\u201d stage and crashed the car straight into \u201cpanicked buying of toilet paper, dry pasta and bleach\u201d, and as a result Tesco and Waitrose have already had to limit how many essential items customers can buy at once. At one point Ocado limited shoppers to a maximum of 24 rolls of toilet paper at any one time, no more. How much more than that you can possibly need, I don\u2019t know. I have a working theory about the root of this shopping stampede groupthink, and it\u2019s the war. There is a prevalent mindset in Britain that a good old war (not one of these new wars, obviously; if a modern war happened right now we\u2019d all be attacked by machine-gun drones and nuked to death in seconds, and the whole thing would be over in about a day and a half), but a proper Vera-Lynn-and-paint-your-tights-on war, would be good for us. Think how good a war would be. We\u2019d all eat boiled grey mince for four years and solemnly rinse our underwear in our leftover bathwater like the martyrs we are, and we\u2019d bloody well muddle through it, wouldn\u2019t we, because we\u2019re British. I don\u2019t want to say that the people who think Old War Britain would be great are many of the same people who voted for Brexit, but only because I\u2019m not YouGov, and me saying so would be a hunch not backed by data. But if you did the polling, you\u2019d find out that I\u2019m right. The Venn diagram of people who currently have a garage full of toilet roll, those who think national service would \u201csort the youth out, because they have too many iPads\u201d and those who would ideally quite like a wall built between us and France, is basically a Covid-19 virus-particle shaped circle. As supermarket shelves start to clear of essentials, price-gouging has become de rigueur, and that classic marker of an impending crisis, essential items selling for 5,000% of the RRP on eBay, is now in full swing. You can, if you want to, currently buy 49p hand sanitiser for \u00a324.99 a throw on an online auction site. May I offer my hearty congratulations to those eBaying while Rome burns. When the population is decimated and money becomes a meaningless token, I\u2019m sure that \u00a324.50 profit will come in handy in keeping the feral gangs of roadhogs away from your toilet paper fortress. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, to stay healthy, it makes more sense to let other people buy soap so they can wash their filthy hands with it instead of me having a stockpile of soap while everyone around me is sick. I mean, I\u2019m no doctor. But then we live in an age of disinformation, and it\u2019s inevitable that that will have a part to play in The Coronapanic. Last month, doctors had to issue a warning to refute a Facebook meme that claimed putting a frozen potato up your hole could cure haemorrhoids. It can be startling to realise that these people are out there, wandering among us, bums full of rosti and hands filthy with germs, and the health of the herd is as reliant on them as it is on you. \u201cThere is no medical evidence that putting frozen potatoes inside the anus can help cure piles,\u201d Dr Diana Gall told WalesOnline, \u201cso I would urge caution to anyone thinking of doing it.\u201d Wise words indeed. Maybe, for some of us, those rolls of toilet paper will come in handy after all. \u2022 Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant",

It said people who had paid for package holidays not due to begin in the next few days would need to wait to see if the situation changed. </p> <p>While trips beginning immediately should be covered, Abta said it was too early to say that summer holidays could not go ahead as planned. \u201cIf you cancel early you may have to pay cancellation charges,\u201d it added.</p> <h2>How do I check the latest travel advice?</h2> <p>The government\u2019s outbound guidance could be crucial for many trips \u2013 not least because airlines may cancel flights, or at the least travel insurance could be invalidated. When the government advises against all but essential travel, that means airlines and bonded holiday firms are usually obliged to refund bookings to that destination.</p> <p>The key page for British citizens is the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\">Foreign Office travel advice page</a>; for Australians, the <a href=\"https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/\">Smart Traveller site</a>; and for the US, the <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html\">State Department page</a>.

The real test will be whether Easter and summer fares tumble too. </p> <h2>What about travelling within the UK?</h2> <p>Transport authorities are following Public Health England advice and have said that they do not expect to see public transport closed, and that the risk of contagion is no greater on trains or buses than in any public space. The bigger threat to services for which Transport for London and others are planning is any outbreak among crucial employees who are unable to self-isolate or work from home \u2013 not least drivers, crew and other frontline staff.</p> <h2>What about sport? What big sporting fixtures are under threat?</h2> <p>The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport held a much trailed meeting with sporting bodies and broadcasters on Monday. It doesn\u2019t seem to have changed much. \u201cBased upon the current scientific advice from the government\u2019s medical experts, there is no rationale to close or cancel sporting events as things stand,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said.</p> <p>That means the Cheltenham festival goes ahead this week and Premier League matches will be played in front of paying crowds. The Six Nations rugby fixture between Wales and Scotland will also take place, in contrast to France against Ireland and Italy against England, which have been postponed.</p> <h2>Will this position change?</h2> <p>Almost certainly. It appears government is reluctant to cancel events unless necessary, perhaps understandable given the amount of interest and revenue attached to UK sport. The UK\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, has also downplayed the value in shutting down large gatherings. But while countries across the world are either cancelling events or playing them behind closed doors, and with the spread of the virus expected to accelerate, pressure will mount on UK bodies to soon follow suit.</p> <h2>Will I be able to watch matches played behind closed doors?</h2> <p>All eyes here are on the Premier League. The UK\u2019s most popular competition is determined to keep the show on the road, but increasingly those within football expect some matches to be driven behind closed doors. If that happens, there have been widely reported suggestions that every match would then be shown on TV, breaking a decades-old understanding that Saturday 3pm matches could not be broadcast live. it is understood that those games would only be available on pay-TV, however, through partners Sky and BT Sport. You would need a subscription to watch.</p> <h2>Is it true that older people could be banned from football?</h2> <p>This was one rather unexpected line that was briefed ahead of the meeting, with Crystal Palace\u2019s 72-year-old manager, Roy Hodgson, subsequently wondering what it might mean for him. In the official summary of Monday\u2019s meeting, however, the proposal was not mentioned.</p> <h2><strong>What\u2019s the latest on theatres, cinemas and festivals?</strong></h2> <p>Britain\u2019s leading theatres are remaining open for now. The National Theatre and Leeds Playhouse are both going ahead with shows as planned, for example, while the Society of London Theatres \u2013 which represents the West End \u2013 said: \u201cOfficial advice states that there is currently no clear rationale to cancel events.\u201d</p> <p>Glastonbury festival currently says it \u201ccontinues to plan and prepare\u201d for the event scheduled for 24-28 June. The Association of Independent Festivals, representing 65 UK events including Victorious, Boomtown, Field Day and Liverpool Sound City, said \u201cthere is no rationale\u201d to cancel events yet. Its chief executive, Paul Reed, added: \u201cWe appreciate that public health advice can change from hour to hour. Our members will adapt accordingly.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, organisers of the Cannes film festival \u2013 scheduled to begin in two months \u2013 say they are still working as normal even though public gatherings of more than 1,000 are banned in France indefinitely. The SXSW festival was cancelled on Saturday.</p> <h2><strong>Will festivalgoers be covered if events are cancelled?</strong></h2> <p>Ticket holders will be entitled to refunds if events are cancelled, though these payouts could seriously harm festivals without insurance cover for communicable disease. Michael Rawlings, underwriting manager at Event Insurance Services, told the Guardian that \u201cvery few people would have had the foresight\u201d to add on the specialist cover.</p>",

This week, despite the shadow cast by the coronavirus and much uncertainty in recent days over whether it would happen at all, the attendance over four days should reach 250,000 or more, as it has for the past three years, and there will be huge relief mixed with the jubilation as the grandstand greets the start of the Supreme Novice Hurdle with its traditional, blood-curdling roar.</p> \n<p>For those with no interest in the sport of kings, it is just another race meeting. For devotees of jumping, it is Christmas for grown-ups, the fixture in the calendar that is anticipated like no other, and a large part of its appeal is that the more it grows and changes, the more it stays the same. Despite the huge increase in attendance and the many thousands of city dwellers who will cram on to trains at Paddington this week, Cheltenham remains a celebration of jump racing and its country roots.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/09/paul-townend-gold-cup-ruby-walsh-willie-mullins-cheltenham-festival-horse-racing-interview\">Paul Townend: 'Every jockey wants to have Ruby Walsh\u2019s success'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The faces change, of course, on both sides of the running rail, but the core audience for the Festival is still essentially the same, and many at the course on Tuesday will remember the bitter disappointment of losing the Festival to foot-and-mouth in 2001.

Because racing gets a slice of bookmakers\u2019 profits, not their turnover, and a run of winning favourites can put a seven-figure dent in the sport\u2019s income. In January last year, racing was on course to make \u00a389m from its levy on betting profits by the end of March. The eventual figure was \u00a378m, and around half of the \u00a311m hole was thought to result from a golden eight-race run for the punters on the second and third afternoons when seven favourites and a second-favourite \u2013 including Altior, Paisley Park and Frodon \u2013 did the business.</p> \n<p>An even sprinkling of winning favourites over the four days keeps turnover ticking over and interest kindled.

And while the Cheltenham Festival has survived, there is no way to know how the coming weeks will unfold. The Grand National in three weeks\u2019 time, when Tiger Roll is due to go for an unprecedented third consecutive victory, is far from certain to go ahead as planned.</p> \n<p>But that, like so much else for racing fans in Cheltenham Festival week, is for another day. Will the coronavirus be on the minds of racegoers? Of course. Will it affect the attendance? Perhaps. But will it be allowed to get in the way? No chance at all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"804a8ded-7dc0-4328-a36f-b539948ec9ce\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nicky Henderson hopes that Altior can be persuaded to believe in his recovery from lameness as the trainer desperately tries to get his star ready for Wednesday's Queen Mother Champion Chase.

I think a lot of it is, he actually needs to sort of get a bit of belief in himself again. It\u2019s nothing like as sore, so the horse just needs to believe.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Sunday\u2019s setback for Altior, winner of the Champion Chase for the last two years, threatens to rob this week\u2019s Cheltenham Festival of its most anticipated clash. The three-way battle between him, Defi Du Seuil and Chacun Pour Soi has been widely anticipated for months.</p>\n    <p>\u201cIf it continues to improve as much as it has done since last night to this morning, he\u2019s got every chance,\u201d added Henderson, who said he was in -regular contact with British Horseracing Authority vets as to Altior\u2019s progress. \u201cWe have to give him every chance, it\u2019s only right. If it was today, no you wouldn\u2019t [run], but the improvement has been significant enough to justify leaving him in and seeing how we are going tomorrow. If necessary, we\u2019ll have to take it to the wire.\u201d</p>\n    <p>The going at Cheltenham on Monday was described as soft, good to soft in places but 5mm of forecast overnight rain is expected to make it soft all round for Tuesday's action. <b>Chris Cook</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

He was joined by <strong>Prof Chris Whitty</strong>, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and <strong>Sir Patrick Vallance</strong>, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Ministers will within a fortnight advise anyone with a fever or a mild respiratory tract infection to stay at home for seven days, Whitty revealed.</strong> He said that the government was not giving out this advice now, because the chances of someone with a fever now having coronavirus are very low, he said. But he said that would change very quickly. Soon the number of infections would rise \u201creally quite fast\u201d, he said. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are now very close to the time, probably within the next 10 to 14 days, when the modelling would imply we should move to a situation where everybody with even minor respiratory tract infections or a fever should be self-isolating for a period of seven days.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This advice is likely to have huge repercussions for workplaces across the country.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson stressed that it was important for the government not to implement its delay and mitigating measures too early. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is absolutely critical in managing the spread of this virus that we take the right decisions at the right time based on the latest and the best evidence, so we mustn\u2019t do things which have no or limited medical benefit, nor things which could turn out actually to be counter-productive.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He sounded more defensive on this point than he was when he held a press conference last week, reflecting the fact that the government is starting to face criticism for allegedly being too complacent. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said that he was no longer shaking hands.</strong> Last week he was still shaking hands, but he said at today\u2019s Commonwealth Day service he was advised against this. He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We were all given an instruction not to shake hands and there\u2019s a good reason for not shaking hands, which is that the behavioural psychologists say that if you don\u2019t shake somebody\u2019s hand then that sends an important message to them about the importance of washing your hands.</p> \n   <p>So there\u2019s a subliminal cue there to everybody to wash your hands, which is, I think I\u2019m right in saying ... far more important.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty refused to comment on suggestions that 2m people might be hospitalised. </strong>He said figures like this were \u201clargely speculative\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said that from tomorrow the government would start screening everyone arriving at hospital with a respiratory illness for coronavirus.</strong> Until now people have only been screened if they are in intensive care and have coronavirus-type symptoms, he said. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said the aim of the measures to be introduced by the government would be to lower the mortality rate of those in the at-risk group by 20 to 30%</strong>. But he said it would be wrong to try to \u201csuppress\u201d the disease completely because it could result in a winter outbreak at a time of maximum pressure for the NHS. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What you can\u2019t do is suppress this thing completely, and what you shouldn\u2019t do is suppress it completely because all that happens then is it pops up again later in the year when the NHS is at a more vulnerable stage in the winter and you end up with another problem.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> \n  <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T18:11:14.216Z\">at 6.11pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e667c738f085f0b8d945198\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T17:29:53.057Z\">5.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is what <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> said at the start of his press conference.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I want to stress the following things.

In <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/08032001.pdf\">his interview with Andrew Marr (pdf)</a> yesterday <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>, the new chancellor, was unable to give a very good answer. He said that levelling up was about \u201cspreading opportunity\u201d (something to which almost every government in the democratic age has been committed). When Marr pressed him on this again, and asked how he would measure \u201clevelling up\u201d, Sunak replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You\u2019ll be able to, of course, measure it in the stats of income growth and everything else. You\u2019ll be able to measure it in whether we\u2019re making our investments in infrastructure as we\u2019ve said ... But, as I say, it\u2019s about a feeling that people have that where they happen to be born, where they happen to grow up is not going to be the determinant of how well they do in life. It\u2019s because, wherever they are, we\u2019ve provided them with the opportunities. Whether it\u2019s through education, whether it\u2019s through skills, whether it\u2019s through a better bus connection that gets them to a better job, we\u2019re doing all of that, and that\u2019s meant that their life is better off.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This morning the<strong> </strong><strong>Institute for Fiscal Studies</strong> has published <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14747\">a useful briefing note</a> looking at what \u201clevelling up\u201d could mean in practice. It could mean raising regional investment spending to the level in London, but this would cost a fortune, it says. Ben Zaranko, who wrote the briefing, explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Currently, investment spending per head is higher in London than anywhere else in the country: \u00a31,456 per head in London, versus an average of \u00a3891 in the rest of the UK, and just \u00a3621 per head in the East Midlands.. Transport, which will be of particular importance for productivity growth, is a key driver of differences in spending across the country: at \u00a3653 per head, transport investment is 2.5 times higher in London than the average \u00a3260 per head in the rest of the UK.</p> \n   <p>Rewriting the rules that govern which projects receive funding to place greater weight on regional equity could be one way of rebalancing government investment away from London and the South East, and towards other parts of the country. \u2018Levelling up\u2019 in this respect could come with a hefty price tag: raising transport investment per head across the UK to the current London level would mean spending an extra \u00a319bn per year.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Zaranko says \u201clevelling up\u201d could also be taken to mean ensuring every region in the UK gets the same total spending per head. But this would not benefit the regions that need it most, he says, because it would mean increasing spending in areas like the south east of England that need it less than other regions.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T12:15:28.660Z\">at 12.15pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e662c118f087df56e4c4ef0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T11:51:10.518Z\">11.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For an alternative view, this is what the Labour MP <strong>Khalid Mahmood</strong> says about Trevor Phillips\u2019s suspension from the party in a foreword to the Policy Exchange report published this morning.

The letter is quite long and detailed, but it accuses Phillips of breaking four specific party rules, all relating to Islamophobia or prejudice against race and religion generally. To justify these allegations, the letter cites numerous alleged offensive passages, which come from five sources:<a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/transcript-tory-conference-islamophobia-fringe-20375360\"> a transcript of a Tory conference fringe event on Islamophobia</a>, an <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2019/05/how-much-do-we-really-have-in-common/\">article for Unherd</a>, a Mail report of <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3418620/Muslims-not-like-just-accept-never-integrate-says-former-racial-equalities-chief-Trevor-Phillips.html\">what Phillips said at Policy Exchange event</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/survey-reveals-chasm-between-muslim-values-and-rest-of-uk-d30hl55lk\">report</a> quoting what Phillips said in an article in the Sunday Times, and <a href=\"http://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/Race-and-Faith.pdf\">a report (pdf)</a> Phillips wrote for the Civitas thinktank four years ago, called Race and Faith: The Deafening Silence.</p> \n  <p>Some of the alleged offensive remarks are very particular: a reference to Enoch Powell\u2019s Rivers of Blood speech, which Phillips says is taken out of context, and a joke by Phillips about being nominated for \u201cIslamophobe of the year\u201d by an Iranian human rights body. But most of the complaints relate to two sorts of comment that Phillips has been making in recent years.</p> \n  <p>First, Phillips has argued that Muslims see the word differently and that they have not integrated as much as other immigrant communities. Here are two of the quotes in the Labour letter cited as evidence of Phillips breaking party rules. The first is about him, and the second is from the Civitas report he wrote.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Muslim communities are not like others in Britain and the country should accept they will never integrate, the former head of the equalities watchdog has claimed. Trevor Phillips, the former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said it was disrespectful to assume that Muslim communities would change. He told a meeting at the Policy Exchange think tank in Westminster on Monday that Muslims \u2018see the world differently from the rest of us\u2019.</p> \n   <p>At a recent conference of Muslim scholars, I had the privilege of addressing a hundred or so people at a leading British university. Most of the audience were Muslims themselves. The event took place just a few days before Remembrance Sunday. I noted that just three people in the room displayed a poppy, myself, a (white) journalist and one Muslim attendee. Raising the point, I could see the incomprehension on the faces of those without poppies; they weren\u2019t meaning to offend, but as a group, they couldn\u2019t see why they should wear what \u2013 I imagine \u2013 they think of as a symbol of war. The same day, I visited an industrial site \u2013 where many immigrants, mostly African and Eastern Europeans, were working. Poppies were everywhere. The norms in these two places were wholly different. One group had clearly adapted to the mainstream; the other had not.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Second, Phillips has highlighted the involvement of Muslim men in child grooming scandals in England, and in harassment incidents in Germany. Here is one of the relevant quotes cited by Labour in the letter as evidence of Phillips breaking party rules. It is from the Civitas report he wrote:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But the most sensitive cause of conflict in recent years has been the collision between majority norms and the behaviours of some Muslim groups. In particular, the exposure of systematic and longstanding abuse by men, mostly of Pakistani Muslim origin in the North of England.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In his response Phillips says the Labour letter came as \u201csomething of a surprise\u201d. He says that he will need more time to respond in detail, he suggests come of the comments have been taken out of context, and he asks why he is being disciplined for comments that in some cases were made several years ago. And he stresses his own background as someone who has confronted Islamphobia. He asks:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Did the disputes committee know of, or consider the specific context of the allegations? For example, did the committee discuss the likelihood that a party member of over a quarter of a century\u2019s standing, who is himself a person of colour, and whose family heritage includes almost a thousand years of adherence to Islam, would either deliberately or accidentally make any statements that are racist or Islamophobic? </p> \n   <p>Were the committee provided with any information as to the commissioning and publication of the Runnymede Trust\u2019s 1997 report on Islamophobia; the Parekh Report of 2000 which called for incitement to racial hatred to be extended to protect Muslims; or the successful efforts by the Commission for Racial Equality to bring about the passage (by the last Labour government) of the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, protecting Muslims inter alia from acts of incitement? I was chair of each organisation in the relevant periods and personally commissioned and launched the two reports referred to.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6612ac8f087df56e4c4dfc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T10:01:22.542Z\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Thinktank publishes letter from Labour to Trevor Phillips explaining his suspension</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Policy Exchange, a rightwing thinktank, has this morning published <a href=\"https://policyexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/The-Trial-the-strange-case-of-Trevor-Phillips.pdf\">a report (pdf)</a> on the Labour party accusations against Trevor Phillips called The Trial: the strange case of Trevor Phillips.

On Thursday morning it may have been, for most people, business as usual. But no one would say that four days later.

He says that he is perplexed by the charge that he is guilty of Islamophobia (a term that he says he actually introduced into British politics) and he says his suspension could be evidence of Labour turning into \u201ca brutish, authoritarian cult\u201d. He says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So what accounts for this extraordinary turn of events? Some will see it as payback by Corbynistas for public criticisms I made of the leadership\u2019s failure to tackle antisemitism in the party. Another possibility is that it\u2019s an attempt to scare the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which I used to lead and which is investigating Labour\u2019s handling of antisemitism. Weaponising Islamophobia to attack political opponents may seem like clever tactics but trying to intimidate a legally independent organisation is pure political gangsterism. Perhaps someone in Labour HQ has been reading up on the Inquisition\u2019s methods; in 1578, one official defined its purpose thus: \u201cThat others may become terrified and weaned away from the evils they would commit.\u201d</p> \n   <p>I accept that I may not share all the views of Labour\u2019s current leader or even of the majority of members.

      "bodyText": "Here are the main points from the press conference held by Boris Johnson. He was joined by Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. Ministers will within a fortnight advise anyone with a fever or a mild respiratory tract infection to stay at home for seven days, Whitty revealed. He said that the government was not giving out this advice now, because the chances of someone with a fever now having coronavirus are very low, he said. But he said that would change very quickly. Soon the number of infections would rise \u201creally quite fast\u201d, he said. He went on: We are now very close to the time, probably within the next 10 to 14 days, when the modelling would imply we should move to a situation where everybody with even minor respiratory tract infections or a fever should be self-isolating for a period of seven days. This advice is likely to have huge repercussions for workplaces across the country. Johnson stressed that it was important for the government not to implement its delay and mitigating measures too early. He said: It is absolutely critical in managing the spread of this virus that we take the right decisions at the right time based on the latest and the best evidence, so we mustn\u2019t do things which have no or limited medical benefit, nor things which could turn out actually to be counter-productive. He sounded more defensive on this point than he was when he held a press conference last week, reflecting the fact that the government is starting to face criticism for allegedly being too complacent. Johnson said that he was no longer shaking hands. Last week he was still shaking hands, but he said at today\u2019s Commonwealth Day service he was advised against this. He explained: We were all given an instruction not to shake hands and there\u2019s a good reason for not shaking hands, which is that the behavioural psychologists say that if you don\u2019t shake somebody\u2019s hand then that sends an important message to them about the importance of washing your hands. So there\u2019s a subliminal cue there to everybody to wash your hands, which is, I think I\u2019m right in saying ... far more important. Whitty refused to comment on suggestions that 2m people might be hospitalised. He said figures like this were \u201clargely speculative\u201d. Whitty said that from tomorrow the government would start screening everyone arriving at hospital with a respiratory illness for coronavirus. Until now people have only been screened if they are in intensive care and have coronavirus-type symptoms, he said. Vallance said the aim of the measures to be introduced by the government would be to lower the mortality rate of those in the at-risk group by 20 to 30%. But he said it would be wrong to try to \u201csuppress\u201d the disease completely because it could result in a winter outbreak at a time of maximum pressure for the NHS. He said: What you can\u2019t do is suppress this thing completely, and what you shouldn\u2019t do is suppress it completely because all that happens then is it pops up again later in the year when the NHS is at a more vulnerable stage in the winter and you end up with another problem. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is what Boris Johnson said at the start of his press conference. I want to stress the following things. First, we are doing everything we can to combat this outbreak based on the latest scientific and medical advice. Second, we have a truly brilliant NHS where staff have responded with all the determination, compassion and skill that makes their service so revered across the world and they will continue to have this government\u2019s full support, my support, in tackling this virus on the front line. Third, we will set out further steps in the days and weeks ahead to help people protect themselves, their family and in particularly the elderly and vulnerable. Finally, while it is absolutely critical in managing the spread of this virus that we take the right decisions at the right time based on the latest and the best evidence, so we mustn\u2019t do things which have no or limited medical benefit, nor things which could turn out actually to be counter productive, there is no hiding from the fact that the coronavirus outbreak will present significant challenges for the UK just as it does in other countries. But if we continue to look out for one another, to pull together in a united and national effort, I have no doubt that we can and will rise to that challenge. Johnson is wrapping up now. He says he hopes he has explained why the somewhat counter-intuitive decision not to cancel sporting events etc has been taken. And he says the government will give out more advice later this week. He says other measures will prove necessary. But timing of these measures is crucial. This is a big national challenge, and it will become a bigger one, he says. But he says it is obvious to him that \u201cwe know how to defeat it\u201d. He says he wants to be as transparent as possible. And that\u2019s it. He has finished. I will post a summary soon. Vallance says the government hopes that the measures it is taking will reduce the death rate amongst those most at risk by 20 or 30%. He says it is not possible to suppress the disease completely. And he says that would not be desirable, because that would just lead to the disease popping up again later. Q: Have you stopped shaking hands? Johnson says, at the Commonwealth Day service today, people were advised not to shake hands. Not shaking hands sends out a subliminal message, he says; it tells people that hands may be dirty. But he says washing hands is more important than not shaking hands. Johnson says he is no longer shaking hands. At his press conference last week, he said he was still shaking hands with people. Whitty says, when the government does ask people to stay at home (see 5.04pm) if they have a fever or a mild respiratory tract infection, they will be asked to stay at home for seven days. Q: Are people who are stockpiling being prudent? And are you confident you will be able to keep the shelves stocked? Johnson says it is important for people to behave responsibly and to think of others. He says more advice will be released to the public within the next few days. Johnson urges anyone thinking of stockpiling to \u201cbehave responsibly\u201d and to think of others. Johnson says this will become a much more significant outbreak than it currently is. But it is important to take the necessary steps \u201cat the right time\u201d, he says. Q: Other governments are taking more drastic steps now. Is that due to political pressure? And are you sure we should not be doing the same thing? Johnson says the epidemiology may be different in one country from another. When the government moves into the delay phase, it won\u2019t abandon the contain mode either, he says. Whitty says, as you start in delay phase, most of the things you will do will be things you were doing when you were in the contain phase too. Whitty says, in an average year, about 8,000 people die from flu. He says at the moment the ratio between people with coronavirus and people with other respiratory diseases is very low. But that will change soon, he says. He says coronavirus will soon spread \u201creally quite fast\u201d. Whitty says soon coronavirus will spread \u201creally quite fast\u201d. Whitty says within about 10 to 14 days the government will advise people with even minor respiratory tract infections or a fever to self-isolate. But is because by that point the chances of their having coronavirus will be much higher than they are now. UPDATE: Here is some video. Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, is speaking now. He says the government is going to start testing all people in intensive care, and all people in hospital with respiratory conditions, for coronavirus. He says the government will soon reach the point where it needs to ask people to change their behaviour. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, is speaking now. He says the government wants to push the peak of the outbreak into the summer. He says a series of actions have been modelled. They will be reviewed through SAGE, the scientific advisory group for emergency. The actions can be modelled for their efficacy, he says. He says it is important to act at the right time. If you tell people now with a sniffle to go into isolation, you will catch a lot of people who do not have coronavirus. Vallance says it is important to introduce measures to delay the spread of coronavirus \u201cat the right time in the right combinations\u201d. Boris Johnson is holding a press conference now. He says Cobra, the government\u2019s emergency committee, received a briefing this morning from Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. Johnson says the UK is still \u201cin the contain phase of the outbreak\u201d. But he says the scientists have said \u201ccontainment is extremely unlikely to work on its own.\u201d He says the government is now preparing to move to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase of the coronavirus action plan. Earlier the House of Commons and the House of Lords commissions held a joint meeting to discuss coronavirus. Afterwards they released this statement. The commissions of both houses met today to discuss parliament\u2019s response to coronavirus. There are no plans to suspend parliament. We continue to act entirely in line with the advice of Public Health England and the Speakers and political leadership of both houses are keeping the situation under constant review. Back in the Commons the Tory Philip Hollobone asks why the UK is not banning flights from northern Italy. Because there are many Britons there who want to come home, says Hancock. And because the evidence suggests that banning flights does not work. He points out that Italy banned flights from China, and that that did not work. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is (like Rory Stewart) accusing the government of being too complacent about coronavirus. Rory Stewart, the former Tory cabinet minister who is now running as an independent candidate for London mayor, has said that the government should be acting \u201cmuch more aggressively\u201d to contain coronavirus and that schools should be shut now. In a statement he said: The government has made a serious mistake today. They should be acting much more aggressively to contain coronavirus. Schools should be shut now. If the government are not prepared to shut them now, they should - at the very least - state clearly and transparently what their triggers will be for closing schools over the next few days. All medium and large gatherings should be cancelled. All passengers coming from hotspots should be tested and quarantined. There is no excuse for passengers not being tested off a plane from Milan last night. There is no justification for half-hearted measures. The government and the Mayor keep saying they are simply following \u201cscientific advice\u201d. But the scientists are clear that this is now a political decision - on whether the government are prepared to spend very serious sums of money, and take a large economic hit, to maximise protection of the population. China shows both the dangers of acting too slowly - at first - and then the benefits of acting decisively. We should have no regrets about spending money to do the absolute maximum to prevent the spread of this disease. Downing Street said earlier that it thought there was not point testing passengers returning to the UK from Northern Italy because temperature tests on arrival were not effective. (See 1.17pm.) From Politics Home\u2019s Matt Honeycombe-Foster From my colleague Rowena Mason From Sky\u2019s Tom Rayner Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, told Hancock that he thought the public needed to know what the government\u2019s central estimate was of how many people would die from coronavirus. Hancock told Hunt that he would reflect on this, but that there were lots of uncertainties. Yesterday the Sunday Times (paywall) claimed that 100,000 was the government\u2019s central estimate for the death toll. It said: Officials in Whitehall last week began describing a 100,000 figure as the \u201ccentral estimate\u201d of the potential death toll, according to a source involved in the preparations, rather than the previously publicised worst case scenario of 500,000 deaths if 80% of the population were infected ... A second official said the \u201cballpark\u201d figure for expected deaths across all councils was \u201cin the region of 100,000\u201d. That includes those likely to die from seasonal flu, which averaged 17,000 over the past five years. One official who has been involved in the planning said: \u201cThe central estimate of deaths is about 100,000. Everyone has been focusing on the worst case but this is what the experts actually expect to happen. Some of those people would have died of other flus.\u201d The figure is just under half the number of British deaths to Spanish flu in 1918, the worst modern pandemic. Covid-19 has already infected 80,000 people in China, killing more than 3,000 of its population of almost 1.4 billion. Italy, with a 60 million population, has suffered more than 200 deaths from some 5,800 cases. The UK had 209 cases by last night with two deaths. Here are the main points from Matt Hancock\u2019s response to the urgent question on coronavirus. Hancock said there have now been four deaths from coronavirus in the UK. The fourth fatality has only just been announced. He said as of this morning there had been 319 cases of coronavirus in the UK. He said the UK would \u201cmake the right choices of which action to pursue at the right moment\u201d. It would be a mistake to act too early, he said: The scientific advice is clear: acting too early creates its own risk. So we will do what is right to keep people safe. Guided by the science, we will act at the right time. He said the number of cases in China and South Korea was still rising, but at a slowing rate. But he said the number of cases in Iran, Italy, Switzerland, France and Germany was growing. In Italy there were 1,492 more cases overnight, and 102 more deaths. He said Public Health England had tested nearly 25,000, and the time taken to carry out tests was being reduced. He said the government was making available an extra \u00a346m to find a vaccine and develop more rapid diagnostic tests. He said the NHS was \u201cwell prepared\u201d, with record numbers of doctors and nurses. He said an extra 700 people had been taken on to help the 111 phone line take calls. He said responding to coronovirus was a \u201cnational effort\u201d and everyone would have to play their part. For members of the public, that meant washing hands and following public health advice. But it could also mean volunteering, he said. He said the government would soon bring forward emergency legislation to help people and services deal with the outbreak. The bill would be \u201ctemporary and proportionate\u201d, he said. He said the government was taking action to help Britons on the Grand Princess cruise ship off the coast of California to come home. Hancock says the government will soon bring forward legislation to give the government emergency powers to deal with coronavirus. Hancock says an extra 700 people have been taken on to help on the 111 phone line. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is responding to an urgent question on coronavirus now. He says this morning there were 319 cases in the UK. And now there have been four deaths, he says. The Muslim Council for Britain has put out a formal statement about Trevor Phillips\u2019 suspension from Labour. (See 9.18am.) A spokesperson said: Mr Phillips has made incendiary statements about Muslims that would be unacceptable for any other minority. Many of these sweeping generalisations are unfounded, wildly exaggerated and are familiar tropes taken up by the far right. He has claimed Muslims do not report terrorism, despite the poll he cited showing Muslims report terrorism more than the general public. He likened placing a Christian girl into a foster care with a Muslim family as akin to \u201cchild abuse\u201d; and further propagates the othering of Muslims, claiming Muslims are \u201cnot like us\u201d, \u201csee the world differently\u201d and are a \u201cnation within a nation\u201d. The impact of Mr Phillips claims from a privileged vantage point is dangerous, providing licence to far-right ideologues such as Tommy Robinson who have seized upon these remarks. Mr Phillips would have us believe that he is a martyr for free speech and tolerance. But the fact remains that the deployment of these sweeping generalisations and tropes would not be acceptable for any other community. We are not commenting on the internal processes of the Labour Party, its choices or prioritisation of this case versus others. We expect the Party to follow appropriate process and investigate its members over all allegations of Islamophobia, and all other types of racism. The government is facing a possible revolt by Tory MPs tomorrow because some of them will be backing an amendment to telecoms legislation saying ministers should eliminate all Huawei technology from the UK\u2019s mobile phone networks by the end of 2022. Earlier this year the government announced it would let the Chinese firm supply up to 35% of the new 5G network. Asked about the possible vote (we don\u2019t know yet whether the amendment will be called), the prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists at the lobby briefing that the government would eventually like to stop having to use any Huawei technology in its telecoms network. He said: We are clear-eyed about the challenged posed by Huawei, which is why are are banning them from sensitive and critical parts of the network and setting a strict 35% cap on market share. We will also keep that 35% market cap under review. We want to get to a position where we do not want to have to use a high-risk vendor [ie, Huawei] in our telecoms network. And on the subject of the trade talks with the EU, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister who is overseeing the \u201cfuture partnership\u201d stage of Brexit, has issued a parliamentary written statement about the first round of the talks that ended on Thursday last week. Here is an excerpt. Discussions in some areas identified a degree of common understanding of the ground that future talks could cover. In other areas, notably fisheries, governance and dispute settlement, and the so-called \u201clevel playing field\u201d, there were, as expected, significant differences. The next negotiating round will take place on 18-20 March in London. The UK expects to table a number of legal texts, including a draft FTA, beforehand. During a press conference this morning Urusla von der Leyen, the European commission president, said the UK had to make up its mind about what it wanted from the talks on the post-Brexit trade relationship with the EU. She said: We are aware that there are differences in the approach towards what scope should the future agreement have and what are - if I may say so - the rules of the game everybody has to abide to. So it will be important that the United Kingdom makes up its mind; the closer they want to have access to the single market, the more they have to play by the rules that are the rules of the single market. If this is not the UK\u2019s choice, then of course they will be more distant and it will be more difficult for the UK to access the single market. So I think it\u2019s up to the United Kingdom within the negotiations to think about the trade-offs they want to take into account. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said that the Von der Leyen was wrong to say that the UK had not made up its mind. He said: I think the UK has made up its mind very decisively, and has been very clear about what it wants from its future relationship with the EU. The UK\u2019s position is the one which secured a significant majority for the prime minister in the December general election. (The No 10 spokesman is right to say that the UK has made up its mind. As the government\u2019s own document [pdf] setting out its position in the talks makes clear, it has resolved the \u201chigh alignment/low autonomy v low alignment/high autonomy\u201d dilemma in favour of as much autonomy as possible. \u201cWhatever happens, the government will not negotiate any arrangement in which the UK does not have control of its own laws and political life,\u201d the document says. A more accurate criticism would be that the government has not yet been fully open with business and with the public about what the implications of this decision are.) We\u2019re getting an urgent question on coronavirus at 3.30pm. There is a summary of all the main coronavirus lines from the No 10 lobby briefing here. But the Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom sums it all up in a single tweet here. Q: Is the government committed to retaining free school meals for the under 7s? The spokesman says he is not aware of any suggestion that it isn\u2019t. When it is put to him that this has been seen as a budget option, he says he has not seen that, and won\u2019t comment on budget matters. And that\u2019s it. The briefing is over. Q: Do you think the EU is listening to what the UK wants from the Brexit talks? Ursula von der Leyen said this morning the UK needed to make up its mind what it wants? The spokesman says the UK has been very clear about what it wants. Q: Does the government support the bid by Tory MPs to impose a deadline by which Huawei\u2019s involvement in 5G should end? The spokesman says, although the government has set a 35% cap on Huawei\u2019s involvement, it wants to reduce this, so that the UK isn\u2019t reliant on Huawei. Q: Why did the PM say last year he had a plan for social care when it was clear from the letter sent out on Friday that there is no plan? That is a reference to this letter. The spokesman says the government is trying to find a consensus. A significant amount of work has taken place on this, he says. Q: Does the PM have a plan? A significant amount of work has taken place, the spokesman says. Q: This morning Oliver Dowden suggested cabin crew staff were getting training to spot symptoms. But the union that represents them denied this? The spokesman says he thinks staff have been given advice on this. Q: Will people brought back from the Grand Princess have to go into isolation? The spokesman says the passengers themselves will be told first. Q: Didn\u2019t the CMO tell elderly people on Thursday to stay away from public places? The spokesman says he does not have the CMO\u2019s words to hand, but whatever he said would have been sensible, the spokesman says. (The CMO actually said in future older people would be told to avoid public spaces.) Q: Are elderly people being told they do not need to stay at home? The spokesman says the government will be led by the evidence. If there is any further advice, it will be issued. Q: What advice is being issued to them at the moment? To wash their hands thoroughly, says the spokesman. Q: How will the government identify people must vulnerable to the disease? And what about elderly people who may not be online? The spokesman says the government is aware of this. He says advice will be issued in due course. This issue is being \u201cactively worked on\u201d, he says. Q: Are there any plans to test people arriving in the UK for coronavirus? The spokesman says the government has been issuing advice to people returning from specific areas. He says temperature checks on arrival are not effective. He says the government has an evidence-based, clinical approach to this. The spokesman says the government has been very transparent so far in terms of publishing information. That will continue, he says. Q: What did you mean when you said earlier that the virus will spread in a significant way? The spokesman says the number of cases is increasing. We have had the first fatalities in the UK, and it is clear that it is spreading in country. Q: Is there a meeting planned between the government and Premier League broadcasters? The spokesman says DCMS held a meeting with a range of sporting bodies this morning. But he says sporting events are not being cancelled at this point. The spokesman says the environment department will be speaking to supermarket companies about what measures can be taken to ensure supplies to shops. Q: Is the PM worried about the stock market crash? The spokesman says the Bank of England has said it will take all steps necessary to protect the economy. He says the underlying fundamentals of the economy are strong. Q: Would the PM urge people to stop panic buying? The spokesman refers to what the PM said yesterday. He says the UK has a \u201cresilient supply change\u201d. The government will work to ensure that remains the case. Q: What do you say to people who will be looking at what is happening in the UK and concluding the government is slow to act? The spokesman says the government has been working on the basis of the best medical and scientific advice. It will continue to do that, he says. Q: Does the PM have a message for people panic buying? The spokesman says the PM commented on this yesterday. He says there was no need for people to do this. Q: Will the local elections be delayed? The spokesman says this is a matter for the Electoral Commission to advise on, but he says he is not aware of any plans for this. The spokesman says the Foreign Office is working intensively with the US authorities on what can be done to bring home the 142 Britons on the Grand Princess cruise ship. Q: Why did it take the Foreign Office so long to update its travel advice after the Italian quarantine decision? The spokesman says the Foreign Office went through its normal decision making progress. Q: Is the government considering stopping flights to the UK from the quarantined areas in Italy? The spokesman says anyone returning to the UK from the quarantined areas of Italy should self-isolate, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms. And anyone returning to the UK from other parts of Italy should self-isolate if they develop symptoms. Q: When is the government likely to announce further measures? The spokesman says he does not want to pre-empt what happens. But he expects a SAGE meeting tomorrow, and a further Cobra meeting on Wednesday. Q: Will you be giving out advice aimed at specific age groups? The spokesman says, when the government does issue advice, it will come from the experts. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman is here. He says the PM has been chairing Cobra. The chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser were there. A range of measures to contain and delay the spread of coronavirus were discussed. Later the PM will give a reading at the Commonwealth Day memorial service. Greg Hands, the international trade minister, is visiting New York and Washington. James Cleverly, the Foreign Office minister, is in Algiers. And Wendy Morton, another Foreign Office minister, is in Argentina. The spokesman says Cobra was still going on as he left for the briefing, and so he says a full briefing on what was agreed will come later. But he says at this stage the government is not calling for sporting events to be cancelled. Q: Are we in the contain or delay phase? The spokesman says we are in the contain phase, but it is accepted that the disease will spread at speed. Q: When the CMO advises that we have moved to the delay phase, does he take the decision? Or is it ultimately up to the PM? The spokesman says the PM has been clear that he will be led by the scientific advice. He says it is important that any steps to delay the disease are introduced at the optimum time. He says the government\u2019s plan talks about the need to achieve the greatest possible impact on containing the spread of the disease, while minimising the social cost. Q: Will there be a meeting of SAGE (scientific advisory group for emergencies) today? The spokesman says it is more likely to come tomorrow. Q: Does the government agree with the WHO director who says it is vital to takle the disease aggressively early on? The spokesman says the government believes in following the scientific advice. I\u2019m at 9 Downing Street for the regular morning lobby briefing, which is due to start at 12.30pm. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman will be briefing on normal government business, but also on this morning\u2019s meeting of the Cobra emergency committee, chaired by Boris Johnson, to discuss coronavirus. The embargo on the briefing is normally lifted soon after it starts. One of the main aims of Boris Johnson\u2019s government is to \u201clevel up\u201d Britain and the budget on Wednesday may by the first big chance for the government to show what it actually means (or it would have been, if circumstances had not evolved to mean that it will largely become a coronavirus rescue plan instead). But what does \u201clevelling up\u201d actually mean, and how will anyone be able to tell in 2024 whether it has been accomplished successfully. In his interview with Andrew Marr (pdf) yesterday Rishi Sunak, the new chancellor, was unable to give a very good answer. He said that levelling up was about \u201cspreading opportunity\u201d (something to which almost every government in the democratic age has been committed). When Marr pressed him on this again, and asked how he would measure \u201clevelling up\u201d, Sunak replied: You\u2019ll be able to, of course, measure it in the stats of income growth and everything else. You\u2019ll be able to measure it in whether we\u2019re making our investments in infrastructure as we\u2019ve said ... But, as I say, it\u2019s about a feeling that people have that where they happen to be born, where they happen to grow up is not going to be the determinant of how well they do in life. It\u2019s because, wherever they are, we\u2019ve provided them with the opportunities. Whether it\u2019s through education, whether it\u2019s through skills, whether it\u2019s through a better bus connection that gets them to a better job, we\u2019re doing all of that, and that\u2019s meant that their life is better off. This morning the Institute for Fiscal Studies has published a useful briefing note looking at what \u201clevelling up\u201d could mean in practice. It could mean raising regional investment spending to the level in London, but this would cost a fortune, it says. Ben Zaranko, who wrote the briefing, explains: Currently, investment spending per head is higher in London than anywhere else in the country: \u00a31,456 per head in London, versus an average of \u00a3891 in the rest of the UK, and just \u00a3621 per head in the East Midlands.. Transport, which will be of particular importance for productivity growth, is a key driver of differences in spending across the country: at \u00a3653 per head, transport investment is 2.5 times higher in London than the average \u00a3260 per head in the rest of the UK. Rewriting the rules that govern which projects receive funding to place greater weight on regional equity could be one way of rebalancing government investment away from London and the South East, and towards other parts of the country. \u2018Levelling up\u2019 in this respect could come with a hefty price tag: raising transport investment per head across the UK to the current London level would mean spending an extra \u00a319bn per year. Zaranko says \u201clevelling up\u201d could also be taken to mean ensuring every region in the UK gets the same total spending per head. But this would not benefit the regions that need it most, he says, because it would mean increasing spending in areas like the south east of England that need it less than other regions. For an alternative view, this is what the Labour MP Khalid Mahmood says about Trevor Phillips\u2019s suspension from the party in a foreword to the Policy Exchange report published this morning. (See 10.01am and 11.10am.) Mahmood says: It was with no small measure of astonishment that I learnt that my own party, the Labour party, had initiated proceedings against Trevor Phillips on grounds of \u2018racism\u2019 and \u2018Islamophobia\u2019. The charges are so outlandish as to bring disrepute on all involved in making them; and I fear they further add to the sense that we, as a party, have badly lost our way. Mahmood links what has happened to Phillips to his opposition to the definition of Islamophobia drawn up by the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on British Muslims. Mahmood, a member of that APPG, says he also thinks its definition of Islamophobia is not fit for purpose. For the record, here is the APPG\u2019s definition. Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness. And these are from Sayeeda Warsi, the former Conservative party chair, who is a longstanding campaigner against Islamophobia in her own party and elsewhere. She does not mention Trevor Phillips by name, but it is fairly obvious that her comments are aimed at him. These are from Miqdaad Versi, a spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain, on the Trevor Phillips\u2019 suspension. The Policy Exchange report (pdf) includes the text of the letter sent to Trevor Phillips by Labour\u2019s governance and legal unit explaining why he has been suspended for alleged Islamophobia. The letter is quite long and detailed, but it accuses Phillips of breaking four specific party rules, all relating to Islamophobia or prejudice against race and religion generally. To justify these allegations, the letter cites numerous alleged offensive passages, which come from five sources: a transcript of a Tory conference fringe event on Islamophobia, an article for Unherd, a Mail report of what Phillips said at Policy Exchange event, a report quoting what Phillips said in an article in the Sunday Times, and a report (pdf) Phillips wrote for the Civitas thinktank four years ago, called Race and Faith: The Deafening Silence. Some of the alleged offensive remarks are very particular: a reference to Enoch Powell\u2019s Rivers of Blood speech, which Phillips says is taken out of context, and a joke by Phillips about being nominated for \u201cIslamophobe of the year\u201d by an Iranian human rights body. But most of the complaints relate to two sorts of comment that Phillips has been making in recent years. First, Phillips has argued that Muslims see the word differently and that they have not integrated as much as other immigrant communities. Here are two of the quotes in the Labour letter cited as evidence of Phillips breaking party rules. The first is about him, and the second is from the Civitas report he wrote. Muslim communities are not like others in Britain and the country should accept they will never integrate, the former head of the equalities watchdog has claimed. Trevor Phillips, the former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said it was disrespectful to assume that Muslim communities would change. He told a meeting at the Policy Exchange think tank in Westminster on Monday that Muslims \u2018see the world differently from the rest of us\u2019. At a recent conference of Muslim scholars, I had the privilege of addressing a hundred or so people at a leading British university. Most of the audience were Muslims themselves. The event took place just a few days before Remembrance Sunday. I noted that just three people in the room displayed a poppy, myself, a (white) journalist and one Muslim attendee. Raising the point, I could see the incomprehension on the faces of those without poppies; they weren\u2019t meaning to offend, but as a group, they couldn\u2019t see why they should wear what \u2013 I imagine \u2013 they think of as a symbol of war. The same day, I visited an industrial site \u2013 where many immigrants, mostly African and Eastern Europeans, were working. Poppies were everywhere. The norms in these two places were wholly different. One group had clearly adapted to the mainstream; the other had not. Second, Phillips has highlighted the involvement of Muslim men in child grooming scandals in England, and in harassment incidents in Germany. Here is one of the relevant quotes cited by Labour in the letter as evidence of Phillips breaking party rules. It is from the Civitas report he wrote: But the most sensitive cause of conflict in recent years has been the collision between majority norms and the behaviours of some Muslim groups. In particular, the exposure of systematic and longstanding abuse by men, mostly of Pakistani Muslim origin in the North of England. In his response Phillips says the Labour letter came as \u201csomething of a surprise\u201d. He says that he will need more time to respond in detail, he suggests come of the comments have been taken out of context, and he asks why he is being disciplined for comments that in some cases were made several years ago. And he stresses his own background as someone who has confronted Islamphobia. He asks: Did the disputes committee know of, or consider the specific context of the allegations? For example, did the committee discuss the likelihood that a party member of over a quarter of a century\u2019s standing, who is himself a person of colour, and whose family heritage includes almost a thousand years of adherence to Islam, would either deliberately or accidentally make any statements that are racist or Islamophobic? Were the committee provided with any information as to the commissioning and publication of the Runnymede Trust\u2019s 1997 report on Islamophobia; the Parekh Report of 2000 which called for incitement to racial hatred to be extended to protect Muslims; or the successful efforts by the Commission for Racial Equality to bring about the passage (by the last Labour government) of the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, protecting Muslims inter alia from acts of incitement? I was chair of each organisation in the relevant periods and personally commissioned and launched the two reports referred to. Policy Exchange, a rightwing thinktank, has this morning published a report (pdf) on the Labour party accusations against Trevor Phillips called The Trial: the strange case of Trevor Phillips. You can get the gist of it from the subtitle, which is \u201cHow the accusation of Islamophobia is used to stifle free speech\u201d. Phillips has said he is not allowed under Labour rules to disclose the exact nature of the charges against him, but miraculously Policy Exchange has managed to get hold a copy of the party\u2019s letter to Phillips explaining why he has been suspended. It is published in the report as an appendix, along with Phillips\u2019 response. I will post a summary soon. Here is Trevor Phillips\u2019 interview with the Today programme where he was asked about comments he has made that triggered the Labour party\u2019s decision to suspend him for alleged Islamophobia. Our write-up of the interview is here. George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor who now edits the Evening Standard in London, told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning that if he were delivering the budget on Wednesday, he would focus on providing short-term help for businesses and individuals affected by the coronavirus outbreak. If I was chancellor, and I\u2019m sure Rishi [Sunak] is thinking like this, I don\u2019t want some complicated scheme that is going to be working in six months\u2019 time. I need to use the tools that are available to me right now to help people who are unable to work because their business has shut or they are self-isolating or they have got the virus, and to help those small and medium-sized businesses that will have very limited cash reserves and therefore could go into bankruptcy. It is a short-term help. It is not like we are going to have 10 years of this. Osborne also hinted that he would like to be writing the budget speech himself, because he also used the interview to road test exactly the sort of cheesy metaphor he used to deploy himself when he was chancellor. He said: If I was chancellor of the exchequer, I would make this a Budget for the coronavirus, I would do everything I could to vaccinate the economy against what is going to happen. If we can\u2019t vaccinate people against what is going to happen, I would provide the cash for businesses and individuals that don\u2019t have it at the moment because of the impact of the virus, and try and provide that immunity to the economy going forward. Good morning. On Thursday last week Boris Johnson told ITV that \u201cthe most important message at this stage, as we start to see [coronavirus] spread, is ... as far as possible, it should be business as usual for the overwhelming majority of people in this country\u201d. Journalists who make bold assertions are often taught to include some \u201ccover\u201d in the remarks, some qualification that protects them against the possibility of being 100% wrong, and for Johnson the three words \u201cat this stage\u201d proved very useful. On Thursday morning it may have been, for most people, business as usual. But no one would say that four days later. As ever, Jack Blanchard has a good summary of where we are in his London Playbook briefing. The oil price crashed 30% when markets opened this morning \u2026 as Asian stock markets and US bond yields tumbled dramatically \u2026 after Italy sealed off 16m people from the outside world \u2026 and France banned all large gatherings of people \u2026 and Germany recommended doing the same \u2026 while the number of coronavirus cases in Britain leapt by more than 30% in one day \u2026 and a third Briton died after contracting the virus \u2026 and we now have Tesco rationing the sale of basic groceries \u2026 and it\u2019s still only 7 am on Monday morning. Goodness knows what else this week will bring. We are covering the main coronavirus developments on a special coronavirus outbreak live blog which Frances Perraudin is writing this morning. You can read it here. And Graeme Wearden is covering this morning\u2019s most dramatic development - the stock market has crashed - on his business live blog. I will be covering some Westminster coronavirus developments here, but our lead coverage on this will be on the coronavirus blog, and so I will be looking at other stories too. Of which the most remarkable is - Labour\u2019s decision to suspend Trevor Phillips, a former head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, for alleged Islamophobia. My colleagues Peter Walker and Sam Gelder have the story here. Phillips has written about his suspension in an article (paywall) for the Times. He says that he is perplexed by the charge that he is guilty of Islamophobia (a term that he says he actually introduced into British politics) and he says his suspension could be evidence of Labour turning into \u201ca brutish, authoritarian cult\u201d. He says: So what accounts for this extraordinary turn of events? Some will see it as payback by Corbynistas for public criticisms I made of the leadership\u2019s failure to tackle antisemitism in the party. Another possibility is that it\u2019s an attempt to scare the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which I used to lead and which is investigating Labour\u2019s handling of antisemitism. Weaponising Islamophobia to attack political opponents may seem like clever tactics but trying to intimidate a legally independent organisation is pure political gangsterism. Perhaps someone in Labour HQ has been reading up on the Inquisition\u2019s methods; in 1578, one official defined its purpose thus: \u201cThat others may become terrified and weaned away from the evils they would commit.\u201d I accept that I may not share all the views of Labour\u2019s current leader or even of the majority of members. But I have never belonged to any other party and I have stuck by it through thick and thin. If this is how Labour treats its own family, how might it treat its real opponents if it ever gains power again? It would be a tragedy if, at the very moment we most need a robust and effective opposition, our nation had to endure the spectacle of a great party collapsing into a brutish, authoritarian cult. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Boris Johnson chairs a meeting of the government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee to discuss the coronavirus outbreak. 11am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech ahead of the budget on Wednesday. 12.30pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. 12.30pm: Executives from Google give evidence to the Lords democracy and digital technologies committee. 2.30pm: Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "body": "<p>As coronavirus has spread globally since February, a tenuous balancing act has been attempted in Britain and much of the rest of the world. Governments have assured populations that necessary precautions and preparations are being undertaken to deal with the potential pandemic. The media has, by and large, resisted the temptation to sensationalise and overdramatise the crisis. Most of the rites of early spring have been observed: at the weekend, London train stations thronged with English and Welsh rugby supporters. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/08/crufts-skijoring-kissing-best-photos-of-the-weekend\" title=\"\">dachshund called Maisie won Crufts</a>.</p> <p>This approach has been understandable, as efforts and hopes are concentrated on containing the virus. But this strange state of pseudo-normality was shattered on Monday. Following a Cobra meeting \u2013 chaired for the first time by Boris Johnson \u2013 the government\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said that coronavirus in Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/04/prof-chris-whitty-the-expert-we-need-in-the-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">will soon spread \u201creally quite fast</a>\u201d.

      "bodyText": "As coronavirus has spread globally since February, a tenuous balancing act has been attempted in Britain and much of the rest of the world. Governments have assured populations that necessary precautions and preparations are being undertaken to deal with the potential pandemic. The media has, by and large, resisted the temptation to sensationalise and overdramatise the crisis. Most of the rites of early spring have been observed: at the weekend, London train stations thronged with English and Welsh rugby supporters. A dachshund called Maisie won Crufts. This approach has been understandable, as efforts and hopes are concentrated on containing the virus. But this strange state of pseudo-normality was shattered on Monday. Following a Cobra meeting \u2013 chaired for the first time by Boris Johnson \u2013 the government\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said that coronavirus in Britain will soon spread \u201creally quite fast\u201d. Meanwhile, global stock markets collapsed at a rate that recalled Black Monday in 1987. Increasingly, the sense is one of queasily living on the brink of a crisis that will be both lethal and transformative. Monday\u2019s market meltdown suggested it will shine a pitiless light on some of the economic assumptions and complacencies of the post-crash decade. The immediate source of investor panic around the world was the decision by Saudi Arabia to enter into an oil price war with Russia.

      "bodyText": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have bid au revoir, if not goodbye, to formal royal life after carrying out their final public engagement in the UK as senior working members of the royal family. Harry and Meghan attended the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on Monday \u2013 their first appearance alongside senior family members since their shock announcement in January that they would be stepping back from official duties. Unlike last year, when the Sussexes took part in the Queen\u2019s formal procession through the nave of the abbey, this time they were ushered to their seats ahead of her entrance. In an 11th-hour change of plan, William and Kate also did not join the Queen\u2019s procession, although they had been due to according to the order of service, which was signed off and printed before the decision to change was made on Sunday. Buckingham Palace offered no explanation for the switch. All eyes were on the Sussexes as they joined the Queen, Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Earl and Countess of Wessex for the celebration. From 31 March, they will retain but not use their HRH styles and live mainly in North America as they pursue their ambition to become financially independent. Harry, who colour-coordinated his jacket lining to match his wife\u2019s emerald green Emilia Wickstead dress, looked solemn and pensive at times during the hour-long service. Meghan, who married into the royal family less than two years ago, smiled broadly and curtsied to the Queen and Charles from the couple\u2019s second-row seats at the high altar. She gave a small wave to William and Kate as the Cambridges took up their seats in front. Coronavirus meant handshakes were not exchanged at the abbey. The Queen resorted to head bows, while Charles adopted a \u201cnamaste\u201d pose with his palms pressed together. As the Sussexes left the service, Harry elbow-bumped Craig David, and Meghan hugged Alexandra Burke after both singers had performed. The couple stopped to congratulate Anthony Joshua, the two-time heavyweight boxing world champion, on his eloquent address reflecting on being a \u201cchild of the Commonwealth\u201d and his British and Nigerian heritage. Joshua had told the congregation: \u201cLike me, so many children of the Commonwealth have two homes and two identities, two cultures and two ways of viewing the world. Some have more than two. \u201cThese days we hear so much about division and difference that some might be tempted to see that as a bad thing. But, on the contrary, it\u2019s a beautiful thing, a thing to be celebrated and cherish, and a great source of peace and stability.\u201d His words seemed to resonate with Meghan, the first biracial member of the royal family, who later engaged in animated conversation with the boxer. She and Harry then got into their car, which whisked them off to their uncertain future. It is not known when they will next appear in public in the UK. They are said to be \u201cpositive and excited\u201d about carving new roles, and are expected to announce news of their plans in the near future. Boris Johnson and his pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds, were among a congregation of senior politicians, high commissioners, ambassadors, faith leaders and schoolchildren. One notable absentee was the Duke of York, who has stepped down from public life after the fallout from his TV interview on his friendship with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. The Queen\u2019s decision to invite the Sussexes is said to have been very important to them. Although they are unable to formally represent the Queen, and will not play as large a role in the Commonwealth as she might have hoped, they will still be involved through charity work. They remain the president and vice-president of the Queen\u2019s Commonwealth Trust, which supports young global leaders.",

The nation has the highest number of cases and deaths in Europe. On Monday night \u2013 after the death toll rose from 366 to 463 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/italian-hospitals-short-beds-coronavirus-death-toll-jumps\">experts warned</a> that the hospital system in some areas was in danger of collapse \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/giuseppe-conte\">Giuseppe Conte</a>, the prime minister, told people to \u201cstay at home,\u201d as he banned all public gatherings \u2013 including Serie A football matches.</p> \n<p>In Germany, which reported its first two deaths from the virus on Monday, the health minister, Jens Spahn, appealed for people to work from home and walk or cycle rather than use public transport. Spahn asked people to make hard choices to help avoid the risk of overburdening the country\u2019s health service.</p> \n<p>Advice and approaches have diverged widely across Europe and the Middle East as governments struggle to contain the rapidly escalating epidemic.</p> \n<p>In the Middle East, Israel took the extreme decision to place anyone arriving from overseas into quarantine for 14 days, Saudi Arabia closed off air and sea travel to 14 affected countries and Iraq banned all public gatherings and called on citizens to avoid visiting sacred cities.</p> \n<p>Authorities in Madrid announced that all kindergartens, schools and universities would be closed for two weeks, as the number of cases and around the Spanish capital jumped from 202 to 469 in 24 hours. Authorities in the Basque country also announced the closure of educational centres around the regional capital, Vitoria, where the second-worst cluster has been identified.</p> \n<p>Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, said that with the virus spreading in so many countries, the threat of a pandemic had become \u201cvery real\u201d as he called for aggressive measures\u201d to counter it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a09a661-0ee2-41ea-b0a0-9e1deefd9268\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Amid mounting anxiety, EU leaders also announced they would hold a teleconference on Tuesday to discuss their next steps to try to slow the epidemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe longer we can slow down the development of the virus, the better,\u201d Spahn said at a press conference at a hospital in Berlin, warning that the restrictions people would face in their daily lives \u201cwould last for months rather than weeks\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery individual should weigh up and decide what is easier to avoid and what is harder,\u201d he said, adding that going to work was more important than going to a football match.</p> \n<p>Spahn added that he was opposed to shutting schools and kindergartens because that would leave tens of thousands of medical staff unable to go to work, which would have a hugely detrimental effect on the health system.</p> \n<p>In the UK, meanwhile, Boris Johnson and senior advisers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/09/matt-hancock-under-fire-from-mps-over-uk-coronavirus-response\">defended the government\u2019s response to the crisis.</a></p> \n<p>The prime minister rejected calls for harsher quarantine measures and a ban on mass gatherings, arguing that the best advice so far was still simply for people to wash their hands. \u201cContainment is very unlikely to work on its own and that is why we are making preparations for a move to the delay phase,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said lots of measures that \u201cseem intuitive turn out to have very little effect\u201d and one of those was screening travellers from high-risk areas at airports.</p> \n<p>In other developments on Monday:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>In the Republic of Ireland, all St Patrick\u2019s Day parades, including Dublin\u2019s main celebration that draws about 500,000 revellers each year from all over the world, were cancelled due to the risk of a further coronavirus spread.</p></li> \n <li><p>Cyprus, which was the last EU country to be virus-free, reported its first case.</p></li> \n <li><p>French culture minister Franck Riester contracted the novel coronavirus and is staying in his Paris home but is \u201cdoing fine\u201d, his office said.</p></li> \n <li><p>Vietnam decided to temporarily suspend visa-free travel for citizens from eight European countries \u2013 Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the UK.</p></li> \n <li><p>Iran announced another 43 people had died, pushing the death toll to 237 amid 7,161 confirmed cases.

      "bodyText": "Governments across Europe have warned their citizens that the coronavirus outbreak could lead to months of serious disruption, as figures for deaths and infections rose sharply again on Monday and new measures were announced restricting large gatherings. Italy\u2019s government has extended emergency measures across the entire country in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. The nation has the highest number of cases and deaths in Europe. On Monday night \u2013 after the death toll rose from 366 to 463 and experts warned that the hospital system in some areas was in danger of collapse \u2013 Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister, told people to \u201cstay at home,\u201d as he banned all public gatherings \u2013 including Serie A football matches. In Germany, which reported its first two deaths from the virus on Monday, the health minister, Jens Spahn, appealed for people to work from home and walk or cycle rather than use public transport. Spahn asked people to make hard choices to help avoid the risk of overburdening the country\u2019s health service. Advice and approaches have diverged widely across Europe and the Middle East as governments struggle to contain the rapidly escalating epidemic. In the Middle East, Israel took the extreme decision to place anyone arriving from overseas into quarantine for 14 days, Saudi Arabia closed off air and sea travel to 14 affected countries and Iraq banned all public gatherings and called on citizens to avoid visiting sacred cities. Authorities in Madrid announced that all kindergartens, schools and universities would be closed for two weeks, as the number of cases and around the Spanish capital jumped from 202 to 469 in 24 hours. Authorities in the Basque country also announced the closure of educational centres around the regional capital, Vitoria, where the second-worst cluster has been identified. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, said that with the virus spreading in so many countries, the threat of a pandemic had become \u201cvery real\u201d as he called for aggressive measures\u201d to counter it. Amid mounting anxiety, EU leaders also announced they would hold a teleconference on Tuesday to discuss their next steps to try to slow the epidemic. \u201cThe longer we can slow down the development of the virus, the better,\u201d Spahn said at a press conference at a hospital in Berlin, warning that the restrictions people would face in their daily lives \u201cwould last for months rather than weeks\u201d. \u201cEvery individual should weigh up and decide what is easier to avoid and what is harder,\u201d he said, adding that going to work was more important than going to a football match. Spahn added that he was opposed to shutting schools and kindergartens because that would leave tens of thousands of medical staff unable to go to work, which would have a hugely detrimental effect on the health system. In the UK, meanwhile, Boris Johnson and senior advisers defended the government\u2019s response to the crisis. The prime minister rejected calls for harsher quarantine measures and a ban on mass gatherings, arguing that the best advice so far was still simply for people to wash their hands. \u201cContainment is very unlikely to work on its own and that is why we are making preparations for a move to the delay phase,\u201d he said. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said lots of measures that \u201cseem intuitive turn out to have very little effect\u201d and one of those was screening travellers from high-risk areas at airports. In other developments on Monday: In the Republic of Ireland, all St Patrick\u2019s Day parades, including Dublin\u2019s main celebration that draws about 500,000 revellers each year from all over the world, were cancelled due to the risk of a further coronavirus spread. Cyprus, which was the last EU country to be virus-free, reported its first case. French culture minister Franck Riester contracted the novel coronavirus and is staying in his Paris home but is \u201cdoing fine\u201d, his office said. Vietnam decided to temporarily suspend visa-free travel for citizens from eight European countries \u2013 Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the UK. Iran announced another 43 people had died, pushing the death toll to 237 amid 7,161 confirmed cases. The government said it had released 70,000 prisoners because of the coronavirus outbreak. Scores of foreign tourists and Egyptian crew remained quarantined aboard a Nile cruise ship, from which 45 suspected coronavirus cases have been evacuated. The Israeli move was interpreted domestically as a measure to avoid irking Donald Trump. The country already requires travellers arriving from more than a dozen countries to spend two weeks in home isolation, effectively killing off incoming tourism. Following outbreaks in the US, pressure had been building to add it to the list. But rather than extending the rules specifically on US travellers, and risk an angry backlash from the White House, Israel has instead broadened the policy to the entire planet. Italy\u2019s government has imposed a virtual lockdown across much of its wealthy northern regions at the centre of the contagion in an effort to contain the virus. Its top sports body on Monday called for all sports events to be cancelled until 3 April. Tensions in its overcrowded jails erupted on Monday over new containment measures, with riots in at least two dozen prisons and the deaths of six inmates who broke into an infirmary and overdosed on methadone. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte cited Winston Churchill as evidence that great nations persevere when the going gets tough. \u201cThese days, I have been thinking about the old speeches of Churchill \u2013 it is our darkest hour but we will make it,\u201d Conte told La Repubblica newspaper. In France, the worst affected European country outside Italy, the person in charge of one of the world\u2019s busiest air transport hubs, Paris\u2019s Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports, was among those to be infected. The two Paris airports are among the busiest air hubs in the world, with more than 100 million people passing through every year. The disclosure that Augustin de Romanet had tested positive followed days of rumours in the French media speculating whether Charles de Gaulle airport, Europe\u2019s second busiest, may have been linked to the spread of the virus in France. Officials in France have been warning it is inevitable that the country would have to go to stage three in its epidemic response shortly. Reports suggested that would involve closing schools, putting its health system on an emergency footing, and perhaps even closure of mass transit systems. Meanwhile, in the US, where there have been a rapidly accelerating number of infections, federal and state officials in California were preparing on Monday to receive thousands of people from a cruise ship that has been idling off the coast of San Francisco, with at least 21 people onboard infected with the coronavirus.

      "body": "<p>It was the worst day for share prices since the financial crash of 2008, but Monday\u2019s action felt entirely rational. Financial risks have fundamentally changed for the worse, even over the course of a weekend. And, since aggressive risk-taking has been rewarded for years by free-and-easy central banks, a sudden rush for safety always had the potential to become ugly.</p> <p>Back in the post-Lehman days, one could glimpse a route out of the mess. The banking system would be bailed out by governments to save economies; states\u2019 balance sheets would take the strain. A healthcare crisis caused by the spread of a deadly virus is plainly different and investors are also having to recognise a couple of hard economic and political truths.</p> <p>First, monetary handouts will be of limited use in preventing the arrival of a global recession, if that\u2019s what\u2019s now on the cards, and will do nothing to hasten the arrival of a vaccine. The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates only a week ago, an action that already feels like an exercise in singing the wrong words to the wrong tune. Worse, by pressing the emergency button at the first whiff of worry in markets, the Fed advertised policy-makers\u2019 panic.</p> <p>Second, the outbreak of a price war in the oil market has demonstrated a breakdown in international cooperation. In place of the gathering of grown-ups at the G20 summit in 2008, investors now see political tensions, opportunism and, so far, no sign of policy coordination, even within the eurozone.</p> <p>An unpredictable Saudi leader is playing games of brinkmanship with President Putin. Moscow, meanwhile, spies an opportunity to put the debt-laden US shale industry out of business, albeit at a hefty short-term cost to its own budget and currency. And the US president is still pretending he\u2019s an epidemiologist and is tweeting about \u201cfake news\u201d as the Dow Jones opens down 2,000 points.</p> <p>On the plus side, the 20% plunge in the price of Brent holds the promise that recovery from the coronavirus crisis could be swift. A combination of cheap oil, low interest rates and free-spending governments usually reignites growth, and there is no reason to think the formula won\u2019t work again eventually (though let us hope that de-carbonisation measures don\u2019t become a casualty).</p> <p>Yet the dislocations beforehand also matter \u2013 and on that score we wait for the market to spit out its losers in the weeks ahead. Any fund with an oversized bet that the Opec oil cartel would hold a firm line on production will be nursing heavy losses.</p> <p>Over-leveraged companies that were betting their survival on the junk bond market are waking up to radically changed circumstances. Last week\u2019s marginal refinancing proposals will look unfeasibly optimistic in the current climate; as with Flybe last week, governments won\u2019t be able to help all corporate casualties. And the stock market looks essentially closed for fundraising until further notice.</p> <p>Note that banks have not been spared in the sell-off. There\u2019s no reason (so far) to doubt regulators\u2019 assurances that a better-capitalised system can withstand most knocks, including a sudden global recession, but the market can smell loans turning sour rapidly.

      "bodyText": "It was the worst day for share prices since the financial crash of 2008, but Monday\u2019s action felt entirely rational. Financial risks have fundamentally changed for the worse, even over the course of a weekend. And, since aggressive risk-taking has been rewarded for years by free-and-easy central banks, a sudden rush for safety always had the potential to become ugly. Back in the post-Lehman days, one could glimpse a route out of the mess. The banking system would be bailed out by governments to save economies; states\u2019 balance sheets would take the strain. A healthcare crisis caused by the spread of a deadly virus is plainly different and investors are also having to recognise a couple of hard economic and political truths. First, monetary handouts will be of limited use in preventing the arrival of a global recession, if that\u2019s what\u2019s now on the cards, and will do nothing to hasten the arrival of a vaccine. The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates only a week ago, an action that already feels like an exercise in singing the wrong words to the wrong tune. Worse, by pressing the emergency button at the first whiff of worry in markets, the Fed advertised policy-makers\u2019 panic. Second, the outbreak of a price war in the oil market has demonstrated a breakdown in international cooperation. In place of the gathering of grown-ups at the G20 summit in 2008, investors now see political tensions, opportunism and, so far, no sign of policy coordination, even within the eurozone. An unpredictable Saudi leader is playing games of brinkmanship with President Putin. Moscow, meanwhile, spies an opportunity to put the debt-laden US shale industry out of business, albeit at a hefty short-term cost to its own budget and currency. And the US president is still pretending he\u2019s an epidemiologist and is tweeting about \u201cfake news\u201d as the Dow Jones opens down 2,000 points. On the plus side, the 20% plunge in the price of Brent holds the promise that recovery from the coronavirus crisis could be swift. A combination of cheap oil, low interest rates and free-spending governments usually reignites growth, and there is no reason to think the formula won\u2019t work again eventually (though let us hope that de-carbonisation measures don\u2019t become a casualty). Yet the dislocations beforehand also matter \u2013 and on that score we wait for the market to spit out its losers in the weeks ahead. Any fund with an oversized bet that the Opec oil cartel would hold a firm line on production will be nursing heavy losses. Over-leveraged companies that were betting their survival on the junk bond market are waking up to radically changed circumstances. Last week\u2019s marginal refinancing proposals will look unfeasibly optimistic in the current climate; as with Flybe last week, governments won\u2019t be able to help all corporate casualties. And the stock market looks essentially closed for fundraising until further notice. Note that banks have not been spared in the sell-off. There\u2019s no reason (so far) to doubt regulators\u2019 assurances that a better-capitalised system can withstand most knocks, including a sudden global recession, but the market can smell loans turning sour rapidly. Shares in Lloyds Banking Group, which has passed all recent stress tests with ease, are down almost 30% since mid-February. The big-picture analysis from Mohamed El-Erian, economic adviser to German insurer Allianz, sounds correct: markets are struggling to find something to cling to. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be messy because we\u2019ve basically lost all our anchors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lost the economic anchor with the coronavirus. We\u2019ve lost the policy anchor with people losing confidence in the Fed\u2019s ability to turn things around. And over the weekend, we lost a market anchor with Opec\u201d. El-Erian\u2019s advice for private investors, incidentally, is that \u201cthere will be opportunities, but they\u2019re not now\u201d. That also feels roughly right. The stock market was probably too high in the first place, so a 20% fall in global share prices since mid-February needs to be seen in context; it could easily get worse. It\u2019s win-win for the executive crew Interesting tweet from Robert Talbut, former chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management: \u201cDisturbing to hear that already some corporates are asking for their incentives/bonuses to be rebased because of coronavirus!\u201d If this is correct, it would be outrageous since, as Talbut says, the executive crew never asks for higher hurdles when Lady Luck smiles upon them \u2013 Persimmon being the prime exhibit. The whisper, though, has a ring of truth about it. Never underestimate a boardroom\u2019s ability to plead that prizes must be awarded in all circumstances.",

      "bodyText": "By 11am on Monday, the atmosphere on the London trading floor of spread-betting firm ETX Capital was electric. Extra staff had been drafted in amid a surge in trading after oil prices plunged overnight and European markets tumbled due to coronavirus fears. The usual day team of two or three traders had bulked up to nearly a dozen. Traders at the Liverpool Street office were glued to their phones, behind a wall of screens, their voices being drowned out by terminals bleating out alerts \u2013 dings, slide whistles and simulated space gun blasts \u2013 signalling fresh market moves and a flurry orders from clients. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen anything like this since the financial crisis,\u201d said Michael Baker, who leads ETX Capital\u2019s sales team. The firm blocked small investors from buying US stock futures due to fears that retail clients would lose too much money by taking a punt and buying on the dip. It ended up being the right call \u2013 with US futures plunging further once limits on sales were temporarily removed. The room was tense as staff prepared for the opening Wall St bell at 1:30pm. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d one dealer said. Within minutes, the S&amp;P 500 was halted from trading due to a 7% fall at the open. Traders shouted across banks of desks, yelling out trades as they tried to work out which stocks were still open for orders. \u201cI can\u2019t buy mate, it\u2019s limit down,\u201d one trader yelled. \u201cJust tried to buy the Nasdaq \u2013 but I can\u2019t,\u201d said another. One trader\u2019s computer was firing off notifications that sounded like an air raid siren. \u201cI\u2019m working to sell 100 [stocks],\u201d one trader yelled. One client was looking to sell \u201c50% of everything\u201d they owned. \u201cThis is a meltdown, this is an absolute meltdown,\u201d Baker sighed. Some investors, however, were still looking for bargains, with one trader shouting out an order for \u00a32m worth of US shares. \u201cAnother million sterling has come in,\u201d another dealer shouted. Investors rushed to put in final orders ahead of the 4:30pm European market close, and finally some calm started to return to the ETX Capital floor. The team would drop down to two on-site traders overnight to cover the US market close and the opening of Asian trading. But thanks to coronavirus crisis preparations, staff were on call to jump on to computers from home at a moment\u2019s notice. \u201cIt\u2019s all hands on deck,\u201d Baker said.",

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 10 March.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>Fears of a global recession amid the spread of coronavirus worsened overnight, as stock markets and commodity prices plunged. </strong>With the FTSE and the Dow Jones both falling by more than 7%, and crude oil slumping by 30%, markets had their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/09/ftse-plunges-to-below-6000-amid-global-coronavirus-sell-off-oil\">worst day since the global financial crisis in 2008</a>. The Guardian\u2019s economics editor, Larry Elliott, writes that \u201cCrash Monday\u201d is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/09/coronavirus-crash-monday-is-the-price-were-paying-for-a-decade-of-cheap-money\">natural consequence of a fragile economy</a> \u201cmasked by perpetually low interest rates\u201d brought into sharp focus by the coronavirus outbreak.

Meanwhile, Italian hospitals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/italian-hospitals-short-beds-coronavirus-death-toll-jumps\">have started to report bed shortages</a> as the country recorded its highest number of deaths in a 24-hour period. The head of Italy\u2019s prison system, Francesco Basentini, said a \u201cseries of rebellions\u201d had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/coronavirus-six-die-in-prison-protest-linked-to-italian-clampdown\">broken out throughout the country</a>. Six inmates died after they broke into a prison infirmary and overdosed on methadone.</p> <p><strong>The former Indigenous affairs minister Nigel Scullion is under fire after it was revealed that money from a fund for alleviating Indigenous disadvantage was handed out to the mining giant Fortescue Metals. </strong>The retail firm Wesfarmers, two NRL clubs, and Catholic and Anglican welfare organisations were also awarded millions of dollars. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/09/mining-giant-given-millions-in-grant-by-coalition-from-fund-for-indigenous-disadvantage\">Scullion approved more than $560m worth of funding before the federal election in 2019</a>. Current Indigenous affairs staff said Scullion had awarded grants to 12 projects the department had advised against and ignored 28 of their recommended projects. These included school nutrition programs for Indigenous children and cadetships in the NSW Legal Aid Commission.</p> <p><strong>The New York attorney general says Prince Andrew will not voluntarily cooperate in the Epstein inquiry. </strong>The Manhattan US attorney, Geoffrey Berman, said: \u201cContrary to Prince Andrew\u2019s very public offer to cooperate with our investigation into Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators, an offer that was conveyed via press release, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/09/prince-andrew-will-not-voluntarily-cooperate-epstein-investigation-lawyer-says\">Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary cooperation</a> and our office is considering its options.\u201d In a notorious interview with the BBC, the Duke of York denied allegations he had sex with a young woman provided by the disgraced billionaire.

Pell\u2019s counsel, Bret Walker SC, argues that the jury and the court of appeal were so swept away by the cardinal\u2019s accuser \u2013 by his testimony and his demeanour in the witness box \u2013 that they downplayed the evidence in Pell\u2019s favour.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 10 March. Top stories Fears of a global recession amid the spread of coronavirus worsened overnight, as stock markets and commodity prices plunged. With the FTSE and the Dow Jones both falling by more than 7%, and crude oil slumping by 30%, markets had their worst day since the global financial crisis in 2008. The Guardian\u2019s economics editor, Larry Elliott, writes that \u201cCrash Monday\u201d is the natural consequence of a fragile economy \u201cmasked by perpetually low interest rates\u201d brought into sharp focus by the coronavirus outbreak. Scott Morrison will warn today that the signs point to a recession worse than the GFC as he launches an appeal for businesses to \u201chold on to your people\u201d, including casual employees, if they succumb to Covid-19. Meanwhile, Italian hospitals have started to report bed shortages as the country recorded its highest number of deaths in a 24-hour period. The head of Italy\u2019s prison system, Francesco Basentini, said a \u201cseries of rebellions\u201d had broken out throughout the country. Six inmates died after they broke into a prison infirmary and overdosed on methadone. The former Indigenous affairs minister Nigel Scullion is under fire after it was revealed that money from a fund for alleviating Indigenous disadvantage was handed out to the mining giant Fortescue Metals. The retail firm Wesfarmers, two NRL clubs, and Catholic and Anglican welfare organisations were also awarded millions of dollars. Scullion approved more than $560m worth of funding before the federal election in 2019. Current Indigenous affairs staff said Scullion had awarded grants to 12 projects the department had advised against and ignored 28 of their recommended projects. These included school nutrition programs for Indigenous children and cadetships in the NSW Legal Aid Commission. The New York attorney general says Prince Andrew will not voluntarily cooperate in the Epstein inquiry. The Manhattan US attorney, Geoffrey Berman, said: \u201cContrary to Prince Andrew\u2019s very public offer to cooperate with our investigation into Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators, an offer that was conveyed via press release, Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary cooperation and our office is considering its options.\u201d In a notorious interview with the BBC, the Duke of York denied allegations he had sex with a young woman provided by the disgraced billionaire. Epstein was found dead in his prison cell last year while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Australia What are the symptoms of Covid-19 and what do I do if I think I have it? Australian health authorities have provided a stream of continuously updated advice about the coronavirus and it can be confusing to navigate. Calla Wahlquist has distilled some of that advice here to help answer your key questions. The Indian Ocean Dipole, an ocean system that drives extreme weather events, is likely to worsen due to global heating. Scientists studying the phenomenon say Australia could experience future conditions even more extreme than those witnessed during the 2019-20 bushfire season. Six grants totalling $260,000 were approved in the marginal seat of Longman in the month before the general election. The grants included $177,000 for the Bribie Island and Districts Junior Rugby League Club. How will the coronavirus affect my travel plans? Here\u2019s what you need to know if you have a trip planned or are thinking of planning a holiday in Australia or overseas. The world The Swedish actor Max von Sydow, star of The Exorcist, has died aged 90. Sydow\u2019s best-known role was in Ingmar Bergman\u2019s The Seventh Seal, in which he plays chess with Death. Russia has been accused of hiring a network of British politicians and consultants to \u201cgo after the enemies of Putin\u201d. MPs on parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee, who drew up a Russia report suppressed by Boris Johnson, were given the secret evidence by the financier Bill Browder. The world\u2019s biggest pornography website, Pornhub, has been criticised for its lack of vetting of videos. An online petition with more than 350,000 signatures accuses the site of not doing enough to stop rape and revenge porn videos appearing. Donald Trump has tweeted a manipulated video of Joe Biden that appears to show the Democratic presidential hopeful back Trump for re-election. The video is in fact cut to remove the end of Biden\u2019s quote. Recommended reads The word in legal circles is that George Pell could walk free, after an appeal to the high court against his conviction for child sex abuse. David Marr suggests that Pell\u2019s lawyers may have a working strategy. Acknowledging how compelling the testimony against Pell has been has become the lynchpin of their case. Pell\u2019s counsel, Bret Walker SC, argues that the jury and the court of appeal were so swept away by the cardinal\u2019s accuser \u2013 by his testimony and his demeanour in the witness box \u2013 that they downplayed the evidence in Pell\u2019s favour. In lawyer speak this amounts to: \u201cBelief in a \u2018compelling\u2019 complainant does not, ipso facto, equate to the elimination of reasonable doubt.\u201d What is it like to work on the frontline of the Covid-19 outbreak? Our anonymous GP describes a single Saturday at the coalface, where doctors come face to face with their first potential case of coronavirus. \u201cI get a frantic knock on my door. It\u2019s my colleague who has just picked up the patient I was meant to see. She\u2019s wearing her N95 mask \u2013 one of only five for each doctor that the government has so diligently provided our practice.\u201d The writer Oobah Butler spends a week living as Andy Warhol in the lead-up to a landmark show at Tate Modern in London. \u201cI\u2019m trying to live like Andy Warhol, the pop artist who died in the 1980s but is still a household name,\u201d he writes. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not going smoothly.\u201d From downing tins of Campbell\u2019s condensed mushroom soup to creating an artwork inspired by the newly ubiquitous face mask, Butler describes his life as a modern-day version of the art icon. Listen The Today in Focus podcast interviews Hadley Freeman about her 18-year search to uncover her family\u2019s secrets. The Guardian journalist embarked on a quest to find out what happened to her grandmother, who fled to the US to escape the Nazis, after she found an old shoebox full of photos and documents in the back of a wardrobe. Sport Australia\u2019s women\u2019s cricket team revelled in their success yesterday, with the captain, Meg Lanning, describing the Twenty20 World Cup win as a dream come true. \u201cWhen they said they wanted to get 90,000 people to the MCG for a World Cup final, I must admit I was a little bit sceptical,\u201d she says. The organisers of the Australian Grand Prix have said there is no chance the event will take place behind closed doors. The Bahrain GP on 22 March will be run without spectators and April\u2019s Chinese Grand Prix has already been postponed. Media roundup Australian newspapers have focused on the coronavirus\u2019s effect on the economy this morning, with the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald leading with news that the Morrison government is closed to removing its self-imposed $600bn debt cap to try to avert a serious recession. Outside Covid-19 news, the Australian has a story about the NSW police minister, David Elliott, facing criminal charges after photographs surfaced of him allegedly shooting two prohibited weapons at a shooting range without an appropriate licence. The New Daily reports that Australia is facing an \u201cepidemic\u201d of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, with the trend being driven by childhood obesity and sugary drinks. Coming up Coronavirus stimulus is to be discussed at today\u2019scabinet meeting. The inquest into the disappearance of William Tyrrell continues at Taree local court.

Deutsche Bank warned that defaults among US oil and gas companies are inevitable, with around $13bn (\u00a39.9bn) of debts due to be repaid by the end of 2021 from the most heavily indebted fossil fuel firms. Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has warned that around 33% of oil and gas firms have negative outlooks on their credit ratings (a measure of their financial strength, which is vital for borrowing money on reasonable terms), which is far higher than the long-term average of 19%. Distressed companies Struggling businesses seeking money to shore up their finances were also hit hard. British carmaker Aston Martin Lagonda, whose rescue fundraising is under way, fell a further 20% to a fresh low of 211p. China is a key market for Aston Martin\u2019s vehicles. Debt-laden shopping centre owner Intu Properties, which owns the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex, saw its shares slide a further 2%, closing below 5p. The firm has a valuation of just \u00a367m, while it has debts of \u00a34.7bn. The company had to postpone its emergency refinancing earlier in the month, blaming extreme market conditions. It needs to raise at least \u00a31.3bn from investors in order to secure a recently arranged overdraft facility from its lenders.",

Seven Britons tested positive after flying from London to Vietnam alongside an infected 26-year-old woman who had recently travelled to Milan and Paris. England\u2019s chief medical officer said people with symptoms as minor as coughs and colds could be asked to self-isolate within the next two weeks.

The US Federal Reserve issued its first emergency rate cut since the 2008 crash last week, although economists said further cuts, possibly close to zero from the current level of 1-1.25% could be required to shore up confidence as fears mount for global growth. In Britain, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is expected to use Wednesday\u2019s budget as a de facto emergency statement to unveil a sweeping package of critical tax and spending measures to protect companies and families. However, analysts warned that the lack of a coordinated international response as countries retreat into protectionist policymaking could threaten to unsettle global markets further, while dramatically raising the chances of a global recession this year. Neil Shearing, group chief economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe most likely worst-case scenario today is a sharp but probably short recession rather than an outright depression \u2026 [but] as the virus spreads, there\u2019s a good chance that that \u2018worst case\u2019 scenario quickly becomes the most likely scenario.\u201d In a silver lining, observers said the world\u2019s biggest banks are better prepared to continue lending to families and businesses despite the sharp moves in financial markets. Pockets of risk still exist, however, including heavily indebted US shale energy companies that could be forced out of business by the oil price collapse. BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest investment management company, said: \u201cMarket moves have been reminiscent of the financial crisis. But we don\u2019t think it\u2019s 2008, as the economy and financial system are on much stronger footing.\u201d",

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use.

In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.

The tumble in global stock markets looks familiar to what\u2019s been experienced the last 3 weeks. But there was a difference to yesterday\u2019s sell-off.

The drop-in oil prices is raising concerns that highly leveraged oil companies, many of which that dominate the US junk bond market, will fall into a state of unprofitability, and lack the means to meet their debt obligations. This credit risk is rippling through corporate bond markets, and raising the chance of financial contagion....</p> \n   <p><strong>Another day of losses for ASX200</strong>: It\u2019s setting up Australia\u2019s ASX200 for another 273 point fall according to SPI Futures. The move will come following yesterday\u2019s 7.3 per cent loss \u2013 its biggest daily loss since October 2008. The energy sector was the biggest loser, tracking the fall in the price of oil, close the day\u2019s trade 20 per cent lower. The financial sector subtracted the most from the mark in terms of points-lost. It cut 136 point from the index, as investors continue to dump banks in a falling rate environment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T21:12:08.098Z\">at 9.12pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e66ab158f085f0b8d94535f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T20:47:14.198Z\">8.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>A late newsflash: Italy is putting the entire country on lockdown!</strong></p> \n  <p>Our main Coronavirus liveblog reports:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy\">Italy</a> will be placed under the lockdown conditions thus far imposed upon the so-called \u201cred zone\u201d in the north of the country, the Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte has said.</p> \n   <p>The restrictions will include banning all public gatherings and preventing all movement other than for work and emergencies.

With a bit of encouragement from central banks, financial markets quickly regained their poise after the 1987 crash and resumed a long upward climb that only came to an end with the financial crisis of 2007.</p> \n   <p>It won\u2019t be nearly so simple to pull off that trick this time. For the past decade, the underlying fragility of the global economy has been masked by perpetually low interest rates.

In good times, when the oil price peaked in late 2018, it was 4.8%. In other words, well more than half of heavily-indebted US energy companies have borrowing costs that are going through the roof. Gulp. </p> \n  <p>In another illustration of how risky the situation is, Standard &amp; Poors says the percentage of oil and gas borrowers with negative outlooks on their credit rating - which gauges their financial strength and is key for borrowing money on reasonable terms - is around 33%, which is well above the long-term average of 19%. </p> \n  <p>Central bankers have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/16/global-economy-faces-19tn-corporate-debt-timebomb-warns-imf\">worrying about the US high yield bond markets</a> for quite a while now already.

      "bodyText": "Finally, today\u2019s wild markets dominate some of Tuesday\u2019s newspapers. Here\u2019s a selection: Good night, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s market rout: Global stock markets post biggest falls since 2008 financial crisis Global stock markets posted their steepest falls since the 2008 financial crisis on Monday after a crash in the oil price amplified concerns about the escalating economic cost of the coronavirus outbreak. Almost \u00a3125bn was wiped off the value of the FTSE 100 in the fifth-worst day in history for the index of leading UK company shares, as it plummeted by 7.7% to finish the day below 6,000 points, its lowest level since straight after the Brexit vote in 2016. Trading on Wall Street was frozen within minutes of the market opening as the system to buy and sell shares failed to keep pace with events. The Dow Jones closed down by more than 2,000 points for the first time ever, a decline of 7.8%. On a day of escalating economic losses as countries scrambled to respond to the outbreak, developments included: The number of deaths in the UK rose from three to five after victims were confirmed in Wolverhampton and St Helier, Jersey. Both were in their 70s and had underlying health conditions. A scramble to bring home hundreds of British tourists from northern Italy was under way, even as planes continued to fly between Britain and the locked-down region. Seven Britons tested positive after flying from London to Vietnam alongside an infected 26-year-old woman who had recently travelled to Milan and Paris. Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte said the coronavirus outbreak was the nation\u2019s \u201cdarkest hour\u201d. Germany and the Republic of Ireland announced emergency funding packages worth billions of euros, with Berlin declaring that it would do \u201ceverything needed to stabilise the economy and secure jobs\u201d. Here\u2019s confirmation that today\u2019s rout marks the 11th anniversary of the end of the 2008-09 crash: Right! I think it\u2019s time for a recap, as traders on Wall Street catch their breath after a shocking day of selling. World stock markets have suffered their worst day since the global financial crisis of 2008, as fears of a global recession swell. Hundreds of billions of dollars, euros and pounds were wiped off stocks across the world, in an alarming sell-off. A collapse in crude prices, triggered by an oil price war, spooked markets which were already reeling from the coronavirus outbreak. The day began with heavy losses in Asia-Pacific; Australia fell over 7%, while the Nikkei fell over 5%. In London, the FTSE 100 plunged by 7.7% in a slump led by the energy sector. That put the Footsie into a bear market - down over 20% since January. More than \u00a3125bn was wiped off the Footsie today, extending its recent rout, with BP (-19%) and Royal Dutch Shell (-18%) badly hit. Other European markets plunged by around 8%, exceeding their worst losses during the debt crisis. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB tumbled by 11%, after Rome announced plans to quarantine millions of people, as its coronavirus deaths kept rising. Wall Street picked up the selling baton, and promptly found trading briefly suspended after tumbling 7% -- triggering a circuit breaker. Once trading resumed, the main indices resumed their losses -- posting their worst day since 2008 as well. Tech shares, banks and energy companies all suffered badly. Apple fell 7.9%, Chevron lost 15% and JP Morgan declined by 13%, in a day when any risers were very rare, and volatility hit an 11-year high. Saudi Arabia\u2019s threat to boost oil production and cut prices sent Brent crude down to just $34 per barrel tonight, down 23% today. Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers, demanded a co-ordinated response to address the impact of Covid-19. Analysts fear that the global economy is heading for very rocky waters due to the coronavirus crisis. Oxford Economics has warned tonight: From an economic perspective, the key issue is not just the number of cases of COVID-19, but the level of disruption to economies from containment measures. Disproportionate action will weaken economic activity and potentially induce panic, increasing the chances of investment and consumer spending being delayed or scrapped. Actions to control the spread of the virus outside China have been larger than we envisaged even a couple of weeks ago. What\u2019s more, additional restrictions are likely to be rolled out in economies that are particularly exposed to the virus, which will offset any temporary boost to demand from panic buying We may see MORE losses in Asia and Europe tomorrow, judging by the overnight futures markets. Here\u2019s Kyle Rodda of IG to set the scene (and perhaps give us nightmares): Panic grips global markets: Trading conditions in global markets can appropriately be described as panicked. Already vulnerable amid the unfolding coronavirus crisis, Saudi Arabia\u2019s pledge to flood global oil markets with extra supply kicked market participants in the guts at precisely the worst possible time. The tumble in global stock markets looks familiar to what\u2019s been experienced the last 3 weeks. But there was a difference to yesterday\u2019s sell-off. Market fundamentals have changed again, and they\u2019ve changed for the worse. Oil\u2019s plunge sparks credit risk: Oil prices were belted on Monday, plunging by as much as 30 per cent, as traders priced-in the impacts of an extra 10 million barrels per day of Saudi oil supply. The drop-in oil prices is raising concerns that highly leveraged oil companies, many of which that dominate the US junk bond market, will fall into a state of unprofitability, and lack the means to meet their debt obligations. This credit risk is rippling through corporate bond markets, and raising the chance of financial contagion.... Another day of losses for ASX200: It\u2019s setting up Australia\u2019s ASX200 for another 273 point fall according to SPI Futures. The move will come following yesterday\u2019s 7.3 per cent loss \u2013 its biggest daily loss since October 2008. The energy sector was the biggest loser, tracking the fall in the price of oil, close the day\u2019s trade 20 per cent lower. The financial sector subtracted the most from the mark in terms of points-lost. It cut 136 point from the index, as investors continue to dump banks in a falling rate environment. A late newsflash: Italy is putting the entire country on lockdown! Our main Coronavirus liveblog reports: All of Italy will be placed under the lockdown conditions thus far imposed upon the so-called \u201cred zone\u201d in the north of the country, the Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte has said. The restrictions will include banning all public gatherings and preventing all movement other than for work and emergencies. According to the Reuters news agency, he has said the decision was necessary to protect Italy\u2019s most vulnerable citizens and that the right course of action now is for people to stay at home. Shares in America\u2019s tech giants have slumped today. For so long the darlings of Wall Street, the FANG companies were firmly caught in today\u2019s rout. Shares in Apple plunged 7.9%. Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet each lost more than 6% and Amazon fell 5.3%. According to CNBC, this has wiped over $320bn of value off the stocks (or roughly twice the losses on the FTSE 100 today)/ Today\u2019s sell-off will go down in market history as a real shocker -- along with these days to forget: Newsflash: the US stock market has suffered its worst one-day slump since 2008, and the depths of the last financial crisis. After a frightening day of losses, the main indices have all tumbled by over 7%. The Dow has shed 2,000 points -- almost twice its worst daily points slump, to 23,839 points. That\u2019s a plunge of 7.8%, matching the worst days during the financial crisis over 11 years ago. The S&amp;P 500 also had a truly dreadful day, slumping by 7.6% or 225 points to 2,746. Such a dramatic rout shows that Wall Street is bracing for something Very Nasty -- such as a coronavirus epidemic, a recession, and some serious financial distress among companies and households. Today\u2019s slump isn\u2019t a repeat of Black Monday in 1987. It\u2019s a lot more serious! So argues our economics editor Larry Elliott today: The working week began in the City of London with oil prices down by 30% and the leading barometer of UK shares registering falls of more than 8%, so it didn\u2019t take long for it to be dubbed Crash Monday. To be sure, those with long enough memories would have been able to recall a similar market panic in October 1987, when a wave of selling began in east Asia and rolled inexorably westwards. That, though, is about as far as the comparison goes, because the 2020 Black Monday is a lot more serious than the one 30-odd years ago. With a bit of encouragement from central banks, financial markets quickly regained their poise after the 1987 crash and resumed a long upward climb that only came to an end with the financial crisis of 2007. It won\u2019t be nearly so simple to pull off that trick this time. For the past decade, the underlying fragility of the global economy has been masked by perpetually low interest rates. Cheap money has been the fuel for rocketing asset prices \u2013 shares and bonds in particular \u2013 but has done little to boost investment and historically weak productivity growth.... More here: Wall Street traders have looked particularly stressed, and positively shell-shocked, at times today as the market rout has intensified. Here are a few pictures from the New York stock exchange: The recent gyrations in the US stock, bond and currency markets mean American companies face much tighter financial conditions. As Lisa Abramowicz of Bloomberg points out, that means some firms will soon struggle to access funding or roll over debts, unless policymakers act. Brazil\u2019s stock market is enduring a terribly day too, as its energy sector is routed. The Bovespa index is down 12%, on course for its worst day since 1998. That was the time when Long Term Capital Management (a \u2018pioneering\u2019 hedge fund) collapsed, sending emerging markets reeling, as Reuter\u2019s Jamie McGeever reminds us: Today\u2019s slump comes 11 years after the US bull market began, almost to the day. Back on 10th March 2009, the S&amp;P 500 stopped its post-Lehman Brothers slide, and jumped by around 6% from 676 points to 719. It then quadrupled in value over the next 11 years -- showing the value of buying at the bottom (good luck this time, folks). But as CNN points out, all bull markets come to an end eventually -- often slain by fiscal tightening, high interest rates or recession (usually linked!). Good news! There\u2019s less than one hour of his dreadful day of stock market trading to go. Bad news! The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average are both down over 7% right now. And this can usually be a volatile time on Wall Street, so hold on tight.... Wall Street\u2019s Fear index, the VIX, has hit its highest level since 2008 today - a clear sign of market panic. And astonishingly, it was initially hard to actually trade the VIX due to the market turmoil. Reuters explains. Trading in options on Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge was impossible in the first minutes of Monday\u2019s session due to a complete absence of prices from the market makers on whom trading depends, a representative of index operator CBOE Global Markets Inc (CBOE.Z) said. CBOE Senior Trade Desk Specialist Ryan Stone told Reuters that VIX options were tradable at 9:51 a.m. ET (1351 GMT) but a lack of liquidity led to a lag of about seven minutes until the first trade, around 9:58 a.m. ET. When activity in options resumed, the VIX surged to its highest level since December 2008. The volatility spike occurred as global stock markets were melting down on fears about the spreading coronavirus and crashing oil prices Capital Economics have predicted that the Federal Reserve will cut US borrowing costs to \u201cnear-zero\u201d within the next couple of months. In a new note, they cite to the continuing slump in stock markets and the global spread of the coronavirus. Last week the Fed unexpectedly cut US rates by 50 basis points (0.5% points) to a range of 1%-1.25%, and holds its next scheduled meeting next week. It\u2019s official: oil has suffered its biggest one-day plunge since the Gulf War in January 1991. US crude has closed at $31.13 per barrel, down over $10 per barrel or 24.6, Marketwatch reports. U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other economic officials later on Monday to weigh possible actions to stem the fallout over the coronavirus, an administration official told Reuters. The Trump administration is weighing a number of potential policy steps, including paid sick leave, the official said. Here\u2019s a pithy summary of Wall Street\u2019s day of pain: Larry Summers, former US Treasury secretary, is trying to bang heads together on Bloomberg TV. Summers believes a US recession is now \u201cmore likely than not\u201d. He says the White House needs to produce a co-ordinated response, that involves various parts of the US administration, other governments, and international bodies. It should be comprehensive, Summers continues. It needs to tackle the financial challenges caused by lack of credit, the need to maintain economic demand when pay cheques are being cut back, and shore up investment. However, we are \u201cnot close\u201d to having such a comprehensive, coordinated and coherent plan now, he warns. Data firm Refinitiv have confirmed that FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares has had its fifth worst day since 1987: Ireland\u2019s government has agreed an aid package of some \u20ac3bn to deal with the public health and economic impact of the coronavirus. Ministers have also moved to cancel all St Patrick\u2019s Day Parades in the State cancelled in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. The Irish Times has the details: People affected by coronavirus are to receive sick pay of \u20ac305 per week from their first day of illness under a new initiative announced by the Government. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the existing conditions surrounding the sick payments, such as having a specific number of contributions, would be waived. Payments will also be available to the self-employed. The Taoiseach said emergency legislation to change the existing rules governing sick pay would be introduced in the Dail next week. This measure is estimated to cost \u20ac2.4bn. The decisions were made following a meeting of the new Cabinet sub-committee on Covid-19 and followed advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team. Back on Wall Street, stocks are sliding again as we enter the last two hours of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 8% again, or around 2,065 points, at 23,798 points. That\u2019s its worst points fall ever, and slightly worst than the Dow\u2019s worst days seen in 2008 after Lehman Brothers. Chemicals firm Dow Inc is now down by 20%, a really brutal slump, followed by oil firm Chevron (-15%), construction machinery maker Caterpillar (-13%) and JP Morgan (-13%). The S&amp;P 500 index is also lurching lower, down 7.5% again today. Some shale oil firms, such as Marathon Oil Corporation and Diamondback Energy, have almost halved in value. Britain\u2019s supermarkets are preparing to shake up their operations to keep the UK supplied with food during a coronavirus epidemic. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: The government has agreed to relax restrictions on the hours delivery lorries can operate in built up areas in the latest step to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. Top supermarket executives held a conference call with George Eustice, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs on Monday afternoon. It was the second call in four days, after a weekend of panic buying of essential items such as toilet roll, dried pasta and tinned tomatoes. Eustice said: \u201cBy allowing night time deliveries to our supermarkets and food retailers we can free them up to move their stocks more quickly from their warehouses to their shelves.\u201d \u201cOur retailers have well-established contingency plans in place and are taking all the necessary steps to ensure consumers have the food and supplies they need. I will continue to work closely with them over the coming days and weeks on this.\u201d The teleconference also discussed ways in which infected shoppers could pick up goods ordered online from stores without interacting with staff and the potential relaxation of other regulations such as limits on drivers\u2019 working time in order to aid those in self-isolation. Here\u2019s a clip of Allianz\u2019s Mohamed El-Erian predicting US stocks could fall another 10% from current levels: Today\u2019s tumble is the fifth worst in the City\u2019s recent history, dating back to the Big Bang in 1984 when the FTSE 100 was created. We\u2019ve only suffered bigger losses in 1987, around the Black Monday crash, and in 2008 after Lehman Brothers failed. Oil giants BP and Royal Dutch Shell led the FTSE 100 fallers tonight, tumbling by 19% and 18% respectively in London today. That makes sense, given crude prices still down 20% today after Saudi Arabia launched its oil price war over the weekend, vowing to cut prices and boost output. Other top fallers included cruise firm Carnival, down 15%, and mining companies Glencore (-12%) and BHP Group (-16%). Demand for foreign holidays, iron ore and coal are all being hammered today, by coronavirus recession angst. They all helped to push the FTSE 100 down by 7.7%, or almost 500 points, tonight. In the end there was one solitary riser - precious metals producer Polymetal. It gained 0.5%, after anxious customers pushed the gold price to a seven-year high today. This chart shows how the FTSE 100 has hit the buffers in the last fortnight. Back on 21 February, the index closed at 7404 points. Today\u2019s rout means it has slumped by 19% since. By my maths, that means the FTSE 100 has slumped by over \u00a3360bn since the start of trading two weeks ago. European stock markets are also in bear market territory, having shed a fifth of their value in recent weeks: Newsflash: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has plunged into a bear market, after its worst day in over a decade. The index of leading blue-chip shares has just closed for the night, down 496 points or nearly 7.7% at 5,965 points. That wipes \u00a3124bn off the value of the companies on the FTSE 100, as global recession fears, Covid-19 worries and the shock of an oil price war rattle the City. We\u2019ve not seen such a big daily fall since early October 2008, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the worst financial crisis in decades. It also means the FTSE 100 is more than 20% below its recent peak, of 7674 points, set on 17th January. In City parlance, that means we\u2019re in a Bear Market. Newsflash: European stock markets have closed with heavy losses on all the main indices. The Stoxx 600 index of leading EU shares is provisionally down 7.5%, which would be its worst decline since the 2008 financial crisis. Dealers here on the ETX Capital trading floor are referring to specific stocks in numerical codes, so it\u2019s hard to tell which company\u2019s shares are changing hands, my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff reports. But what we do know is that some high rolling investors are clearly ignoring advice by the likes of economist Mohammed El-Erian to stay on the sidelines of the market rout, with one client putting in an order for \u00a32m of US shares. Another trader yells. \u201cAnother million sterling has come in.\u201d Investors will now be rushing to put in final orders ahead of the 4:30pm European market close, but the sales team here is not expecting as much chaos after hours. ETX is expected to drop down to two on-site traders overnight to cover the US close and Asia open, though others can easily hop onto computers from home if needed. A number of trading firms have been testing working from home as part of coronavirus crisis prep. Here\u2019s a video of the Wall Street opening bell - shortly before stocks plunged, triggering a rare (brief) market suspension: Lloyd Blankfein, the former boss of Goldman Sachs, has tweeted that the markets will recover soon. He argues that the financial system is in better shape than in 2008 (when Goldman Sachs was bailed out, along with the rest of the US banking sector) Back in the US, the left leaning Economics Policy Institute has a report out on the impact of Covid 19 this morning. And it shows that the coronavirus could have a very serious effect - including on lower-paid workers. EPI concludes: If it comes it will come fast, It will hit lower-wage workers first and hardest, It will impose even faster and larger costs on state and local governments than recessions normally do. The Guardian have just published a report about the impact low wage workers in the US - where the majority do not have adequate (or any) health insurance and few have sick day pay. As one worker told our reporter. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to miss pay so I have gone to work before several times sick as a dog, masked up so my patients wouldn\u2019t catch what I have,\u201d Here\u2019s EPI\u2019s report. The City has entered its final hour of trading, with the FTSE 100 still down 6.6% at 6032 points, a fall of 430 points today. But amid the rout, one plucky stock has clambered into the list of FTSE risers. Supermarket chain Tesco is now up 0.5%, after agreeing to sell its store networks in Thailand and Malaysia for $10.6bn (\u00a38.2bn). The supermarkets are riding out this crash relatively low, thanks to the surge in stock-piling and full-blown panic buying by anxious consumers. Ulas Akincilar, Head of Trading at the online trading platform, INFINOX, says the oil price war is a big low to America\u2019s oil industry -- although it might mean cheaper gasoline too: \u201cThe triggering of America\u2019s equity market circuit breakers, which halted trading on the major US markets for 15 minutes, brought a brief moment of respite and reflection \u2013 rather than recovery. \u201cUS consumers may be relishing the imminent prospect of $2 a gallon gas, but the country\u2019s huge oil industry has been sucked into the vortex of a global crude price war, the flames of which have been fanned by the coronavirus. \u201cThis is no mere Opec-inspired spat. With Saudi Arabia adopting a \u2018pump or die\u2019 strategy, the market is being flooded with supply just as demand plunges in the face of Covid-19 and its chilling effect on travel and trade. Noted economist Mohamed El-Erian fears that Wall Street will continue to slump in the days ahead. El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, told CNBC that this is no time to be buying the dip or selling everything. His advice - stay on the sidelines. \u201cThis is going to be treacherous for a while. I would advise most retail investors to stay on the sidelines, not panic. There will be opportunities but they\u2019re not now.\u201d El-Erian suspects that Wall Street could fall 20% or 30% from February\u2019s record peak before stabilising. As we\u2019re currently 19% down from that high, further heavy losses are possible.... After a brief lull, phones are ringing and traders\u2019 computers are firing off alerts non-stop on the ETX Capital trading floor again. There\u2019s speculation that investors outside of the US may have been caught off guard by the American time change over the weekend and still expected Wall Street to open at 2:30pm London time. It\u2019s hard to believe that many investors would have missed the news of the stock market plunge at 1:30pm, but everyone should be on board now. Regardless, with trade volumes up again, some dealers have had trouble executing orders. Here\u2019s our updated news story on today\u2019s market rout: If the stock market crash isn\u2019t bad enough, the fallout in the US bond markets is perhaps even scarier to contemplate - particularly given a boom in risky borrowing by US oil and gas firms in recent years. Deutsche Bank has just issued a note warning there could be a \u201cMinsky moment\u201d for high-yield American bonds - in a nod to the economist Hyman Minsky\u2019s theory on how markets can crash amid widespread panic following periods of speculative investment. The US subprime collapse of 2008 is regarded as one such moment, so the comparison is ominous to say the least... The bank\u2019s analysts warn that defaults - companies being unable to repay or refinance their debts - are now inevitable, with around $13bn of debts due for repayment before the end of 2021 from the most heavily-indebted oil and gas firms. In a shocking sign of the chaos to come, it says the distress ratio for US oil and gas high yield debt - defined as the proportion of debt trading with a spread of at least 1,000 basis points (in other words, bonds with yields that are more than 1,000 basis points higher than a reference yield such as on a US Treasury bond) - was already 62.3% as of Friday before today\u2019s oil price collapse. To put that in context, it says the distress ratio hit 43.9% in March 2016 when oil prices last crashed. In good times, when the oil price peaked in late 2018, it was 4.8%. In other words, well more than half of heavily-indebted US energy companies have borrowing costs that are going through the roof. Gulp. In another illustration of how risky the situation is, Standard &amp; Poors says the percentage of oil and gas borrowers with negative outlooks on their credit rating - which gauges their financial strength and is key for borrowing money on reasonable terms - is around 33%, which is well above the long-term average of 19%. Central bankers have been worrying about the US high yield bond markets for quite a while now already. This could be the start of something quite dramatic indeed. Bang on cue.... The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 14.5% so far this year. Just last month, the Dow hit a record high of 29,551 points. At just 24,420 right now, it\u2019s 19% down from that peak -- a very bruising slump that has hit US savers badly. Back in January, the US president was trumpeting Wall Street\u2019s performance: Every sector on the S&amp;P 500 index is tumbling this morning. Energy stocks are leading the rout here too, tracking the 20% slump in crude prices. Banks are down too, as traders anticipate a recession - and a possible jump in loan defaults. Bank of America and Citigroup are both down 10%, alongside JP Morgan. Edward Moya of trading firm OANDA says traders are selling despite forecasts that US interest rates could be slashed towards zero soon: Stock markets in freefall and it seems unlikely central banks and governments in the short-term can do anything. Technical selling is getting ugly and even though expectations are high the Fed will take rates to the zero bound, the retail investor will likely want to wait this one out. It seems the collapse with oil prices have added a log to the deflationary fire the Fed will try to extinguish. Virus fears, deflationary risks, and growing stress in the credit markets, means markets will see the Fed launch a new QE program very soon. Eventually investors will start scaling back into stocks, but it seems the technical selling can remain ugly for a couple more days. The longer-term playbook will likely to buy stocks again as markets will move beyond the virus, adjust to lower oil prices, and expect a wrath of global stimulus likely to remain in place over the next year. One trader\u2019s computer on the ETX Capital trading floor in London is firing off notifications that sound like a bomb raid alarm, which is a bit unnerving. \u201cI\u2019m working to sell 100 [stocks]\u201d one trader yells. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bid in,\u201d another says. Another client is looking to sell \u201c50% of everything.\u201d Traders are having to seek out multilingual staff, including those who speak Spanish, to help sort out trades from international clients. Those dealing with institutional clients are trying to push through their trades amid the chaos. Each of the 30 members of the Dow Jones industrial average is falling today - some vertiginously so. Companies particularly exposed to global growth, and travel, are the worst affected. Chemicals giant Dow Inc has plunged by 16%, followed by airline maker Boeing (-12%), oil giant Chevron (-11%),investment bank JP Morgan (-9%) and construction and machinery maker Caterpillar (-8.5%). Today\u2019s rout has pushed America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 index of shares to its lowest since June 2019. The Dow (which contains just 30 of America\u2019s biggest, most famous companies) has troughed to its lowest since January 2019. US investors might think they\u2019re getting off lightly -- Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is at its weakest point since 2016 (when a Brexit-weakened pound started driving shares up). Yikes! The Dow Jones industrial average just briefly fell by 2,000 points(!), as the selloff gathers more pace. That (un)comfortably smashes its worst points performance -- the 1,190 point tumble late last month. It means roughly 7.5% has been wiped off the Dow -- the worst day since Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008 Trading has resumed on Wall Street... and stocks are continuing to slide. The S&amp;P 500 index is now down 7.3% today (an eye-watering plunge), as the automatic trading halt ends. Investors have caught their breath....and decided that they\u2019re still panicking about a global recession, an oil price war, and the spread of Covid-19 around the world. Meanwhile in London, stocks are sliding deeper into the red... as my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff reports: \u201cThis is a meltdown, this is an absolute meltdown,\u201d says Michael Baker, who is leading the sales team at spread-betting firm ETX Capital. Traders are hollering across banks of desks, yelling out trades. They\u2019re trying to figure out which stocks are trading in the US after the S&amp;P 500 was briefly halted following its 7% fall a moment ago. You can barely hear anyone over the calls and trading notifications, sounding like alarms across the office. \u201cI can\u2019t buy mate, it\u2019s limit down,\u201d one trader yells. \u201cJust tried to buy the Nasdaq - but I can\u2019t,\u201d another says. Not everyone is being pessimistic, with one trader yelling that at least one high net worth client had put in an order to buy hundreds of US shares. (No word over whether that is a bet that has any chance of paying off, though) This is a \u201clong-term market for investors\u201d, Wall Street chief Stacey Cunningham adds, as she tries to end on a note of reassurance. Stacey Cunningham, head of the NYSE, is on CNBC now talking about circuit breakers. \u201cIt\u2019s a pause to catch our breath and reevaluate,\u201d she says. Newsflash: Trading has been briefly suspended on the New York stock exchange. The 7% plunge on the S&amp;P 500 has triggered automatic circuit breakers, which are designed to prevent a market meltdown. Trading is now on hold for 15 minutes, to let investors catch their breath. But European markets aren\u2019t suspended -- they\u2019re plunging further into the red, with the FTSE 100 now down 8.3% today (its worst rout since 2008). The Wall Street bell was rung by a group of women from Citi. The group knocked elbows rather than shaking hands in a nod to Covid-19 -- before the selloff began.... NEWSFLASH: The US stock market has plunged by nearly 7% at the start of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has tumbled by 1,758 points -- or almost 7% -- as Wall Street joins the global selloff. That\u2019s the Dow\u2019s biggest points slump ever -- and on track for its worst day in percentage terms since 2008. The S&amp;P 500 index, which is a broader measure of US companies, is also down more than 6%, with oil companies and banks among the biggest fallers. The Wall Street opening bell is about to be rung..... Ahead of what could be a ghastly session on Wall Street, President Donald Trump has defended the US response to the coronavirus: With just minutes before US stock markets open there is a chance we could see \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d put in to action. Circuit breakers pause trading if the markets fall a certain percentage. The first one would be triggered if the S&amp;P 500 drops 7% - which looks easily possible right now. Trading would stop for 15 minutes. The next level is a 13% decline. Gulp. One exchange-traded fund (ETF) is suggesting the S&amp;P 500 could fall 7%, although there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty right now. US technology stocks are expected to plunge at the Wall Street open, with Apple down over 7% in pre-markets trading. Stocks are trembling in London as traders await Wall Street\u2019s verdict. The FTSE 100 is now down 7.6%, or 486 points, at 5967 -- a three-year low -- as another burst of sell orders rattle through trading floors.... Financial research group TS Lombard have predicted that Covid-19 will drag the global economy into a \u201cmajor recession\u201d. It will also forcing stocks into a bear market, they fear (as is already happening in some markets today). In a new note, chief economist Charles Dumas writes: Global spread of the Covid-19 virus looks likely to cause a worldwide recession and bear market in stocks. Nobody knows how serious the disease is likely to be. But The Brookings Institution\u2019s estimates suggest a reasonable likelihood that 10% of the US population will catch the virus, and of those at least 1% will die. As that implies more than 300,000 US deaths, personal fear is rational \u2013 there is more to fear than \u2018fear itself\u2019. Here are the key points from his note: Coronavirus seems likely to cause a major recession and bear market Confined to China, the disease was a supply-side menace, but limited Spread globally, it is far less easily tackled than in authoritarian China US consumers\u2019 major cutbacks could cut Q2 GDP sharply Big Chinese infrastructure-build to focus recovery on manufacturing European crisis most acute in Italy \u2013 could turn into financial crisis US stocks likely to fall to 2500 on the S&amp;P, down 26% from peak Budget airline easyJet says it is cancelling some flights to Italy, following the mass quarantine measures announced by Rome over the weekend. Here\u2019s the statement: Following a decree issued by the Italian authorities implementing further restrictions for anyone living in Lombardy and 14 other central and northern provinces in Italy, easyJet in common with a number of other airlines is reviewing its flying programme to Milan Malpensa, Milan Linate, Venice and Verona airports for the period from now until 3 April 2020. \u201cIn the short-term we will be cancelling a number of flights to and from these destinations on Monday 9 March. We will be advising all affected passengers of the cancellations by email and SMS. Customers on flights scheduled to operate to and from these airports will be given the option of a full refund or to change their flight. \u201cWe expect to continue to reduce the number of flights in and out of Milan Malpensa, Milan Linate, Venice and Verona airports in the period up to 3 April and will provide a further update on our schedule in due course. \u201cWhilst these circumstances are outside of our control, we apologise to all affected customers for any inconvenience caused.\u201d Time for a quick markets catch up, as we brace for Wall Street to open (at 9.30am US time, or 1.30pm GMT). Britain\u2019s stock market is suffering one of its worst days in decades, as fears of a global recession and an oil price war hit stocks. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index plunged by 8.5% at the start of trading, and is currently down 7% or 450 points at 60058. Every stock on the index is down, led by BP (-20%). Other top fallers include cruise operator Carnival (-10%) and mining giant Glencore (-11%). Oil stocks are also dragging the smaller FTSE 250 index deep into the red. It\u2019s currently down 5.5%. European shares are also suffering their worst day in years. The Stoxx-600 index is down over 6.5%, with deep losses in Germany (-7.1%) and France (-7.3%). Italy\u2019s market has slumped by 10% after Rome\u2019s government announced plans to quarantine millions of people in the north of the country. As things stand, European markets are going to end the day in Bear Markets -- more than 20% off their recent peaks back in January. Analyst Fawad Razaqzada of Trading Candles explains why the markets are tanking today: Well, first there is coronavirus and the growing worries over the spread and economic risks it poses. Virus cases have topped 109,000 worldwide with the death toll exceeding 3,800. Then you have oil prices crashing, hurting energy stocks and raising concerns over the economic health of the oil producing nations. Crude prices tumbled after Saudi Arabia launched an aggressive price war following Russia\u2019s refusal to agree to new production cuts. With demand falling due to Covid-19 and the already-excessive supply set to get larger, a speedy recovery looks unlikely for crude oil. This is the result - electronic trading boards dripping with red: What started with the biggest oil-price collapse since 1991 is shaping up to be one of the wildest days in years for global markets, says Bloomberg: Panic selling, margin calls, vanishing liquidity and coronavirus work-from-home arrangements were just some of the challenges traders faced as risk assets plunged, currency volatility soared and money flooded into government bonds. They also had to figure out how an oil-price war and rapidly spreading outbreak will affect the global economy, companies and geopolitics. \u201cThe day has been absolutely chaotic,\u201d said Eugene Kang, whose team trades assets including Russian government bonds at NH Investment &amp; Securities Co. from Seoul. \u201cFinancial markets have been caught off guard.\u201d In other developments: The oil price is still being hammered by Saudi Arabia\u2019s new price war, with Brent crude down 22% at $34.91 per barrel, and US crude down almost 24% at $31.40. The US Federal Reserve is trying to pump more liquidity into the system, by boosting its overnight repo operation from $100bn to $150bn. That could help banks get their hands on dollars, if they\u2019re reluctant to lend to each other. Many stock markets in Asia plunged into bear markets today, including Japan and Singapore, following a rout which wiped 7% off Australia\u2019s market. Paul O\u2019Connor, Head of the Multi-Asset Team at Janus Henderson Investors, has stuck his neck out and predicted that today COULD be a good time to buy.... He writes that investor \u2018complacency\u2019 has dramatically turned to \u2018panic\u2019, as the prospects of a global recession rise - triggering an urgent \u201cbroad-based de-risking\u201d. But in such turbulent times, there could be value out there..... Whereas last week, investors were largely focused on trying to evaluate the potential impact of the coronavirus on global growth, they are now worried about scenarios involving self-reinforcing adverse market dynamics. The oil shock has jolted the hitherto-resilient markets for high yield debt and emerging market bonds. The risk now is that investor redemptions will accelerate at a time when market liquidity is already under pressure. Still, the scale of the repricing has been so rapid today that value is already beginning to emerge. Credit markets have gone from being overbought to oversold, overnight. So in conclusion: One thing we do know however is that markets are now in panic mode. While it would be foolish to try to call the bottom in the markets, we would rather be buying in this environment rather than selling. We are gradually rebuilding risk exposures into market weakness. The key word here is gradually..... Savers are nursing losses approaching 10% in their pension schemes since the start of the coronavirus market panic, while holders of share Isas have lost as much as a quarter of all their money in some funds, my colleague Patrick Collinson explains: The stock market rout means someone who had accumulated \u00a3250,000 in their pension scheme at the start of this year will have seen it shrivel to about \u00a3225,000 on Monday. Holders of final salary-style pensions, mostly in the public sector, lose nothing as their payouts are guaranteed. However, further falls in the market will mean these schemes will drop further into deficit, requiring employers (such as local authorities and universities ) to somehow find the cash to top them up. One saving grace is that the vast majority of pension schemes invest less in \u201cequities\u201d (shares) than in the past, so a 5% fall in the market does not equate to a 5% fall in the total value of the fund. The typical pension fund is about 60%-65% in shares, with the rest in government and corporate bonds and property. Wall Street appears to be heading for a very rough session, when trading begins in an hour\u2019s time. The futures contracts for the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were all frozen overnight after falling by 5%. So traders are somewhat flying blind right now, although some individual stocks (including banks and oil firms) are down heavily right now. Marketwatch explains: Futures fell their 5% limit in early Asian trade and have traded near there for most of the session. Stocks could see steeper losses when cash trading opens Monday. Initial circuit breakers kick in to temporarily halt trading with a fall of 7%. Trading firms are starting to block small investors from buying US stock futures, over fears they will lose too much money by taking a punt and trying to buy on the dip. \u201cDo not let retail clients buy,\u201d one ETX Capital dealer warned his colleagues on the trading floor. US futures trading has been restricted from falling any lower following a 5% drop in US stock futures overnight from their previous closing price. It triggered a circuit breaker, known as \u201climit down,\u201d which limits derivatives trading linked to major US indexes including the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq and the Dow. Hundreds of thousands of sales orders are piling up and are expected to drive US futures down even further whenever the limit down restrictions are lifted. So while investors technically can buy futures positions, there is a worry that less sophisticated investors could get into trouble financially due to another expected drop. Another trader admitted. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Gold hit a new seven-year high this morning, amid the mad dash for safe-haven assets. One ounce of bullion jumped to $1,702 for the first time since 2013. It\u2019s also trading at record levels in sterling terms, Adrian Ash, director of research at online precious metals trader BullionVault, says demand for gold has soared since the coronavirus crisis escalated: \u201cOver the last 7 days, trading volumes on BullionVault have jumped 102% from the previous 52-week average, with more than \u00a338.2m of gold, silver and platinum changing hands in total ($49.6m, \u20ac44.1, \u00a55.2bn). \u201cNet of client selling, gold demand has risen 545.3% from the prior 52-week average, totalling 6 large bars last week, each weighing 12.5 kilograms. How low could the markets go? Clem Chambers, CEO of stocks and shares website ADVFN, reckons the London stock market will keep falling in the coming weeks. We could see some bounces along the way, but he predicts the FTSE could hit 5,500 -- down almost another 10% from today\u2019s levels! Chambers says: \u201cIt\u2019s Crash Monday with the already fragile markets in free fall following the unravelling of OPEC Plus and Saudi Arabia launching an oil price war against the backdrop of falling oil demand triggered by the Coronavirus. We will see a few short-lived bounces along the way, but 5500 is the next stop on the FTSE. The Dow and S&amp;P have not crashed yet but when they do it will hammer the FTSE hard, again. It\u2019s difficult to see the FTSE below 5000 but it\u2019s not impossible. This rout is far from over and its aftermath will take more than months to pan out.\u201d America\u2019s central bank is pumping tens of billions of dollars into the markets today, in an attempt to stop the financial system running out of liquidity. The Federal Reserve has boosted its overnight repo operations from $100bn to $150bn. That means there\u2019s an extra $50bn on offer to US banks, who might be worried about lending to rivals in the current climate. A repo operation allows a bank to access dollars, in return for handing over quality collateral such as US government bonds and mortgage securities. Such operations are typically in demand during times of financial stress. Correction: the New York stock exchange will open at 1.30pm UK time today, not 2.30pm. My mistake - I\u2019d forgotten that US clocks moved forward an hour yesterday. So 9.30am New York time will come round sooner. On a trading floor near London\u2019s Liverpool Street Station, the trading floor of spreadbetting firm ETX Capital is buzzing. The firm has called in extra staff to deal with a surge in trades after oil plunged overnight and the European stock markets tumbled this morning. ETX\u2019s usual day team of about two or three traders has more than doubled, and will be bulked up to around 10 in the coming hours as they rev-up for the Wall Street open at 1:30pm UK time (corrected). TV screens are set to Bloomberg and Sky News and banter between traders and dealers is intermittently being drowned out by a chorus of notifications. Phones are ringing, while terminals are bleating out a series of alerts - dings, slide whistles and simulated space gun blasts - signalling further market moves and flurry of new trades requests from clients. Michael Baker, who is leading the sales team, says it will be all-hands-on-deck for at least 24 hours. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen anything like this since the financial crisis.\u201d Financial service company Hargreaves Lansdown, which provides ISAs, pensions, and share dealing, says it is \u201cvery busy\u201d this morning. It\u2019s not clear whether that\u2019s people looking to sell, or buy, or simply check how much poorer they are today. UK bank NatWest has announced a package of funding support worth \u00a35bn for small businesses struggling to stay afloat as the coronavirus outbreak drags down the economy. Alongside the funding, the majority government-owned bank will offer loan repayment holidays of up to six months, temporary emergency loans and fee-free borrowing. In some respects, this is simply what a bank should always do \u2013 providing funds and flexible repayment terms to customers \u2013 but that NatWest feels the need to announce this package is illustrative of the scale of the stress facing firms. It comes as pressure mounts on the Treasury and the Bank of England to slash interest rates and cut taxes to support families and companies. Clearly the banking system has a role to play as well. The German government says it hopes to avoid any business falling into insolvency as a result of the coronavirus. Spokesman Steffen Seibert told a news conference in Berlin that: \u201cThe government will do everything to support businesses and workers in this great economic challenge. \u201cOur goal is that ideally no business in Germany will fall into insolvency due to the coronavirus outbreak, and ideally no job will be lost.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quotes). German firms will be suffering badly from the coronavirus chaos, particularly travel firms and manufacturers (whose supply chains have been badly disrupted). So if the economy does fall into recession, a lot of help could be needed. BP\u2019s share price has slumped to its lowest level since 2016 (the last time the oil price cratered). That\u2019s a blow to BP\u2019s army of small shareholders. At just 320p, shares are dropping towards the levels seen after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010. Some more bad news for incoming Bank of England boss Andrew Bailey: his leaving do has been scrapped due to coronavirus fears. The party for the outgoing Financial Conduct Authority chief executive was set to take place on Wednesday evening at the RSA House near Charing Cross, just a few days before he\u2019s meant to take up the BoE post on 16 March. TheCityUK, which co-organised the event with the FCA, had been expecting around 170 attendees, including FCA employees, journalists and people from across banking, insurance and professional services industry. The industry lobby group said in an email to attendees that after \u201cconsultation with the FCA, we are cancelling our event with Andrew Bailey, Chief Executive of the FCA, due to ongoing concerns related to COVID-19.\u201d That could be a relief for Bailey -- last week, MPs blasted the FCA\u2019s \u201cculture and operations\u201d, saying there was an unacceptable \u201cgap\u201d between public expectations and its performance. Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, says Saudi Arabia has created a race to the bottom to sell Crude into the market: \u201cSaudi Arabia declared an oil price war this weekend, as OPEC+ departed Vienna on Friday without a deal. It\u2019s still a slight hope that Saudi Arabia is playing this card in an effort to push OPEC+ members back to the negotiation table before the current production cuts expire at the end of March, however Russia is unlikely to bend to such power tactics. \u201cSaudi Arabia basically offered its oil on a fire-sale as it dropped its Official Selling Prices (OSPs) to all regions by $6-8 per barrel - the sharpest decline in Saudi Arabia\u2019s OSPs in decades. Saudi Arabia is undercutting everyone else by a mile, and as such it has created a race to the bottom where everyone must undercut each other in order to be able to sell their crude oil into the market. The oil price is still languishing at its lowest since early 2016, down over 20% today. US crude: down $8.7 at $32.50 per barrel Brent crude: down $9 at $36.15 per barrel This is a particular blow to America\u2019s oil industry. Thousands of jobs could be lost at Houston, Texas, the centre of the US energy industry. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, analyst Amrita Sen of Energy Aspects warned that \u201cHouston is going to suffer so much, they\u2019re already suffering...\u201d Stock markets in Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Singapore have all fallen into bear market territory today, amid a wave of selling, Bloomberg reports. Volatility in European stock markets (known as the Fear Index) has hit its highest levels since the eurozone debt crisis back in 2011. Another very worrying sign. The oil price war has triggered turmoil in the currency market too. Russia\u2019s rouble has slumped by over 7% today (an astonishing slump) from 68 roubles to the US dollar to nearly 74. Saudi\u2019s decision to launch an aggressive oil price war - by cutting prices and boosting output - could hurt Russia\u2019s economy badly, taking a massive chunk out of Moscow\u2019s revenues. Optimism among eurozone investors has absolutely crumbled this month, as the coronavirus crisis has raged. The monthly Sentix survey of investor morale, just released, has slumped to -17.1 for March, down from +5.2 in February. That\u2019s the lowest reading since April 2013, when the eurozone debt crisis was raging, and even worse than expected. It shows that many experts expect Europe to slump into recession in 2020 (including Berenberg, as we reported earlier). Sentix chief Manfred Huebner said \u201cinvestors are preparing for a long period of economic weakness\u201d, and urged policymakers to take action quickly. As Sentix puts it: The new coronavirus, which is now spreading significantly across the globe and requires consistent measures to contain it, is plunging the global economy into recession. Never before has such a strong synchronised collapse of the global economy been measurable in our data. The Saudi price war could drive oil prices below $30 a barrel for the first time since the 2016 oil price crash, according to market experts at S&amp;P Global Platts. The price reporting agency said a \u201creasonably aggressive\u201d stance from the Saudis could see the Kingdom raise its production from 9.75 million barrels a day in the first quarter to 10.25 million barrels per day in 2Q. But a \u201cmore aggressive and offensive\u201d stance could see Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil output surge to highs of 11 million barrel a day, enough to drive the oil price into the $20s for the first time since early 2016 if the coronavirus is not contained. Meanwhile Russia is expected to raise its oil production by 300,000 barrels a day within the next three months before US shale oil producers are forced out of the market by lower prices. Shin Kim, at S&amp;P Global Platts, says \u201cAll signs point to Saudi Arabia and Russia wanting to inflict maximum pain. \u201cAt the very least to instigate as fast a response as possible from US shale producers and each other.\u201d The FTSE 100\u2019s early-morning slump is one of the worst in history, reports Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. He suspects that investors are moving from the \u201cpanic\u201d stage to the full-blown \u201ccapitulation stage\u201d, as the coronavirus crisis escalates. \u201cThinking about buying in today\u2019s market is only for the brave and there remains considerable uncertainty about the spread of coronavirus and its effect on economies and society. \u201cBy 9am the FTSE was trading 7.1% lower at 6,004 which put the index back to the levels seen before the EU referendum vote in early 2016. \u201cThe index initially fell to 5,899 on Monday, representing an 8.7% decline which is the fourth biggest one-day fall on record. The worst falls were recorded on 19 October 1987 (-10.8%) and 20 October 1987 (-12.2%) during the Black Monday crash, and then on 10 October 2008 (-8.8%) as the global financial crisis unfolded. \u201cVery few stocks escaped the misery. In early trading on Monday funeral services group Dignity was among the stocks in positive territory, perhaps as investors predicted it would see an increase in demand. However, this rally was short lived and its shares quickly started to fall. Today\u2019s market rout comes as the number of Covid-19 infections worldwide bursts over the 110,000 mark. The global death toll is heading towards 4,000 -- including the third death in the UK last night. Our main coronavirus liveblog has all the details: After 90 minutes trading, the London stock market is still reeling from its opening 8.5% crash. But there are signs that the City is catching its breath. The Footsie is still suffering a right old kicking, but has now clambered back over the 6,000 point mark. It\u2019s currently 348 points lower at 6115, a loss of 5.5% today -- which would be its worst since 2008. Oil giants BP and Royal Dutch Shell are the top fallers, both down by 15% right now, tracking the slump in crude prices (currently down 20%). Gavekal Research analyst Tom Holland says Saudi Arabia has triggered today\u2019s market rout by launching an oil price war over the weekend. As he puts it: \u201cIf you ever wondered what would happen if someone lobbed a hand grenade into a bloodbath, now you know. It\u2019s not pretty,\u201d (that\u2019s via the FT). Germany bank Berenberg has forecast that the coronavirus will drag Europe\u2019s economy into recession this year. It has slashed its forecast for European growth, and sees a sharp downturn in Italy and Germany during 2020. It also believes the UK will only grow by 0.9% this year, even if the government boosts spending in Wednesday\u2019s budget. Berenberg\u2019s Holger Schmieding explains: Italy: We now expect GDP to decline by 1.0% instead of 0.3% in Q2. With a downward revision to Q1 GDP from -0.1% to -0.8%, this takes our forecast for the full year 2020 to -1.2% from -0.3%. Eurozone: We now project that GDP will fall by 0.4% qoq in Q1 and 0.5% qoq in Q2 instead of stagnating in Q1 and falling mildly by 0.2% qoq in Q2. For full-year 2020, we look for a contraction of -0.1% instead of growth of 0.5%. Germany: We now look for declines in GDP by 0.2% and 0.6% qoq in Q1 and Q2 instead of falls by just 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. That brings our annual forecast 2020 as a whole to -0.4% instead of 0%. France: We now expect GDP to rise merely by 0.1% instead of 0.2% qoq in Q1 and contract by 0.3% instead of advancing by 0.1% in Q2. For the full year 2020, we now look for growth of just 0.3% instead of 0.8%. UK: We reduce our 2020 call to 0.9% from 1.3% previously after lowering Q1 to 0.3% qoq from 0.4%, Q2 to 0.0% qoq from 0.3% and Q3 to 0.3% from 0.4%. We expect the UK to announce a sizeable fiscal stimulus in response to the virus-related disruptions on 11 March. After a panicky open, the European stock markets are all suffering huge losses as well. The Milan stock market is absolutely tumbling, after Italy\u2019s government sealed off large swathes of its country in an attempt to combat Covid-19. This has dragged the FTSE MIB index of Italian shares down by 10% - a proper crash. The selloff is dragging the EU-wide Stoxx 600 index into a bear market, alongside the FTSE 100. Today\u2019s stock market slump is attracting parallels with the crash of 1987. Neil Wilson of Markets.com writes: This will be remembered as Black Monday. If you thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse than the last fortnight, think again. The blood really is running in the streets, it\u2019s utter carnage out there. The astonishing 30% slump in the oil price today (thanks to the Saudi price war), is having a serious impact on equities. That\u2019s because anyone who bet on the oil price going up is suffering massive losses, and may be forced to sell shares to cover them. As Wilson puts it: There\u2019s a risk of losses in oil positions needing to be covered by selling down elsewhere - we\u2019re in a vicious circle. Equity markets are hideous today and these kind of moves are to be afraid of as they can lead to aggressive tightening in credit that can spiral into real financial distress. We don\u2019t know even know what kind of impact the coronavirus will have on the economy yet bond and equity markets are screaming recession. The FTSE 100 is now more than 20% off its recent peak -- which means we\u2019re in Bear Market territory. Back in January, the blue-chip index was trading over 7,600 points -- some 22% higher than this morning\u2019s trough. As you can see, the slump began two weeks ago -- after it became clear that Covid-19 was spreading across the globe, with a spike of cases in Italy. This means the nation\u2019s pension pots, ISAs and other savings will have suffered very severe damage this year. Money is absolutely pouring into government bonds, as investors try to find somewhere safe to put their money. This is forcing prices to stratospheric highs, which pushes the yield (or interest rate) to new lows. The yield on Britain\u2019s two-year government bonds (or gilts) has just fallen below zero. That means the UK government could effectively borrow for free, and simply return the money in 2022. A good sign? Hardly. The yields on US Treasury bonds are also falling again to fresh record lows. It suggests the markets are very pessimistic about growth and inflation prospects, and highly reluctant to own shares this morning. European stock markets are also plunging this morning. The Stoxx 600, which contains Europe\u2019s largest 600 companies, has tumbled by over 6%. As in London, many stocks failed to open at the start of trading -- implying that market-makers were struggling to match buy and sell orders. I think that\u2019s why Italy is only down 2% right now.... This morning\u2019s tumble, below 6,000 points, means the FTSE 100 is languishing at its lowest point since summer 2016. Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision to launch an oil price war, and the deepening coronavirus crisis, are a toxic combination for markets. Kyle Rodda of trading firm IG explains: Markets have gone into panic mode, pure and simple. The fall-out between the Russian and Saudis has lead the Saudis to pledge over the weekend that it will flood the global oil market with supply, in order exert their will over oil prices. The plunge in the oil price has raised major credit risks in financial markets, which are already reeling from the expected slowdown in global growth because of the coronavirus. Here are the top fallers on the FTSE 100, as panicky investors ditch stocks. Shares in international equipment rental firm Ashtead is now leading the rout -- its business would be badly hurt by a global recession. There are still no risers. NEWSFLASH: The FTSE 100 index has plunged by over 8.5%, on track for its worst one-day fall since 2008. The index of top blue-chip shares has slumped by around 565 points, or 5895, as trading gets under way. Every stock is in the red, hit by fears of a global recession. Oil giants are leading the rout, with BP down 27% and Royal Dutch Shell losing 20%, following the oil-price war launched by Saudi Arabia over the weekend. This is really unusual - and a bad sign. The London stock market is struggling to match buy and sell orders this morning. Ding ding! European markets are open, triggering a burst of sell orders. The FTSE 100 is being dragged deep into the red.... already shedding 120 points or 2%. But half the index isn\u2019t actually trading yet -- including the banks and the oil giants. This suggests there are going to be BIG losses this morning. Shares in Saudi Aramco, the country\u2019s oil giant, have been suspended after slumping by 10% in early trading. The oil price has suffered an astonishing plunge overnight. Brent crude slumped by 30% at the start of trading, after Saudi Arabia effectively launched an oil price war against competitors such as Russia and the US. After failing to get Russia\u2019s agreement for major supply cuts, Saudi authorities retaliated by slashing export prices and boosting production. This sent Brent crude reeling to just $31 per barrel at one point -- its lowest since 2016 - down from $45 on Friday night. It\u2019s the biggest single fall since the start of the first Gulf war in 1991, and there\u2019s chatter that the price could fall even lower if other players retaliate. Analysts in Australia are reeling from its worst stock market slump since 2008, my colleague Martin Farrer reports: \u201cThere is genuine panic in the price action \u2026\u201d said Chris Weston, head of research at the web trading platform Pepperstone in Melbourne. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything like this for years.\u201d David Bassanese, chief economist at BetaShares Capital in Sydney, said the market would not bottom out until the US situation was clearer. \u201cWe need a clear sign that the outbreak in the US is contained but we\u2019re not there yet because the number of cases and deaths is still on the rise. We have to see what happens with containment measures there, such as travel restrictions and shutdowns. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Tin hats on! Global stocks markets are facing their worst day since the financial crisis of 2008. The escalating coronavirus crisis, and the eruption of an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, are triggering a massive wave of selling today. Asia-Pacific stock markets have been severely hit already. Fears that Covid-19 will trigger a global recession has sent investors reeling, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei slumping by 5%. Australia\u2019s market has tumbled by a shocking 7%, its worst day since the crisis. European markets are heading for similar losses - Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is being called down 600 points, or over 9%, when the new trading week begins. We\u2019ve not seen such a severe loss since the aftermath of Lehman Brother\u2019 collapse a decade ago. This would plunge European markets into a full-blown bear-market --- wiping 20% off their recent peaks. Trading in US stock market futures has been frozen overnight, after falling 5%: Italy\u2019s decision to quarantine 16 million people has triggered turmoil in the markets, as investors try to assess which other countries will take similar measures -- and its impact on growth. Ratings agency Moody\u2019s has already weighed in, warning that the risk of a global recession was rising as the spread of the coronavirus causes a simultaneous supply and demand shock throughout the world economy. As my colleague Martin Farrer writes: Stock markets in Europe and the United States are braced for their biggest falls since the 2008 financial crisis after the start of the trading week saw panic selling amid the double threat of a coronavirus-driven global recession and an oil-price war. It follows huge losses on Asian markets on Monday where fears about the worsening worldwide economic slowdown were exacerbated by the shock decision by Saudi Arabia over the weekend to increase oil production in an attempt to drive competitors such as Russia and the US out of the market. We\u2019ll be tracking all the action through another dramatic day -- which will also see a new test of eurozone investor confidence: The agenda 9.30am GMT: The Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence: expected to plunge to -12.2, from +5.2",

      "body": "<p>The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is facing mounting pressure to announce a package of emergency measures in Wednesday\u2019s budget designed to support companies and households through the worst of the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>Business leaders warned that the growing scale of the disruption for the economy amid widespread panic on financial markets meant urgent steps were required to shore up confidence. The Institute of Directors said Sunak needed to announce measures on Wednesday to provide UK companies with extra breathing space to spread out their tax payments.</p> <p>Tej Parikh, chief economist at the IoD, said: \u201cGovernment must be at the ready to take swift action to help cash-strapped businesses bridge this challenging period. The upcoming budget also provides an opportune moment to lower business costs and support investment to amplify the post-outbreak recovery.\u201d</p> <p>Firms facing financial distress should be given more time to pay VAT, payroll taxes and corporate tax, the IoD said, adding that HMRC\u2019s \u201ctime to pay\u201d scheme - which offers firms more generous payment terms \u2013 should be expanded.</p> <p>The Bank of England is expected to be called upon by the Treasury to provide extra support to struggling firms. Andrew Bailey, who replaces Mark Carney as the Bank\u2019s governor on 16 March, said last week that Threadneedle Street was in talks with the chancellor about providing a coordinated package of short-term financing to firms.</p> <p>Economists said this could take the form of government guarantees for commercial banks to provide firms with short-term loans, with any losses being underwritten by the Treasury.

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is facing mounting pressure to announce a package of emergency measures in Wednesday\u2019s budget designed to support companies and households through the worst of the coronavirus outbreak. Business leaders warned that the growing scale of the disruption for the economy amid widespread panic on financial markets meant urgent steps were required to shore up confidence. The Institute of Directors said Sunak needed to announce measures on Wednesday to provide UK companies with extra breathing space to spread out their tax payments. Tej Parikh, chief economist at the IoD, said: \u201cGovernment must be at the ready to take swift action to help cash-strapped businesses bridge this challenging period. The upcoming budget also provides an opportune moment to lower business costs and support investment to amplify the post-outbreak recovery.\u201d Firms facing financial distress should be given more time to pay VAT, payroll taxes and corporate tax, the IoD said, adding that HMRC\u2019s \u201ctime to pay\u201d scheme - which offers firms more generous payment terms \u2013 should be expanded. The Bank of England is expected to be called upon by the Treasury to provide extra support to struggling firms. Andrew Bailey, who replaces Mark Carney as the Bank\u2019s governor on 16 March, said last week that Threadneedle Street was in talks with the chancellor about providing a coordinated package of short-term financing to firms. Economists said this could take the form of government guarantees for commercial banks to provide firms with short-term loans, with any losses being underwritten by the Treasury. The IoD also called on ministers to put pressure on high street banks to provide access to cheap emergency loans. Laura Gardiner, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cThere have been lots of examples from the past decade of this. Something like that again could be used, with focus on the firms that would suffer the worst hit.\u201d She said the Bank could issue an emergency rate cut of around 50 basis points, sinking the cost of borrowing back down to the lowest level in its 325-year history at 0.25%. Britain\u2019s biggest commercial bank, NatWest \u2013 which is still majority-owned by the government after RBS collapsed in the financial crisis \u2013 said it would provide \u00a35bn of funding support to small firms. It will also offer loan repayment holidays of up to six months, temporary emergency loans and fee-free borrowing. Barclays is offering its business clients 12-month capital repayment holidays on loans worth more than \u00a325,000, as well as bigger overdrafts and access to a \u00a314bn fund launched last year as part of a three-year commitment to small firms to build resilience during uncertain times. Business confidence in Britain is rapidly evaporating as the disruption to the world economy caused by the coronavirus mounts. About one in five company bosses surveyed by the IoD said the outbreak represented a high or severe threat to their organisation, with a further 40% seeing the risk as moderate. Gardiner said the government could launch a compensation scheme for firms with high statutory sick pay bills, which could be increasingly required if more workers were forced to self-isolate. The government previously had a programme called the \u201cpercentage threshold scheme\u201d, which provided support to companies struggling with staff absences but was abolished in 2014. The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that cuts to VAT \u2013 as deployed to support firms and families in the financial crisis \u2013 would be unsuitable for the chancellor this time around.

It comes from the mother of Harry, my two-year-old son with cystic fibrosis, a chronic health condition that makes him particularly vulnerable to respiratory viruses.</p> <p>I write this from a place of deep anxiety, stemming from the familiarity I have with the smells of fear and tears accompanying an intensive care unit in a children\u2019s hospital. A year ago, I watched as my son was sedated and put on oxygen because of complications arising from rhinovirus \u2013 the common cold \u2013 combined with two other respiratory viruses. I shudder to think what Covid-19 could do to his already compromised lungs.</p> <p>But I am more worried about the human reaction to the virus in the weeks to come than I am about the actual virus. And the virus is terrifying. I predict we will witness, as we have already started to, the worst of humanity, including people fighting over toilet paper in a supermarket, people hoarding supplies meaning that others miss out, people going to work when they\u2019re sick or letting their kids out of the house when they should be quarantined. Two weeks is a long time to spend at home to limit the spread of the virus, but I am urging people to please abide by the rules, because doing so will protect the vulnerable. Doing so will protect Harry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-symptoms-what-are-they-and-should-i-see-a-doctor\">Coronavirus symptoms: what are they and should I see a doctor?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because of Covid-19\u2019s infancy, we are yet to fully understand how it will affect people with cystic fibrosis, or the many others with compromised immune systems.

      "bodyText": "In a time of panic, please don\u2019t forget to be kind. Before you roll your eyes at this worthy statement, know it doesn\u2019t come from a place of virtue. It comes from the mother of Harry, my two-year-old son with cystic fibrosis, a chronic health condition that makes him particularly vulnerable to respiratory viruses. I write this from a place of deep anxiety, stemming from the familiarity I have with the smells of fear and tears accompanying an intensive care unit in a children\u2019s hospital. A year ago, I watched as my son was sedated and put on oxygen because of complications arising from rhinovirus \u2013 the common cold \u2013 combined with two other respiratory viruses. I shudder to think what Covid-19 could do to his already compromised lungs. But I am more worried about the human reaction to the virus in the weeks to come than I am about the actual virus. And the virus is terrifying. I predict we will witness, as we have already started to, the worst of humanity, including people fighting over toilet paper in a supermarket, people hoarding supplies meaning that others miss out, people going to work when they\u2019re sick or letting their kids out of the house when they should be quarantined. Two weeks is a long time to spend at home to limit the spread of the virus, but I am urging people to please abide by the rules, because doing so will protect the vulnerable. Doing so will protect Harry. Because of Covid-19\u2019s infancy, we are yet to fully understand how it will affect people with cystic fibrosis, or the many others with compromised immune systems. However, with the death toll rising it is obvious there is cause for serious concern. According to Centers for Disease Control data collated by John Hopkins University, the virus has claimed more than 3400 lives globally, with more than 100,000 cases reported.

      "bodyText": "Qantas has reduced its international flying capacity by a quarter, grounding eight Airbus A380s and leaving just two of the largest planes in its fleet flying. The cuts to international routes will last for six months after a \u201csudden and significant drop in forward travel demand\u201d, the airline says. Smaller planes will now service a number of key international routes. Globally, the airline industry could lose more than US$100bn (A$150bn) this year because of plunging passenger numbers. Qantas\u2019s signature Sydney-Singapore-London return service (QF1 and QF2) will be temporarily rerouted to become a Sydney-Perth-London service. To help cut costs, Qantas\u2019s chief executive, Alan Joyce \u2013 Australia\u2019s highest paid executive, who took home nearly $24m in 2018 \u2013 will take no salary this financial year. Annual management bonuses have also been scrapped this year, and the chairman and board will take no fees \u2013 or a significant reduction in fees. Non-essential recruitment and consultancy work has been frozen and staff will be asked to take paid or unpaid leave in light of reduced flying activity. Joyce said the past fortnight had seen a sharp drop in bookings on the airline\u2019s international network as the global coronavirus spread continues. \u201cWe expect lower demand to continue for the next several months, so rather than taking a piecemeal approach we\u2019re cutting capacity out to mid-September,\u201d he said. \u201cThis improves our ability to reduce costs as well as giving more certainty to the market, customers and our people. \u201cWe retain the flexibility to cut further or to put capacity back in as this situation develops.\u201d Joyce said reducing flying was the most effective way for Qantas to cut costs and preserve its workforce. \u201cLess flying means less work for our people, but we know coronavirus will pass and we want to avoid job losses wherever possible. We\u2019re asking our people to use their paid leave and, if they can, consider taking some unpaid leave given we\u2019re flying a lot less. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict how long this situation will last, which is why we\u2019re moving now to make sure we remain well-positioned. But we know it will pass, and we\u2019ll be well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities when it does.\u201d Globally, airlines around the world are being forced into similar cost-cutting measures. Carriers have cancelled flights into airports within lockdown regions. United Airlines, JetBlue and Lufthansa have closed routes. British Airways and Air France-KLM are allowing passengers who book flights to change their travel plans without a fee for the next year. The International Air Transport Association has estimated that global revenue losses for passenger airlines in 2020 will be between US$63bn and US$113bn. Moody\u2019s Investors Service has revised its outlook for the global passenger airlines industry to negative from stable. \u201cThe negative outlook reflects the increasing risk to demand for passenger air travel as the coronavirus expands globally,\u201d said Jonathan Root, Moody\u2019s senior vice-president. \u201cThe uncertainty and the speed of the outbreak will pressure airlines\u2019 operating profits and cash generation for at least the first half of 2020. We expect further capacity reductions as the number of infected people and affected countries grow.\u201d Moody\u2019s now estimates an operating margin of less than 5% for 2020 for the aggregate of the airlines it rates, down from its pre-coronavirus expectation of about 9%. Significant unknowns \u2014 uncertainty about the virus\u2019s active period, its eventual geographic spread and the scale of infections in a given country or region \u2014 complicate efforts to project the operational and financial impact. Qantas and Jetstar will contact customers affected by changed flight schedules in the next week. Typically, customers flying internationally will be offered an alternative flight via another capital city or a partner airline, or travel on an alternative day. Disruption to domestic passengers is expected to be minimal given the continued high frequency on most routes. The latest information will be published on Qantas and Jetstar websites.",
