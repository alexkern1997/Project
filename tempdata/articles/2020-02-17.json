Xu Zhiyong, a former law lecturer and founder of the social campaign New Citizens Movement, was taken away by police on Saturday evening while he was seeking refuge at the home of a lawyer in the southern city of Guangzhou, activists Ye Du and Hua Ze said. His host Yang Bin, her husband and son were also taken away for \u201chiding criminals\u201d but were released after 24 hours, they said. Yang has reportedly posted comments online demanding officials be held responsible for the whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang who died this month. A staff member who answered the phone at the Shilou township Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou refused to comment. Xu published an essay early this month, which called on China\u2019s president to resign for his lack of ability to govern China, citing the coronavirus crisis and the mishandling of the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests \u2013 a dangerous move that guarantees official anger. \u201cYou didn\u2019t authorise the truth to be released, and the outbreak turned into a national disaster,\u201d Xu wrote. \u201cWhenever you face looming crisis, you\u2019re clueless,\u201d Xu wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an evil man, you\u2019re just not wise \u2026 Mr Xi Jinping, please step down.\u201d Facing criticism over Beijing\u2019s handling of the outbreak, Xi said in a speech reported by state media on Saturday evening that he had given instructions on fighting the disease as early as 7 January.

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and this is your run-down of the top stories this Monday.</p> \n<p>Media coverage of Caroline Flack has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/16/politicians-condemn-press-intrusion-after-caroline-flacks-death\">widely condemned</a> after the death of the Love Island presenter at the weekend, weeks before her trial for assaulting her partner was due to begin. Labour leadership hopeful Keir Starmer said some stories had \u201camplified\u201d damaging social media posts about the 40-year-old star, who is believed to have taken her own life, and that he would push for ways to \u201cdiversify\u201d the press if he was party leader. The Lib Dem MP Daisy Cooper said Flack had been \u201chounded\u201d by parts of the media. The cabinet minister Grant Shapps, speaking on Sky News, argued that there was a duty of care for everybody involved in such cases, including the crown prosecution service, which has been criticised for pushing ahead with the assault case. Prominent barristers have also highlighted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/feb/16/barristers-warn-of-strain-on-defendants-caroline-flack-death\">the strain placed on defendants in domestic abuse cases.</a></p> \n<p>ITV has also been criticised for failing to stand by Flack when the charges were laid as the case <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/16/caroline-flack-death-turns-spotlight-on-tabloids-once-again\">turns the spotlight back on tabloid intrusion</a>. The station cancelled its episode of Love Island last night but will air a tribute to Flack tonight. Laura Whitmore, who succeeded Flack as host of Love Island, suggested on Five Live that media coverage had contributed to her friend\u2019s death. Our TV writer Tim Jonze <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/16/caroline-flack-the-sparky-presenters-death-is-a-stomach-churning-shock\">says Flack\u2019s fragility and openness made her the perfect fit as Love Island host</a>. And you can read our obituary of her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/16/caroline-flack-obituary\">here</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Dennis deluge \u2013 </strong>A record number of flood warnings have been issued across the country after Storm Dennis lashed Britain with heavy rain and strong winds, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/16/storm-dennis-prompts-life-threatening-flood-warnings-in-south-wales\">inundating thousands of homes and causing widespread disruption to transport</a>. Only a week after Storm Ciara brought a similar deluge, major incidents were declared in south Wales and parts of England. Pontypridd, north of Cardiff, was under water and faced being cut off for several days after roads were blocked by rising waters and landslides. Hundreds of flights were cancelled across Britain and roads and railways were submerged, with commuters facing a chaotic journey to work for the second Monday in a row.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad6f36639ba605952e70f978114c7d7c7be1996d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad6f36639ba605952e70f978114c7d7c7be1996d/86_0_4218_2532/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A boy wades through a flooded alleyway in Pontypridd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A boy wades through a flooded alleyway in Pontypridd.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Munns/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Japan warning \u2013</strong> Japan is facing a deepening crisis over the coronavirus outbreak after 70 more cases were detected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/17/coronavirus-japan-braces-for-hundreds-more-cases-as-another-china-city-locked-down\">along with six new cases on the mainland</a>. Experts say the country, which is the worst affected after China, is still in the \u201cearly stages\u201d of the outbreak with 59 confirmed cases along with 355 on the ship. The health system is straining to cope, with a hospital near Tokyo forced to stop accepting new patients on Monday. The outbreak, which has now infected more than 71,000 people worldwide and killed 1,775, could also force the Tokyo Marathon set for 1 March to be scaled down. Chinese competitors have been asked to defer entry until next year.

Spire Healthcare was already in the spotlight after an independent inquiry into rogue breast surgeon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/04/ian-paterson-inquiry-culture-of-denial-allowed-rogue-breast-surgery\">Ian Paterson</a>, who is serving 20 years in jail for mistreating patients.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Presenter\u2019s death throws spotlight back on media Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and this is your run-down of the top stories this Monday. Media coverage of Caroline Flack has been widely condemned after the death of the Love Island presenter at the weekend, weeks before her trial for assaulting her partner was due to begin. Labour leadership hopeful Keir Starmer said some stories had \u201camplified\u201d damaging social media posts about the 40-year-old star, who is believed to have taken her own life, and that he would push for ways to \u201cdiversify\u201d the press if he was party leader. The Lib Dem MP Daisy Cooper said Flack had been \u201chounded\u201d by parts of the media. The cabinet minister Grant Shapps, speaking on Sky News, argued that there was a duty of care for everybody involved in such cases, including the crown prosecution service, which has been criticised for pushing ahead with the assault case. Prominent barristers have also highlighted the strain placed on defendants in domestic abuse cases. ITV has also been criticised for failing to stand by Flack when the charges were laid as the case turns the spotlight back on tabloid intrusion. The station cancelled its episode of Love Island last night but will air a tribute to Flack tonight. Laura Whitmore, who succeeded Flack as host of Love Island, suggested on Five Live that media coverage had contributed to her friend\u2019s death. Our TV writer Tim Jonze says Flack\u2019s fragility and openness made her the perfect fit as Love Island host. And you can read our obituary of her here. * * * Dennis deluge \u2013 A record number of flood warnings have been issued across the country after Storm Dennis lashed Britain with heavy rain and strong winds, inundating thousands of homes and causing widespread disruption to transport. Only a week after Storm Ciara brought a similar deluge, major incidents were declared in south Wales and parts of England. Pontypridd, north of Cardiff, was under water and faced being cut off for several days after roads were blocked by rising waters and landslides. Hundreds of flights were cancelled across Britain and roads and railways were submerged, with commuters facing a chaotic journey to work for the second Monday in a row. * * * Japan warning \u2013 Japan is facing a deepening crisis over the coronavirus outbreak after 70 more cases were detected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, along with six new cases on the mainland. Experts say the country, which is the worst affected after China, is still in the \u201cearly stages\u201d of the outbreak with 59 confirmed cases along with 355 on the ship. The health system is straining to cope, with a hospital near Tokyo forced to stop accepting new patients on Monday. The outbreak, which has now infected more than 71,000 people worldwide and killed 1,775, could also force the Tokyo Marathon set for 1 March to be scaled down. Chinese competitors have been asked to defer entry until next year. In China an activist has been arrested for criticising president Xi Jinping and in Hong Kong an armed gang has stolen a shipment of toilet rolls as panic-buying grips the city. * * * Rogue surgeon \u2013 A private healthcare firm is under scrutiny after a second case emerged of a doctor who subjected patients to unnecessary operations that left many of them in pain. Spire Healthcare was already in the spotlight after an independent inquiry into rogue breast surgeon Ian Paterson, who is serving 20 years in jail for mistreating patients. The Guardian reveals today that Michael Walsh, a shoulder surgeon, was sacked by Spire after patients and colleagues raised concerns about his work. An investigation uncovered examples of Walsh harming patients by performing surgery on them unnecessarily or badly. Walsh has now retired. * * * Cummings\u2019 \u2018misfit\u2019 \u2013 Labour has called for a government adviser to be sacked after his controversial views about pregnancy, race and women\u2019s sport came to light. Andrew Sabisky, 27, was made an adviser at No 10 as part of Dominic Cummings\u2019 trawl for \u201cmisfits and weirdos\u201d to help him shake up government. Sabisky wrote in 2014 that women should be forced to have contraception to stop unplanned pregnancies. He also claimed African Americans have a lower IQ than whites and compared women\u2019s sport to the Paralympics. Jon Trickett, Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet office minister, said there were \u201cno words\u201d to describe Sabisky\u2019s appointment. * * * Ring cycle \u2013 An American woman has hailed the \u201cgood people in the world\u201d after a ring she lost 47 years ago in Portland, Maine was returned to her in the post after being unearthed by a metal detectorist in a forest in Finland. Debra McKenna expressed her delight at the return of the ring, which was given to her by her late husband when they were at high school. The ring was inscribed with the school\u2019s name, a graduation date and her husband\u2019s initials, enabling sheet metal worker Marko Saarinen to track her down. Today in Focus podcast Tom Phillips, the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent, is back in Venezuela a year after the start of a dramatic, but so far unsuccessful, attempt to topple Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. While conditions in Caracas appear slightly improved, outside the capital conditions in schools and hospitals are appalling \u2013 and getting worse. Lunchtime read: James Taylor on The Beatles, Joni and Trump We have an astonishingly frank interview today with singer-songwriter James Taylor in which he discusses his turbulent childhood, his heroin addiction and his relationship with Joni Mitchell. Promoting his new album in London, he recalls hanging out with the Beatles (\u201cI was a bad influence\u201d), life in Hollywood\u2019s legendary Laurel Canyon (\u201cIt really was a perfect moment\u201d) and, of course, Trump (\u201cIt\u2019s like the Confederacy has won the civil war\u201d).

The club could also face sanctions in the Premier League, potentially being docked points, as the ramifications of the ruling reach far and wide. Arteta\u2019s Arsenal team cut loose in the second half to beat Newcastle 4-0 in the Premier League at the Emirates Stadium, while Son Heung-min capitalised on Bjorn Engels\u2019 error to score a late winner for Tottenham as they beat Aston Villa 3-2. A superb innings from Eoin Morgan reeled in South Africa in an extraordinary run chase that gave England a 2-1 T20 series win. Lisa Keightley\u2019s England will consider themselves contenders for the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup in Australia, which begins at the end of the week, despite the hosts\u2019 status as clear favourites. England fly-half George Ford has predicted Ireland will be firing at Twickenham when the two sides meet in the Six Nations on Sunday. And the BBC has said it will no longer use the pundit Craig Ramage after the former midfielder criticised Derby County\u2019s \u201cyoung black lads\u201d, saying they needed \u201cbringing down a peg or two\u201d.

      "bodyText": "More than 200 people stranded on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan by the coronavirus outbreak will be flown to the Northern Territory, where they must remain in quarantine for a further 14 days. Scott Morrison said on Monday that 209 Australians still aboard the cruise ship, in quarantine in Yokohama since 3 February when cases of Covid-19 were discovered on board, would be brought to Australia on a Qantas charter flight on Wednesday. The evacuees would be taken to the former construction workers\u2019 village at Howard Springs, outside Darwin, where they would remain in quarantine for a further 14 days. About 150 Australians on Diamond Princess are over the age of 60. \u201cI understand that those who were on board will feel very frustrated about this, as will their family members,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cBut our first responsibility is that we have to protect the health and safety of Australians in Australia.\u201d The camp already houses more than 200 Australian evacuees brought from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, on a Qantas flight on 9 February. They would be kept separate from the new arrivals, said Prof Dianne Stephens, the deputy chief health officer of the Northern Territory. \u201cWe can quarantine the two groups and have them not mixing at all,\u201d Stephens said. The US, Hong Kong and Canada are also in the process of evacuating their citizens from the Diamond Princess. On Monday the US State Department said 14 of 300 US citizens and family members who had been on the ship had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The American passengers were preparing to return to the US on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed of the positive tests. The passengers were allowed to board the plane, but were isolated from the others and would be monitored closely. A further 99 cases of coronavirus were confirmed among Diamond Princess passengers on Monday, including two Australians, bringing the total to 454. Meanwhile, the first group of Australians evacuated from Wuhan who were taken to Christmas Island have completed their quarantine and were returned to the Australian mainland on Monday. None tested positive to the coronavirus. Some of the evacuees touched down in Sydney, while others were bound for Canberra, Adelaide, Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane. One passenger from Sydney said she was \u201cfeeling so exhausted it\u2019s kind of just a relief\u201d. She said Christmas Island was \u201creally positive\u201d and she was \u201cvery surprised by the care of all the teams\u201d. \u201cI was expecting a detention centre, and that\u2019s what it was, but did not expect the warmth of the people,\u201d she told AAP. Another group of 35 who arrived on Christmas Island later after being evacuated on an Air New Zealand flight that travelled via Auckland must remain to finish their 14 days in quarantine later this week. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, acknowledged that the people on board the cruise ship had already been in quarantine for 12 days and had \u201cdone everything that they have been asked to do\u201d. The extra two weeks of quarantine was required due to uncertainty about how the virus was spreading on board the ship, Murphy said. \u201cWe are not quite sure why there have been ongoing infections. But given there have been recent cases, we cannot be absolutely sure that any of the currently well people on the ship who are coming home on Wednesday are not carrying the virus.\u201d Of more than 3,000 people on the Diamond Princess, there have been 355 confirmed cases of Covid-19, including more than 20 Australians who are being treated in Japan. Anyone from the ship who was not on the Qantas flight would be refused entry if they sought to enter Australia within the next 14 days, regardless of nationality, Morrison said. Murphy attributed the low number of coronavirus cases in Australia to the efficiency of the containment strategies the government had put in place. \u201cIf you are a passenger on the ship and you want to come back to Australia, your only option is to get on the flight,\u201d Murphy said. Morrison also confirmed that there were Australians on the MS Westerdam, a cruise ship that arrived in Cambodia on Friday, after a passenger was confirmed to have the virus. Thirty-nine Australian passengers are in Phnom Penh where they have been provided with accommodation by the Cambodian authorities and are being screened for the virus. Ten Australians have remained on board, along with another 200 passengers. \u2022 Australian Associated Press contributed to this report",

As the unexpected solution to a famous club\u2019s striker shortage, he will be the subject of wild attention and swift judgment, a situation a world away from the one he faced when he first moved to Europe in 2007 and became the latest in an only occasionally glorious line of compatriots attempting to forge a reputation at the Norwegian club Lyn.</p> <p>The star graduate, Mikel John Obi, had joined Chelsea the previous year, and the speedy striker Chinedu Obasi had left for Hoffenheim just before Ighalo\u2019s arrival, which followed unsuccessful trials at Sporting and Hertha Berlin, with the forward Ezekiel Bala and the midfielder Paul Obiefule already in the squad. Coaches at the club were used to evaluating young players as they took their first steps in European football, and the prevailing opinion of Ighalo was that he was likely to achieve only moderate success.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/05/odion-ighalo-reveals-he-took-pay-cut-to-make-dream-manchester-united-move\">Odion Ighalo reveals he took pay cut to make 'dream' Manchester United move</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have any special skills,\u201d says Rolf-Magne Walstad, who was in charge of the club\u2019s academy at the time. \u201cWe\u2019d had Mikel and Obasi, and they had some extreme physical capacities \u2013 the strength of John Obi, the speed of Chinedu, was unusual. We could see they would get to a higher level but with Odion, I cannot say I thought he would go on to score 15 goals in a Premier League season as he did for Watford.\u201d</p> <p>Lyn\u2019s then manager, the former United defender Henning Berg, was not convinced Ighalo contributed enough to the team, especially defensively, and despite a decent scoring record he was never a regular starter. \u201cAs a young player he was mature when it came to movement in the box,\u201d Walstad says. \u201cHe looked much more experienced than a usual 18 year old when it comes to finding the right spaces, behind a defence and between lines. He was so calm in front of goal, never nervous. When he left I was quite confident that he would be able to score goals at the highest level he could play. That he would be top scorer at the Africa Cup of Nations and a high scorer in the Premier League is a surprise.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"017d175654a4d732bc72547aaf947764b89841fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/017d175654a4d732bc72547aaf947764b89841fa/0_218_4330_2599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In his previous Premier League incarnation with Watford, Odion Ighalo began prolifically but the goals dried up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In his previous Premier League incarnation with Watford, Odion Ighalo began prolifically but the goals dried up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Davy/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Somehow, word of this callow but clinical young striker spread and he had started only five of Lyn\u2019s 14 league games of 2008 when he was brought to Udinese by Gino Pozzo, now owner of Watford. But in Udine the Italy internationals Antonio di Natale and Fabio Quagliarella were first-choice forwards and several other promising youngsters, including a 19-year-old Alexis S\u00e1nchez, were also fighting for game time, limiting Ighalo to one start and one goal in his one season. He next moved to Granada, another team then under the control of the Pozzo family but languishing at the time in Spain\u2019s third tier.</p> <p>Propelled by Ighalo\u2019s goals they were promoted in his first season and again in his second, returning to the top flight after 35 years. The club\u2019s local paper, Granada Hoy, has described him as \u201cthe club\u2019s most important player in the last 40 years\u201d.</p> <p>From there he moved to Watford, where his reputation flourished over an explosive 12 months that straddled promotion from the Championship and a first campaign back in the Premier League. Between 28 December 2014 and the same date the following year he scored 31 league goals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/10/ed-woodward-backs-ole-gunnar-solskjaer-to-lead-manchester-united-spending\">Woodward backs Solskj\u00e6r to lead Manchester United\u2019s summer spending</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMaybe the Premier League suits my style more than the other leagues I have played in and so I have scored more goals,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is very physical and very tough, and I know I am a physical player. I also have good technique and pace, so if you add those things together as a striker you\u2019re going to do well here.\u201d</p> <p>He could not, however, sustain it and there were only three goals in the 13 months from the end of 2015 until his move to China. He has scored consistently since, though in a lesser league.</p> <p>Ighalo is tall and quite fast, can beat defenders one on one with his favourite move, the so-called \u201cIghalo scoop\u201d, and finish well with head or feet.</p> <p>At Watford he excelled in partnership with Troy Deeney, showing that old knack for timing runs into space behind defences and so turning the Englishman\u2019s flicks and passes into goals, but he has been prolific in China as a sole striker. He has had barren spells, and he got hate mail after playing poorly for his country at the 2018 World Cup, but he also brings more to a team than goals, captaining Nigeria at the 2009 Under-20 World Cup and Changchun Yatai in China.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e45626265bce83c30beb575aa21b6a20ab6baec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e45626265bce83c30beb575aa21b6a20ab6baec/0_152_4076_2446/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Odion Ighalo scores for Nigeria against Burundi in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Odion Ighalo scores for Nigeria against Burundi in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Visionhaus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe was always willing to do extra work, not only what the team was doing,\u201d Walstad says. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good story and it proves that players that maybe don\u2019t have the X-factor can have other things that are much more difficult to find in my experience. He\u2019s someone other kids can look up to, who proves if you\u2019re humble, if you work hard enough, you can get there.\u201d</p> <p>As the player himself puts it: \u201cMy motto is work hard and pray. Be humble and always ready to learn.

      "bodyText": "After Odion Ighalo\u2019s unexpected loan move at the end of January and his coronavirus-related quarantine, at Stamford Bridge on Monday he is expected to become the first Nigerian to play for Manchester United. As the unexpected solution to a famous club\u2019s striker shortage, he will be the subject of wild attention and swift judgment, a situation a world away from the one he faced when he first moved to Europe in 2007 and became the latest in an only occasionally glorious line of compatriots attempting to forge a reputation at the Norwegian club Lyn. The star graduate, Mikel John Obi, had joined Chelsea the previous year, and the speedy striker Chinedu Obasi had left for Hoffenheim just before Ighalo\u2019s arrival, which followed unsuccessful trials at Sporting and Hertha Berlin, with the forward Ezekiel Bala and the midfielder Paul Obiefule already in the squad. Coaches at the club were used to evaluating young players as they took their first steps in European football, and the prevailing opinion of Ighalo was that he was likely to achieve only moderate success. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have any special skills,\u201d says Rolf-Magne Walstad, who was in charge of the club\u2019s academy at the time. \u201cWe\u2019d had Mikel and Obasi, and they had some extreme physical capacities \u2013 the strength of John Obi, the speed of Chinedu, was unusual. We could see they would get to a higher level but with Odion, I cannot say I thought he would go on to score 15 goals in a Premier League season as he did for Watford.\u201d Lyn\u2019s then manager, the former United defender Henning Berg, was not convinced Ighalo contributed enough to the team, especially defensively, and despite a decent scoring record he was never a regular starter. \u201cAs a young player he was mature when it came to movement in the box,\u201d Walstad says. \u201cHe looked much more experienced than a usual 18 year old when it comes to finding the right spaces, behind a defence and between lines. He was so calm in front of goal, never nervous. When he left I was quite confident that he would be able to score goals at the highest level he could play. That he would be top scorer at the Africa Cup of Nations and a high scorer in the Premier League is a surprise.\u201d Somehow, word of this callow but clinical young striker spread and he had started only five of Lyn\u2019s 14 league games of 2008 when he was brought to Udinese by Gino Pozzo, now owner of Watford. But in Udine the Italy internationals Antonio di Natale and Fabio Quagliarella were first-choice forwards and several other promising youngsters, including a 19-year-old Alexis S\u00e1nchez, were also fighting for game time, limiting Ighalo to one start and one goal in his one season. He next moved to Granada, another team then under the control of the Pozzo family but languishing at the time in Spain\u2019s third tier. Propelled by Ighalo\u2019s goals they were promoted in his first season and again in his second, returning to the top flight after 35 years. The club\u2019s local paper, Granada Hoy, has described him as \u201cthe club\u2019s most important player in the last 40 years\u201d. From there he moved to Watford, where his reputation flourished over an explosive 12 months that straddled promotion from the Championship and a first campaign back in the Premier League. Between 28 December 2014 and the same date the following year he scored 31 league goals. \u201cMaybe the Premier League suits my style more than the other leagues I have played in and so I have scored more goals,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is very physical and very tough, and I know I am a physical player. I also have good technique and pace, so if you add those things together as a striker you\u2019re going to do well here.\u201d He could not, however, sustain it and there were only three goals in the 13 months from the end of 2015 until his move to China. He has scored consistently since, though in a lesser league. Ighalo is tall and quite fast, can beat defenders one on one with his favourite move, the so-called \u201cIghalo scoop\u201d, and finish well with head or feet. At Watford he excelled in partnership with Troy Deeney, showing that old knack for timing runs into space behind defences and so turning the Englishman\u2019s flicks and passes into goals, but he has been prolific in China as a sole striker. He has had barren spells, and he got hate mail after playing poorly for his country at the 2018 World Cup, but he also brings more to a team than goals, captaining Nigeria at the 2009 Under-20 World Cup and Changchun Yatai in China. \u201cHe was always willing to do extra work, not only what the team was doing,\u201d Walstad says. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good story and it proves that players that maybe don\u2019t have the X-factor can have other things that are much more difficult to find in my experience. He\u2019s someone other kids can look up to, who proves if you\u2019re humble, if you work hard enough, you can get there.\u201d As the player himself puts it: \u201cMy motto is work hard and pray. Be humble and always ready to learn. And no matter what you have achieved, don\u2019t get carried away and still believe you are learning.\u201d Apparently when his mother was told her son had completed his move to Manchester, she wept with joy. For Ighalo, a United fan since childhood, the next few months will be the pinnacle of his career. \u201cWe want players here who want to give everything they\u2019ve got,\u201d said Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r of his signing, and that surely much can be guaranteed. Ighalo\u2019s journey started in Ajegunle, a rough slum area of Lagos, and will end with retirement to the palatial house he recently built in Lekki, one of the city\u2019s more exclusive suburbs, which literally has the words \u201cIghalo Residence\u201d written on the side in foot-high gold letters, near the swimming pool and five-a-side pitch. Across town in Ijegun there is another building with his name on it, the orphanage he funded and opened in 2017. Having long since achieved financial security, Ighalo has nothing more to chase except dreams.",

Meanwhile concern is growing over possible infections among passengers from another cruise liner that docked in Cambodia last week. On Sunday a traveller from the MS Westerdam was confirmed to have the virus in Malaysia, days after disembarking along with hundreds of other passengers. It is not clear how many travellers remain in Cambodia and how many have already travelled on to further destinations. The Cambodian health ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The cruise operator, Holland America Line, told Reuters that guests who had left Cambodia would be \u201ccontacted by their local health department and be provided further information\u201d. It is not clear if passengers will be asked to self-isolate once they return home. Hundreds of American passengers from the Diamond Princess, where travellers have been mostly confined to their cabins since 3 February, have been flown back to the US. Fourteen passengers tested positive during the evacuation, the US state department said. Australia said it would follow suit on Wednesday. Both countries have said citizens will face a further two weeks of quarantine after arriving home. Forty American passengers who were diagnosed with the virus have already been transferred to hospitals in Japan. Some Diamond Princess passengers still on the ship face another two weeks in isolation if they have shared a cabin with someone who tests positive. The total number of people infected around the world climbed to more than 71,000 on Monday, including a further 2,048 confirmed cases in China, where the total number of deaths stands at 1,770.

In the UK the same proportion of cases and deaths as China (currently) would mean around 3,000 cases and 70 deaths.</p> <p>Despite being far lower than typical annual numbers of flu patients in the UK, there is little doubt that the virus landing in the UK in such numbers would generate widespread panic and have a significant effect on economic activity. In this case, we think the policy response could be more significant \u2013 the Bank of England could take interest rates down close to their zero lower bound in response to the virus becoming more entrenched, though it is not obvious that fiscal policy would be loosened much further than is already planned (especially now Mr Johnson has installed his own man into the Treasury as Chancellor, who may well opt to loosen fiscal policy more than was expected under his predecessor).</p> <p>Still, even more money could be directed towards health spending to help eradicate the virus.

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap: Japan has suffered its worst quarter since 2014. Japanese GDP shrank by 1.6% in the final quarter of this year, the equivalent of a 6.3% annualised slump. Consumer spending fell sharply, hit by a recent sales tax hike, while business investment also dropped. Economics fear that Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest country, could fall into recession this year -- as the coronavirus hits companies exposed to China. Germany\u2019s Bundesbank has warned that its economy doesn\u2019t appear to be picking up, since it stagnated in the final quarter of 2019. It also cited the coronavirus as a threat to growth this year. Japanese bank Nomura has predicted that China\u2019s economy is facing its biggest slowdown since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Airline Cathay Pacific has slashed its profit forecasts, after suffering tumbling demand since the crisis began. Markets have rallied in China, and Europe, after Beijing\u2019s central bank cut the interest rate on its loans to businesses. It could be a prelude to a larger stimulus programme soon. In the UK, consumer confidence has jumped.... as have house prices. European stock markets are clinging onto their earlier gains, with the Stoxx 600 and Germany\u2019s DAX on track for record closing highs. It all feels a little relaxed, given the uncertainty over the coronavirus and the bleak GDP figures from Japan today. Rupert Thompson, Chief Investment Officer at Kingswood, says: That said, the markets do look somewhat complacent. There remains a risk that events turn out significantly worse than markets are now assuming. Epidemiologists seem to be much less sure than the markets that the epidemic is under control. The global economic recovery may also not be quite as secure as markets would have us believe. The spread of the virus may be slowing but estimates of the disruption to Chinese economic activity have been growing. Last week\u2019s return to work and re-opening of factories has not surprisingly been a half-hearted affair given many travel restrictions still in place. Chinese GDP now looks likely to post an outright q/q decline in the first quarter. As for global growth, it will also be hit by the collapse of Chinese tourism and disruption to global supply chains and may grind to a halt in Q1. Shares in Anglo-French biotechnology group Novacyt have surged by over 50% today, after the company launched a molecular test to clinically detect the coronavirus. Novacyt believes this is the first such test to be certified in the EU, following its earlier launch of a \u2018research only\u2019 [RUO] test on 31 January. This new test can be used directly by laboratories and hospitals for the testing of patients, without needing to be validated by clinician, the company says. Novacyt is already deluged with demand -- with requests for quotations for 288,000 CE-Mark tests since they were made available to pre-order on 14 February 2020. The Company has received orders for 40,000 RUO tests and requests for quotations for an additional 35,000 RUO tests prior to the launch of the COVID-19 clinical version. Demand for the tests has come from China, the US and the UK, as well as many other countries around the world, adds the company, which has offices in Camberley, Surrey, United Kingdom and V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay, France. Novacyt\u2019s stock has been soaring since its RUO test was launched. It was worth \u20ac0.186 per shares on 20 January, but has now rattled to \u20ac1.86 today. Graham Mullis, CEO of Novacyt says the test can help tackle the coronavirus outbreak: As with our research use only test, it can produce a result in less than two hours, with the added efficiency of being able to transport the test at ambient temperatures eliminating the need for cold chain shipping. It is designed to run on multiple instrument platforms commonly used by clinical laboratories around the world, which ensures our COVID-19 test can be used by the largest possible number of clinicians. We look forward to continuing to support clinicians in the fight to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus during this public health emergency.\u201d What might covonavirus mean for the UK? Nomura\u2019s base-case scenario is that Britain isn\u2019t particularly affected by the outbreak. But in its \u2018severe scenario\u2019 of a long, global, pandemic... growth would be almost wiped out this year, and there would be 70 deaths. Nomura explains: The severe scenario does not only see China\u2019s lockdown last for longer but the disease spreads to match Chinese levels. In the UK the same proportion of cases and deaths as China (currently) would mean around 3,000 cases and 70 deaths. Despite being far lower than typical annual numbers of flu patients in the UK, there is little doubt that the virus landing in the UK in such numbers would generate widespread panic and have a significant effect on economic activity. In this case, we think the policy response could be more significant \u2013 the Bank of England could take interest rates down close to their zero lower bound in response to the virus becoming more entrenched, though it is not obvious that fiscal policy would be loosened much further than is already planned (especially now Mr Johnson has installed his own man into the Treasury as Chancellor, who may well opt to loosen fiscal policy more than was expected under his predecessor). Still, even more money could be directed towards health spending to help eradicate the virus. Our numbers show annual economic growth falling to close to zero in 2020 from our 0.7% base case \u2013 a similar hit to what our US team have assumed. Nomura have also warned that Europe\u2019s economy would be badly hurt if the coronavirus crisis continues to rage in China until the summer, and becomes a full pandemic world wide. The Covid-19 outbreak is already hurting Europe\u2019s economy in three ways: imports from China are disrupted; tourists visits from China are down; and economic sentiment in Europe is hit. If China lifts its lockdown at the end of April, then these effects will be limited. But if the lockdown lasts for longer, and the virus spreads across the globe, then eurozone GDP would shrink this year -- with both Germany and Italy in a full-blown recession. Today\u2019s report warns: If China\u2019s lockdown measures continue for the entirety of H1 2020, but more importantly if the infection becomes pandemic, fear would likely increase dramatically in Europe and activity across all walks of economic life would be affected to some degree. A more prolonged slowdown in the Chinese economy would lead to even weaker trade flows, with Germany the most significantly affected among the big four. Supply chains would suffer from severe disruptions, while the spread of the virus to Europe would likely cause a domestic demand shock, with both consumption and investment being hit. In that case we assume euro area GDP would slow to -0.1% y-o-y in 2020 from our base case of 0.7% yo-y. Both Germany and Italy would likely fall into recession in 2020, and we would not exclude the possibility of further monetary policy loosening including lower interest rates and potentially a step-up in the asset purchase programme. Fiscal policy may need to be deployed more proactively too. Analysts at Japanese bank Nomura have published a detailed report on coronavirus -- which is packed with concerning forecasts. Their base case scenario is that China\u2019s growth rate will fall to just 3.0% year-on-year in the current quarter, down from 6% in 2019, with a firm risk of an even bigger slump. That would be the worst performance since the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Nomura say: So much damage has already been done to China\u2019s economy that, even with the lockdown easing in March, it is too late to avoid what is likely to be the largest quarterly drop in real GDP growth since the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989. This base case scenario shows growth recovering during 2020 as factories and offices reopen, and supply chains catch up. But in Nomura\u2019s worst-case scenario, the economy actually flatlines this quarter with just 0.5% growth. Full-year growth falls to 3.9% in 2020 (down from 5.7% originally forecast). Nomura points out that the lockdown measures imposed since the crisis began have hurt businesses, hampered production levels, and damaged consumer spending: China\u2019s economy is experiencing \u201cthe rare case of simultaneous demand and supply shocks\u201d, they warn: Because COVID-19 in China is far worse than SARs in terms of breadth and speed of infections, the \u2018fear factor\u2019 among China\u2019s population is palpable, with people shunning crowded places like shopping malls and restaurants, crimping consumption, which contributed nearly three-fifth of China\u2019s GDP growth last year China\u2019s central government has been pushing local provinces to get back to business, but there is resistance on ground. Nomura\u2019s Ting Lu says \u201cthis appears to be a classic case of prisoners\u2019 dilemma\u201d, with local politicians unwilling to risk being blame for more infections. If a local government official heeds the call of Beijing and eases its local lockdown measures, unblocks roads connecting to other regions, and shifts its focus to reopening factories and shops, the gain would be quite limited if other governments continue to limit commerce and the national logistics network remains in shambles. Also, this local government would be risking a rapid rise of infections in its territory. If that happens, the local government officials could take all the blame, and may even lose their jobs and be subject to further penalties. We believe this special \u201cprisoners\u2019 dilemma\u201d mechanism is also playing a key role why business activities have been so slow to resume. Back in the UK, household confidence has jumped at its fastest rate in over a decade -- perhaps a sign that the Boris Bounce is real.... Just in: Germany\u2019s central bank has warned that its economy is still struggling, and could suffer from the coronavirus crisis in the months ahead. In its monthly update, the Bundesbank says it can\u2019t see any economic change in Germany this quarter -- which is disappointing, as the economy stagnated in the last quarter of 2019. The Bundesbank says: For the first quarter of 2020, there are still no signs of a fundamental economic change in Germany. With regard to industry, the downward trend in incoming orders continued until the end of 2019, albeit with a further decrease in intensity,. However, the mood in this sector of the economy has visibly improved recently. This could indicate that the downward pressure on industrial production is gradually easing.... However, economic risks exist with regard to the coronavirus outbreak in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Here\u2019s our news story on Cathay Pacific\u2019s profits warning: Here\u2019s some more of today\u2019s business stories - from rising house prices in the UK to a row over General Motors: Cathay Pacific Group Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam says his company has endured its toughest Chinese New Year ever. Lam explains that the company\u2019s performance declined dramatically in the last week of January, as the novel coronavirus situation became more severe. This forced the company to cut capacity, and warn today that results for 2020 will be worse than hoped. Lam says: \u201cThis was the most challenging Chinese New Year period we have experienced. As the novel coronavirus outbreak in mainland China intensified towards the end of the holiday period, travel demand dropped substantially. With more governments worldwide having imposed travel restrictions on passengers from mainland China and in some cases Hong Kong, we are seeing continued cancellations of bookings. We have since taken a series of short-term measures in response. These notably include the sharp reduction of capacity across our global network. For February and March, we have now reduced our overall passenger flight capacity by approximately 40%, representing further reduction since our recent announcement. Passenger capacity reduction is also likely for April as we continue to monitor and match market demand. Meanwhile, we have kept our freighter capacity intact. The full statement is online here. Here\u2019s Danny Lee of the South China Morning Post on Cathay Pacific\u2019s warning: Cathay has also reported a 3.8% drop in total passenger traffic last month, compared to January 2019. Incoming passenger numbers to Hong Kong fell 40% -- a staggering slump, which is actually better than the 46% slide seen in November and December. Speaking of airlines....flights from Heathrow today are still being affected by computer problems: Ouch! Airline group Cathay Pacific has just warned that the coronavirus outbreak will have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on its financial results. Hong Kong\u2019s flag carrier says it has slashed capacity by 40% in February and March having suffered a drop in passenger numbers since the crisis began. Cathay was already being hit by the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, so the coronavirus is another blow -- leading to fresh cancellations and refund requests from customers. Cathay Pacific warns: \u201cThe first half of 2020 was already expected to be extremely challenging financially,\u201d \u201cAs a result of this additional significant drop in demand for flights and consequential capacity reduction caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak, the financial results for the first half of 2020 will be significantly down on the same period last year.\u201d The coronavirus crisis has hurt the diamond market, according to London-listed Petra Diamonds this morning. Petra told the City that sentiment in the precious jewels market has \u201csignificantly weakened \u201cdue to the outbreak of the coronavirus in China. Operational cash flow benefits are being eroded by a weaker diamond market, due to the outbreak of the coronavirus, which has served to significantly reduce activity across the pipeline. Diamond sales have been hurt by the retail stores over the important Chinese New Year period. The subsequent postponement of the Hong Kong International Diamond, Gem and Pearl show from early March to mid-May has also damaged confidence. Petra warns that the market could be weak until Covid-19 is under control: The virus is expected to further impact diamond trading and consumer spending in this region (ca. 14% of diamond sales) and further afield, with the end result that activity is expected to reduce across the diamond pipeline until the virus is brought under control. Petra also reported a 6% drop in revenues in the last six months, due to a drop in rough diamond prices. Overnight, ratings agency Moody\u2019s has warned that the coronavirus has dented optimism just as global economy showed signs of stabilization. In a new report, Moody\u2019s explains that it has cut its growth forecasts due to the impact of the coronavirus. It now expects the G20 to grow by 2.4% in 2020, down from 2.6% previously. It also warns that the global economy faces \u201csevere\u201d downside risks if the coronavirus grows to pandemic proportions. Moody\u2019s vice president Madhavi Bokil explains: \u201cThe outbreak will first and foremost hurt China\u2019s economy by lowering discretionary consumer spending on transportation, retail, tourism and entertainment. There is already evidence - albeit anecdotal - that supply chains are being disrupted, including outside China. Furthermore, extended lockdowns in China would have a global impact given the country\u2019s importance and interconnectedness in the global economy,. \u201cWith the virus continuing to spread within China and to other parts of the world, it is still too early to make a final assessment of the impact on China and the global economy.\u201d European stock markets have shrugged off Japan\u2019s dire GDP report. The main bourses are all up this morning, with Germany hitting a new record high. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 16 points, or 0.2%, to 7425 points - recovering some of Thursday and Friday\u2019s losses. Traders are cheered by the news that Beijing\u2019s central bank has lowered the interest rate it charges commercial banks for loans. That is means to encourage lending, and could be a sign that the People\u2019s Bank of China will cut its benchmark rates soon. Economists at ING also believe Japan will sink into a recession this quarter, dragged down by weak spending. They told clients that: \u201cConsumer spending, which slumped following the tax hike in the fourth quarter of 2019, will now struggle to do anything except contract further in the first quarter as the impact of Covid-19 weighs on consumer sentiment, weighing in particular on the consumer services sector.\u201d \u201cSome further government spending may help to curb any further contraction in GDP beyond 1Q20. But that will not stop what started off as a technical downturn from evolving into a full-blown recession. Japan\u2019s habit of reporting GDP in annualised terms is causing some confusion this morning..... We\u2019re still waiting for Canada to cough up its GDP report for the final three months of 2019. But most other major countries have satisfied our thirst for data, and we can see that Japan was the worst-performing major economy last year. America was the strongest member of the G7, followed (some way behind) by the UK. Germany, France and Italy all had a poor year -- dragging the wider eurozone down too. Economist Rupert Seggins has rounded up the details: Japan\u2019s stock market fell following its weak GDP report. The Nikkei lost 164 points or 0.7%, as it ended today\u2019s session at 23,523 points. Other Asia-Pacific markets did better, though. China\u2019s CSI 300 index jumped by over 2% on talk of a Beijing stimulus package to protect its economy from the coronavirus damage. The Bank of Japan governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, has hinted that he could ease monetary policy if the coronavirus outbreak hurts the Japanese economy. Kuroda told the Sankei newspaper that Covid-19 virus was the \u201cbiggest uncertainty\u201d facing Japan\u2019s domestic economy, adding: \u201cWe would need to consider monetary policy steps if (the virus outbreak) significantly affects Japan\u2019s economy.\u201d Japan\u2019s economy was also hurt by super-typhoon Hagibis, which struck the country last October. The biggest storm to strike Japan in decades killed at least 90 people, causing widespread flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, says this was one reason Japan\u2019s economy shrank so sharply last quarter, along with the sales tax hike. Minami told AFP: \u201cThere was a hit from natural disasters but consumer sentiment was particularly weak after the tax hike despite government measures to ease the impact.\u201d Taro Saito, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute, is also bracing for recession, telling Reuters: \u201cThere\u2019s a pretty good chance the economy will suffer another contraction in January-March. The virus will mainly hit inbound tourism and exports, but could also weigh on domestic consumption quite a lot. If this epidemic is not contained by the time of the Tokyo Olympic Games, the damage to the economy will be huge.\u201d Here\u2019s more reaction -- none of it particularly positive: Josh Mahoney of IG is worried that the coronavirus will drive Japan\u2019s economy lower. John Ferro of Bloomberg is worried that two of the Big Four economies are at risk of recession. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit fears Japan will struggle until the summer (when the Tokyo Olympics could lift growth). Japan\u2019s economy is now on the brink of recession after shrinking last quarter, and many economists fear it could soon topple in. The coronavirus outbreak is a clear threat to Japan\u2019s economy, given many Japanese manufacturers rely on Chinese companies in their supply chains. Scores of major firms have already closed their factories across China, which will quickly hurt production output. A second consecutive contraction this quarter would means recession: Daiwa Securities economist Mari Iwashita explains: \u201cBecause of the effects of the novel coronavirus, weakness in consumption will likely continue in the January-March period. Exports and production could be dreadfully weak as the supply chain is interrupted.\u201d Robert Ward, Japan chair at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, fears Japan\u2019s economy may struggle to grow this year. Danske Bank analysts also fear recession after today\u2019s \u201cgloomy\u201d Japanese GDP figures, telling clients that: The economy shrank at an annualized pace of 6.3% q/q in Q4, the deepest contraction in five years. The impact of the VAT hike and typhoon Hagibis weighed on economic activity and recession fears are mounting amid the coronavirus outbreak in neighbouring China. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Worries over the global economy have intensified today, after Japan\u2019s economy suffered its sharpest contraction in five years. Japanese GDP shank by 1.6% during the last three months of 2019, new government data overnight shows. That equates to an annualised contraction of 6.3%, against forecasts of 3.9%. That\u2019s a very sharp decline, and much worse than economists had expected. It means Japan has suffered its worst quarter since 2014 -- and its second largest slump since the financial crisis more than a decade ago. Consumer spending fell by 2.9% during the quarter, for the first time in over a year, led by weaker demand for cars, household appliances and alcohol. Tokyo\u2019s government must shoulder some blame -- they were warned that hiking Japan\u2019s sales tax to 10%, from 8%, last autumn would hurt consumption. Business investment also dropped, driven by weaker spending on construction and production machinery. And in another worrying sign, imports and exports both declined. It underlines that Q4 2019 was bad time for the global economy, with growth slowing in China, the UK and Germany stagnating, and France and Italy contracting. Adam Cole of RBC Capital Markets says fears over Japan\u2019s economy are on the rise. Consumer spending fell almost 3% q/q, more than reversing the Q3 rise (0.5%) as households reacted to the October consumption tax increase. Private capital spending also slumped and the data will prompt talk of recession if the monthly data look like they are adding up to another fall in Q1. Otherwise, it could be a quieter day in the markets....especially as Wall Street is shut for President\u2019s Day. The agenda 10am GMT: Eurozone construction output for December",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The escape, which took place on 7 February, went unreported for days until Ilyina herself told journalists she had broken out, posting a detailed video of her getaway on Instagram.</p> \n<p>Ilyina fell ill after returning from the Chinese resort island of Hainan last month and was put under quarantine by doctors.

      "bodyText": "A St Petersburg court has ordered a Russian woman to be forcibly confined to hospital after she dramatically broke out of coronavirus quarantine and blogged about her escape. Alla Ilyina, 32, was escorted by bailiffs and medical staff back to the Botkin infectious diseases hospital, where she had been held under quarantine, before short-circuiting the electronic lock to her hospital door and sneaking past doctors to an elevator. The escape, which took place on 7 February, went unreported for days until Ilyina herself told journalists she had broken out, posting a detailed video of her getaway on Instagram. Ilyina fell ill after returning from the Chinese resort island of Hainan last month and was put under quarantine by doctors. But after she tested negative for the virus on 6 February, she was told she would be held under quarantine for two weeks regardless. \u201cWhen they told me I was totally healthy, I requested that the doctors let me go home,\u201d she said in the video, which featured a schematic diagram detailing her escape plan. \u201cI said that according to the constitution, I have a right to my freedom. Also under Russian law, I have a right to refuse hospitalisation. They refused. So, I worked out a plan.\u201d The story went viral and led to a police search for Ilyina, who had locked herself in her apartment. The court on Monday ordered her to be admitted to hospital until at least Wednesday, in order to receive new test results. Russia has taken extraordinary measures to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus, closing its borders with China and putting dozens more under quarantine. But patients have complained about delayed test results and draconian rules that have left them trapped in hospitals. At least three people have fled quarantine since the coronavirus outbreak began, including a 34-year-old mother who jumped out of a hospital window with her son in the city of Samara. On Monday, the first Russian citizen was diagnosed with the new coronavirus \u2013 a woman onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan. Two Chinese citizens in Russia were diagnosed with the disease and have since been released. More than 140 Russians and others evacuees from Wuhan are also being quarantined at a sanatorium in western Siberia being patrolled by members of Russia\u2019s national guard.",

I was wrong. * Dr Song and Lin are pseudonyms \u2022 The author is a Chinese writer living in north America",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Other countries including Canada, Australia, Italy, South Korea and Israel have all made plans to evacuate their citizens from the ship.</p> \n<p>In a video uploaded to YouTube, a British passenger, David Abel, said: \u201cIt is all getting to us now.

      "body": "<p>Covid-19, the new coronavirus that has killed nearly 1,800 people in China, causes only mild disease in four out of five people who get it, the World Health Organization has said.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears that Covid-19 is not as deadly as other coronaviruses, including Sars and Mers,\u201d said the WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, adding that officials were \u201cstarting to get a clearer picture of the outbreak\u201d.</p> <p>The conclusion comes from analysis of data from Chinese authorities relating to 44,000 cases of Covid-19 in Hubei province, where the coronavirus was first recorded. </p> <p>\u201cMore than 80% of patients have mild disease and will recover, 14% have severe disease including pneumonia and shortness of breath, 5% have critical disease including respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ failure, and 2% of cases are fatal,\u201d Tedros said in Geneva. \u201cThe risk of death increases the older you are.\u201d</p> <p>He said children were not suffering from Covid-19 in the same way as adults, and more research was needed to find out why. There were still gaps in understanding that he hoped the WHO\u2019s team of international experts would be able to work towards filling.</p> <p>China has reported 70,365 cases of Covid-19 infection, 2,051 of those in the past 24 hours. The new cases include those confirmed by lab tests and those diagnosed through lung CT scans read by doctors. The vast majority of Chinese cases \u2013 94% \u2013 continue to be reported in Hubei province. China says there have been 1,772 deaths. Outside China, there have been 694 cases and four deaths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/corona_charts_17_feb/giv-3902sef6CcIaCMgI/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/corona_charts_17_feb/giv-3902sef6CcIaCMgI/\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Tedros said there appeared to be a decline in the number of new cases in China. \u201cThis trend must be interpreted very cautiously. Trends can change.\u201d He said the WHO would continue to work day and night to help countries prepare for the potential arrival of the coronavirus, sending testing kits and protective equipment, working with manufacturers to ensure supplies are maintained, and training health workers.</p> <p>He thanked countries that had contributed towards the $675m (\u00a3520m) that the WHO has said it needs to fight the epidemic, but he added: \u201cWe have not seen the urgency in the funding that we need. We have a window of opportunity now. We need resources now to ensure countries are prepared now.

      "bodyText": "Covid-19, the new coronavirus that has killed nearly 1,800 people in China, causes only mild disease in four out of five people who get it, the World Health Organization has said. \u201cIt appears that Covid-19 is not as deadly as other coronaviruses, including Sars and Mers,\u201d said the WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, adding that officials were \u201cstarting to get a clearer picture of the outbreak\u201d. The conclusion comes from analysis of data from Chinese authorities relating to 44,000 cases of Covid-19 in Hubei province, where the coronavirus was first recorded. \u201cMore than 80% of patients have mild disease and will recover, 14% have severe disease including pneumonia and shortness of breath, 5% have critical disease including respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ failure, and 2% of cases are fatal,\u201d Tedros said in Geneva. \u201cThe risk of death increases the older you are.\u201d He said children were not suffering from Covid-19 in the same way as adults, and more research was needed to find out why. There were still gaps in understanding that he hoped the WHO\u2019s team of international experts would be able to work towards filling. China has reported 70,365 cases of Covid-19 infection, 2,051 of those in the past 24 hours. The new cases include those confirmed by lab tests and those diagnosed through lung CT scans read by doctors. The vast majority of Chinese cases \u2013 94% \u2013 continue to be reported in Hubei province. China says there have been 1,772 deaths. Outside China, there have been 694 cases and four deaths. Tedros said there appeared to be a decline in the number of new cases in China. \u201cThis trend must be interpreted very cautiously. Trends can change.\u201d He said the WHO would continue to work day and night to help countries prepare for the potential arrival of the coronavirus, sending testing kits and protective equipment, working with manufacturers to ensure supplies are maintained, and training health workers. He thanked countries that had contributed towards the $675m (\u00a3520m) that the WHO has said it needs to fight the epidemic, but he added: \u201cWe have not seen the urgency in the funding that we need. We have a window of opportunity now. We need resources now to ensure countries are prepared now. We don\u2019t know how long this window of opportunity will remain.\u201d The WHO\u2019s director of emergencies, Dr Michael Ryan, said the outbreak should not be described as a pandemic, even though it has spread to 25 countries outside China. \u201cThe real issue is whether we are seeing efficient community transmission outside of China and at the present time we are not observing that,\u201d he said. Dr Sylvie Briand, the director of pandemic and epidemic diseases at the WHO, said the organisation was working closely with Japanese authorities regarding the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked off the coast of Japan. \u201cWe need to make sure that we focus on our objective, our public health objective, which is to contain the virus, and not to contain the people, and making sure that we can have the right balance between the health of the population in Japan and other countries, but also the health of the people being currently on this boat,\u201d she said. There were still many unknowns, she said. \u201cMeasures are implemented and assessed currently and monitored on a nearly hourly basis, because we learn every day and every hour more about this disease and this virus.\u201d Meanwhile, experts said reports that some people may have incubated the virus for far longer than the 14-day quarantine period before falling ill were likely to be anomalies. The China-based Global Times tweeted that one person had been diagnosed 34 days after being in Wuhan and another 94 days after contact with someone who lived in Wuhan. Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: \u201cThe last data I saw suggested 95% of people had incubation of less than 12 days. There will be the outlier, the occasional person who has a longer incubation period.\u201d But 34 days and 94 days were extremely unlikely, he said. \u201cThose people will have had another more recent exposure.\u201d He added: \u201cIncubation period is based on best possible evidence.

      "bodyText": "Here is quick summary of the latest coronavirus developments across the globe over the past few hours: A Holiday Inn hotel at Heathrow has been block-booked to serve as a coronavirus facility for those at risk of spreading the disease. British passengers stuck on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan could be flown home as the government considers a repatriation flight. It is too early to tell if the decline in new cases will continue, the WHO chief said, but the virus is certainly not as deadly as previous outbreaks. Doctors in Shanghai have started using the blood plasma from those who have recovered from the disease to treat new patients. Nearly half of China\u2019s population is living under some form of travel restrictions. The number of global cases is now over 71,000 - the vast majority are in mainland China, with 99 new cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. Doctors in Shanghai are using infusions of blood plasma from people who have recovered from the coronavirus to treat those still battling the infection, with some encouraging results. A top emergency expert at the World Health Organization said that using convalescent plasma was a \u201cvery valid\u201d approach to test, but it was important to get the timing right to maximise the boost to a patient\u2019s immunity. China\u2019s financial hub of Shanghai has had 332 infected cases, one of whom died in recent weeks. Lu Hongzhou, professor and co-director of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre, said that 184 people were still in hospital , including 166 mild cases, while 18 were in serious and critical conditions, Reuters reports. He said the hospital had set up a special clinic to administer plasma therapy and was selecting patients who were willing to donate. The blood would be screened to check if he or she had other diseases like hepatitis B or C, he added. \u201cWe are positive that this method can be very effective in our patients,\u201d he said. There are no fully licensed treatments or vaccines against the new coronavirus, and the process of developing and testing drugs can take many months and even years. Convalescent plasma has been proven \u201ceffective and life-saving\u201d against other infectious diseases, including rabies and diphtheria, Dr Mike Ryan, head of the WHO health emergencies programme, told reporters in Geneva. It is a very important area to pursue. Because what hyperimmune globulin does is it concentrates the antibodies in a recovered patient. You are essentially giving the new victim\u2019s immune system a boost of antibodies to hopefully get them through the very difficult phase. So it must be given at the right time, because it mops up the virus in the system, and it just gives the new patient\u2019s immune system a vital push at the time it needs it. But it has to be carefully timed and it\u2019s not always successful. Ryan added: \u201cSo it is a very important area of discovery, and I believe they are starting trials on that in China. But it is a very valid way to explore therapeutics, especially when we don\u2019t have vaccines and we don\u2019t have specific antivirals.\u201d As well as using plasma therapies, the Chinese doctors are also trying antiviral drugs licensed for use against other infections to see if they might help. Scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are due in weeks, while the head of a Wuhan hospital had said plasma infusions from recovered patients had shown some encouraging preliminary results. The deaths of four members of the same family in Wuhan have raised concerns over the practice of self-isolating at home, Chinese media group Caixin reports. Chang Kai, a director at Hubei Film Studios, died on 14 February aged 55 from pneumonia caused by the Covid-19 virus, according to an obituary published by his employer. His father, mother and older sister also died from the disease between 28 January and 14 February, according to the Caixin story. Chang Kai reportedly tried to take his ill father to a number of hospitals, but was turned away at each one due to a lack of beds. His father died at home a few days later. Many people in Wuhan isolating at home, as over-stretched hospitals struggle with the huge number of cases in the city. However, health experts have raised concerns that home quarantine can lead to cross-household and cross-community infections China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, spelled out his plan to contain the coronavirus crisis at a meeting of the core Chinese leadership today, Reuters reports. In the speech, Xi admitted there were \u201cshortcomings\u201d in China\u2019s emergency response systems and said local officials would be punished if they failed to \u201ctake responsibility\u201d or implement directives. He also condemned the \u201cmajor hidden danger\u201d of eating wild animals. The speech was noteworthy for putting Xi at the centre of events earlier than had been previously revealed, analysts said, as he referred to directions he\u2019d given at a 7 January meeting. Analysts also said the internal speech was unusual for being released to the public on Saturday, relatively soon after it was given. Xi was mostly absent from Chinese state media coverage of the crisis in its early days. His first public comments on the outbreak were on 20 January. A Pakistani international student on a university campus in Wuhan, the city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in China, has told of how he and other international students have been ordered not to leave their dormitories. More than 100 foreign students at Wuhan\u2019s Zhongnan University of Economics and Law had been allowed to visit grocery stores for one hour a week to purchase basic necessities. They have now apparently been advised to remain in isolation to reduce the risk of possible disease spread, though it is unclear if anyone has contracted the deadly virus. \u201cThere are lots of people in this situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not alone. For the past few days, we have been told to stay in our room and not go anywhere. Our exterior doors are locked and we cannot go outside.\u201d He and his fellow students spend most of their time in their rooms, only leaving to cook food in bulk to then refrigerate. The student said: We try to avoid talking to each other because we are scared. Face-to-face contact is limited and most of the time I stayed in my room. We speak over the internet. Since the university was closed in the beginning of January, students from Bangladesh, Nepal, Russia and elsewhere have been returned to their home countries, but those from some African and Latin American states are also among those who pass the days reading books, phoning home and watching TV. Movement has been increasingly restricted and prices of groceries have allegedly doubled. The student said the university administration was trying its best to manage the situation, but is required to keep the students indoors. They have basically told us if one of us gets infected, it will spread quickly to everyone else as we live in close proximity. At the moment we don\u2019t know if anyone is infected or not, we are so afraid. It still feels like a worst nightmare. Pakistani authorities have reportedly said that more than 500 students from the country are in Wuhan, but no plans for their evacuation have yet been announced. The Pakistani student said: All students are scared and waiting for this disaster to end or our countries to rescue us. We are trying to stay strong and encourage each other. It is too early to tell if the recent decline in new coronavirus cases will continue, the World Health Organization chief has said, and data must be interpreted \u201ccautiously\u201d. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of WHO, said in a press conference today: This trend must be interpreted very cautiously. Trends can change as new populations are affected. It\u2019s too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table. He added that the virus seems to be \u201cnot as deadly as other coronavirus including Sars and Mers\u201d, with the majority of patients making a full recovery. More than 80% of patients have mild disease and will recover. In about 14% of cases, the virus causes severe diseases including pneumonia and shortness of breath. And about 5% of patients have critical diseases including respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ failure. In 2% of reported cases, the virus is fatal, and the risk of death increases the older you are. We see relatively few cases among children. More research is needed to understand why. Nearly half of China\u2019s population is living under some form of travel restrictions, CNN analysis has revealed, as authorities strive to contain the coronavirus outbreak. Travel restrictions of varying degrees are still being enforced across a number of provinces and cities in mainland China, affecting over 780 million people. This includes Hubei, Liaoning, Beijing and Shanghai, with restrictions ranging from self-quarantines to limits on who can come and go from neighbourhoods. The strictest measures have been implemented in Hubei\u2019s four cities \u2013 Wuhan, Huanggang, Shiyan and Xiaogan \u2013 which have completely sealed off all residential complexes and communities. Residents receive daily essentials from neighbourhood committees, and the use of non-essential vehicles on motorways is banned. The World Health Organization is working \u201cvery closely\u201d with the Japanese authorities regarding the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked off the coast of Japan. Dr Sylvie Briand, director of pandemic and epidemic diseases at the WHO, said: We need to make sure that we focus on our objective, our public health objective, which is to contain the virus, and not to contain the people. And making sure that we can have the right balance between the health of the population in Japan and other countries, but also the health of the people currently on this boat. She said there was so much still unknown about the virus that measures were monitored on a nearly hourly basis as authorities learned more about the disease. The Department of Health has confirmed that a Holiday Inn at Heathrow Airport has been block booked to be used as a coronavirus facility. The hotel will be used by those who are considered at risk but have nowhere else to go. It can be used as a place for people to self-isolate if they have been advised to do so, and to be tested for the virus and await results. All tests will be carried out by clinicians and anyone who does test positive will be transferred straight to hospital. Heathrow is the UK\u2019s largest airline hub both in terms of incoming passengers but also those in transit. The son of a British couple stuck onboard the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship has renewed appeals for the UK government to help his parents. Steve Abel appeared in a video posted on his father\u2019s YouTube channel and admitted that his \u201cgreatest fear\u201d was that his parents would become separated in Japan. Throughout the video he displayed a white piece of paper reading \u201cMum and Dad are fine!\u201d but said that his parents were beginning to feel the effects of living in quarantine for an extended period of time. He said: Please bear in mind they\u2019ve been on that cruise ship for 28 days. They\u2019re getting pretty fed up and they are the way they are because of the stress, the confinement within the cabin. Steve also asked the authorities to give his parents more information. This is my plea \u2013 I want my mum and dad to wake up in the morning and actually have some information sent to them; they need to be communicated with. We\u2019re seeing things on the news and we\u2019re seeing things are happening but they\u2019re getting nothing, no one is actually speaking to them, which is driving them crazy. They must be going crazy as it is just being inside that cabin. Abel said he was extremely concerned that his parents may be separated abroad. Becoming visibly emotional, he said: My greatest fear is if they\u2019re separated. If they\u2019re not both on a flight home. But we\u2019re not going to think like that because they\u2019re coming home. Japan is on the brink of recession, after its economy shrank at its fastest pace in more than five years as the impact of the coronavirus epidemic continues to set in. Official figures showed gross domestic product (GDP) declined by 1.6% in the last quarter. If GDP falls for a second successive quarter, the economy will be in recession. Along with the coronavirus, a sales tax hitting consumer and business spending, and the impact of a major typhoon have also hit the world\u2019s third-largest economy badly. Taro Saito, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a pretty good chance the economy will suffer another contraction in January-March. \u201cThe virus will mainly hit inbound tourism and exports, but could also weigh on domestic consumption quite a lot. \u201cIf this epidemic is not contained by the time of the Tokyo Olympic Games, the damage to the economy will be huge.\u201d You can find out more on our Business live blog. A Russian court has ordered a woman who escaped from quarantine after testing negative for the disease to return to hospital for at least two more days. Alla llyina was admitted to hospital in St Petersburg on 6 February with a sore throat and was tested for the new coronavirus as she had returned from China five days earlier. She broke out of the hospital the next day by disabling an electronic lock in her room, after finding out she would have to spend 14 days in isolation instead of the 24 hours that doctors promised her. In an Instagram post, Ilyina wrote: \u201cWild. All three tests showed I was completely healthy, so why the hell the quarantine?\u201d Several days later, Russia\u2019s public health watchdog, Rospotrebnadzor, filed a lawsuit against her, asking the court to order compulsory confinement in hospital. Ilyina\u2019s defence lawyer argued during the court hearing on Monday that she didn\u2019t pose any danger to people around her and noted that she was allowed into a courtroom packed with dozens of people, none of whom wore masks. Health officials maintained that isolating Ilyina was a necessary measure to stop the virus from spreading, claiming it can be latent in a person for up to 24 days. The St Petersburg branch of Rospotrebnadzor did not respond to a request for comment on the effectiveness of the court ruling, given that Ilyina has already roamed free for almost 10 days after escaping. Last week, at least three other people in quarantine for possible coronavirus infection fled the same St Petersburg hospital. Two of them have since returned while the third a woman, named Anna Rybakova, remains at large, according to media reports. Rospotrebnadzor has filed a lawsuit to bring Rybakova back to the hospital as well, with a hearing scheduled for Wednesday. The chief of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, announced on Monday that health officials were looking into introducing harsher measures for patients who violated quarantine rules and stricter quarantine protocols. Russia has recorded only two cases of the Covid-19 disease, two Chinese citizens who have been treated and released. However, Russian authorities have confined in hospital hundreds of people who returned from China as a precaution. Russia has also halted most air traffic to China, suspended all trains to China and North Korea, and closed its land border with China and Mongolia. Russia\u2019s prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, has also said Russia may start deporting foreigners infected with the virus. A Russian woman onboard the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan is the first Russian citizen to be diagnosed with the disease. Here are the latest figures reported by each government\u2019s health authority as of Monday in Beijing, as the number of global cases reaches over 71,000: Mainland China: 1,770 deaths among 70,548 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei Hong Kong: 58 cases, 1 death Macao: 10 Japan: 519 cases, including 454 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, 1 death Singapore: 77 cases Thailand: 35 South Korea: 30 Malaysia: 22 Taiwan: 20 cases, 1 death Vietnam: 16 cases Germany: 16 United States: 15 cases; separately, 1 US citizen died in China Australia: 14 cases France: 12 cases, 1 death United Kingdom: 9 cases United Arab Emirates: 9 Canada: 8 Philippines: 3 cases, 1 death India: 3 cases Italy: 3 Russia: 2 Spain: 2 Belgium: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Sweden: 1 Cambodia: 1 Finland: 1 Egypt: 1 Richard Branson has responded to calls for help from those on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, saying Virgin Atlantic is in discussions with the UK government. Previously British passengers David and Sally Abel had made a direct appeal to the British business magnate to help fly them home, after the lack of action from the UK government over evacuation flights. A No 10 spokesman has since confirmed the Foreign Office is in contact with those on the ship to discuss a possible flight home. The University of Sussex said its student who was being checked for the Covid-19 coronavirus has tested negative. A spokesman said: \u201cRecently a student on our campus was tested and has been informed they do not have coronavirus. \u201cThe university is operating as usual and we continue to follow all the advice and guidance from Public Health England.\u201d Jessica Murray here, taking the reins for the rest of the afternoon - feel free to get in touch via @journojess_ on Twitter or jessica.murray@theguardian.com. A Holiday Inn near Heathrow airport has been closed to the public and designated as a potential coronavirus quarantine centre, the Independent has reported. The Holiday Inn Heathrow Ariel hotel, on Bath Road, closed on Saturday and staff were told it would not re-open for bookings until March at the earliest. The Independent reports that the hotel has been block-booked to be used as a potential quarantine zone for international visitors to the UK who develop coronavirus or for Britons evacuated to the UK from overseas. Guests booked at the Holiday Inn have been transferred to sister hotels. The hotel\u2019s general manager confirmed the hotel had been closed but said there had not been any cases of coronavirus at the hotel. From one cruise ship to another, the MS Westerdam ship, which eventually docked in Cambodia after being turned away from a number of Asian ports, has sparked some global concerns after a passenger coronavirus case was confirmed. An 83-year-old American woman who was on the ship tested positive for the virus in Malaysia, where she had flown to. Movement of passengers and crew has now stopped, with some in hotels in Cambodia\u2019s capital, Phnom Penh, and others still onboard the ship. The American woman was among several hundred passengers who were flown out of Cambodia on Friday and Saturday. According to authorities in Malaysia, 143 continued their flights home from that country, while the woman and her 84-year-old husband, who was diagnosed with pneumonia, remained behind for treatment. The dispersal around the world of passengers from the ship with possible exposure to the virus has sparked concern. \u201cI think now, given that there is a confirmed case that is suspected to have acquired infection on board the ship, the other passengers should be asked to quarantine themselves at home and alert health authorities if they develop fever or respiratory symptoms within the 14 days since disembarkation,\u201d said Prof Benjamin Cowling, from the School of Public Health at Hong Kong University. At this time, no other guests or crew onboard or at the hotel have reported any symptoms of the illness. Guests who have already returned home will be contacted by their local health department and provided further information, the ship\u2019s operator said. Several Westerdam passengers have already returned home and spoken to the media. Two Canadians who returned via Vancouver international airport were asked to put on protective face masks on arrival but were not otherwise isolated, Canada\u2019s CBC News reported. Hansen, from Surrey, British Columbia, told CBC that he did not hear about the American woman in Malaysia with the virus until he landed in Vancouver on Sunday. He said: I guess on the one hand it\u2019s upsetting to know that there was one case, but we\u2019re feeling fine. We\u2019ve had health scans, temperature scans and we don\u2019t have any concerns for our own health. Cambodia\u2019s government had originally earned kudos from the head of the World Health Organization for allowing the ship to dock, after it was turned away by Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Guam and Thailand. However, Cambodia\u2019s handling of the ship\u2019s passengers has since been criticised on social media, though it also has got some support. \u201cI think it would not be appropriate to keep passengers on the ship for 14 days, as it could be a high-risk environment,\u201d said Cowling. \u201cWe have seen the consequences of holding passengers on a cruise ship with the Diamond Princess outbreak,\u201d he said, referring to the cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama, Japan, which now has hundreds of coronavirus cases. The UK joins a growing number of countries considering repatriating citizens on the Diamond Princess. Israel\u2019s ministry of health has said it is preparing to evacuate several Israelis from the ship back to the country. In a statement, the ministry said three Israelis on the cruise ship had tested positive for coronavirus and would remain in Japan. However, the ministry added it was contacting insurance companies of the remaining 12 Israeli nationals onboard to have them flown back via a special direct flight. \u201cUpon returning they will enter home quarantine and undergo medical follow-up tests,\u201d it said. Foreign Office ministers are looking at chartering another flight to repatriate some or all of the 74 Britons on board the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship hit by 454 cases of coronavirus. \u201cWe sympathise with all those caught up in this extremely difficult situation,\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s deputy official spokesman said. \u201cThe Foreign Office is in contact with all British people on the Diamond Princess, including to establish interest in a possible repatriation flight. \u201cWe are urgently considering all options to guarantee the health and safety of those on board.\u201d Here are the latest developments: Of the 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, 14 have tested positive for coronavirus, the US state department said on Monday. Japanese officials have confirmed a further 99 people have been infected by the new coronavirus onboard the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess, bringing the total to 45. A Russian woman who was onboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner docked in Yokohama, Japan, has tested positive for coronavirus, the Russian embassy in Japan said on Monday. Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesperson confirmed the government was in contact with the 74 Britons on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship. China\u2019s parliament and its top political consultative body are both considering delaying annual meetings set for March. The standing committee of the parliament will meet on 24 February to deliberate the postponement, Reuters reports. The Tokyo Marathon will be closed to all but elite runners. Organisers said the 38,000 general participants who signed up for the race on 1 March will not be allowed to compete, a person with knowledge of the issue told Reuters. Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesperson confirmed the UK government was in contact with the 74 Britons on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The government is trying to gauge interest in the possible repatriation of the Britons stuck onboard, Reuters reports. The US has evacuated 300 of its citizens and family members by plane from the quarantined ship in Japan. The state department said 14 Americans among those evacuated had tested positive for the new coronavirus. Here\u2019s some more information on the possible delay of China\u2019s annual meetings set for March. The meetings of the parliament, or National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), and the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) were both due to begin early next month. But both China\u2019s parliament and its top political consultative body are both considering delaying annual meetings set for March, state media said on Monday. Reuters reports: The gatherings see more than 5,000 delegates descend on Beijing, the capital, from all over China, for at least 10 days, to pass legislation and unveil the year\u2019s key economic targets. A postponement would be the first since China adopted the current March schedule in 1995 for the meeting of parliament. The standing committee of the NPC will meet on Feb. 24 in Beijing, the official Xinhua news agency said. \u201cThe upcoming session is ... expected to deliberate a draft decision on postponing the third annual session of the 13th NPC,\u201d it said. The session was due to have begun on 5 March. The proposal was made in the belief it was important to focus on reining in the epidemic, Xinhua said. China has imposed transport curbs to halt the spread of the virus, which has killed 1,770 and infected nearly 71,000 in mainland China. The CPPCC is also studying whether to postpone its annual meeting, state-run CCTV said, due to have begun two days earlier, on 3 March. Five people familiar with the matter told Reuters this month that China was considering delaying the meetings as Beijing grapples with the epidemic. The parliamentary committee will also consider a proposed law banning wildlife trade and discuss government changes, Xinhua said, without elaborating. Japan is bracing for the possibility of hundreds of additional cases of the coronavirus onboard the stricken Princess Diamond, after health officials said on Monday that a further 99 people on the ship had tested positive. The passengers already evacuated from the ship face further uncertainty too, with the US and Australian citizens set for a further two weeks of quarantine after arriving home. Hundreds of American passengers have flown back to the US and Australia said it would follow suit on Wednesday. The US state department announced later that 14 of the 340 American evacuees were confirmed to have the virus in tests given before they boarded the planes. They were taken to the US because they did not have symptoms and were being isolated from other passengers on the planes, it said. It was not immediately clear whether the 14 were among the 99 new cases. Onboard the Diamond Princess, 454 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 out of an original total of about 3,600 passengers and crew. Japan\u2019s health ministry said it had tested 1,723 people on the vessel. Forty American passengers who were diagnosed with the virus on Sunday have been transferred to hospitals in Japan. Most of the people on the ship, which has the largest number of cases outside China, have yet to be tested. The health ministry will continue to test passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess, whose 14-day quarantine was due to end on Wednesday. Japanese public health experts advising the government defended the decision to isolate passengers and crew on the ship, even as the number of cases increased again on Monday. \u201cMany people are testing positive on the ship, but that is because we are testing everyone onboard, regardless of their medical condition,\u201d said Shigeru Omi, the chief director of the Japan Community Health Care Organisation. \u201cAnd 70% of those testing positive are not showing any symptoms at all.\u201d Omi said any disruption to this summer\u2019s Tokyo Olympics \u2013 including the Games\u2019 cancellation \u2013 would depend on how and if the virus mutates in the coming months, as well as the effectiveness of the international community\u2019s attempts to contain the outbreak. \u201cWhether the virus is under control by the time of the Olympics is anyone\u2019s guess,\u201d he said at a media briefing in Tokyo. Omi conceded that tracing the chain of domestic transmissions not related to the Diamond Princes was proving difficult, but denied Japan, which has confirmed 65 cases on land, was becoming a second major infection cluster. \u201cOur focus now is on community-based preventative action to lower the speed of the transmission of the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is true that there have been silent transmissions, but Japan is certainly not in a state of pandemic.\u201d A Russian woman who was onboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner docked in Yokohama, Japan, has tested positive for coronavirus, the Russian embassy in Japan said on Monday. Reuters reports the woman will be taken to a hospital and treated, citing a post by the embassy on Facebook. The woman is thought to be the first Russian national to contract the virus after the two previous cases found in Russia were Chinese nationals. Japanese officials have confirmed a further 99 people have been infected by the new coronavirus aboard the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess, bringing the total to 454, the health ministry said on Monday. AP reports: The ministry has been carrying out tests on passengers and crew on the ship, docked in Yokohama, a port city near Tokyo. The 14-day quarantine for those on the ship was due to end Wednesday. Outside China, the ship has had the largest number of cases of the Covid-19 illness caused by the virus that emerged in China late last year. Japan will close next month\u2019s Tokyo Marathon to all but elite professional runners. Organisers of the Tokyo Marathon said the 38,000 general participants who signed up for the race on 1 March will not be allowed to compete, a person with knowledge of the issue told Reuters. The event will instead be limited to top-level competitors, which includes 176 elite runners and 30 elite wheelchair athletes. Japan would limit public crowds in Tokyo to prevent a further spread of the deadly coronavirus. Shares in some of the marathon\u2019s sponsors fell following the announcement. Seiko Holdings, the maker of watches and clocks, slid 3.5%, as did shoe and sportswear maker ASICS Corp. The broader Tokyo market was little changed. Japan also announced it would be scrapping the emperor\u2019s birthday celebrations. The last time the birthday celebration was cancelled was 1996, during a hostage crisis at the Japanese embassy in Peru. China says it might postpone its annual congress in March, its biggest political meeting of the year. The standing committee for the National People\u2019s Congress said it believes it is necessary to postpone the gathering to give top priority to people\u2019s lives, safety and health, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It noted that one-third of the 3,000 delegates are provincial and municipal-level cadres with important leadership roles working on the frontline of the battle against the epidemic. The standing committee said it would meet on 24 February to further deliberate on a postponement. The meeting is due to start on 5 March. I want to hear your news, experiences and questions about the coronavirus outbreak. You can email me at aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com or tweet me at @aamnamohdin I\u2019m particularly keen to hear from those who have booked a holiday to China, but are currently in limbo. Morning, it\u2019s Aamna Mohdin taking over the liveblog from my colleague Alison Rourke. Of the 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, 14 have tested positive for the new coronavirus, the US state department said on Monday. The American passengers disembarking from the Diamond Princess preparing to return home on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for Covid-19, the state department said in a joint statement with the department of health and human services (HHS). The passengers were allowed to board the plane, but were isolated from the others and would be monitored closely. The state department and HHS said in a statement: During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers. These flights departed Japan at approximately 4:30pm eastern time on February 16 and will arrive in the United States later this morning. All passengers are being closely monitored by medical professionals throughout the flight, and any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated. Upon landing in the United States, passengers will deplane at either Travis AFB or Joint Base San Antonio and will remain under quarantine for 14 days. Passengers that develop symptoms in flight and those with positive test results will remain isolated on the flights and will be transported to an appropriate location for continued isolation and care. Here are the latest developments: The total confirmed number of Covid-19 cases in China has risen. to 70,548, after the health ministry reported 2,048 new cases in its Monday update. New deaths totalled 105, bringing the total number of fatalities in China to 1,770. Of the new cases 1,933 were in Hubei province, as were 100 of the deaths. The US has airlifted its citizens stuck on the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan. Forty Americans were tested positive remain in the country. A number of other countries, including Canada, Australia and South Korea have announced plans to evacuate their citizens from the stricken ship. (A Qantas plane will fly 209 Australians home on Wednesday). Xiaogan city, in central Hubei, has banned residents from leaving their homes in an attempt to curtail the virus. It has the second highest number of confirmed cases in China, after nearby Wuhan. Xinxian country in Henan province, south of Beijing, announced it is extending quarantine to 21 days for citizens returning from Wuhan, following two unusual cases of Covid-19. Singapore has flagged a possible recession as it cut growth forecasts because of the impact of the virus. You can read our latest roundup of all the days news on the coronavirus outbreak below. The Covid-19 outbreak has officially had no negative impact on the country\u2019s stock markets. After a huge 8% fall on the first day of trading after the lunar new year break, indices have fattened up again and are buoyed by the promise of stimulus from the central bank (see below). The Shanghai Composite was up 2.19% in afternoon trading while the Shenzhen Composite rose 2.84%. We\u2019re seeing a news conference now from the Australian city of Darwin, where authorities are talking about the 209 Australians being brought home from the stricken Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan. Those returning will be quarantined for 14 days near the northern city of Darwin. \u201cWe are not entirely convinced that the quarantine procedures on that ship were 100% effective,\u201d said Prof Dianne Stephens, deputy chief health officer for the Northern Territory (NT). About 150 of the 209 passengers are over the age of 60. Authorities said there will also be a number of older people and the concern for them is not about coronavirus, but co-morbidities, including diabetes, stress and cardiovascular disease. The Global Times \u2013 the tabloid mouth piece of the Chinese government \u2013 is reporting that the county of Xinxian in Henan province, south of Beijing, is extending the quarantine period for travellers returning from Wuhan to 21 days. This follows two unusual cases of Covid-19, which you can read about in the tweet below. This could obviously be very significant if this is replicated elsewhere. The Economist\u2019s correspondent in Shanghai, Simon Rabinovitch, has published a graph showing the infections in China outside Hubei. Just breaking down that flurry of speakers at the press conference in Australia ... one of the most significant things to come out of it for me was that the chief medical officer saying they are not sure why the infections on the Diamond Princess cruise liner are continuing to spread, despite the quarantine measures in place. Shares in China have posted strong gains after the country\u2019s central bank cut the interest rate on its medium-term lending from 3.25% to 3.15% to try to cushion businesses from the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. The bank also injected another 200bn yuan of liquidity into the system. The move is expected to pave the way for a reduction in the country\u2019s benchmark loan prime rate on Thursday, Reuters reports, to lower borrowing costs and ease financial strains on companies hit by the epidemic. China\u2019s authorities have already loosened borrowing requirements and arranged special loans for businesses hit by the lockdown of millions of people. On Sunday, the finance ministry said it would roll out targeted and phased tax and fee cuts. The Shanghai Composite index of leading shares was up 1.4% and Hong Kong was 0.4% to the good. But the picture was less rosy elsewhere in Asia Pacific with the poor GDP data pushing the Nikkei down by 0.65% in Tokyo. In Sydney the ASX200 was flat. A reporter is asking about Australians onboard the MS Westerdam cruise ship that docked in Cambodia last Thursday. An American passenger on that ship was subsequently diagnosed with Covid-19, after testing in Malaysia. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne answers: There were some Australians on the vessel Westerdam. 39 of those have remained in Phnom Penh after the ship finally docked. They have been provided with hotel accommodation in the capital. Payne says they are being tested in Cambodia and results expect to be returned in the next 48 hours. Ten Australians remain on the ship, still docked in Cambodia She says the Cambodian government is making arrangements to test those people who remained on the ship tested \u2013 another 200 or so people. She says that will happen in the next two to three days. Scott Morrison made very clear that the decision has been made by the national security committee that: Any person who was onboard that ship, regardless of their nationality, if they seek to enter Australia within the next 14 days, they will not be granted entry to Australia. Brendan Murphy\u2019s, Australia\u2019s chief health officer, has the microphone now. He says he is not sure why there have continued to be further infections onboard the Diamond Princess ship. We are not quite sure why there have been ongoing infections, but given there has been recent cases, we cannot be absolutely sure that any of the currently well people on the ship who are coming home onWednesday are not carrying the virus. We cannot be sure. And if we cannot be sure we have to take precautions. And that is why we are going to take them to the HowardSprings facility in Darwin, which minister Hunt and I have visited, it is a very good quality accommodation facility and I can assure the families of those coming that it is a much nicer place to be for two weeks than a cabin. He says he sympathises with people who have already done nearly two weeks in quarantine on the ship, and who may not want to do another two weeks of quarantine, but notes that other countries have also imposed additional two weeks of quarantine, including Canada and the US. The Australian health minister, Greg Hunt, is talking now. He confirms Australia still only has 15 cases of Covid-19, eight of which have now recovered. He says the 242 passengers who were airlifted out of Wuhan on the first Australian evacuation flight out of that city, will leave Christmas Island today, where they have been staying for 2 weeks. Payne reiterates the decision to bring citizens home from Japan is based on medical advice. We\u2019re now hearing from Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne. She thanks the government of Japan for its co-operation during this process of getting Australia\u2019s citizens home from the ship, currently docked south of Tokyo. She also thanks Japan for the care they are giving to the 20 or so Australians in hospital in Japan who have tested positive for Covid-19. Morrison says they are contacting all the passengers on the ship and that New Zealand citizens on the ship will also be offered seats on the Qantas flight. The Australian PM, Scott Morrison, has announced Qantas will fly home Australian citizens stuck on the stricken Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan this Wednesday. There are more than 200 Australians on the ship. They will face a further 14 days in quarantine at the Howard Springs facility near the Australian city of Darwin. In Hong Kong armed robbers have stolen hundreds of toilet rolls, amid panic buying from stores as the coronavirus outbreak spreads. Toilet rolls have become hot property in the business hub, despite government assurances that supplies remain unaffected by the virus outbreak. You can read our full story here. Agence France-Presse has rounded up where the coronavirus cases are globally. ASIA-PACIFIC Cruise ship Diamond Princess, quarantined off Japan: 355, plus a quarantine officer. Singapore: 75 Japan: 59, including death of one infected woman Hong Kong: 57, including one death Thailand: 34 South Korea: 30 Malaysia: 22 Taiwan: 20, including one death Vietnam: 16 Australia: 15 Macau: 10 India: 3 Philippines: 3, including one death Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Cambodia: 1 NORTH AMERICA United States: 15 Canada: 8 EUROPE Germany: 16 France: 12, including one death Britain: 9 Italy: 3 Russia: 2 Spain: 2 Finland: 1 Sweden: 1 Belgium: 1 MIDDLE EAST United Arab Emirates: 9 AFRICA Egypt: 1 While we are on the economic impact of the coronavirus, New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said on Monday that the country\u2019s GDP is expected to slow to around 2% to 2.5% this year, due to the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic. Ardern said the forecasts were from the treasury which had previously predicted a GDP growth of 2.2% to 2.8%. She said the impact will be seen in the first two quarters of the year. \u201cTreasury expect things to return to normal in the second half of 2020,\u201d she told a news conference. Japan\u2019s NKH has reported new figures from the government that show GDP shrank in the final quarter of 2019 by 6.3% (on an annualised basis for October-December). NHK says it was the first contraction in five quarters. It was also the biggest fall since the consumption tax was last raised in 2014. Given that it\u2019s from last year, it\u2019s unlikely to be related to the coronavirus. But the figures show that the economy is already under pressure while it\u2019s trying to absorb the impact of the virus. Reuters is citing experts warning that the widening fallout the outbreak is damaging output and tourism in Japan, undermining growth and potentially pushing the country into recession. Meanwhile, the Tokyo Marathon organisers are considering restricting the number of general participants in this year\u2019s race as a precaution against the further spread of the virus. China\u2019s Global Television Network is reporting that Chinese residents are being asked to defer their participation in the event until next year. The marathon is believed to have more than 300,000 entrants this year. Just a bit more on the new measures in the city of Xiaogan, that confine residents to their homes ... on Friday, the state media outlet, Xinhua, reported that all residents in the city would not be allowed to exit and re-enter their communities or residential areas. Today\u2019s announcement appears to be a further escalation of this. Xinhua reported that \u201ccommunity committees\u201d would deliver daily necessities to residents and that buying services would be provided for urgently-needed goods. This is something we have also seen in Wuhan, with community workers delivering items to residents. Deutsche Welle\u2019s East Asia correspondent William Yang says the new restrictions in Xiaogan will begin on Monday. Yang also reports on a new initiative in eastern Hubei\u2019s Huanggang city, where residents with a fever or cough who report their symptoms will be awarded 500 yuan or $72. The city is the third worst affected in Hubei, with 2,831 reported cases of Covid-19 and 78 deaths. Chinese state media is reporting another city in Hubei province has banned residents from leaving their homes. In Xiaogan, population 4.8 million, in central Hubei, people who violate the order will be detained \u201cfor a maximum of 10 days\u201d, the Global Times says: The levelled-up measure in Xiaogan asks all urban residents to stay indoors and rural villagers are prohibited from loitering, visiting or gathering. Those who involved in the prevention and control of the epidemic should travel in accordance with the designated time and route. Those who violate the order will be detained for no more than 10 days. All vehicles including motorcycles, electric bikes, bicycles and tricycles are prohibited from driving on the road. Only vehicles for special purposes, such as ambulances, fire trucks or vehicles transporting daily necessities, can be seen out of the road. All the other vehicles without a permit will be held by traffic police, and drivers will face 10 days of detainment and a fine of 500 yuan if they break the order. Those who do not obey the traffic management rules may have their driving licenses revoked. The Global Times adds that pharmacies, designated supermarkets, hotels and markets are open, but need to \u201cstrictly control the flow of people\u201d and to record customers\u2019 temperatures. \u201cPatrol teams\u201d will monitor movements. Xiaogan is the second worst hit in Hubei after Wuhan, with 3,279 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 70 deaths. Xiaogan is about 70km from Wuhan. The economics research firm Capital Economics, has published some very interesting graphs which appear to show just how substantially activity in China has reduced as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. The first graph shows road congestion across 100 Chinese cities in the weeks before and after the lunar new year, comparing figures from the four years to 2020. The next graph looks at daily passenger trips by the millions. Many economists use electricity consumption as a proxy for economic activity in China, which makes this next graph particularly interesting. And finally, the food wholesale price index, comparing 2017-2020. A fifth evacuation flight of Japanese citizens from Wuhan has landed in Tokyo. It landed at Haneda airport shortly before 7.00am on Monday, the Japanese broadcaster NHK said, carrying 36 Japanese nationals and 29 Chinese nationals, including spouses of Japanese. A total of 763 people returned to Japan from Hubei on the four previous flights, NHK says. Singapore has cut its 2020 growth and exports forecasts due to an expected economic blow from the new coronavirus outbreak, flagging the chance of a recession this year, Reuters reports. The country has reported 75 cases of the virus to date, one of the highest tallies outside China. The downgrade of its GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5%, from 0.5% to 2.5% previously, opens up the possibility that full-year growth could be negative, with the prime minister saying on Friday that a recession is possible. \u201cThe outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since the last review... In particular, the Covid-19 outbreak is expected to affect the Singapore economy,\u201d said the ministry\u2019s permanent secretary, Gabriel Lim. Lim said the impact would be most keenly felt in manufacturing, trade, tourism and transport, alongside retail and food services. Singapore is set to roll out a hefty package of measures to cushion the blow from the epidemic on its economy at its annual budget on Tuesday, with some analysts expecting it to plan for its biggest deficit in over a decade. The full-year forecast range for non-oil domestic exports was also lowered on Monday to -0.5% to 1.5%, from 0% to 2% previously. The economy had been staging a nascent recovery after recording its lowest growth rate in a decade in 2019 at 0.7% before the virus spread to the city-state in late January. The Australian government is working on a plan to evacuate its citizens off the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship \u2013 the largest site for Covid-19 infections outside of mainland China. The ship, carrying more than 3,700 passengers and crew, is docked at Yokohama port south of Tokyo. 355 people have tested positive for coronavirus, including 16 Australians. Nearly 200 Australians are on board. The US has begun an airlift operation to bring more than 400 of its citizens home form the ship and into quarantine in the US. They face a further 14 days in isolation. Canada, South Korea, Hong Kong and Italy have announced flights home for their citizens and residents. Australia\u2019s national security committee of cabinet met late Sunday, and will meet again Monday afternoon, to formalise a plan to extract Australians from the ship. Meanwhile, the first cohort of evacuees quarantined on Christmas Island are set to leave the remote island Monday afternoon. The evacuees will be flown to capital cities across Australia and allowed to return home. They have spent 14 days in the immigration detention centre on the remote island, and will not be required to self-isolate at home. 271 Australians were evacuated to the island. None have tested positive for coronavirus. A second cohort will leave Wednesday. Australia has also quarantined 266 citizens and permanent residents at a disused mining workers village on the outskirts of Darwin. They remain in quarantine. No coronavirus cases have been detected amongst that group either. There\u2019s been a lot of discussion about how the figures are trending over the past few days, particularly as there was a big spike in the number of recorded cases of infections in Hubei province last Wednesday, when it changed the way it was recording cases to include people who had been clinically diagnosed with Covid-19, as well as those who had tested positive on a Covid-19 test. First let\u2019s look at the trend for infections inside China but outside of Hubei, since they changed the way they were counting cases. Sunday 16 February: 125 new cases excluding Hubei (1,933 inside Hubei) Saturday 15 February: 166 new cases excluding Hubei (1,843 inside Hubei) Friday 14 February: 221 cases excluding Hubei (2,641 inside Hubei) Thursday 13 February: 267 cases excluding Hubei (4,823 inside Hubei) On Wednesday 12 February, Hubei changed the way it was counting cases. That day the National Health Commission recorded 312 cases outside of Hubei. The daily national figures for China have been announced. It says the total number of confirmed cases have by 2,048 to 70,548. Total deaths now stand at 1,770, after 105 more deaths were reported in the past 24 hours. Of those new deaths, only five were reported outside of Hubei province (3 in Henan, and 2 in Guangdong). Of the new infections, only 125 were recorded outside of Hubei. China\u2019s ambassador in Australia, Chen Jingye, is giving an interview on Sky News Australia about the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThis is controllable. This is curable,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we have every confidence and capacities to win against the epidemic.\u201d He says the Australian travel ban on people entering the country if they have travelled to China is \u201cout of proportion\u201d \u201cThe situation here is ... inconsistent with recommendations from WHO,\u201d he says. He says he hopes the Australian government will take this into account when next reviewing the travel ban, due to expire on Saturday. He hopes restrictions will be relaxed. He\u2019s now being asked about the death of the whistleblower doctor, Li Wenliang, who died from the virus around 10 days ago. \u201cHis contributions is (sic) acknowledged,\u201d he says. Chen says the best way to honour his memory is to keep fighting the virus. The next question is about reports a speech President Xi gave on 3 February, in which he gave instructions to fight the virus on 7 January. His remarks were published by state media late Saturday. \u201cPresident Xi himself has shown strong leadership in this fight against the virus. He\u2019s has been personally involved ... giving orders ... and overseeing and guiding efforts throughout this outbreak,\u201d Chen said. Chinese state media is reporting that penalties up to life imprisonment can be handed out to people who sell face masks or goggles which don\u2019t meet national standards. Hubei province is tightening its restrictions on movement further, in an effort to combat the virus. About 56 million people are effectively under quarantine, including in Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have started. New measures include broad instructions that residential compounds and villages be \u201csealed off\u201d from unnecessary visitors, with tenants\u2019 outings \u201cstrictly managed\u201d. Last week Beijing, a city of more than 20 million people, said anyone returning to the city must go into self-imposed quarantine for 14 days, or face stiff penalties. The World Health Organization says international experts in a WHO-led joint mission had arrived in Beijing and had had their first meeting with their Chinese counterparts. \u201cWe look forward to this vitally important collaboration contributing to global knowledge about the \u001dCOVID19 outbreak,\u201d Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter. On Sunday, a spokesman for China\u2019s National Health Commission said slowing case numbers nationally showed that China was controlling the outbreak. But Tedros has warned it is \u201cimpossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take\u201d. Tedros also said the international community must \u201cuse the window of opportunity\u201d to intensify preparations for the spread of Covid-19 infections. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. The epicentre of the outbreak \u2013 Hubei province \u2013 has reported 100 new deaths in its daily update of figures on Monday, with 1,933 new infections. This takes infections in China past 70,000, and deaths to at least 1,765. We are still waiting for Monday\u2019s national figures and will bring you them shortly. Five other deaths have been reported globally. Outside China, attention has turned to the Diamond Princess cruise ship, stuck in Japan. The US has airlifted its passengers out, but around 40 Americans who tested positive to Covid-19, will remain in Japan where they are being treated. Here\u2019s a quick summary of what else we know so far: The US air flights carrying passengers from the stricken cruise ship quarantined south of Tokyo have departed Canada and Hong Kong have offered flights to repatriate their nationals and we are expecting a decision in Australia on whether it will also offer flights home to the 200+ Australians on the ship. The quarantine on the Diamond Princess is due to end on Wednesday, but there are questions about whether it will be extended A passenger from the MS Westerdam cruise ship, which docked in Cambodia at the end of last week, has tested positive to the virus, after flying to Malaysia with nearly 150 other passengers from the ship Taiwan has reported first death from coronavirus",

London is Burberry\u2019s home, but its commercial heartbeat is now in Asia. With Chinese customers accounting for 40% of Burberry revenues, the brand is one of those that has been hit hardest by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/12/bitcoin-back-over-10000-dollars-amid-coronavirus-concerns\">economic impact</a> of coronavirus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/14/interview-burberry-designer-riccardo-tisci\">In the trenches: Riccardo Tisci on his new era at Burberry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With a troupe of expensive supermodels, Tisci\u2019s fourth season at Burberry was a slick cheerleading routine for the blue-blooded glamour that flows through the label\u2019s veins. In the Victorian pomp of Kensington Olympia, where the iron ribs spanning the vaulted ceiling soar above the mirrored catwalk like the skeleton of a blue whale, a grand piano was the centrepiece for a dressage parade of modern equestrian chic. This season\u2019s look was a more globally bankable take on Burberry than Tisci\u2019s punk- and rave-referencing, subculture-themed collections of last year.</p> <p>Tisci has made Burberry sexy where his predecessor Christopher Bailey made it romantic. His equestrian silhouette owed as much to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jilly-cooper\">Jilly Cooper</a> as to the Grand National. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/16/harvey-weinstein-trial-gigi-hadid-juror-dismissed\">Gigi Hadid</a> wore high, tight jodhpurs tucked into glossy boots. Blazers had nipped waists, and trenchcoats were reinvented as slippery satin dresses with multiple unfastenings. The Victorian architecture of the venue was echoed in corsetry outlines on evening wear, while quilted nylon stable-hand jackets looked a strong commercial offer for the more street-orientated Burberry customer. This was a collection tailored to helping Burberry weather the current economic storm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cf4d945cf6ab0171477e5f2cc187eea0051083f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf4d945cf6ab0171477e5f2cc187eea0051083f0/0_69_2487_3332/746.jpg\" alt=\"Models present creations during the Burberry catwalk show\" width=\"746\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This season\u2019s look was a more globally bankable take than Tisci\u2019s subculture-themed collections of last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than a third of the label\u2019s 64 stores in mainland China have been closed since the coronavirus outbreak hit the region.

      "bodyText": "\u201cLondon is the place where I learned to be myself and a city where I gained the confidence to be the man that I am today,\u201d said Riccardo Tisci, the chief creative officer of Burberry, before his London fashion week show on Monday. \u201cNow I want to share British style with the world and use this incredible heritage to build and humanise the house.\u201d Burberry, British luxury fashion\u2019s marquee name, could use a boost in morale. London is Burberry\u2019s home, but its commercial heartbeat is now in Asia. With Chinese customers accounting for 40% of Burberry revenues, the brand is one of those that has been hit hardest by the economic impact of coronavirus. With a troupe of expensive supermodels, Tisci\u2019s fourth season at Burberry was a slick cheerleading routine for the blue-blooded glamour that flows through the label\u2019s veins. In the Victorian pomp of Kensington Olympia, where the iron ribs spanning the vaulted ceiling soar above the mirrored catwalk like the skeleton of a blue whale, a grand piano was the centrepiece for a dressage parade of modern equestrian chic. This season\u2019s look was a more globally bankable take on Burberry than Tisci\u2019s punk- and rave-referencing, subculture-themed collections of last year. Tisci has made Burberry sexy where his predecessor Christopher Bailey made it romantic. His equestrian silhouette owed as much to Jilly Cooper as to the Grand National. Gigi Hadid wore high, tight jodhpurs tucked into glossy boots. Blazers had nipped waists, and trenchcoats were reinvented as slippery satin dresses with multiple unfastenings. The Victorian architecture of the venue was echoed in corsetry outlines on evening wear, while quilted nylon stable-hand jackets looked a strong commercial offer for the more street-orientated Burberry customer. This was a collection tailored to helping Burberry weather the current economic storm. More than a third of the label\u2019s 64 stores in mainland China have been closed since the coronavirus outbreak hit the region. This month, the company\u2019s chief executive, Marco Gobbetti, acknowledged the material negative effect of the outbreak on luxury demand. It is a further blow to Burberry, already hit hard by the effect on retail of anti-government protests in Hong Kong, where its sales in the final quarter of 2019 were down 50% on the previous year. This London fashion week show had been scheduled to be reprised in Shanghai, on 23 April, at an event for Chinese press, influencers and clients that would have featured the same clothes alongside exclusive additional looks for Chinese Burberry customers. When the Shanghai show was announced, Tisci described China as \u201ca country that has always been so supportive of me\u201d and Shanghai as \u201cone of the most innovative and inspiring cities in the world\u201d. The event has been postponed indefinitely. At the day\u2019s earlier shows by Erdem and at JW Anderson, the 1920s made a comeback. Shawl-collared tuxedos of the roaring 20s inspired the wing-collared padded coats at JW Anderson, which he called \u201cnouveau chic\u201d. Erdem, whose modernist flamboyant gowns are a feature of the art-fair social scene, worked with Robin Muir, the curator of the National Portrait Gallery\u2019s upcoming exhibition about Cecil Beaton, to develop themes from the exhibition on his catwalk. \u201cBeaton was truly experimental \u2013 so much more than a society photographer,\u201d said Erdem backstage in front of a mood board showing the teenage Beaton\u2019s early stage sets in which he dressed up his sisters and himself in 20s gowns against makeshift backdrops.

A poll conducted by the Australian National University\u2019s Centre for Social Research and Methods found a \u201csignificant and substantial decline\u201d in the Coalition\u2019s vote from 40% in October 2019 to 35% in January. Australia A flexible solar \u201cskin\u201d that could be used to generate power is a step closer to development after the technology was used to break a world record for electricity conversion, researchers say. Australia risks becoming \u201ca magnet for dirty money\u201d from abusers and kleptocrats across the globe, says the man who spearheaded the United States\u2019 Magnitsky Act \u2013 which targets sanctions against human rights violators around the world \u2013 unless it brings in similar legislation. Labor is pursuing the Liberals over the deleted record of a $165,000 donation from a key Scott Morrison ally. The opposition will ask the joint standing committee on electoral matters to examine the circumstances of the donation, which was initially disclosed by the Liberals, then removed entirely after questions from the Guardian. Liberal Katie Allen says Australia needs to join the emissions technology revolution, saying the world is approaching an \u201ciPhone moment\u201d when it comes to new technology lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and Australia needs to be part of the revolution, rather than being a technology \u201ctaker\u201d. The world Sinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald has rejected suggestions of a pact between Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, centrist rivals that have dominated Irish politics for a century. Nine days after Sinn F\u00e9in won the popular vote in Ireland\u2019s general election, party leaders have inched towards talks to see whether anybody can cobble together a coalition in the hung parliament. If not, another election looms. Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman has refused to say whether Johnson thinks black people have lower IQs, or agrees with eugenics, after No 10 hired an adviser with highly controversial views. Donald Trump attended the wedding this weekend of controversial White House aide Stephen Miller, who has been condemned for his links to white nationalism and his hardline stance on immigration. Greece has halted plans to construct new detention centres on outlying islands facing Turkey amid mounting opposition from resident communities who fear they will become permanent. A second nest of 16 snakes has been found dumped outside a fire station in the UK, days after 13 royal pythons were found in the same spot. Recommended reads Mallacoota resident and photographer Rachel Mounsey documented the bushfires that destroyed some 150 houses in her town and its surrounds. \u201cWhen the New Year\u2019s fire bore down on my town of Mallacoota I began to imagine the fire as a type of medieval dragon \u2013 heavy-footed and angry \u2013 coming towards us to destroy everything in its way,\u201d she says. Weeks after the catastrophe, Mounsey sits with neighbours who lost their homes, and asks: how do you move on mentally when all you own has turned to ash? The Australian housing market is being driven by owner-occupiers, writes Greg Jericho. \u201cAnd as long as that is the case housing affordability should remain relatively steady. And with that stability the RBA will be more comfortable with cutting rates again should it believe the economy needs a boost.\u201d Listen On Today in Focus: Tom Phillips, the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent, is back in Venezuela a year after the start of a dramatic, but so far unsuccessful, attempt to topple Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. While conditions in Caracas appear slightly improved, outside the capital conditions in schools and hospitals are appalling \u2013 and getting worse. Also today: Jess Cartner-Morley on pockets. Sport The phrase \u201cwell-behaved women seldom make history\u201d is often misinterpreted. Nonetheless the parallels with the burgeoning AFLW competition \u2013 built on the back of decades of quiet, unrewarded work at grassroots level, almost exclusively by women \u2013 are obvious, writes Erin Delahunty. Rugby Australia is pitching a \u201cwhole of game\u201d package to broadcasters, including Optus, in an attempt to achieve a significant uplift on its current $57m-a-year deal with Fox Sports. Brett Harris asks whether the package will be greater than the sum of its parts. Media roundup There are growing calls for a second safe injecting room in Sydney, the Sydney Morning Herald reports, \u201cas data on overdose deaths show the opioid crisis has spread to the outer suburbs\u201d. The Australian reveals that Scott Morrison \u201cis expected to adopt a technology target to avoid Australia signing up to an internationally imposed requirement for net zero emissions by 2050\u201d and that Anthony Albanese has been warned not to be hostile to coal. Australian tech giant Atlassian plans to build a concrete-and-timber tower next to Sydney\u2019s Central Station costing over $1bn, the Australian Financial Review reveals. Coming up A NSW parliamentary committee will hear more evidence on the impact of the bushfires on koala populations. Perth Glory begin their Asian Champions League campaign in Tokyo, while Melbourne Victory take on FC Seoul. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 A \u201cghost ship\u201d has washed ashore in Ireland after more than a year at sea. Abandoned by its crew, the cargo vessel made a lonely odyssey across the Atlantic, seemingly destined never to make port. The 77-metre MV Alta drifted for over a year, skirting the Americas, Africa and Europe.
