Officials had insisted until recent days that travel restrictions would remain for the foreseeable future, with the country\u2019s president, Milos Zeman, suggesting last weekend that frontiers should stay closed for the next year.</p> \n  <p>However, Vojt\u011bch heralded a dramatic reversal in a late-night press conference on Thursday but indicated the onus would be on travellers to prove they were uninfected on their return.</p> \n  <p>\u201cUpon return, travellers will either have to present confirmation of a negative test for coronavirus, or be forced to spend 14 days in quarantine,\u201d he said. Commuters would also be able to cross the borders daily if they presented a negative test for coronavirus every 14 days, Vojt\u011bch added, a move that will affect a relatively small number of people who live in the Czech Republic but work in a neighbouring country, or vice versa.</p> \n  <p>In a further development, the deputy health minister, Roman Prymula, announced that mandatory face mask-wearing \u2013 credited by officials with containing the virus\u2019s spread \u2013 would stay until at least the end of June. Restrictions are also being lifted on movement within the country, with groups of up to 10 people now permitted to gather. Previous rules limited outdoor gatherings to two.</p> \n  <p>The move follows growing public pressure for an easing of emergency measures. But there was criticism that the announcement sowed confusion, with no immediate announcement on when foreign visitors would be allowed to re-enter, which would help Prague\u2019s beleaguered tourist economy.</p> \n  <p>The announcement came hours after the government had accelerated its timetable for reopening the economy following pressure from Czech trading lobbies. Restaurants and pubs will be allowed to fully reopen on 25 May, two weeks earlier than initially planned in a five-phase restart plan announced last week. Zoos will be allowed to reopen from Monday, a month earlier than planned.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>The relaxations came after Prague\u2019s municipal court on Thursday ruled the government\u2019s restrictions unlawful.</p> \n  <p>Officials have hailed better-than-expected results from the anti-coronavirus clampdown.

Currently there are typically more than 2,000 new infections every day.</p> \n  <p>According to the RKI, Germany has 150,383 confirmed cases, a rise of 2,337 from Thursday, and 5,321 people have died from the virus. </p> \n  <p>But due to a delay in the central collation of figures, the real number of cases is said by reliable health watchers gathering statistics on the L\u00e4nder level, to be more than 3,000 higher, and the number of deaths just under 300 more than the RKI\u2019s figures.</p> \n  <p>The current reproduction rate in Germany is 0.9 - which means every person with the infection is passing it on to one other person. This is up from 0.7 a week ago, but virologists consider one and under to be good.</p> \n  <p>Schaade said keeping the restrictions was necessary because in order to be able to keep the disease under control, health authorities around the country have to be in a position to be able to identify each case and trace their contacts, to place them in immediate isolation. If the number of new infections grows too quickly, the tracking and tracing process becomes too unwieldy a task, and the situation could quickly get out of control, he said.</p> \n  <p>He said unlike in Italy, France and Spain, there was so far no evidence of excess mortality in Germany - that is, a death rate higher than the usual average death rate for this time of year. This was, he said, due to the fact that Germany was able to tackle the illness early on, largely through testing, and dampen its spread, and therefore treated many coronavirus cases effectively, without lessening hospitals\u2019 ability to treat other illnesses.</p> \n  <p>Referring to the pressure being placed on authorities to relax measures, which he advised against strongly, Schaade said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is a paradox, that due to the success of the measures that have been taken ... these very measures are now being called into question.</p> \n   <p>That Germany has come through this epidemic comparatively well so far, is thanks to the measures we have taken. The number of cases has stayed at a level with which the health system has been able to cope, and it must stay that way. We cannot afford to become lax. With respect to the first relaxation of measures, this must not be allowed to lead to a landslide of other subsequent easing that could have serious consequences.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He said quite simply, that more contact would automatically lead to more infections \u201cand when there are more infections a dynamic will develop again very quickly with rising infection rates which in the worst case, could bring us to a point where the epidemic is no longer manageable.</p> \n  <p>In short, Schaade said, his \u201cemphatic plea\u201d was for people to stick to the recommendations: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Stay at home, stay away from others, keep the 1.5 metre - or even better 2 metre distance, keep to the coughing and sneezing rules, and on public transport or shops, wear mouth-nose cover to protect others.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He recognised, he said, that \u201cmany people are running out of strength, and many are suffering from existential angst. Believe me, I\u2019d like nothing more than to tell you it\u2019s over...but unfortunately it\u2019s not over.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea2da8a8f08e05690dc3da5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T12:34:50.853Z\">1.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>While social distancing and national lockdowns have been credited with slowing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, governments and experts have said the only permanent way out is through a <strong tabindex=\"-1\">vaccine</strong>. </p> \n  <p>Vaccine development usually takes years, meaning that teams around the world are considering a range of risks and shortcuts to bring one to market in a much shorter time. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Hannah Devlin</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s science correspondent, has looked at four different approaches being taken by research teams around the world, ranging from classic weakened viruses, to genetically modified forms, to revolutionary approaches using DNA and RNA. </p> \n  <p>But, as she writes, there is a chance none of them will work, or that they may have serious unintended side-effects. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/the-hunt-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine-a-perilous-and-uncertain-path\">The hunt for a coronavirus vaccine \u2013 a perilous and uncertain path</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T12:40:12.444Z\">at 1.40pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea2d58b8f08fa2bdcb1aaf1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T12:05:57.027Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Italy \"to ease lockdown\", local media reports</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Newspapers in Italy are reporting that the country\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, the longest and toughest in Europe, is to be eased over the next four weeks.

It has asked its citizens to avoid non-essential travel, work from home and stay indoors if they are over 70 or are feeling ill - but there has been no enforced lockdown.</p> \n  <p>The country has seen a higher death rate than its neighbours. Yesterday, the Public Health Agency of Sweden said it had recorded 16,755 confirmed cases, and 2,021 deaths with the coronavirus. And there has been anger in the country that older people have borne the brunt of the strategy, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/anger-in-sweden-as-elderly-pay-price-for-coronavirus-strategy\">as reported by my colleague Richard Orange</a>. </p> \n  <p>Lena Einhorn, a virologist who has been one of the leading domestic critics of Sweden\u2019s coronavirus policy, told the Observer<em>. </em></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>They have to admit that it\u2019s a huge failure, since they have said the whole time that their main aim has been to protect the elderly. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Tegnall today said Sweden\u2019s strategy put it in a better place to deal with a second wave of coronavirus as the country\u2019s scientists estimated there was now around 15-20% immunity in the population \u2013 not enough for herd immunity, but enough to slow and control the spread of the disease. </p> \n  <p>Asked if the policy had worked, Tegnall said the aim had been to slow the progression of the disease so its healthcare system did not become overwhelmed. </p> \n  <p>It has worked in some aspects. The health service has been able to cope \u2013 20% of ICU beds have been empty and able to take coronavirus patients at all times. </p> \n  <p>In terms of death toll, Sweden had seen \u201cabout the same results as other countries\u201d, he said. </p> \n  <p>Asked about the fact that there are more deaths in Sweden than in other Scandinavian countries, he said that as many as 50% of deaths had come in care homes for the elderly \u2013 which have banned visitors. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how a lockdown would have stopped that,\u201d he said. Asked if the strategy had resulted in more deaths, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s a difficult question and I don\u2019t think we have the answer and I don\u2019t know if we will ever get the answer. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Sweden estimates it passed the peak of the disease last week, and hopes it will be better placed to deal with any further outbreaks</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We hope this will make it easier for us in the long run.

As an introvert, I am really looking forward to spending this month focusing inwards, without the burden of social responsibility.</p> \n   <p>Ramadan in 2020 means no communal gatherings in mosques for \u201ctarawih\u201d night prayers, no large \u201ciftar\u201d dinners with family and friends at sunset to break the day\u2019s fast,and, sadly, restrictions on celebrating Eid, the biggest social holiday for Muslims signalling the end of Ramadan.</p> \n   <p>In this time of physical distancing, as Muslims we will be forced to reconnect to our God and the Qur\u2019an on a deeply intimate level. Interestingly enough, this is the authentic practice of Prophet Muhammad. He would isolate himself for days in a cave at the top of a mountain to introspect, reflect, worship and connect with God. During each of the 10 days of Ramadan, he was known to self-isolate in a spiritual seclusion practice known as \u201citik\u0101f\u201d.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/ramadan-during-coronavirus-may-seem-disheartening-but-its-the-ideal-time-for-reflection\">Ramadan during coronavirus may seem disheartening but it's the ideal time for reflection | Heba Shaheed</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T03:55:57.153Z\">at 4.55am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea25a498f082ab274335cfd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T03:22:39.222Z\">4.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e659c15540987049599987a1811d4086f6c9e57\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e659c15540987049599987a1811d4086f6c9e57/0_108_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"About 90 people onboard the cruise ship Costa Atlantica have tested positive for the coronavirus.

      "bodyText": "We are closing this blog, but will continue coverage here. The AP has this report from Brazil, which is on the way to becoming a virus outbreak centre. Cases of the new coronavirus are overwhelming hospitals, morgues and cemeteries across Brazil as Latin Americas largest nation veers closer to becoming one of the world\u2019s pandemic hot spots. Medical officials in Rio de Janeiro and at least four other major cities have warned that their hospital systems are on the verge of collapse, or already too overwhelmed to take any more patients. Health experts expect the number of infections in the country of 211 million people will be much higher than what has been reported because of insufficient, delayed testing. Meanwhile, President Jair Bolsonaro has shown no sign of wavering from his insistence that Covid-19 is a relatively minor disease and that broad social-distancing measures are not needed to stop it. He has said only Brazilians at high risk should be isolated. In Manaus, the biggest city in the Amazon, officials said a cemetery has been forced to dig mass graves because there have been so many deaths. Workers have been burying 100 corpses a day, triple the pre-virus average of burials. Yesterday Donald Trump made those jaw-dropping remarks wondering whether the virus could be treated by injecting bleach. Doctors everywhere were very quick to say people should absolutely not do this. Today, from New York, Guardian reporter Ed Pilkington has this story: The leader of the most prominent group in the US peddling potentially lethal industrial bleach as a \u201cmiracle cure\u201d for coronavirus wrote to Donald Trump at the White House this week. In his letter, Mark Grenon told Trump that chlorine dioxide \u2013 a powerful bleach used in industrial processes such as textile manufacturing that can have fatal side-effects when drunk \u2013 is \u201ca wonderful detox that can kill 99% of the pathogens in the body\u201d. He added that it \u201ccan rid the body of Covid-19\u201d. A few days after Grenon dispatched his letter, Trump went on national TV... Read more below. Hi, this Helen Davidson here to take you through the next few hours of updates. Thanks to Kevin Rawlinson and my other colleagues in London for their work. In Australia and New Zealand it is Anzac Day, the annual day of remembrance for armed forces. With both countries under lockdowns or strict social distancing rules, there was not the usual parades or public dawn services. Instead, people were encouraged to stand at the ends of their driveways for moments of silence. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister Jacinda Ardern was one of many thousands of Kiwis who spent at least a minute of their mornings in contemplation by their letterbox. She issued a message, addressing both the unique nature of the 2020 commemoration and the ways that war have shaped her modern nation. \u201cWhile we cannot gather in person, we join in spirit as we remember the service and sacrifice of New Zealanders in times of war and crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cMany New Zealanders have been affected by war or know somebody who has. \u201cReturned and current service personnel, friends and families of the fallen, New Zealanders who have come to start a new life here as refugees - through Anzac Day we are all connected.\u201d At the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, prime minister Scott Morrison attended a service which was closed to the public but filmed by media. He reflected on a 1919 gathering in Gallipoli. \u201cA small group of Anzacs who\u2019d been arranging and tending the graves of their mates gathered and there was no pomp at that little service, there were no dignitaries, no band, just the sound of lapping water on the lonely shore,\u201d he said. \u201cOne said of that little service, \u2018It was the real thing\u2019. \u201cAnd so our remembrances today, small, quiet and homely will be.\u201d Reuters is reporting that China has dispatched a team to North Korea that includes medical experts to advise on the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un. The news agency cites three people familiar with the situation. The trip by the Chinese doctors and officials comes amid conflicting reports about the health of the North Korean leader. There was no indication of what, if anything, it signalled in terms of Kim\u2019s health. Downing Street has issued a second response to the Guardian\u2019s report that Boris Johnson\u2019s top political adviser, Dominic Cummings, is on the secret scientific group advising the government on the pandemic. It is not true that Mr Cummings or Dr Warner are \u2018on\u2019 or members of Sage. Mr Cummings and Dr Warner have attended some Sage meetings and listen to some meetings now they are all virtual. They do this in order to understand better the scientific debates concerning this emergency and also to understand better the limits of how science and data can help government decisions. Occasionally, they ask questions or offer help when scientists mention problems in Whitehall. Others also listen to meetings without being \u2018on\u2019 or \u2018a member of\u2019 Sage. Sage provides independent scientific advice to the government. Political advisers have no role in this. The scientists on Sage are among the most eminent in their fields. It is factually wrong and damaging to sensible public debate to imply their advice is affected by government advisers listening to discussions. The prime minister wants his advisers to understand the scientific debates around Covid as well as they can for obvious reasons. From the start, the government has tried hard to integrate scientific advice into its decision-making in a sensible way. It will continue to do so. Public confidence in the media has collapsed during this emergency partly because of ludicrous stories such as this. You can read the full story here: The US defence secretary, Mark Esper, will \u201cthoroughly review\u201d the Navy\u2019s preliminary inquiry into a coronavirus outbreak aboard the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt and then meet with Navy leadership to discuss the next steps, the Pentagon said on Friday. The Pentagon said Esper had received a verbal update from the acting navy secretary and chief of naval operations. After the secretary receives a written copy of the completed inquiry, he intends to thoroughly review the report and will meet again with navy leadership to discuss next steps. US officials have told Reuters that, during the Friday meeting, the navy recommended reinstating the fired captain of the coronavirus-stricken carrier, whose crew hailed him as a hero willing to risk his job to safeguard his sailors. A French court has rejected Amazon\u2019s appeal against a ruling that restricts what it can deliver during the pandemic, handing a victory to unions that criticised the firm\u2019s safety measures. Amazon must limit deliveries in France to IT products, health items, food and pet food, the court of appeal has said, upholding a previous order for the firm to curtail shipments while it improves its health protocols. US navy leaders have recommended the reinstatement of the commander of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, who was fired after he pleaded for help with a coronavirus outbreak onboard. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, officials have told the Reuters news agency the recommendation to reinstate Captain Brett Crozier was made during a meeting on Friday between the US defence secretary, Mark Esper, and navy leaders. The decision is pending Esper\u2019s approval, the officials said. The US Food and Drug Administration has warned doctors against prescribing the malaria drug Donald Trump has been touting, citing reports of sometimes fatal heart side effects among patients. From the Associated Press: The warning comes as doctors at a New York hospital published a report that heart rhythm abnormalities developed in most of 84 coronavirus patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin, a combo Trump has promoted. Both drugs are known to sometimes alter the heartbeat in dangerous ways, and their safety or ability to help people with COVID-19 is unknown. The warning excludes in hospital and research studies. A National Institutes of Health experts panel earlier this week also recommended against taking that drug combo except in a formal study. Responding to the news that the prime minister\u2019s chief political adviser is part of SAGE \u2013 the secret scientific group advising the government, the shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, has said: These are very serious revelations and raise significant questions about the credibility of decisions being taken by the government on the coronavirus. Dominic Cummings has no place on the government\u2019s scientific advisory group on the coronavirus. He is a political adviser, not a medical or scientific expert. If the public are to have confidence in the SAGE, the government must make clear Dominic Cummings can no longer participate or attend. We also need full transparency on who is attending meeting of SAGE and what is being discussed. Air France will receive a \u20ac7bn (\u00a36.1bn) loan package backed by the French government to avert a cash crisis brought on by the pandemic, the country\u2019s finance minister Bruno Le Maire has announced. France will issue \u20ac3bn in direct loans and guarantees on another \u20ac4bn in bank lending to the carrier, part of airline group Air France-KLM, Le Maire said. \u201cAir France\u2019s planes are grounded, so we need to support Air France,\u201d the minister said on TF1 television, adding that the aid would carry conditions requiring the group to \u201cbecome the most environmentally friendly airline on the planet\u201d. The French state is also preparing to back about \u20ac5bn in loans to the car manufacturer Renault, Le Maire said. Global confirmed death toll passes 190,000 Researchers at Johns Hopkins University say at least 193,042 people have died since the outbreak began, while at least 2.7m have been infected. The figures are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale of the pandemic due to suspected under-reporting and differing testing regimes. UK records 684 more hospital deaths The Department for Health and Social Care reports 684 more deaths in UK hospitals, bringing the death toll to 19,506. Friday\u2019s update also shows an increase of 5,386 confirmed cases, bringing the UK total to at least 143,464. Recoveries outstrip infections in Spain Authorities in Spain, which has seen the second largest number of confirmed cases in the world, point out that more people are being diagnosed as cured than are falling sick for the first time since the beginning of the outbreak. On Friday, there were 2,796 new infections confirmed while 3,105 overcame the infection. \u201cWith all the effort that we have done, the evolution of the epidemic is obviously beginning to be where it should be,\u201d said Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the ministry\u2019s health emergency centre coordinator. Italy to ease lockdown, local media report Newspapers in Italy are reporting that the country\u2019s lockdown, the longest and toughest in Europe, is to be eased over the next four weeks. There has been no official confirmation, however. Saudi Arabia extends Yemen ceasefire Saudi Arabia says it is extending a unilateral ceasefire in Yemen by one month to support efforts to contain the epidemic there. The announcement comes after a two-week ceasefire expired on Thursday. The ceasefire was by the Saudi-led coalition waging war on the Iran-backed Houthi rebel group that had seized control of parts of the country. UK ministers were warned of pandemic risks last year Government ministers were warned last year that the UK must have a robust plan to deal with a pandemic virus and its potentially catastrophic social and economic consequences, the Guardian reveals. A confidential 600-page Cabinet Office document warned that even a mild pandemic could cost tens of thousands of lives, and set out the must-have \u201ccapability requirements\u201d to mitigate the risks to the country, as well as the potential damage of not doing so. Don\u2019t ease lockdown yet, says German public health body The Robert Koch Institute warns against further loosening restrictions. Its vice-president, Lars Schaade, says the situation is too fragile to allow more relaxation after small shops were allowed to reopen this week and some pupils returned to school. Schaade says Germany should only consider further relaxation if the confirmed cases fall to a few hundred per day. There are typically more than 2,000. WHO launches effort for \u20ac7.5bn fund The World Health Organization announces a multibillion-euro \u201ccall to action\u201d for a global response to the pandemic. The programme and its \u20ac7.5bn (\u00a36.5bn) fundraising effort will be officially launched on 4 May. Sweden reports its greatest number of new cases yet Sweden reports 812 new confirmed cases, the highest such number since the outbreak began. That brings the total number of infections in the country to 17,567. It also reports 131 new deaths, taking the total death toll there to at least 2,152, according to data published by its public health authority. Philippines pass 7,000 cases Confirmed cases in the Philippines rise to more than 7,000, as the country\u2019s health ministry announces 211 new infections. The ministry reported 15 additional deaths and 40 more recoveries. It brought the total cases to 7,192, deaths to 477 and recoveries to 762. The UK prime minister\u2019s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, and a data scientist he worked with on the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit are on the secret scientific group advising the government on the coronavirus pandemic, according to a list leaked to the Guardian. It reveals both Cummings and Ben Warner were among 23 attendees present at a crucial convening of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on 23 March, the day Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown in a televised address. Multiple attendees of Sage told the Guardian that both Cummings and Warner had been taking part in meetings of the group as far back as February. The inclusion of Downing Street advisers on Sage will raise questions about the independence of its scientific advice. There has been growing pressure on Downing Street in recent days to disclose more details about the group, which provides scientific advice to the upper echelons of government during emergencies. Both the membership of Sage and its advice to ministers on the Covid-19 outbreak is being kept secret. The government\u2019s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King said he was \u201cshocked\u201d to discover there were political advisers on Sage. \u201cIf you are giving science advice, your advice should be free of any political bias,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is just so critically important.\u201d Told that Cummings was in the 23 March meeting, King replied: \u201cOh my goodness. Isn\u2019t this maybe why they don\u2019t want us to know who was there?\u201d Deaths from the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy climbed by 420 on Friday, the smallest daily tally since 19 March, the Civil Protection Agency said, but the number of new infections rose to 3,021 from 2,646 on Thursday, Reuters reports. Friday\u2019s death toll was down from 464 the day before. The total of fatalities since the outbreak came to light on 21 February now stands at 25,969, the agency said, the second highest in the world after that of the US. The number of confirmed cases was 192,994, the third highest global tally behind those of the United States and Spain. The New York Times admits it has abandoned its commitment to giving both sides of the story when it comes to Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that injecting disinfectant might help treat coronavirus. According to Jim Acosta, CNN\u2019s chief White House correspondent, the president has since clarified that his remark was sarcastic. The US Covid-19 death toll, the highest in the world, topped 50,000 on Friday, having doubled in 10 days, according to a Reuters tally, and the number of Americans known to be infected surpassed 875,000. The milestone came as New York, so far the country\u2019s worst-affected state, reported its lowest number of daily coronavirus deaths in weeks on Friday. The state reported 422 deaths as of Thursday. That\u2019s the fewest since 31 March, when it recorded 391 deaths, the Associated Press reports. More than 16,000 people have died in the state from the outbreak. We spend a lot of time on this blog posting death tolls, infection rates and other coronavirus-related statistics. But how useful is comparing these statistics? A team of Guardian reporters have set out to answer that question. Two hundred people have defied a police ban to gather in Vienna to protest against Austria\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, Reuters reports. The protest\u2019s organisers, the Initiative for Evidence-Based Corona Information (ICI), want the lockdown ended and argue, among other things, that wearing face masks and fabric equivalents that are compulsory in shops and on public transport is counter-productive. The protesters assembled on a square behind the Vienna State Opera on Friday afternoon, chanting slogans including \u201cWe are the people\u201d and \u201cKurz must go\u201d, referring to the conservative chancellor, Sebastian Kurz. After looking on for an hour, police dispersed the crowd, checking the identities of those who stayed. There was one arrest, a spokesman said. ICI urged people to respect the ban on Friday\u2019s event but said it would register \u201ca new, bigger demo\u201d for a week\u2019s time. It is more than a month since the Austrian government shut bars, restaurants, schools and non-essential shops, although it allowed some shops to reopen last week in a first easing of the curbs. Since the measures were introduced, Austria\u2019s daily increase in infections has fallen to less than 2%. The country has reported 530 coronavirus-related deaths so far, fewer than some larger countries have reported daily. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the African Union\u2019s health body, has released its latest continent-wide coronavirus statistics. Singapore\u2019s ministry of health has reported 897 new cases of coronavirus, taking the national total above 12,000 but ending a four-day streak of more than 1,000 new cases detected per day. Again the overwhelming majority - 853 - of the new cases were detected among migrant workers who live in foreign worker dormitories, while just 25 were in Singapore\u2019s other communities. Twelve people have died from coronavirus in Singapore. Ecuador\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases reached 22,719 after health authorities released the results of a batch of tests that had been backed up, Interior Minister Maria Paul Romo said on Friday, according to Reuters. He identifies as a leftist and rails constantly against neoliberalism. But Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has introduced austerity measures so severe that his critics have compared him to Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, writes David Agren in Mexico City. This week, the president, popularly known as Amlo, unveiled more cuts in response to the Covid-19 crisis, including the abolition of 10 government departments, a hiring freeze and a 25% cut in government salaries. He also eliminated Christmas bonuses. \u201cReagan, Thatcher and now Amlo. This is how it will go down in history \u2013 along with all the human suffering that austerity will cause,\u201d tweeted Ricardo Fuentes Nieva, executive director of Oxfam Mexico. Despite the cuts, the president promised to plough ahead with a suite of mega-projects including a huge oil refinery in his home state of Tabasco, a pair of railways and an airport north of Mexico City. Confirmed cases of Covid-19 increased by 3,122 in Turkey, and 109 more people have died, taking the death toll to 2,600, according to figures published by the health ministry on Friday. The total number of cases in the country is now at 104,912, the data showed. A total of 21,737 people have so far recovered. The number of tests carried out in the past 24 hours was 38,351. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres joined leaders from the European Union and beyond on Friday to ensure all countries receive the tools to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Speaking during a virtual WHO launch event, Guterres said treatments and vaccines should belong to the whole world, not to individual countries or regions. Not a vaccine or treatments for one country or one region or one-half of the world, but a vaccine and treatment that is affordable, safe, effective, easily administered and universally available for everyone, everywhere. The early easing of lockdowns in Ghana and Burkina Faso this week has revealed differing views in West Africa on the most effective application of lockdowns, in response to outbreaks of Covid-19, writes Emmanuel Akinwotu, the Guardian\u2019s West Africa correspondent. In many countries in the region, lockdowns have been imposed early on entire cities. But it has sparked outcry amongst the poorest. Lockdowns on economic activity have weighed heavily on large populations reliant on daily wages, in informal labour. Many countries have not clearly spelled-out what conditions will determine whether lockdowns can ease, fuelling uncertainty and worry. In Ghana, an unexpected decision to ease its lockdown has seen schools, places of worship, restaurants and bars remain closed in Accra and Kumasi. But markets and businesses have been allowed to open with restrictions on movement lifted. Opposition politicians have led criticisms that easing restrictions while cases are rising - now at 1024 infections according to data released on Tuesday - is premature and could accelerate the spread of the virus. But Ghana\u2019s information minister told the Guardian that in a country where almost 90% of its workforce was in the informal economy, its lockdown was not to indefinitely shut down activity until cases fall. A limited lockdown he said bought Ghana time to boost its testing capacity, test widely, assess the nature of its outbreak and prepare its health system. \u201cWe have peculiar local circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cWe decided not to wait but to do a precautionary lockdown early and within that period get mass findings and data to help us,\u201d he said. Nkrumah said the country has conducted more than 80,000 tests - the most per million in Africa, and could now aggressively trace cases as restrictions eased. Coronavirus claimed its seventh fatality in Senegal on Friday, as health officials recorded the West African state\u2019s largest single increase in infections. In a statement, Senegal\u2019s health ministry announced that a 65-year-old man had succumbed to Covid-19 in the seaside capital Dakar, AFP repots. Senegalese authorities said the same day that they had recorded 66 new coronavirus cases - out of a total of 545 - in the largest single increase since the pandemic began in the country. In addition to a night-time curfew, Senegal has closed schools, banned travel between cities and required people to wear a mask in public transport and shops, measures that fall short of a total lockdown The health minister, Abdoulaye Diouf Sarr, told reporters the news underlined why the government has ordered the \u201csystematic wearing of masks in markets and other public places\u201d. Saudi Arabia has said it is extending a unilateral ceasefire in Yemen by one month to support efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic in the battle scarred country. The announcement comes after a two-week ceasefire by the Saudi-led coalition waging war on the Iran-backed Houthi rebel group that had seized control of parts of the country expired on Thursday. The Houthis, who ousted the internationally recognised Saudi-backed government from power in the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014, had rejected the previous ceasefire. They want a lifting of air and sea blockades imposed by the coalition to the regions they control before agreeing to a ceasefire, sources have told Reuters. Yemen\u2019s war has been described as the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis for the third year in a row, the UN refugee agency said on Friday as it called for $89.4m to support displaced people in the country. UNHCR said that only half of Yemen\u2019s health centres were functional, and more than 24 million people in the country needed humanitarian aid. The US has insisted that it is still determined to lead the world on global health matters, despite not taking part the launch on Friday of a World Health Organization initiative to build a coordinated global response to Covid-19. Donald Trump last week suspended US funding to the WHO, which he accused of being slow and \u201cChina-centric.\u201d The US had been the largest single donor to the UN health body. Despite that, and the US\u2019s absence from Friday\u2019s launch, Reuters quoted the US mission in Geneva as saying there was \u201cno doubt about our continuing determination to lead on global health matters\u201d. \u201cThe pause in U.S. funding to WHO does not limit or redefine our commitment to strong and effective international engagement,\u201d a spokesperson at the mission said. It was in late February that the world was first alerted to a rapidly spreading outbreak of coronavirus in Italy, the first major western country to face the viral disease. Italy began testing people after diagnosing its first local patient on 21 February in Codogno, a small town in wealthy Lombardy. Cases and deaths immediately surged. A study presented on Friday suggests the earliest Covid-19 infections in Italy in fact date back to at least a month earlier. Stefano Merler, of the Bruno Kessler Foundation, told a news conference with Italy\u2019s top health authorities that his institute had looked at the first known cases and drawn clear conclusions from the subsequent pace of contagion, Reuters reports. \u201cWe realised that there were a lot of infected people in Lombardy well before 20 February, which means the epidemic had started much earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cIn January for sure, but maybe even before. We\u2019ll never know,\u201d he said, adding that he believed the immediate surge in cases suggested the virus was probably brought to Italy by a group of people rather than a single individual. A separate study based on a sample of cases registered in April said 44.1% of infections occurred in nursing homes and another 24.7% spread within families. A further 10.8% of people caught the virus at hospital and 4.2% in the workplace. Another team of Italian scientists has said the coronavirus may have reached Italy from Germany, not directly from China, in the second half of January. The UK has reported 684 more deaths in hospitals from Covid-19, bringing the total death toll in the country to 19,506, according to a daily report from health authorities. Friday\u2019s update from the Department of Health and Social Care also showed an increase of 5,386 confirmed cases of coronavirus, bringing the UK total to 143,464. For more detailed updates from the UK, click below: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Netherlands rose by 806 to 36,535, health authorities said on Friday, with 112 new deaths. The country\u2019s overall death toll is now 4,289, the Netherlands\u2019 Institute for Public Health (RIVM) said. However it emphasised it reports only confirmed cases, and actual numbers are higher. Separately, statistician Ruben van Gaalen, of the Netherlands\u2019 central bureau of statistics, tweeted data that suggested the country\u2019s real Covid-19 death toll could be somewhere in the region of 7,000. RIVM\u2019s update added that 123 more patients had been admitted to hospital. \u201cNot all of the reported hospital admissions or deaths occurred within the last 24 hours,\u201d RIVM said. \u201cSome patients are reported later. For this reason, the figures are often supplemented with data from previous days.\u201d It added: \u201cThe figures for the last few days are in line with the impression that the measures are working. The number of new hospital admissions reported per day is still decreasing. The same applies to the number of reported deaths.\u201d Sweden\u2019s top coronavirus official has questioned the scientific basis of other EU countries\u2019 strict coronavirus lockdowns, as Germany said its number of cases needed to fall from about 2,000 to a few hundred a day before it could ease restrictions further, writes Jon Henley, the Guardian\u2019s Europe correspondent. As several European countries continued to cautiously lift their lockdowns, sending children back to school and reopening some shops and businesses, Sweden\u2019s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, said the original measures looked difficult to justify. Sweden has favoured civic responsibility over mandatory rules, closing senior high schools and banning gatherings of more than 50 people, but asking rather than ordering people to avoid non-essential travel, work from home and stay indoors if they are over 70 or feeling ill. Shops, restaurants and junior schools have stayed open. Polls show many Swedes support and are complying with the policy, which has been heavily criticised by some senior members of the country\u2019s scientific community. The country has also recorded 2,150 deaths \u2013 giving it a per-million total much lower than Italy\u2019s and Spain\u2019s, but many times higher than those of its Nordic neighbours. Coronavirus has been detected on particles of air pollution by scientists investigating whether this could enable it to be carried over longer distances and increase the number of people infected, writes Damian Carrington, the Guardian\u2019s environment editor. The work is preliminary and it is not yet known if the virus remains viable on pollution particles and in sufficient quantity to cause disease. The Italian scientists used standard techniques to collect outdoor air pollution samples at one urban and one industrial site in Bergamo province and identified a gene highly specific to Covid-19 in multiple samples. The detection was confirmed by blind testing at an independent laboratory. Leonardo Setti, at the University of Bologna in Italy, who led the work, said it was important to investigate if the virus could be carried more widely by air pollution. He added: I am a scientist and I am worried when I don\u2019t know. If we know, we can find a solution. But if we don\u2019t know, we can only suffer the consequences. Sweden reported 812 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, the highest number of new cases yet reported, bringing the total number of infections so far in the country to 17,567. On Friday, the country also reported 131 new deaths from Covid-19, taking the total death toll in the country to 2,152, according to data published by its public health authority. So far, 1,256 patients have had cases serious enough for them to be treated in intensive care.

The Dutch National Ballet may have cancelled all of its stage shows until June but for some of its performers the lockdown has not stopped them dancing. Six of its dancers headed out this week on to the deserted streets of Amsterdam to film parts in a piece of choreography inspired by the Covid-19 lockdown. Footage of the solo dances, featuring performances in front of landmarks including the Amstel Hotel and the Eye film museum, will be edited together into a film titled Gently Quiet that will be streamed online by early May, the National Ballet said, according to a Reuters report. \u201cI like this project as we can show what we want to do and what we are waiting for to do again,\u201d 25-year old dancer Yvonne Slingerland, who performed her piece beside the Amstel river, said on Friday. Even if we are in this weird situation we are still moving and we are still trying to get to the audience. I think art right now is really important for everyone.\u201d Bars, restaurants, museums and other public places have been shut in the Netherlands since 15 March in an attempt to limit the spread of coronavirus. The National Ballet has cancelled all its performances until 1 June and stopped its dancers from rehearsing together, with many resorting to practicing at home. \u201cThis is our way of bringing a poetic production, despite not being able to work together in our studio or to perform in front of an audience,\u201d National Ballet spokesman Richard Heideman said. The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a multibillion-pound \u201ccall to action\u201d for a global response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The programme and its \u20ac7.5bn (\u00a36.5bn) fundraising effort will be officially launched on 4 May. WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the Access to Covid Tools (ACT) Accelerator programme would call on international experts and governments to unite and speed up access to safe, affordable and universally available vaccines and therapeutics. Tedros said: \u201cPast experience has taught us that even when tools are available, they have been not been equally available to all - but we cannot allow that to happen. Today, the WHO is proud to be uniting with many partners to launch the Access to Covid Tools Accelerator. The virtual conference also heard all new vaccines, diagnostics and treatments against coronavirus must be made equally available to everyone worldwide. The WHO call comes as it launches a \u201clandmark collaboration\u201d to speed the development of effective drugs, tests and vaccines to prevent and treat Covid-19, with Tedros warning the disease is a \u201ccommon threat which we can only defeat with a common approach\u201d. He said: Experience has told us that even when tools are available they have not been equally available to all. We cannot allow that to happen.\u201d European commission president Ursula von der Leyen also told the virtual conference that the effort to raise \u20ac7.5bn was to ramp up work on prevention, diagnostics and treatment. \u201cThis is a first step only, but more will be needed in the future,\u201d she said. More from France where it has been announced that millions of washable face masks will be provided to the public from next month. The government move is the latest development in a row over its apparent flip-flopping over the value of masks in protecting people from Covid-19 infection. More than 10m textile masks were produced by domestic and international plants last week and output should reach 25m by the end of April, Junior finance minister Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher told financial daily Les Echos. From 4 May, the masks will be sold to the public, likely via pharmacies, supermarkets and online. The French government has been hit by criticism from medical specialists and opposition politicians for repeatedly shifting its position on whether, when and where citizens should wear masks in public to limit the spread of the disease. In a video call with French mayors on Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron indicated that mask wearing for the public would only be recommended, and probably made mandatory in public transport, once the lockdown is lifted. The Czech Republic today opened its borders for outbound foreign travel in a sudden U-turn after official figures showed a decline in the incidence of Covid-19 infections. The move, announced by the health minister ,Adam Vojt\u011bch, represented a surprise change of course for the country, which had been among the first in Europe to close its borders on 16 March. Officials had insisted until recent days that travel restrictions would remain for the foreseeable future, with the country\u2019s president, Milos Zeman, suggesting last weekend that frontiers should stay closed for the next year. However, Vojt\u011bch heralded a dramatic reversal in a late-night press conference on Thursday but indicated the onus would be on travellers to prove they were uninfected on their return. \u201cUpon return, travellers will either have to present confirmation of a negative test for coronavirus, or be forced to spend 14 days in quarantine,\u201d he said. Commuters would also be able to cross the borders daily if they presented a negative test for coronavirus every 14 days, Vojt\u011bch added, a move that will affect a relatively small number of people who live in the Czech Republic but work in a neighbouring country, or vice versa. In a further development, the deputy health minister, Roman Prymula, announced that mandatory face mask-wearing \u2013 credited by officials with containing the virus\u2019s spread \u2013 would stay until at least the end of June. Restrictions are also being lifted on movement within the country, with groups of up to 10 people now permitted to gather. Previous rules limited outdoor gatherings to two. The move follows growing public pressure for an easing of emergency measures. But there was criticism that the announcement sowed confusion, with no immediate announcement on when foreign visitors would be allowed to re-enter, which would help Prague\u2019s beleaguered tourist economy. The announcement came hours after the government had accelerated its timetable for reopening the economy following pressure from Czech trading lobbies. Restaurants and pubs will be allowed to fully reopen on 25 May, two weeks earlier than initially planned in a five-phase restart plan announced last week. Zoos will be allowed to reopen from Monday, a month earlier than planned. The relaxations came after Prague\u2019s municipal court on Thursday ruled the government\u2019s restrictions unlawful. Officials have hailed better-than-expected results from the anti-coronavirus clampdown. The health ministry confirmed the number of infections at 7,188 on Friday, with 55 new Covid-19 positive tests recorded the previous day \u2013 the lowest number since 14 March. There have been 213 deaths. France will decide at the end of next month when it will allow bars and restaurants to reopen, the country\u2019s finance minister says, as the government prepares to ease some coronavirus lockdown measures from 11 May. Bars and restaurants in France have been shut for five weeks already but the government is warning against the risk of a premature reopening. Finance minister Bruno Le Maire said on Friday: Nothing would be worse than to make a hasty reopening which would then force us to close again. It would be a huge disappointment for the restaurant owners, a huge disappointment for French people as well.\u201d From 11 May, children will begin returning to school, but this will be organised in stages and classes will be much smaller in order to reduce infection risks. The World Health Organization has been working with thousands of researchers across the world since January in a bid to fast-track a development of a vaccine, its director general says, as he announces the launch of a new scheme to help achieve the goal. WHO\u2019s Tedros Adhanom says the organisation is uniting with partners to launch the \u201cAccess to #COVID19 Tools Accelerator, or the ACT Accelerator\u201d. The \u201clandmark collaboration\u201d will accelerate the development, production and equitable distribution of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics for Covid-19, he says. Hello folks, it\u2019s Simon Murphy here taking over the global live blog while my colleague Damien Gayle takes a break. Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary general, and Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, are due to launch a \u201clandmark collaboration to accelerate the development, production and equitable distribution of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics for Covid-19.\u201d According to the WHO, the aim of the collaboration is to make vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics for Covid-19 accessible to everyone who needs them, worldwide. They are due to begin speaking in just a few minutes, and you can watch for yourself, live, in the player embedded at the top of the blog. Germany\u2019s leading public health body, the Robert Koch Institute, has warned against further loosening restrictions introduced to slow down the spread of coronavirus, writes Kate Connolly, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent. Lars Schaade, its vice president, said at the RKI\u2019s twice-weekly briefing the situation was too fragile to allow more relaxation, after small shops were allowed to reopen this week and some pupils returned to school, following a month of strict lockdown measures. Schaade said only if the confirmed cases fell to a few hundred, should Germany consider further relaxation. Currently there are typically more than 2,000 new infections every day. According to the RKI, Germany has 150,383 confirmed cases, a rise of 2,337 from Thursday, and 5,321 people have died from the virus. But due to a delay in the central collation of figures, the real number of cases is said by reliable health watchers gathering statistics on the L\u00e4nder level, to be more than 3,000 higher, and the number of deaths just under 300 more than the RKI\u2019s figures. The current reproduction rate in Germany is 0.9 - which means every person with the infection is passing it on to one other person. This is up from 0.7 a week ago, but virologists consider one and under to be good. Schaade said keeping the restrictions was necessary because in order to be able to keep the disease under control, health authorities around the country have to be in a position to be able to identify each case and trace their contacts, to place them in immediate isolation. If the number of new infections grows too quickly, the tracking and tracing process becomes too unwieldy a task, and the situation could quickly get out of control, he said. He said unlike in Italy, France and Spain, there was so far no evidence of excess mortality in Germany - that is, a death rate higher than the usual average death rate for this time of year. This was, he said, due to the fact that Germany was able to tackle the illness early on, largely through testing, and dampen its spread, and therefore treated many coronavirus cases effectively, without lessening hospitals\u2019 ability to treat other illnesses. Referring to the pressure being placed on authorities to relax measures, which he advised against strongly, Schaade said: It is a paradox, that due to the success of the measures that have been taken ... these very measures are now being called into question. That Germany has come through this epidemic comparatively well so far, is thanks to the measures we have taken. The number of cases has stayed at a level with which the health system has been able to cope, and it must stay that way. We cannot afford to become lax. With respect to the first relaxation of measures, this must not be allowed to lead to a landslide of other subsequent easing that could have serious consequences.\u201d He said quite simply, that more contact would automatically lead to more infections \u201cand when there are more infections a dynamic will develop again very quickly with rising infection rates which in the worst case, could bring us to a point where the epidemic is no longer manageable. In short, Schaade said, his \u201cemphatic plea\u201d was for people to stick to the recommendations: Stay at home, stay away from others, keep the 1.5 metre - or even better 2 metre distance, keep to the coughing and sneezing rules, and on public transport or shops, wear mouth-nose cover to protect others. He recognised, he said, that \u201cmany people are running out of strength, and many are suffering from existential angst. Believe me, I\u2019d like nothing more than to tell you it\u2019s over...but unfortunately it\u2019s not over.\u201d While social distancing and national lockdowns have been credited with slowing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, governments and experts have said the only permanent way out is through a vaccine. Vaccine development usually takes years, meaning that teams around the world are considering a range of risks and shortcuts to bring one to market in a much shorter time. Hannah Devlin, the Guardian\u2019s science correspondent, has looked at four different approaches being taken by research teams around the world, ranging from classic weakened viruses, to genetically modified forms, to revolutionary approaches using DNA and RNA. But, as she writes, there is a chance none of them will work, or that they may have serious unintended side-effects. Newspapers in Italy are reporting that the country\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, the longest and toughest in Europe, is to be eased over the next four weeks. However, there has been no official confirmation, AFP reports. The Covd-19 pandemic has killed at least 25,500 people in Italy, the world\u2019s second highest death toll. \u201cThe next four Mondays will mark the country\u2019s reopening\u201d following the lockdown implemented last month to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, the Corriere della Sera daily reported. \u201cEverything depends on the infection curve,\u201d the best-selling daily said, but if it doesn\u2019t rise again \u201cfactories making agricultural and forestry equipment can reopen on (Monday) 27 April.\u201d Building sites as well as the textile and fashion industry can restart on 4 May, followed a week later by clothing, shoe and other shops. Finally, bars, restaurants and hairdressers can reopen on 18 May, the paper said. Other Italian media said that bars and restaurants could reopen some time \u201cin the second half of May\u201d. Italy\u2019s national lockdown is the longest in force anywhere in the world. Its stay-at-home orders \u2013 introduced on 9 March \u2013 have since been replicated by other European nations. The government ordered all shops except for pharmacies and grocery stores to close on 12 March. Human Rights Watch has accused security forces in Rwanda of arbitrarily arresting scores of people and imprisoning them in stadiums while enforcing coronavirus lockdown measures in the country. Among those detained were journalists and bloggers trying to expose abuse, including reports of killings, rapes and other serious crimes by soldiers, the NGO said, as it called for the government to investigate the alleged abuses. Lewis Mudge, central Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said: Government directives to prevent the spread of Covid-19 do not give security forces carte blanche to ignore rule of law and commit abuses against the population while locking up those trying to expose them. The Rwandan authorities should end these unlawful practices immediately, transparently investigate those responsible, and bring officers involved in violations and who have committed crimes to justice. The lockdown in Rwanda, which has so far reported 154 cases of coronavirus, 87 recoveries and no deaths, was extended last week until the end of the month. Authorities in Spain have pointed out that for the first time since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak more people are being diagnosed as cured than those falling sick, the Associated Press reports. On Friday, there were 2,796 new infections confirmed while 3,105 overcame the infection. \u201cWith all the effort that we have done, the evolution of the epidemic is obviously beginning to be where it should be,\u201d said Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the ministry\u2019s health emergency centre coordinator. On Friday, Spain recorded 367 new deaths of patients with the coronavirus, raising the total death toll to 22,524, as the government considered how to end a strict confinement that has extended for more than 40 days. Health officials from Spain\u2019s 17 regions and the central government were to meet later on Friday with proposals on how to roll back the six-week lockdown. Authorities have said that future steps will be incremental and depend on how regions meet certain health criteria. The UN\u2019s human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, has criticised countries for using the coronavirus crisis as an excuse to attack independent journalists, saying \u201ccredible, accurate reporting is a lifeline for all of us\u201d. In a statement on Friday, Bachelet pointed to data from the International Press Institute showing there have been nearly 40 journalists arrested around the world for reports critical of states\u2019 responses to the pandemic or for questioning the accuracy of official numbers of cases and deaths. She said: Some states have used the outbreak of the new coronavirus as a pretext to restrict information and stifle criticism. A free media is always essential, but we have never depended on it more than we do during this pandemic, when so many people are isolated and fearing for their health and livelihoods. Credible, accurate reporting is a lifeline for all of us. This is no time to blame the messenger. Rather than threatening journalists or stifling criticism, States should encourage healthy debate concerning the pandemic and its consequences. People have a right to participate in decision-making that affects their lives, and an independent media is a vital medium for this. Being open and transparent, and involving those affected in decision-making builds public trust and helps ensure that people participate in measures designed to protect their own health and that of the wider population and increases accountability. According to an AFP report, rights office spokesman Rupert Colville pointed to, among others, US president Donald Trump, who has been known to make direct attacks on journalists during his press briefings. \u201cThat\u2019s a worrying trend, when you\u2019re talking about mainstream, serious media organisations under fire,\u201d Colville said during a virtual press briefing. Authorities in France have banned online sales of nicotine substitutes, and limited their sale in shops, to avoid stockpiling after research suggested the drug could stop people contracting coronavirus. Until 11 May, when the country\u2019s lockdown is planned to gradually begin lifting, pharmacies will only be able to sell a maximum of one month\u2019s worth of products treating nicotine dependence, such as patches, chewing gum or lozenges, AFP reports. The move was to \u201cfirstly prevent the health risks from excessive consumption or misuse linked to media coverage of the possible protective effect of nicotine against COVID-19,\u201d the government said in a statement. \u201cSecondly it guarantees continuous and appropriate supply to people requiring medical support to stop smoking.\u201d It comes after a study at a major Paris hospital suggested a substance in tobacco \u2013 possibly nicotine \u2013 may be stopping patients who smoke from catching Covid-19. Clinical trials of nicotine patches are awaiting the approval of the country\u2019s health authorities. The team at Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospital questioned 480 patients who tested positive for the virus, 350 of whom were hospitalised while the rest with less serious symptoms were allowed home. It found that of those admitted to hospital, whose median age was 65, only 4.4% were regular smokers. Among those released home, with a median age of 44, 5.3% smoked. French health minister Olivier Veran on Friday urged citizens not to rush out and buy nicotine products, telling France Inter radio that there are 70,000 deaths due to tobacco each year in France. But he called the research \u201cinteresting\u201d and said that products similar to nicotine could be developed that could help avoid its \u201caddictive effects\u201d. Confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Philippines have rose to more than 7,000 on Friday, after the country\u2019s health ministry reported 211 new infections, Reuters reports. In a bulletin, the ministry reported 15 additional deaths and 40 more recoveries. It brought the total cases to 7,192, deaths to 477 and recoveries to 762. President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday extended a strict lockdown in the capital Manila - where more than two thirds of deaths have been reported - until 15 May to try to contain coronavirus infections, but will ease restrictions in lower-risk regions. Ramadan begins with new coronavirus measures The Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins on Friday, with some countries easing restrictions and others tightening them. Egypt is set to ease its coronavirus lockdown for the holy fasting month of Ramadan by allowing more businesses to reopen and shortening a night-time curfew. The United Arab Emirates has shortened a nationwide coronavirus curfew by two hours to now run daily from 10pm-6am (instead of from 8pm). Doctors condemn Trump\u2019s \u2018disinfectant\u2019 virus theory Medical experts have widely condemned Donald Trump\u2019s musings at the latest White House briefing about whether disinfectant and UV rays could be used on people to fight the virus. US may extend social distancing until summer Trump also said he might extend federal social distancing guidelines to the summer. It came as Congress approved a $484bn coronavirus relief package, taking to nearly $3tn the money pledged so far. Also in the US, the Democratic senator, Elizabeth Warren, has revealed her older brother has died after contracting Covid-19. Russia: 5,849 new cases and 60 new deaths in 24 hours Russia on Friday reported 5,849 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, pushing its nationwide tally to 68,622. Sixty people with the virus died overnight, pushing the death toll to 615, Russia\u2019s official crisis response centre said. New deaths in Spain at lowest level in more than a month The number of coronavirus deaths in Spain has fallen to its lowest level in more than a month, with 367 new deaths reported on Friday, Reuters reports. The latest update took total fatalities to 22,524 from 22,157 the day before, the health ministry said. The overall number of coronavirus cases rose to 219,764 from 213,024 the day before. No deaths in South Korea in last 24 hours South Korea reported just six more cases of Covid-19 compared with 24 hours ago as of midnight on Friday local time, raising the total number of infections to 10,708. There were no deaths in the last 24 for the first time since 16 March \u2013 a full 39 days. The death toll is now at 240; the total fatality rate is 2.24%. China reports low numbers of new cases again China has published its daily coronavirus figures, reporting just 6 new cases and no new deaths. Macron to release lockdown exit plan early next week French president Emmanuel Macron says the government is aiming to release its detailed end of lockdown plan \u201cprobably on Tuesday\u201d. Speaking to a group of mayors by video-conference on Friday, the president said managing the return to normal life was a \u201clogistical and organisational challenge\u201d. The company that makes Dettol has issued a warning against consuming or injecting disinfectants, after Donald Trump, the US president, suggested it would \u201cinteresting to check\u201d whether doing so could help cure patients of coronavirus. During his latest press conference, Mr Trump said researchers were looking at the effects of disinfectants on Covid-19. Wondering aloud if they could be injected into people, he added the virus \u201cdoes a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that\u201d. But hours later, disinfectant manufacturer RB, the company behind the Dettol and Lysol brands, issued a statement urging people not to try the method. It said: Due to recent speculation and social media activity, RB has been asked whether internal administration of disinfectants may be appropriate for investigation or use as a treatment for coronavirus. As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route). It added that all its products should only be used as intended and according to usage guidelines. In response to the Mr Trump\u2019s comments, William Bryan, of the US department of homeland security\u2019s science and technology unit, said health officials were not considering such treatment. The number of coronavirus deaths in Spain has fallen to its lowest level in more than a month, with 367 new deaths reported on Friday, Reuters reports. The latest update took total fatalities to 22,524 from 22,157 the day before, the health ministry said. The overall number of coronavirus cases rose to 219,764 from 213,024 the day before.

Iran has reported 1,168 new cases of coronavirus in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of infections to 88,194. There have been 93 new deaths in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths to 5,574. The Taliban have rejected appeals for a ceasefire from Afghanistan\u2019s president, as the country records its biggest daily rise in new coronavirus cases, reports my colleague Akhtar Mohammad Makoii. The country recorded 95 new cases, bringing the overall total to 1,330. It recorded two new deaths, bringing the overall number of deaths to 43. President Ashraf Ghani, speaking on the eve of Ramadan, asked the Taliban to declare a ceasefire during Ramadan as the nation continues its struggle with coronavirus. Ghani said coronavirus is now \u201cspread all over the country\u201d and urged the Taliban to answer a call for peace and a ceasefire and to \u201cstop the violence\u201d. But the Taliban refused to announce a ceasefire. The group\u2019s spokesman Suhail Shaeen said they had a framework of a peace deal with the US and \u201cif it is implemented (fully), it will take us to a lasting peace and ceasefire\u201d . Meanwhile, the Taliban continued their attacks across the country. Local media reported that at least 13 local forces were killed in western Badghis province over night. Afghanistan\u2019s health ministry has said the ministry is concerned about the spread of coronavirus in war zones. A spokesman said the country is fighting both terror and coronavirus: \u201cYou won\u2019t find any country like us, war is our biggest challenge in order to fight with coronavirus.\u201d More positive news out of South Korea. The country reported just six more cases of Covid-19 compared with 24 hours ago as of midnight on Friday local time, raising the total number of infections to 10,708. There were no deaths in the last 24 for the first time since 16 March \u2013 a full 39 days. The death toll is now at 240; the total fatality rate is 2.24%. It is worth remembering that South Korea has not imposed any lockdown, but has instead pursued a policy of \u201ctest, trace, contain\u201d from the outset. This report from my colleague Justin McCurry is a fascinating read: Here an excerpt: By the time the World Health Organization issued its plea in mid-March for countries to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d, South Korea had spent weeks doing just that, quickly developing the capability to test an average of 12,000 people \u2013 and sometimes as many as 20,000 \u2013 a day at hundreds of drive-through and walk-in testing centres. The mobile centres conducted the tests free of charge within 10 minutes, with the results were sent to people\u2019s phones within 24 hours. By mid-March more than 270,000 people had been tested. Testing aside, South Korea \u2013 the most connected country in the world \u2013 also used mobile technology against the outbreak in the form of contact tracing. People who tested positive were asked to describe their recent movements, aided by GPS phone tracking, surveillance camera records and credit card transactions. Those details enabled the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to issue alerts, in real time, about where infected people had been before their positive status was confirmed. Indonesia reported its biggest daily jump in coronavirus infections after identifying 436 new cases, taking the total to 8,211, data provided by health ministry official Achmad Yurianto showed on Friday. Forty-two more people who had tested positive for the virus died, taking the total number of deaths to 689, according to the data. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany needs to fall to a few hundred a day to enable further easing of lockdown measures, the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said on Friday. Germany recorded 2,337 new cases on Friday to bring the total number of confirmed infections to 150,383. The reported death toll rose by 227 to 5,321. French president Emmanuel Macron says the government is aiming to release its detailed end of lockdown plan \u201cprobably on Tuesday\u201d. Speaking to a group of mayors by video-conference on Friday, the president said managing the return to normal life was a \u201clogistical and organisational challenge\u201d and that measures to end the lockdown would be introduced nationally across the country and not region by region as had been reported. The reopening of schools would happen progressively and along \u201cthree major principles \u2026 progressively, with consultations and adapted to the situation\u201d. Priority would probably be given to younger pupils and those with \u201cthe most difficulties\u201d, he said, without specifying what those difficulties might be. More importantly in the face of some opposition from worried parents, Macron said there would be \u201cno obligation\u201d for pupils to return immediately. \u201cWe have to be flexible,\u201d the president added. French junior economy and finance minister Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher said the distribution of washable face masks to the general public will begin on 4 May, but told French radio the details of how this would be carried out were still being decided. Catherine Guillouard, the president of RATP, the Paris region transport authority, said she hopes to have 70% of public transport running on 11 May, the day the French lockdown is due to be eased. Paris\u2019s automated Metro lines will run at 100%. The city\u2019s public transport network is operating 30% its usual trains, buses and trams. The authorities are looking at whether to make it obligatory to wear a mask when using public transport. Work on Notre Dame Cathedral, ravaged by fire a year ago, is to restart on Monday. General Jean-Louis Georgelin, tasked by Macron to oversee the work, said he still believes it can be completed in five years if everyone \u201crolls up their sleeves\u201d. Russia confirmed 5,849 new cases of coronavirus on Friday, a sharp increase that appears to dash hopes that the country has reached a plateau in its battle against the virus. The near-record jump in cases brought the country\u2019s total to 68,622, with nearly half of those in Moscow, the country\u2019s capital. The sudden increase came after several days of decreasing tallies, and was accompanied by reports that hospitalisations in Moscow have been going up. On Thursday, the chief doctor at one of Moscow\u2019s hospitals battling the virus said that emergency departments are under pressure from a wave of younger patients. Russia is also expected to see cases rise in coming days as the virus continues to progress from Moscow out into the country\u2019s other regions. Reuters have a story here that sounds straight out of a film script, but such are the times in which we live: Police in the United Arab Emirates are deploying smart helmets that can scan the temperatures of hundreds of people every minute in their effort to combat the new coronavirus. The helmets, which need less time and less contact than traditional thermometers, can measure temperatures from five metres (16ft) away and scan up to 200 people a minute, triggering an alert if a fever is detected. Chinese company KC Wearable says it has sold more than 1,000 of the temperature-scanning helmets and has received orders from the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Police officer Aly al-Ramsy told Reuters: We\u2019ve implemented the smart helmet during this time of crisis, with Covid-19, across all police stations in Dubai, as well as at patrolling stations whose duty requires them to be on the frontline. In the case of someone with a high temperature, we take the necessary measures to stop the person \u2026 and then the person is dealt with by paramedics and taken to the closest medical facility. Dubai police are using the helmets to screen people in densely populated areas, including sealed off neighbourhoods. The UAE has the second highest infection count among the six Gulf states, with more than 8,000, and over 50 deaths. It does not provide a breakdown for each of its seven emirates. The Philippines\u2019 health ministry on Friday reported that confirmed cases of the new coronavirus have risen to more than 7,000. In a bulletin, the ministry recorded 211 new infections, 15 additional deaths and 40 more recoveries. It brought the total cases to 7,192, deaths to 477 and recoveries to 762. President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday extended a strict lockdown in the capital Manila until 15 May to try to contain coronavirus infections, but will ease restrictions in lower-risk regions. Russia on Friday reported 5,849 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, pushing its nationwide tally to 68,622. Sixty people with the virus died overnight, pushing the death toll to 615, Russia\u2019s official crisis response centre said. This is a lovely picture essay of Italian teenage lockdown living. More disheartening economic news. European Union industry commissioner Thierry Breton said on Friday the EU was heading this year towards a 5-10% economic contraction due to the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 and that could be an optimistic prediction. Breton said on France 2 television: As of today, in the European Union, we\u2019re on course for a 5% to 10% (recession), meaning it\u2019s about 7.5%. But that is today, and if things don\u2019t improve and if we have a second peak (of the outbreak), things could get worse. Disappointment that Gilead\u2019s Remdesivir drugs has apparently failed a Covid-19 test has dampened investors\u2019 mood, with the European-wide Stoxx 600 index down 1%, writes my colleague Graeme Wearden. Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that corovavirus patients could be injected with disinfectant or bathed in ultraviolet light has, unsurprisingly, not helped the mood in the markets either. For all business and financial markets updates, do work Graeme\u2019s superlative work on Business Live: This is the moment that Dr Deborah Birx, the US\u2019s coronavirus taskforce response coordinator, listened in obvious discomfort as President Trump asks his science adviser to study using UV light on the human body and injecting disinfectant to fight the coronavirus suggested people could receive injections of disinfectant to cure coronavirus, a notion one medical expert described as \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d. Here is the full story on (yet another) extraordinary press conference: More on Sweden. Nature published an in-depth piece on the country\u2019s approach, including an interview with Tegnell, which is really worth a read: Here\u2019s a snippet: The approach has sharp critics. Among them are 22 high-profile scientists who last week wrote in the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter that the public-health authorities had failed, and urged politicians to step in with stricter measures. They point to the high number of coronavirus deaths in elder-care homes and Sweden\u2019s overall fatality rate, which is higher than that of its Nordic neighbours \u2014 131 per million people, compared with 55 per million in Denmark and 14 per million in Finland, which have adopted lockdowns. What is striking, to me at least, is Tegnell\u2019s statement that we still do not know about coronavirus, the way it behaves or the way it spreads - in contrast to the UK government\u2019s insistence that \u201cwe are following the science\u201d. Tegnell states: It is difficult to talk about the scientific basis of a strategy with these types of disease, because we do not know much about it and we are learning as we are doing, day by day. Closedown, lockdown, closing borders \u2013 nothing has a historical scientific basis, in my view. We have looked at a number of European Union countries to see whether they have published any analysis of the effects of these measures before they were started and we saw almost none. Closing borders, in my opinion, is ridiculous, because Covid-19 is in every European country now. We have more concerns about movements inside Sweden. As a society, we are more into nudging: continuously reminding people to use measures, improving measures where we see day by day the that they need to be adjusted. We do not need to close down everything completely because it would be counterproductive. Fascinating interview with Sweden\u2019s state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning. Sweden has been criticised for taking a different path to its neighbours, and indeed the rest of Europe, in its approach to dealing with coronavirus. It has asked its citizens to avoid non-essential travel, work from home and stay indoors if they are over 70 or are feeling ill - but there has been no enforced lockdown. The country has seen a higher death rate than its neighbours. Yesterday, the Public Health Agency of Sweden said it had recorded 16,755 confirmed cases, and 2,021 deaths with the coronavirus. And there has been anger in the country that older people have borne the brunt of the strategy, as reported by my colleague Richard Orange. Lena Einhorn, a virologist who has been one of the leading domestic critics of Sweden\u2019s coronavirus policy, told the Observer. They have to admit that it\u2019s a huge failure, since they have said the whole time that their main aim has been to protect the elderly. But Tegnall today said Sweden\u2019s strategy put it in a better place to deal with a second wave of coronavirus as the country\u2019s scientists estimated there was now around 15-20% immunity in the population \u2013 not enough for herd immunity, but enough to slow and control the spread of the disease. Asked if the policy had worked, Tegnall said the aim had been to slow the progression of the disease so its healthcare system did not become overwhelmed. It has worked in some aspects. The health service has been able to cope \u2013 20% of ICU beds have been empty and able to take coronavirus patients at all times. In terms of death toll, Sweden had seen \u201cabout the same results as other countries\u201d, he said. Asked about the fact that there are more deaths in Sweden than in other Scandinavian countries, he said that as many as 50% of deaths had come in care homes for the elderly \u2013 which have banned visitors. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how a lockdown would have stopped that,\u201d he said. Asked if the strategy had resulted in more deaths, he said: It\u2019s a difficult question and I don\u2019t think we have the answer and I don\u2019t know if we will ever get the answer. Sweden estimates it passed the peak of the disease last week, and hopes it will be better placed to deal with any further outbreaks We hope this will make it easier for us in the long run. Other part of the reasoning is we want something sustainable, if we need mitigation we can go on doing this for a long time, if looks like going to get second wave in the fall we can easily continue doing what we are doing now. I\u2019m handing over the blog to my colleague in the UK, Alexandra Topping. Thanks for your company and enjoy the day\u2019s continuing coverage from our HQ in Britain. The alpine ski resort of Ischgl, at the centre of Austria\u2019s biggest cluster of coronavirus infections, has said it wants to move away from \u201cparty tourism\u201d as it emerged from more than a month under quarantine. Ischgl is near the point where Austria, Italy and Switzerland meet and has described itself as the \u201cIbiza of the Alps\u201d. It is now clear that more than 800 cases spread across Austria can be traced back to the resort and the surrounding Paznaun valley. In February and early March, the virus found a breeding ground in crowded apres-ski bars. Hundreds of foreign tourists were infected in Ischgl and then unwittingly took the virus home with them. \u201cWe will question developments of the past years and, where necessary, make corrections,\u201d Ischgl\u2019s mayor, Werner Kurz, said in a statement issued by the tourism authority for his town and the Paznaun Valley, which on Thursday came out of a quarantine imposed on 13 March. Kurz said the town\u2019s image as a party destination was unfair because that was just a small part of its offering, but he said he would work with local businesses to make changes. You can read our full story below: If you are just joining the blog, you can get up to speed fast on our latest At A Glance coverage of coronavirus developments. And you can also see our latest global wrap-up of the day\u2019s events, as the governments of nations with large Muslim populations were divided on coronavirus restrictions as Ramadan began, with with some easing lockdowns while others enacted travel bans. Several of the UK papers lead on virus testing. Here\u2019s a flavour of the coverage: In the latest blame game tit-for-tat between US and China over who concealed what in regards to the coronavirus, the Chinese state media tabloid, the Global Times, has tweeted that a lawyer from Wuhan plans to sue the US for \u201cfalsely reporting Covid-19 patients as flu patients\u201d. Thailand reported 15 new coronavirus cases and no new deaths on Friday, bringing the total number of cases since its outbreak in January to 2,854 cases and 50 fatalities. Of the new cases, nine were linked to previous cases and two had no known links. Four other new cases were reported from the southern province of Yala where the authorities are aggressively testing the population because of high infection rates there, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the government\u2019s Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration. Since the outbreak 2,490 patients have recovered and gone home South Korea\u2019s stock market has bounced back stronger than any other major world market, as investors bet Seoul\u2019s handling of the crisis would see it through sooner and stronger than others, Reuters reports. The Kospi index is up 31% from a low point hit on 19 March, a performance matched only by smaller Thailand, and bettered only by Argentina\u2019s S&amp;P Merval, which is less than 1% of the Seoul market\u2019s size by value. The jump has come even as South Korea\u2019s exports have cratered and the economy has contracted. South Korea is Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy and among the first countries to bring its major outbreak of the virus under control, with a vigorous without mandatory lockdowns or a gigantic debt-funded rescue package. It has fewer than 11,000 cases so far, with 240 deaths. Press Association in the UK is reporting that Beyonce has teamed up with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to donate US$6m to the coronavirus relief effort. The pop titan\u2019s BeyGood foundation announced the donation on Thursday, with money going to frontline workers and those affected by the pandemic. Beyonce said: \u201cThe impact of this pandemic is far reaching, and it\u2019s going to take each and everyone of us to help make a difference.\u201d Recipients of the money, donated in partnership with Dorsey\u2019s StartSmall initiative, include small community organisations as well as mental health services in US cities New York, Detroit, New Orleans and Houston, Beyonce\u2019s home city. She previously warned the virus was having a disproportionate impact on black Americans and shared grim statistics from Houston. The BeyGood initiative said: \u201cCommunities of colour are suffering by epic proportions due to the pandemic. Many families live in underserved areas with homes that make it harder to practice social distancing.\u201d Beyonce appeared on the One World: Together At Home concert on the weekend and paid tribute to medical staff, describing them as \u201ctrue heroes\u201d. And she made a surprise appearance on the Disney Family Singalong broadcast and dedicated her performance of When You Wish Upon A Star to those risking their lives. Other stars to make donations to the coronavirus relief effort include George Clooney, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Reynolds. Here\u2019s a summary of the main news today on coronavirus: Global infections have passed 2.7 million, with deaths standing at just under 191,000. The US leads infections with 869,000, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker, then daylight before Italy on 213,000. The US also leads global deaths at 49,954. The next worst affected countries are Italy on 25,549 deaths, Spain on 22,157 and France on 21,856. Medical experts have widely condemned Donald Trump\u2019s musings at the White House briefing this morning about whether disinfectant and UV rays could be used on people to fight the virus. It followed a briefing by Bill Bryan, who heads the science and technology directorate at the Department of Homeland Security, presenting information on how the virus reacts to heat, humidity and light on surfaces and when it is airborne. Donald Trump said the US may extend federal social distancing guidelines to the northern summer. It came as Congress approved a $484bn coronavirus relief package, taking to nearly $3tn the money pledged so far. Democratic senator, Elizabeth Warren, has revealed her older brother has died after contracting Covid-19. Ramadan begins on Friday with strict non-essential travel measures being enforced in Indonesia, the world\u2019s most populous Muslim country. Police will use road blocks to enforce measures. There will also be a domestic and international air and sea travel, with some exceptions. The ban on air travel will be in place until 1 June, officials said, with a ban on sea travel in force until 8 June. Elsewhere, Ramadan restrictions have been lifted, including in the UAE, Egypt and Algeria, where curfews have been slightly shortened. China has published its daily coronavirus figures, reporting just 6 new cases and no new deaths. In Japan, the mayor of Osaka has come under fire for suggesting men should do grocery shopping during the coronavirus outbreak because women are indecisive and \u201ctake a long time\u201d. Also in Japan, about 40 more crew on an Italian cruise ship docked in Nagasaki have tested positive for the new coronavirus, bringing the total to about 90. The Philippines has extended its lockdown in the capital Manila until 15 May stretching to eight weeks one of the world\u2019s strictest community quarantines to curb coronavirus infections. The New Zealand intensive care nurse thanked by British prime minister Boris Johnson has revealed he was treated like \u201cany other patient\u201d \u2013 and originally thought his praise was a prank. \u201cMy first reaction was that it was a joke. I thought my friends were playing a joke on me \u2026 it was totally out of the blue,\u201d Jenny McGee told TVNZ. Ecuador\u2019s health minister has said the country\u2019s coronavirus case total is twice as high as previously confirmed, as authorities added 11,000 new infections that resulted from delayed testing. The new cases will be added to the confirmed total of 11,183 infections. The country has registered 560 deaths. Tom Hanks has sent a letter and a Corona brand typewriter to an Australian boy who wrote to him about being bullied over his name, Corona. Corona De Vries, an eight-year-old from the Gold Coast in Queensland, wrote to the Hollywood star after he and his wife, Rita Wilson, spent more than two weeks in quarantine after testing positive for Covid-19. Hanks told the boy: \u201cYou\u2019ve got a friend in ME!\u201d \u2013 a line made famous in the music in the animated film Toy Story, where Hanks voiced the main character, Woody. The mayor of Japan\u2019s Osaka has come under fire for suggesting men should do grocery shopping during the coronavirus outbreak because women are indecisive and \u201ctake a long time\u201d, Agence France=Presse writes. Japan is under a state of emergency over the pandemic, and residents in some areas have been asked to shop less frequently and only send one family member out to get supplies to limit contact. Osaka Mayor Ichiro Matsui told reporters on Thursday that men should be entrusted with grocery runs because women \u201ctake a long time as they browse around and hesitate about this and that,\u201d Kyodo news agency reported. \u201cMen can snap up things they are told (to buy) and go, so I think it\u2019s good that they go shopping, avoiding human contact,\u201d the 56-year-old added. When challenged by a reporter, he acknowledged his remarks might be viewed as out-of-touch, but said they were true in his family. But online he was roundly condemned, with one Twitter user accusing him of being \u201cdisrespectful to women and men.\u201d Another dubbed his comment \u201cfull of prejudice against women,\u201d adding \u201cthere are indecisive men and nimble and sharp women.\u201d \u201cDoes he think (shoppers) like to take time?\u201d added a third. \u201cThey are thinking about menus and prices.\u201d Despite its highly educated female population, Japan ranked 121 out of 153 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2020 gender gap index, primarily because of its poor showing in political representation. Traditional gender roles are still deeply rooted in Japanese society and women are often still expected to take primary responsibility for childcare and domestic chores, even while holding down professional jobs. Australia\u2019s prime minister and chief medical officer have just given a coronavirus briefing. As Guardian Australia\u2019s Amy Remekis writes: Prof Brendan Murphy, the chief medical officer, is barely holding back incredulous laughter when asked if anyone should follow Donald Trump\u2019s latest suggestion about dealing with the coronavirus \u2013 which was basically injecting disinfectant (kill it with bleach! and yourself!) and blasting yourself with massive amounts of UV light (kill it by giving yourself cancer!). Murphy says: Um ... I would not ... I would caution against the injection of disinfection! They could be quite toxic to people. I wasn\u2019t privy to his comments, so I want to be very careful about commenting on something that I didn\u2019t hear myself. And ultraviolet light, look, I don\u2019t know the context in which he said it, so I really would need to study it before I could comment, thank you. The Philippines has extended its lockdown in the capital Manila until 15 May stretching to eight weeks one of the world\u2019s strictest community quarantines to curb coronavirus infections. The measures will be expanded to other regions with big outbreaks but modified in lower-risk areas, which would see a partial resumption of work, transport and commerce. Television broadcast images on Friday of a crisis panel meeting where Duterte had made the decision late the previous day. He even offered a reward of 50 million pesos ($986,000) to any Filipino who could create a vaccine. \u201cWe are all at risk, but do not increase the odds or chances of getting it,\u201d he said, warning against complacency. There country 6,981 infections and 462 deaths from coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins university figures. It is going to be a very different Ramadan this year due to the Covid-19 global pandemic and the social isolation laws, writes Heba Shaheed. For 1.8 billion Muslims around the world, the cultural traditions and customs of this religious month of fasting will have to be forsaken for the safety of the global community. As an introvert, I am really looking forward to spending this month focusing inwards, without the burden of social responsibility. Ramadan in 2020 means no communal gatherings in mosques for \u201ctarawih\u201d night prayers, no large \u201ciftar\u201d dinners with family and friends at sunset to break the day\u2019s fast,and, sadly, restrictions on celebrating Eid, the biggest social holiday for Muslims signalling the end of Ramadan. In this time of physical distancing, as Muslims we will be forced to reconnect to our God and the Qur\u2019an on a deeply intimate level. Interestingly enough, this is the authentic practice of Prophet Muhammad. He would isolate himself for days in a cave at the top of a mountain to introspect, reflect, worship and connect with God. During each of the 10 days of Ramadan, he was known to self-isolate in a spiritual seclusion practice known as \u201citik\u0101f\u201d. About 40 more crew on an Italian cruise ship docked in Nagasaki, southwestern Japan, have tested positive for the new coronavirus, public broadcaster NHK reported on Friday, bringing the total to about 90. The Costa Atlantica was taken into a shipyard in Nagasaki in late February after the COVID-19 pandemic scuttled plans for scheduled repairs in China. Nagasaki officials have said they hoped to complete testing of all 623 crew soon. \u2018The government has a cake problem!\u2019: New Zealand couple document luxury life in Covid-19 quarantine A couple in government-enforced quarantine at an Auckland airport hotel are documenting their experience of luxury lockdown \u2013 and causing envy worldwide with images of waffles delivered to the door, mini-fridges stocked full of cake, and escorted walks under stormy New Zealand skies. The Instagram blog thequarantinecanteen_nz has recorded 13 days of quarantine at the four-star Novotel, a lockdown measure introduced by the Jacinda Ardern government to stop the spread of coronavirus. The majority of those in quarantine are New Zealanders, as the country closed its borders to foreign nationals in mid-March. Most of New Zealand\u2019s 1,400 virus cases have links to overseas travel and arrivals, and the island country of five million people is now attempting to eliminate the virus with stringent lockdown rules that are among the toughest in the world. \u201cThe government has a cake problem\u201d the blog\u2019s authors have said, adding that the whole process has been \u201creally impressive\u201d. Breakfast on day 13 was poached eggs on a bean medley with chorizo sausage and porridge with spiced apple and almonds, while lunch on day seven was a mushroom frittata with buttered potatoes, a green salad with french dressing, a banana, a cheese scone with butter, hummingbird cake and a can of coke. Japan is taking drastic measure to discourage people from being outside, but cutting thousand of roses off their stems in public parks do deter public gatherings. Justin McCurry in Tokyo writes: Tiptoeing through the tulips or breathing in the scent of roses are popular spring rites in Japan, but there is concern that flower festivals could become the source of new infection clusters. This week workers began severing the buds of about 3,000 rose bushes at Yono park in Saitama, north of Tokyo, in an attempt to keep flower viewers away. The local government had already cancelled the annual rose festival, but the park is still open to the public, prompting the decision to rid the venue of its main attraction \u2013 180 varieties of rose bushes that reach their peak from around the middle of May. \u201cIt\u2019s very painful, but we decided to take action after looking at the situation in other cities,\u201d a local official told the Mainichi newspaper, adding that it would take about a week to remove all the buds. You can read Justin\u2019s full story below. The New Zealand intensive care nurse thanked by British prime minister Boris Johnson has revealed he was treated like \u201cany other patient\u201d \u2013 and originally thought his praise was a prank, writes our NZ correspondent Eleanor Ainge Roy. Jenny McGee said she had not been told of the public praise in advance. \u201cMy first reaction was that it was a joke. I thought my friends were playing a joke on me \u2026 it was totally out of the blue,\u201d she told TVNZ. The 35-year-old \u2013 who has worked as an intensive care nurse for 10 years, five of those as a sister \u2013 highlighted just how ill Johnson was, saying: \u201cWe take it very seriously who comes into intensive care, these patients who come into us it\u2019s a very scary thing for them so we don\u2019t take it lightly. And he absolutely needed to be there.\u201d Johnson thanked \u201cJenny from Invercargill\u201d on his release from hospital on 13 April, crediting her and another sister with saving his life after he contracted Covid-19 and became severely ill. Johnson said two nurses sat by his bed for 48 hours, nursing him through the darkest time when \u201cthings could have gone either way\u201d. McGee also revealed the toll the coronavirus restrictions were taking. \u201cPeople are dying without their loved ones around \u2026 we can be there to hold their hand but it should be their family and that\u2019s heartbreaking to watch,\u201d she said. McGee said she and Johnson talked about New Zealand, and her home town of Invercargill \u2013 the country\u2019s most southern major town, famous for rugby, oysters and farming . \u201cHe was interested to know about Invercargill,\u201d she said.

The boy wrote to Hanks saying: \u201cI heard on the news you and your wife had caught the coronavirus,\u201d Channel 7 reported. \u201cAre you ok?\u201d He said he loved his name but people at school called him the coronavirus, which made him \u201csad and angry\u201d. \u201cYour letter made my wife and I feel so wonderful!\u201d Hanks replied in a letter typed on a Corona typewriter which he had taken to the Gold Coast. \u201cYou know, you are the only person I\u2019ve ever known to have the name Corona \u2013 like the ring around the sun, a crown,\u201d the double Oscar winner wrote to the boy. \u201cI thought this typewriter would suit you,\u201d an image of the letter showed. \u201cAsk a grown up how it works. And use it to write me back.\u201d Hanks hand wrote at the end: \u201cP.S. You got a friend in ME!\u201d You can see our full story here: The biggest health crisis in a generation and the enforced isolation of lockdowns is taking not just a physical toll on people but also affecting mental health. The Guardian\u2019s John Crace discusses his mental health challenges and public health specialist Dr Antonis Kousoulis tells Anushka Asthana what may help, on the Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast. As I mentioned earlier, Donald Trump stunned viewers of his daily White House briefing by suggesting that people could receive injections of disinfectant to cure the coronavirus, a notion one medical expert described as \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith in Washington writes ... At Thursday\u2019s White House coronavirus task force briefing, the US president discussed new government research on how the virus reacts to different temperatures, climates and surfaces. \u201cAnd then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOne minute! And is there a way we can do something, by an injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it\u2019d be interesting to check that. So, that you\u2019re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me.\u201d Dr Deborah Birx, the task force response coordinator, remained silent. But social media erupted in hilarity and outrage at the president, who has a record of defying science and also floated the idea of treating patients\u2019 bodies with ultraviolet (UV) light. Several doctors warned the public against injecting disinfectant or using UV light. Robert Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and a former labor secretary, tweeted: \u201cTrump\u2019s briefings are actively endangering the public\u2019s health. Boycott the propaganda. Listen to the experts. And please don\u2019t drink disinfectant.\u201d You can read David\u2019s full story below: Here\u2019s something to brighten the coronavirus gloom ... Getty photographers Cameron Spencer and Ryan Pierse have taken to the skies to capture the sights of Sydney \u2013 Australia\u2019s biggest city \u2013 during the Covid-19 pandemic. New South Wales residents can be fined for leaving their homes unless they have a reasonable excuse. The laws allow for fines of up to $11,000 or six months\u2019 imprisonment for those who flout them. You can see the full series of images here, but these are some of my favourites. The Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, has threatened to declare martial law if communist rebels disrupted the flow of relief goods for Filipinos impacted by the coronavirus lockdown restrictions, and asked his military to be ready. \u201cI am now warning everybody, I am putting notice to the armed forces and police. I might declare martial law and there will be no turning back,\u201d he said at the beginning of the meeting on the extension of coronavirus containment measures on Friday. Duterte has long been at odds with the New People\u2019s Army, worsened by repeated breakdowns in a peace process he launched at the beginning of his presidency. China\u2019s ambassador to the UK has strongly rebuked the US for suggesting Beijing was not truthful about the coronavirus, saying Washington should not seek to bully the China in a manner reminiscent of the 19th century European colonial wars, Reuters reports. \u201cI hear quite a lot of this speculation, this disinformation about China covering up, about China hiding something - this is not true,\u201d Liu Xiaoming said. \u201cThe Chinese government was transparent and very quick to share data.\u201d His comments were targeted at a growing number of legal claims over the virus, primarily aimed at China. \u201cSome other country \u2013 their local courts sued China \u2013 it is absurd,\u201d he said. \u201cSome politicians, some people, want to play at being the world\u2019s policeman \u2013 this is not the era of gunboat diplomacy, this is not the era when China was a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society.\u201d \u201cThese people still live in the old days \u2013 they think they can bully China, think they can bully the world,\u201d Liu said. \u201cChina is not an enemy of the United States \u2013 if they regard China as an enemy they chose the wrong target.\u201d You can read the Guardian\u2019s full story below. China has published its daily coronavirus figures, reporting just 6 new cases and no new deaths. Indonesia \u2013 the world\u2019s most populous Muslin nation \u2013 has stopped non-essential travel between provinces to contain coronavirus during Ramadan, with police using road blocks to enforce the measure. The ban will include domestic and international air and sea travel, with some exceptions, Transport Ministry officials said. The ban on air travel will be in place until 1 June, officials said, with a ban on sea travel in force until 8 June. Cargo transport is exempted from the bans. Other exceptions would include flights to repatriate Indonesian and foreign citizens, as well as travel by state officials, diplomatic staff and representatives of international organisations, the officials said. Indonesia has 7,775 cases of Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins university, and 647 deaths, but with a population of 268 million people, there are fears of widespread infections. Egypt will ease its coronavirus lockdown for the holy fasting month of Ramadan by allowing more businesses to reopen and shortening a night-time curfew, the prime minister said on Thursday. Starting on Friday, the curfew will start at 9pm instead of the previous 8pm and run until 6am. Shopping malls and businesses will be allowed to open on weekends, but will still be required to close at 5pm. Mosques will remain closed and any public religious gatherings will still be banned. Egypt has reported 232 new cases of Covid-19, including 11 deaths, bringing the country\u2019s total to 3,891 infections and 287 deaths. The United Arab Emirates has shortened a nationwide coronavirus curfew by two hours to now run daily from 10pm-6am (instead of from 8pm). In Dubai, one of the Gulf country\u2019s seven emirates and which has been under a 24-hour curfew since 26 March, authorities said they lifted the curfew from 6am-10pm. A statement from Dubai\u2019s media office said cafes and restaurants have been allowed to resume business, and shopping malls to be reopened partially from noon to 10pm, but with a maximum capacity of 30%. Public transportation services including subways will resume on Sunday and companies will be allowed to have 30% of their staff in offices, although daily temperature testing is required for employees. Mosques, cinemas and playgrounds will remain closed until further notice. The Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins on Friday, with some countries easing restrictions and others tightening them. I\u2019ll take you through a few of the measures in the next few posts: Algeria will shorten a night curfew and lift a full lockdown for a province near the capital Algiers, the prime minister\u2019s office said on Thursday. The Blida province south of Algiers will be replaced with a curfew from 2pm-7am, while a 3pm-7am curfew in nine provinces, including Algiers, will be shortened to run from 5pm-7am. The government made no changes to the confinement measures in the remaining provinces where a 7pm-7am curfew has been imposed for weeks. Algeria has so far reported 3,007 cases of the novel coronavirus, with 407 deaths and 1,355 recoveries. During the briefing, Trump was joined by Bill Bryan, who heads the science and technology directorate at the Department of Homeland Security. Bryan presented more information on how the virus reacts to heat, humidity and light on surfaces and when it is airborne. He said the virus survived best indoors, in dry conditions. UV rays and hotter, more humid temperatures seem to cut down the half-life of the virus ...but was at pains to say the research is ongoing. After that Trump wondered whether UV light therapy or disinfectants could be a way to treat people, something that was dismissed by medical professionals, including his own coronavirus task force co-ordinator, Deborah Birx. Medical professionals have since taken to Twitter to warn people to disregard the president\u2019s comments. During the briefing, the president evaded questions about Rick Bright, the vaccine expert who says he was removed from his post after resisting the president\u2019s push to use hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for coronavirus without proper vetting and testing. Bright said he would file a whistleblower complaint, after being reassigned from his post overseeing the development of a coronavirus vaccine. You can read the full story on Bright below: The spending package was voted through during President Trump\u2019s daily press briefing during which he said federal social distancing guidelines could be extended through to the American summer. \u201cWe may, we may go beyond that - we\u2019ll have to see where it is. Until we feel it\u2019s safe, we\u2019re going to be extending,\u201d Trump said, in a change of tone from previous briefings where he has pushed strongly for the country to reopen. The president said he was \u201cnot happy about Brian Kemp\u201d, referring to the governor of Georgia, who has moved ahead with a plan to reopen businesses despite criticisms from the president and other Republican and Democratic lawmakers. \u201cI don\u2019t want this thing to flare up because you\u2019re deciding to do something that\u2019s not in the guidelines,\u201d Trump said. If you\u2019re just joining us, the big news in the past hour or so is that the US Congress has passed a huge spending package to help deal with the coronavirus. The package takes US spending during the crisis to nearly $3tr dollars. It will rush new relief to employers and hospitals buckling under the strain of a pandemic that has claimed almost 50,000 American lives and a staggering one in six US jobs. Anchoring the bill is the Trump administration\u2019s $250bn funding request to replenish a fund to help small- and medium-size businesses with payroll, rent and other expenses. The payroll program provides forgivable loans so businesses can continue paying workers while forced to stay closed for social distancing and stay-at-home orders. It also contains $100bn demanded by Democrats for hospitals and a nationwide testing program, along with a $60bn set-aside for small banks and an alternative network of community development banks that focus on development in urban neighbourhoods and rural areas ignored by many lenders. Theres also $60bn for small-business loans and grants delivered through the Small Business Administrations existing disaster aid program. It came as it was reported another 4.4 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week as layoffs sweep the economy. Over the last five weeks, roughly 26 million people have filed for jobless aid. Good morning and welcome to our live global coverage of coronavirus developments, with me Alison Rourke. Before we get started, here are the top stories making news at the moment: The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases around the world is at 2,699,338, while 188,437 deaths have been recorded, according to Johns Hopkins University. US Congress has passed a $480bn coronavirus aid package to help small business. It comes as President Trump says federal social distancing guidelines could be extended to the summer. Democratic senator, Elizabeth Warren, has revealed her older brother has died after contracting Covid-19. Indonesia has stoped non-essential travel between provinces to contain coronavirus during Ramadan. Algeria will ease confinement measures from the first day of the holy month of Ramadan on Friday by shortening a night curfew and lifting a full lockdown for a province near the capital Algiers, the prime minister\u2019s office said on Thursday. Remdesivir, a drug thought to be one of the best prospects for treating Covid-19, failed to have any effect in the first full trial, it has been revealed. German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, has said the coronavirus pandemic is \u201cstill at the beginning\u201d and parts her country may be rushing their exit from lockdown, as divided EU leaders clashed at a video summit over a desperately needed Europe-wide recovery fund. Ecuador\u2019s health minister has said the country\u2019s coronavirus case total is twice as high as previously confirmed, as authorities added 11,000 new infections that resulted from delayed testing. The new cases will be added to the confirmed total of 11,183 infections. The country has registered 560 deaths. Four people in a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon have tested positive for the coronavirus, a health official said, bringing total cases in the settlement to five. Residents of the Wavel camp in the eastern Bekaa Valley were tested after a Palestinian refugee from Syria was admitted to hospital in Beirut with symptoms. The 2020 European Athletics Championships, due to be held in Paris at the end of August, have been cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic, organisers have announced. A number of major sporting events, including Wimbledon and the Open, will not be held this year. You can get in touch with me via email: alison.rourke@theguardian.co.uk",

Capacity for performing wellness checks on vulnerable residents will also be expanded. </p> \n  <p>Local agencies will begin distributing criteria on who qualifies for the program, but of highest priority are seniors who live below the poverty line and those with compromised immune systems. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThese programs will provide older, vulnerable Californians with access to nutritious meals in the safety of their homes and the opportunity to connect with someone who can listen to their concerns and make sure their needs are met.

Six current and former Trump advisors, including Miller, have ties to the group. </p> \n  <p>In a private call this week, Miller appeared to try and maintain restrictionists\u2019 favor by saying the ban was part of a long-term vision. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/stephen-miller-audio-immigration-coronavirus/2020/04/24/8eaf59ba-8631-11ea-9728-c74380d9d410_story.html\">According to the Washington Post</a>, Miller said of the executive order: \u201cIt is vital, it is necessary, it is patriotic and it deserves the full-throated support of everybody on this call.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The Trump administration has already made dramatic changes to immigration in the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/15/invisible-wall-trump-policies-have-curbed-immigration\">through policies big and small</a>. So, the vision is already in place. </p> \n  <p>This is why the ban, with its exceptions, was interpreted as a largely political move. To have it be criticized by the people it is meant to appease is a problem for Miller above all others. </p> \n  <p>In addition to the call, the far-right website <strong>Breitbart News</strong> had an exclusive story today saying the original ban was more expansive.

It\u2019s amazing the work they do.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But returning to the effect of sunlight, he added: \u201cI\u2019d like them now to look as it pertains to the human body. Not just sitting on a railing or sitting on a wall. I\u2019d like to look as it pertains because maybe there\u2019s something there. They have to work with \u2014 I\u2019m not a doctor. They have to work with their doctors. But maybe there is something to light, and the human body, and helping people that are dying.\u201d</p> \n  <p>One more time, Mason gamely pressed: \u201cJust to clarify, you\u2019re not encouraging Americans to inject disinfectant?\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump: \u201cNo. Of course not. Interior-wise, it was said sarcastically. It was put in the form of a question to a group of extraordinarily hostile people, namely the fake news media.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Mason answered: \u201cSome doctors felt you needed to clarify that after your comments.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump said: \u201cOf course, all they had to do was see just \u2014 you know the way it was asked. I was looking at you.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Mason shot back: \u201cNo, you weren\u2019t, sir. I wasn\u2019t there yesterday.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Weijia Jiang</strong> of <strong>CBS News </strong>pointed out that Trump had been looking at Birx. Changing his story, Trump claimed: \u201cI was looking at Bill. I was looking at the doctor. I was looking at some of the reporters. I don\u2019t know if you were there. Were you there? </p> \n  <p>Jiang said: \u201cI was there and I watched you ask her.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump, who has clashed with Jiang in the briefing room, added: \u201cYou were there. You were there. You I never forget.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The jumbled, inaccurate assertions are likely to have the opposite of the desired effect, only deepening concerns about Trump\u2019s embrace of flawed science that could endanger public health.</p> \n  <p><strong>Scott Gottlieb</strong>, Trump\u2019s former <strong>Food and Drug Administration</strong> director, told <strong>CNBC</strong>: </p> \n  <p>\u201cI think we need to speak very clearly. There\u2019s no circumstance under which you should take a disinfectant or inject a disinfectant for the treatment of anything, and certainly not the treatment of coronavirus.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no circumstance in which that\u2019s appropriate, and it can cause death and very adverse outcomes, so people should not be doing that if that was an impression that was left by any of the reporting around comments that have been made in the last 24 hours.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea33b128f08e05690dc4319\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T19:19:03.758Z\">8.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Navy leader recommends reinstating fired captain</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Officials with the US Navy recommended the reinstatement of the commander of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt.</p> \n  <p>Roosevelt was fired after he pleaded for help with a coronavirus outbreak onboard.

Now disinfectant or doing this maybe on the hands would work. I was asking the question of the gentleman who was there yesterday, Bill [Bill Bryan, the acting homeland security undersecretary for science and technology], because when they say that something will last three to four hours or six hours, but if sun is out, or if they use disinfectant, it goes away in less than a minute. Did you hear about this yesterday?</p> \n  <p> POTUS: When I was asking a sarcastic \u2014 a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside, but it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to a reporter.</p> \n  <p> Reporter: But you were asking your medical experts to look into it.</p> \n  <p> POTUS: To look into whether or not sun \u2014 and disinfectant on the hands \u2014 but whether or not sun can help us. Because, I mean he came in yesterday and he said they\u2019ve done a big study. This is a study. This isn\u2019t where he hasn\u2019t done it. This is where they\u2019ve come in with a final report that sun has a massive impact negatively on this virus. In other words, it does not live well with humidity and it doesn\u2019t live well with sun, sunlight, heat. It doesn\u2019t live well with heat and sun and and disinfectant. And that\u2019s what I brought up, and I thought that was clear.</p> \n  <p> Jeff Mason [Reuters journalist]: Just to follow up on the comments from yesterday you said you were being sarcastic, but some people may have misunderstood you. Do you want to just clarify?</p> \n  <p>POTUS: I wish they [\u2026]</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: Do you want to clarify to Americans if you don\u2019t want people to think that?</p> \n  <p>POTUS. Yes. I do think that disinfectant on the hands could have a very good effect. Now, Bill is going back to check that in the laboratory. You know, it\u2019s an amazing laboratory, by the way. It\u2019s amazing the work they do. So, he\u2019s going to check because a hard surface. This is a hard surface I guess maybe depending on whose hand you\u2019re talking about, right? But this is a hard surface and disinfectant, disinfectant has an unbelievable \u2014 it wipes it out. You saw it? Sun and heat, and humidity and you wipe it out. And this is from tests \u2014 they\u2019ve been doing these tests for a number of months. And the result \u2014 so then I said, \u2018Well, how do we do it inside the body or even outside the body with the hands and disinfectant I think would work.\u2019 He thinks it would work. When you use it when you\u2019re doing your hands. I guess that\u2019s one of the reasons they say wash your hands, but whether it\u2019s washing hands or disinfectant on your hands, it\u2019s very good. So, they\u2019re going to start looking at that. And there is a way of, you know, if light \u2014 if sun, sun itself that sun has a tremendous impact on or kills it like in one \u2014 it goes from what was it? Hours to like one minute instead.</p> \n  <p>So, I said you got to go back and look, but I\u2019d like them now to look as it pertains to the human body. Not just sitting on a railing or sitting on a wall. I\u2019d like to look as it pertains because maybe there\u2019s something there. They have to work with \u2014 I\u2019m not a doctor. They have to work with their doctors. but maybe there is something to light, and the human body, and helping people that are dying.</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: Just to clarify: You\u2019re not encouraging Americans to inject disinfectant?</p> \n  <p> POTUS: No. Of course not\u2026It was said sarcastically. It was put in the form of a question to a group of extraordinary hostile people. Namely, the fake news media.</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: Some doctors felt you needed to clarify that after your comments.</p> \n  <p>POTUS: Of course, all they had to do was see just \u2014 you know the way it was asked. I was looking at you.</p> \n  <p> Jeff Mason: No you weren\u2019t sir. I wasn\u2019t there yesterday.</p> \n  <p> Weijia Jiang: You were looking at Dr. Birx.</p> \n  <p> POTUS: What\u2019s that?</p> \n  <p> Weijia Jiang: You were looking at Dr. Birx.</p> \n  <p> POTUS: I was looking at Bill.

Trump gave a short-lived press conference, apparently part of a new strategy in which he makes fewer and shorter appearances to the public \u2013 a departure from his daily pressers. Trump stressed in the presser that the economy would recover from coronavirus, touting recent stimulus checks.

Wealthy Americans and corporations stand to benefit more than others from the economic rescue package, a New York Times report showed. \u201cMany of the tax benefits in the stimulus are \u2018just shoveling money to rich people\u2019,\u201d Victor Fleischer, a tax law professor at the University of California, Irvine, told the Times. One tax break in the bill, for example, only applies to companies with $25m in annual receipts. Another change lets people in households earning at least $500,000 a year \u2013 the top 1% of American taxpayers \u2013 deduct even more of their businesses\u2019 losses from any winnings they reaped in the stock market, sharply reducing what they owe in capital gains taxes. Apparently Trump\u2019s surprisingly short coronavirus briefing was part of a new policy. Trump may stop appearing daily at press conferences, according to a new Axios report. Advisers in the White House have told Trump he may be \u201coverexposed\u201d, causing him to sink behind Joe Biden in the polls. From the report: Another source close to the deliberations said there simply isn\u2019t enough new material to justify Trump appearing before the press every day. \u201cI mean, you wonder how we got to the point where you\u2019re talking about injecting disinfectant?\u201d the source wondered aloud. Well, that was a brief briefing. Donald Trump made opening remarks and handed over to Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drugs Administration, and Mike Pence, but then fled without taking questions. The obvious conclusion is he is still smarting from Thursday night\u2019s effort, when he wondered aloud if injecting disinfectant into patients might be a good idea and was duly hammered by doctors, politicians and even disinfectant makers. White House coronavirus task force briefings are often two-hour prime time marathons but on Friday Trump turned on his heel as reporters shouted questions in vain. Perhaps it was a fit of pique, or perhaps revenge is a dish best served cold. He may also have reached a tipping point with advisers warning that the briefings are now hurting him more than they help. Right on cue, minutes later, the Axios website reported that Trump plans to \u201cpare back\u201d his coronavirus press conferences, according to four of its sources. Next week, it said, \u201che may stop appearing daily and make shorter appearances when he does\u201d. One other thought. What Trump might have delivered on Friday night was a sombre, landmark speech recognising that more than 50,000 of his countrymen have now been lost to the coronavirus. He did not. Political reporters are floored by the brevity of today\u2019s White House briefing, which clocked in at less than 30 mins (others have lasted hours), and lacked the usual Q&amp;A with reporters. Trump\u2019s quick escape comes as the president faces a huge backlash over comments he made at yesterday\u2019s briefing, where he mused on whether disinfectant or sunlight could be used internally to treat coronavirus. Today the president has attempted to backtrack, claiming his comments were merely \u201csarcasm\u201d. As the Guardian\u2019s Poppy Noor writes ... Now, this might cause one to question whether Trump knows the definition of sarcasm which, according to Merriam-Webster, is \u201ca sharp and often satirical or ironic utterance designed to cut or give pain\u201d. The thought of the president baiting journalists to see \u201chow they would react\u201d in a time of unprecedented crisis is unsettling, but it is nothing new: Trump has mastered the art saying one thing and retracting or changing his statement when public opinion doesn\u2019t follow. Trump walked off stage quickly without taking any questions, unusual for the president in these recent press conferences where he often spars with reporters. Mike Pence now gives a nationwide update on the coronavirus pandemic and how states are responding. Various state governors have \u201cmade progress\u201d in testing, the vice-president said. Many states are putting forth new technology to trace and treat coronavirus. Governor Kim Reynolds in Iowa has launched testiowa.com, a location to screen people with coronavirus symptoms and connect them with tests. Governor Mike Parsons of Missouri launched a website to list companies repurposing their manufacturing resources to make medical supplies. The state of Utah has launched a \u201chealthy together\u201d app to find testing locations. \u201cI believe the day will soon come when we will heal our land,\u201d Pence said. Trump praised the FDA extensively on Friday, despite the administration just today urging extreme caution on hydroxychloroquine. The FDA commissioner, Stephen Hahn, also addressed concerns about inaccurate coronavirus antibody tests on the market. He said only four have been approved, but did not say how many were publicly available despite not being approved. Now US food and drug commissioner, Stephen Hahn, is speaking. He said coronavirus tests from 65 companies have been approved. Meanwhile, the government is working with more than 400 companies developing additional tests for the coronavirus, and coronavirus antibodies. In addition to tests, the FDA is looking into additional types of coronavirus treatments. \u201cWe are leaving no stone unturned in finding treatments for Covid-19,\u201d he said. Trump has been criticised for touting unproven treatments for Covid-19 including hydroxychloroquine \u2013 despite a near total lack of scientific study on the safety and efficacy in coronavirus patients. Trump quickly pivots to a focus on the economy, saying that he spoke with the Apple executive Tim Cook who said the market is \u201cgoing to be a \u2018V\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s going to go quickly back upward\u201d. The president said more than 80 million Americans have already received their stimulus checks and that it will aid in an economic recovery. \u201cOver the last three years we built the strongest economy and the most successful country the world has ever seen greatest economy, the world has ever seen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will rebuild that economy, our economy in the not too distant future.\u201d The press conference begins with Trump claiming \u201cvery significant progress\u201d in the fight against the coronavirus. He said 18 states now show a decline in a number of positive tests in the last seven days. Hello readers, Kari Paul here hopping on the blog for the day. Stay tuned for more updates and, later, a live fact check of Donald Trump\u2019s presser. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve covered so far today: The coronavirus likely reached New York from Europe Meanwhile, Trump signed the latest coronavirus bill and claimed his disinfectant suggestion was sarcasm Trump owes tens of millions to the Bank of China At least 18 members of a naval ship tested positive for Covid-19 FDA warned doctors against prescribing hydroxychloroquine But the VA intends to keep using it The mother of Biden\u2019s accuser allegedly reported the incident in a call to Larry King Navy leaders recommended reinstating Captain Brett Crozier The US deficit is expected to reach $3.7tn USPS may need to quadruple its prices or losing funding Stay tuned for more on the live blog with Kari Paul taking over. The US Department of Veterans Affairs confirmed it will continue using an anti-malarial drug previously touted by Donald Trump to treat Covid-19. VA officials told CNN said it would still administer hydroxychloroquine in ways \u201cconsistent with current FDA guidance.\u201d Earlier Friday, the US Food and Drug Administration warned the drug is not proven to work and could cause deadly side effects. \u201cWhile clinical trials are ongoing to determine the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for Covid-19,\u201d the FDA said. \u201cThere are known side effects of these medications that should be considered.\u201d VA spokeswoman Christina Noel said hospitals use the drug \u201cto treat Covid-19 in cases where Veteran patients and their providers determine it is medically necessary.\u201d New York man charged with supply hoarding A retailer was charged with hoarding tons of disposable masks, surgical gowns and hand sanitizer in a Long Island warehouse and selling the items at huge markups, according to federal prosecutors. From the AP: Amardeep \u201cBobby\u201d Singh, 45, was charged with violating the Defense Production Act of 1950 in what authorities described as the first such prosecution during the coronavirus pandemic. Singh is expected to surrender to authorities next week in the case around what is known as personal protective equipment (PPE), which has become a hot commodity during the outbreak. Singh\u2019s attorney, Bradley Gerstman, called the charges \u201cmostly fiction\u201d and said the complaint misstated his client\u2019s costs. \u201cIf selling PPE goods is improper or criminal, then a lot of people need to go to jail,\u201d Gerstman said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe Defense Production Act is wildly vague, and I don\u2019t think this would pass muster on any appellate level. I think this statute would be struck down as null and void.\u201d Donald Trump issued an executive order making it illegal to hoard medical supplies or sell PPE at inflated prices last month. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran with more on California\u2019s new food program: California is launching a program it hopes will feed seniors and get restaurant workers back on the job. Speaking from a noon press conference, California governor Gavin Newsom said the program was of particular importance to the 1.2 m seniors across the Golden State who live alone. Capacity for performing wellness checks on vulnerable residents will also be expanded. Local agencies will begin distributing criteria on who qualifies for the program, but of highest priority are seniors who live below the poverty line and those with compromised immune systems. \u201cThese programs will provide older, vulnerable Californians with access to nutritious meals in the safety of their homes and the opportunity to connect with someone who can listen to their concerns and make sure their needs are met. We are all in this together and we will continue to support older Californians who are more at risk during this public health emergency\u201d Newsom said in a press release. The program, funded by the state and by FEMA, will provide three meals a day, seven days a week, with a daily cash value of up to $66. Newsom said the program could also mean relief for the restaurant industry and its workers. State and local governments will select which restaurants will be included in the program. \u201cThis will allow for restaurants to start rehiring people or keep people employed\u201d, he said. Meantime, with warm weather expected in California over the weekend, Newsom reminded Californians that it\u2019s not yet time to greenlight the reopening of wide sections of society. Yesterday California tallied 93 deaths, and the number of confirmed coronavirus cases ticked up 5% in the past 24 hours. Hospitalizations and admissions to ICUs, on the other hand, stayed largely flat. California is a state but many parts, Newsom said, and the state will consider regional realities \u2014 like the number of cases and hospital capacity should outbreaks resurface \u2014 when deciding to ease stay-at-home orders. In recent days, protestors have challenged stay-at-home orders in various states, including California. But Newsom said the decision to modify restrictions will be based only on facts. \u201cWe don\u2019t debate dates. We are only guided by indicators\u201d, he said. At least one person believes the president\u2019s \u2018sarcasm\u2019 Reporters at Breitbart News want readers to know that Donald Trump wasn\u2019t encouraging Americans to inject themselves with disinfectant. But that doesn\u2019t appear to be going over well: Donald Trump confirmed to the White House press pool, on Friday, reports that the administration is leveraging funding of the US Postal Service, saying it should quadruple its package delivery prices, otherwise he will stop congressionally approved funding. \u201cIf they don\u2019t raise the price, I\u2019m not signing anything,\u201d he said. The terms that the Trump administration appear to be weighing the right to dictate package rates and select set collective bargaining policies. From the Post: Trump has railed for years against what he sees as mismanagement at the Postal Service, which he argues has been exploited by e-commerce sites such as Amazon, and has sought to change how much the agency charges for the delivery of packages. Under the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus relief passed last month, the Treasury was authorized to loan $10 billion to the USPS, which says it may not be able to make payroll and continue mail service uninterrupted past September. [Steve] Mnuchin rejected a bipartisan Senate proposal to give the Postal Service a bailout amid the negotiations over that legislation. The Guardian\u2019s Amanda Holpuch with more on the US immigration ban announced this week: Stephen Miller, the senior White House advisor who has promoted white supremacist views and racist conspiracy theories, is insisting the immigration ban announced this week is part of a longer-term vision for the country as anti-immigrant groups criticize its limited scope. The amount of exceptions carved into the ban has left some of Donald Trump\u2019s most consistent supporters, right-wing anti-immigrant groups, complaining about the ban. On Thursday, the anti-immigration group Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) sent a critical letter to the president. Six current and former Trump advisors, including Miller, have ties to the group. In a private call this week, Miller appeared to try and maintain restrictionists\u2019 favor by saying the ban was part of a long-term vision. According to the Washington Post, Miller said of the executive order: \u201cIt is vital, it is necessary, it is patriotic and it deserves the full-throated support of everybody on this call.\u201d The Trump administration has already made dramatic changes to immigration in the US, through policies big and small. So, the vision is already in place. This is why the ban, with its exceptions, was interpreted as a largely political move. To have it be criticized by the people it is meant to appease is a problem for Miller above all others. In addition to the call, the far-right website Breitbart News had an exclusive story today saying the original ban was more expansive. The story also attempted to move blame for the exceptions away from Trump and some of his advisors. \u201cIt is unclear how closely Trump reviewed this draft before signing the final executive order,\u201d Breitbart said. \u201cThe contents indicate administration staffers with views more in tune with the president\u2019s economic nationalist agenda were involved in its drafting.\u201d Miller has had a close relationship with the website in the past and late last year, a former reporter there leaked her 900 email correspondence with the president\u2019s advisor. The emails revealed Miller\u2019s endorsement for white supremacist views and promotion of racist conspiracy theories. The US Congressional Budget Office announced Friday that a looming recession caused by coronavirus pandemic and a spike in government spending will nearly quadruple the government\u2019s budget deficit to $3.7 trillion. From the AP: The 2020 budget deficit will explode after four coronavirus response bills passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump promise to pile more than $2 trillion onto the $24.6 trillion national debt in just the remaining six months of the current fiscal year, according to the CBO\u2019s report. That\u2019s more than double the deficit record set during President Barack Obama\u2019s first year in office. The CBO predicted a devastating hit to the economy this quarter at a rate of decline of 40 percent, accompanied by a 14 percent unemployment rate. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith has a short wrap on the updated disinfectant debate that just took place in the Oval Office: As a clean-up attempt, it could have gone better. Donald Trump tried on Friday to justify dangerous comments about using disinfectant as a potential cure for coronavirus, falsely claiming that he was \u201casking a question sarcastically to reporters\u201d. The US president provoked uproar at a White House coronavirus task force briefing the previous evening by suggesting that doctors study the idea of people receiving injections of disinfectant to combat the virus. Medical experts, politicians and even disinfectant makers denounced the suggestion and warned the public against consuming the product. On Friday, even as the US death toll topped 50,000, Trump tried to make what critics saw as a desperate and dishonest u-turn. \u201cI was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen,\u201d the president, sitting at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, told reporters as he signed emergency funding legislation.\u201d \u201cWhen I was asking a sarcastic \u2013 a very sarcastic question \u2013 to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside, but it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to a reporter.\u201d A video of the briefings demonstrates otherwise. When Trump posed the question about the efficacy of disinfectant injections, he had turned to his right and was looking in the direction of Bill Bryan, the acting homeland security undersecretary for science and technology, and Deborah Birx, the coronavirus task force coordinator. Reuters reporter Jeff Mason asked if Trump wanted to clarify that he was being sarcastic and ensure no one misunderstood him. He replied: \u201cYes. I do think that disinfectant on the hands could have a very good effect. Now, Bill is going back to check that in the laboratory. You know, it\u2019s an amazing laboratory, by the way. It\u2019s amazing the work they do.\u201d But returning to the effect of sunlight, he added: \u201cI\u2019d like them now to look as it pertains to the human body. Not just sitting on a railing or sitting on a wall. I\u2019d like to look as it pertains because maybe there\u2019s something there. They have to work with \u2014 I\u2019m not a doctor. They have to work with their doctors. But maybe there is something to light, and the human body, and helping people that are dying.\u201d One more time, Mason gamely pressed: \u201cJust to clarify, you\u2019re not encouraging Americans to inject disinfectant?\u201d Trump: \u201cNo. Of course not. Interior-wise, it was said sarcastically. It was put in the form of a question to a group of extraordinarily hostile people, namely the fake news media.\u201d Mason answered: \u201cSome doctors felt you needed to clarify that after your comments.\u201d Trump said: \u201cOf course, all they had to do was see just \u2014 you know the way it was asked. I was looking at you.\u201d Mason shot back: \u201cNo, you weren\u2019t, sir. I wasn\u2019t there yesterday.\u201d Weijia Jiang of CBS News pointed out that Trump had been looking at Birx. Changing his story, Trump claimed: \u201cI was looking at Bill. I was looking at the doctor. I was looking at some of the reporters. I don\u2019t know if you were there. Were you there? Jiang said: \u201cI was there and I watched you ask her.\u201d Trump, who has clashed with Jiang in the briefing room, added: \u201cYou were there. You were there. You I never forget.\u201d The jumbled, inaccurate assertions are likely to have the opposite of the desired effect, only deepening concerns about Trump\u2019s embrace of flawed science that could endanger public health. Scott Gottlieb, Trump\u2019s former Food and Drug Administration director, told CNBC: \u201cI think we need to speak very clearly. There\u2019s no circumstance under which you should take a disinfectant or inject a disinfectant for the treatment of anything, and certainly not the treatment of coronavirus.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no circumstance in which that\u2019s appropriate, and it can cause death and very adverse outcomes, so people should not be doing that if that was an impression that was left by any of the reporting around comments that have been made in the last 24 hours.\u201d Officials with the US Navy recommended the reinstatement of the commander of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt was fired after he pleaded for help with a coronavirus outbreak onboard. Reuters reports the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the recommendation to reinstate Captain Brett Crozier was made during a meeting on between Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Navy leaders. The decision is still pending Esper\u2019s approval. Reporters for The Intercept obtained new evidence that appeared to support accusations from former congressional staffer Tara Reade. Reade has made allegations of sexual harassment and assault related to her former boss, then-Delaware senator Joe Biden, including a claim that she told her mother about the encounter. Reade had maintained that she told her mother, close friend, and brother about both the harassment. Her mother passed away in 2016. From the Intercept: In interviews with The Intercept, Reade also mentioned that her mother had made a phone call to \u201cLarry King Live\u201d on CNN, during which she made reference to her daughter\u2019s experience on Capitol Hill. Reade couldn\u2019t remember the date or the year of the phone call, and King didn\u2019t include the names of callers on his show. After the podcast aired, a listener managed to find the call and sent it to The Intercept. On August 11, 1993, King aired a program titled, \u201cWashington\u2013 \u2018The Cruelest City on Earth\u2019?\u201d Toward the end of the program, he introduces a caller dialing in from San Luis Obispo, California. Congressional records list August 1993 as Reade\u2019s last month of employment with Biden\u2019s Senate office, and, according to property records, Reade\u2019s mother, Jeanette Altimus, was living in San Luis Obispo County. Biden, throughout a spokesperson, continued to deny the allegation. The US Food and Drug Administration released an alert Friday warning doctors against prescribing the malaria drug Donald Trump touted for treating the coronavirus, citing reports of sometimes fatal heart side effects among patients. From the AP: The warning comes as doctors at a New York hospital published a report that heart rhythm abnormalities developed in most of 84 coronavirus patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin, a combo Trump has promoted. Both drugs are known to sometimes alter the heartbeat in dangerous ways, and their safety or ability to help people with COVID-19 is unknown. The warning excludes in hospital and research studies. A National Institutes of Health experts panel earlier this week also recommended against taking that drug combo except in a formal study. New poll shows a hidden threat for Trump: double haters A poll on voters who had negative opinions of both Trump and Biden showed Donald Trump\u2019s may be in trouble with the double haters. Voters who disliked both candidates were clear in their preference between them: they prefer Joe Biden by a 50-point margin. Researcher Joshua Green, who analyzed data provided by NBC News, said in an op-ed that while one poll doesn\u2019t predict the future, \u201cit\u2019s hardly a positive sign for Trump, and there are a number of reasons to think the disparity in support is real.\u201d From Green: Trump\u2019s allies have been eager to change this for more than a year, and the fact that they haven\u2019t succeeded is the main reason why some in his campaign are itching to attack Biden as weak on China. More reactions to the president\u2019s \u201csarcasm\u201d explanation: Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier is not buying it. Merriam-Webster with a bit of a cheeky quip directed at the Donald Trump, who might need a refresher from the dictionary: In a statement, the Navy confirmed another ship at sea , the USS Kidd, had a reported coronavirus outbreak and is returning to port. At least 18 members of the crew of a destroyer have tested positive. Numbers are expected to grow as the Navy evaluates the outbreak. From AP: The Kidd is in the Caribbean, where it has been operating as part of a counter-drug mission. One sailor who displayed symptoms was flown off the Kidd on Thursday to a medical facility at San Antonio, where he tested positive for the virus. After the positive case was confirmed at San Antonio, the Navy deployed a specialized medical team to the ship to conduct contact tracing and additional onsite testing. More from the Cuomo presser: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo agreed with Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of the World Health Organization\u2019s early handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Whose job is it to warn us of these global pandemics? The president says it\u2019s the World Health Organization, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s taken action against them. Not my field, but he\u2019s right to ask the question.\u201d Here is a fuller report on the exchange that just took place in the Oval Office between Donald Trump and the small group of reporters gathered to see him sign the latest coronavirus financial rescue legislation. From the pool: Reporter: Can you clarify your comments about injection on disinfectant? POTUS [President of the United States]: I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen. Now disinfectant or doing this maybe on the hands would work. I was asking the question of the gentleman who was there yesterday, Bill [Bill Bryan, the acting homeland security undersecretary for science and technology], because when they say that something will last three to four hours or six hours, but if sun is out, or if they use disinfectant, it goes away in less than a minute. Did you hear about this yesterday? POTUS: When I was asking a sarcastic \u2014 a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside, but it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to a reporter. Reporter: But you were asking your medical experts to look into it. POTUS: To look into whether or not sun \u2014 and disinfectant on the hands \u2014 but whether or not sun can help us. Because, I mean he came in yesterday and he said they\u2019ve done a big study. This is a study. This isn\u2019t where he hasn\u2019t done it. This is where they\u2019ve come in with a final report that sun has a massive impact negatively on this virus. In other words, it does not live well with humidity and it doesn\u2019t live well with sun, sunlight, heat. It doesn\u2019t live well with heat and sun and and disinfectant. And that\u2019s what I brought up, and I thought that was clear. Jeff Mason [Reuters journalist]: Just to follow up on the comments from yesterday you said you were being sarcastic, but some people may have misunderstood you. Do you want to just clarify? POTUS: I wish they [\u2026] Jeff Mason: Do you want to clarify to Americans if you don\u2019t want people to think that? POTUS. Yes. I do think that disinfectant on the hands could have a very good effect. Now, Bill is going back to check that in the laboratory. You know, it\u2019s an amazing laboratory, by the way. It\u2019s amazing the work they do. So, he\u2019s going to check because a hard surface. This is a hard surface I guess maybe depending on whose hand you\u2019re talking about, right? But this is a hard surface and disinfectant, disinfectant has an unbelievable \u2014 it wipes it out. You saw it? Sun and heat, and humidity and you wipe it out. And this is from tests \u2014 they\u2019ve been doing these tests for a number of months. And the result \u2014 so then I said, \u2018Well, how do we do it inside the body or even outside the body with the hands and disinfectant I think would work.\u2019 He thinks it would work. When you use it when you\u2019re doing your hands. I guess that\u2019s one of the reasons they say wash your hands, but whether it\u2019s washing hands or disinfectant on your hands, it\u2019s very good. So, they\u2019re going to start looking at that. And there is a way of, you know, if light \u2014 if sun, sun itself that sun has a tremendous impact on or kills it like in one \u2014 it goes from what was it? Hours to like one minute instead. So, I said you got to go back and look, but I\u2019d like them now to look as it pertains to the human body. Not just sitting on a railing or sitting on a wall. I\u2019d like to look as it pertains because maybe there\u2019s something there. They have to work with \u2014 I\u2019m not a doctor. They have to work with their doctors. but maybe there is something to light, and the human body, and helping people that are dying. Jeff Mason: Just to clarify: You\u2019re not encouraging Americans to inject disinfectant? POTUS: No. Of course not\u2026It was said sarcastically. It was put in the form of a question to a group of extraordinary hostile people. Namely, the fake news media. Jeff Mason: Some doctors felt you needed to clarify that after your comments. POTUS: Of course, all they had to do was see just \u2014 you know the way it was asked. I was looking at you. Jeff Mason: No you weren\u2019t sir. I wasn\u2019t there yesterday. Weijia Jiang: You were looking at Dr. Birx. POTUS: What\u2019s that? Weijia Jiang: You were looking at Dr. Birx. POTUS: I was looking at Bill. I was looking at the doctor. I was looking at some of the reporters. I don\u2019t know if you were there. Were you there? Weijia Jiang: I was there and I watched you ask her. POTUS: You were there. You were there. You I never forget. Jeff Mason: I wasn\u2019t there yesterday. POTUS: You were not? Jeff Mason: No sir. POTUS: Yeah. I didn\u2019t think you were there. That\u2019s the end of that section of the Oval transcript. It\u2019s worth re-upping this tweet from CBS\u2019s Weijia Jiang: Cuomo to McConnell: \u2018I dare you\u2019 to let states to go bankrupt During his daily press briefing on the state\u2019s coronavirus response, New York governor Andrew Cuomo dared Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to pass legislation that would allow states to go bankrupt amid the outbreak. \u201cPass the law. I dare you,\u201d the governor said. \u201cYou want to send a signal to the markets that this nation is in real trouble? I dare you to do that\u201d. Cuomo then expanded on earlier comments on how the state of New York contributes more to federal budgets than McConnell\u2019s home state of Kentucky: \u201cNew York has bailed you out every year, every year. Mitch McConnell is a taker, not a giver. New Yorker is a state of givers.\u201d The dare then extended to Donald Trump: \u201cOK, senator, pass the bill that authorizes states to declare bankruptcy. Sign the bill Mr. President. Good, pass the bill, and let\u2019s watch how the stock market takes off. I got great news about our economic resilience.\u201d This follows Cuomo\u2019s angry remarks yesterday in reaction to McConnell\u2019s suggestion on Wednesday in an interview that maybe states should be able to go bankrupt and restructure their battered finances that way, rather than take federal coronavirus rescue funds. More on what the president of the United States said in the Oval Office moments ago: Politico is reporting despite trying to pin former vice president Joe Biden as \u2018Beijing Biden\u2019, \u201cTrump himself is tens of millions of dollars in debt to China.\u201d The debt is apparent from one of the US president\u2019s New York City buildings, which was refinanced by his real estate partner in 2012. The president owns a 30 percent stake on a loan that matures in 2022. From Politico: In 2012, his real estate partner refinanced one of Trump\u2019s most prized New York buildings for almost $1 billion. The debt includes $211 million from the state-owned Bank of China \u2014 its first loan of this kind in the U.S. \u2014 which matures in the middle of what could be Trump\u2019s second term, financial records show. The Trump campaign provided a statement in response to the scoop: There is an obvious difference between Donald Trump working as a successful businessman as a private citizen and Hunter Biden using his name to cash in with a $1.5 billion investment from a state-controlled Chinese bank while his father was vice president,\u2019 said Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman. 20 coronavirus cases linked to Wisconsin primary Wisconsin officials confirmed Friday that, so far, nearly 20 newly confirmed cases of the coronavirus can be traced to the state\u2019s 7 April primary. \u201cWe know that gatherings such as (the election) are detrimental to the efforts to slow the spread of this pandemic,\u201d Milwaukee County Office of Emergency Management\u2019s medical director Ben Weston, said in the statement. Democrats excoriated the state\u2019s Republican-led senate and supreme court for going through with the primary even as the virus spread, including governor Tony Evers, whose last-ditch effort would have postponed the primary until June. Meanwhile, earlier this week, the Milwaukee Common Council voted unanimously to approve a plan that would mail every registered voter in the city an application for an absentee ballot, under an initiative to create a \u201cSafeVote\u201d program. Along with the absentee ballot applications, every Milwaukeean would also receive a postage-paid envelope for to return it. The resolution still needs the approval of Democratic mayor Tom Barrett, but the measure could have major implications for the state\u2019s general election, where turnout in the city fell in 2016 to a two-decade low. A 19 percent drop in turnout among the city\u2019s African American population is largely credited with Donald Trump\u2019s narrow victory in the state over Democrat Hillary Clinton. As black Americans face disproportionate negative health outcomes from the coronavirus, sending each resident an absentee ballot could stand to protect vulnerable voters from an expected second wave of the outbreak in the fall. Here\u2019s CBS\u2019s Weijia Jiang on Trump\u2019s assertion just earlier that his comments last night suggesting taking disinfectant internally as a possible coronavirus treatment or cure was simply sarcasm. On disinfectant: More: Trump said to pool reporters gathered in the Oval Office for the signing of the legislation just earlier, re his disinfectant suggestion: \u201cI was asking a question just sarcastically, to reporters like you, just to see what would happen.\u201d Anderson Cooper just said on his show on CNN: \u201cWe have the president of the United States just lying, just there. He was lying about that, we witnessed him saying it yesterday to his own task force\u201d about whether there could be analysis of the scope for injecting disinfectant into humans to treat or cure the coronavirus. \u201cWe have the tape, we\u2019re going to play it to you,\u201d he said. It\u2019s right here: The president caused uproar last night by suggesting that coronavirus could be treated or cured with the application of light onto or inside the human body and the injection of disinfectant. Today he appears to want to dismiss the disinfectant remark. The maker of Lysol put out a warning this morning. Donald Trump signed the $484 billion bill moments ago to aid employers and hospitals under stress from the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 50,000 Americans and devastated broad swaths of the US economy. The bill is the latest effort by the federal government to help keep afloat businesses that have had to close or dramatically alter their operations as states try to slow the spread of the virus, The Associated Press writes. Over the past five weeks, roughly 26 million people have filed for jobless aid, or about 1 in 6 US workers. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said today that \u201cthe horse had already left the barn\u201d by the time the US responded to the coronavirus pandemic. He also pointed out that strains of the coronavirus that first infected his state\u2019s residents came from Europe, not China, and that the restrictions on travelers to the US from China announced by Donald Trump on January 31 and implemented on February 2 came too late to halt the spread of Covid-19. \u201cWe closed the front door with the China travel ban, which was right, but we left the back door open,\u201d Cuomo told a daily briefing. Here is what we\u2019ve covered thus far today: The US has reached 50,000 coronavirus deaths Georgia hurried to reopen despite a jump in coronavirus cases Atlanta\u2019s mayor is fighting against racists attacks for encouraging residents The EPA and Lysol manufacturers warned against disinfectant use One in four Americans reported a job loss in the household Trump announced the US is working with Ecuador to combat the outbreak Hillary Clinton warned Americans against poisoning themselves The AP is reporting that US deaths from the coronavirus had surpassed 50,000, Friday. The number is based on a Johns Hopkins University database tracking the virus\u2019 spread. The Guardian\u2019s Jessica Glenza with more on the controversial drugs hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin: A new letter published in the journal Nature describes how hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin \u2013 an anti-malarial medication and an antibiotic \u2013 may increase the risk of \u201csudden cardiac death\u201d for Covid-19 patients. The combination has been touted by Donald Trump as a \u201ccure\u201d for Covid-19, despite a near total lack of scientific study on the safety and efficacy in coronavirus patients. The drugs came of interest after a \u201cmisleading\u201d French study, according to earlier Guardian reporting. In the letter to Nature, which unlike a study is not peer-reviewed, a New York City doctor described 84 Covid-19 patients\u2019 reaction to a five-day, twice daily regimen of the drugs. The patients\u2019 were monitored on electrocardiogram. Both drugs have independently been shown to increase patients\u2019 risk of \u201cdrug-induced sudden cardiac death\u201d. Among the patients, nine showed signs of potentially severe heart \u201cmalignant arrhythmia\u201d which could increase risk of cardiac arrest, although none had heart attacks. At the end of the study, four patients had died of multi-organ failure, 16 patients were discharged and another 64 remained in hospital at the time the letter was submitted. The authors concluded patients on the regimen need to be \u201cconstantly monitored\u201d for heart problems. The former first lady and US secretary of state weighed in on the Donald Trump\u2019s incoherent suggestions that sunlight, UV rays and disinfectants could be used to treat patients battling the coronavirus. The president\u2019s remarks appear to be derived from Department of Homeland Security\u2019s William Bryan, who said at Thursday\u2019s White House briefing that researchers see \u201cemerging results\u201d suggesting solar light has a powerful effect in killing the virus on surfaces and in the air, not humans. American factories face second-largest order decline in history A new report from the US Commerce Department showed orders for big-ticket manufactured goods plunged 14.4 percent in March, the second-largest decline on record. From the AP: The March decline was surpassed only by an 18.4 percent drop in August 2014. The report Friday from the Commerce Department showed widespread weakness, with demand for motor vehicles and commercial airliners both tumbled. Commerce\u2019s numbers followed a report that manufacturing production collapsed in March, with declines that have not been seen since the country demobilized after World War II. The president tweeted: Ecuador had been hit hard by the coronavirus with more than 11,000 confirmed cases. The virus had been confirmed as the cause of 560 deaths, and more are suspected. Interior minister Mar\u00eda Paula Romo told The Guardian the true number was probably much higher, saying \u201cthe number of deaths is totally out of the ordinary\u201d. The US is struggling as well, despite Trump\u2019s commitment to sending supplies to the embattled South American nation, the US is currently experiencing a shortage of ventilators, masks and other supplies as experts estimate the US is behind daily testing targets by the millions. Backlash over stimulus loan applications despite business\u2019s bailout criticism Businesses representing a diverse political spectrum are drawing ire for applying for loans from the Small Business Administration\u2019s stimulus package despite a history of strong governmental rebuke. Two of those businesses include FreedomWorks, a conservative operation that advocates small government and made its name opposing bailouts, and the Congressional Progressive Caucus Center on the left. From the New York Times: The groups on the left may be more comfortable than those on the right with the idea of federal government assistance, but accepting help from an administration they regularly criticize has left them debating how to balance their independence with their ability to keep functioning during an economic crisis. Despite being a strong supporter of limited government and free enterprise, FreedomWorks president Adam Brandon told the Times \u201cI would love someone to give us free cash,\u201d in working with Donald Trump to reopen the economy. A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found one-in-every-four American adults say someone in their household has lost a job to the coronavirus pandemic. From the AP: Forty-six percent of all Americans say their household has experienced some form of income loss from layoffs, reduced hours, unpaid leave or salary reductions. Still, Americans remain mostly optimistic about the economy. The AP reported 71 percent of Americans describe the national economy as poor, up from 60 percent three weeks ago and 33 percent in January. More than 60 percent called their personal financial situation good, largely unchanged since before the virus outbreak began. The country is split on whether the economy will rebound over the next year, however. Forty-five percent of respondents expected the economy to improve, while 37 percent say it will worsen. Just 17 percent expect it to stay the same. Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms shared on Twitter the backlash she\u2019s receiving on account of keeping the city closed, despite governor Brian Kemp order to reopen businesses. One racist text required a discussion with her 12-year-old son after it was sent to the pair. The mayor told CNN on Friday: \u201cI see racism in 2020, people feel empowered to speak hate. It saddened me. There is someone or some entity attempting to make this pandemic about something else, but this is impacting all of us.\u201d The mayor vowed that racism wouldn\u2019t stop her from protecting her constituents. \u201cWe are not cowards. Cowards don\u2019t run for office,\u201d she said. Lance Bottoms went on to remind Georgians to \u201cjust stay home\u201d on Good Morning America Friday. Listen to the scientists. There is nothing essential about going to a bowling alley or getting a manicure in the middle of a pandemic. Any type of relief in the situation is because we have been aggressive, especially in Atlanta, with the social distancing. Doctor\u2019s discomfort with Trump goes viral Coronavirus response coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, looked uncomfortable when Donald Trump referred to sunlight as a possible treatment in the outbreak. A tweet featuring a video of Birx\u2019s body language during Trump\u2019s remarks about UV lights went viral. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Lewis: Trump was apparently referencing light treatments to help the infected. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to use medical doctors, right, but it sounds interesting to me,\u201d he said. Dr Birx only offered a mild retort to the president\u2019s inaccurate suggestions, noting she hadn\u2019t heard light used \u201cas a treatment a treatment before but \u201ccertainly fever is a good thing.\u201d \u201cWhen you have a fever, it helps your body respond,\u201d she said. \u201cBut not as, I\u2019ve not seen heat or light.\u201d The Environmental Protection Agency is reminding people to only use disinfectant on surfaces, issuing an update after Donald Trump suggested it might be helpful to inject disinfectant to combat the coronavirus. The EPA says: \u201cNever apply the product to yourself or others. Do not ingest disinfectant products.\u201d Reckitt Benckiser, which manufactures Lysol and Dettol, also put out a statement discouraging unintended use. \u201cAs a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route).\u201d The company added it had a \u201cresponsibility in providing consumers with access to accurate, up-to-date information as advised by leading public health experts.\u201d William Bryan of the Department of Homeland Security said at a White House briefing on Thursday \u201cemerging results\u201d from new research suggest solar light has a powerful effect in killing the virus on surfaces and in the air. But he said there was no consideration of internal use of disinfectants. Trump\u2019s hypothesis drew a flood of comments on Twitter. Georgia begins reopening businesses today After Georgia governor, Republican Brian Kemp lifted a month-long stay-at-home order, the AP reports some salons, gyms and other close-contact services in Georgia are preparing to open today: David Huynh had 60 clients booked for appointments Friday at his nail salon in Savannah. He said that\u2019s less than half the customers he would normally see. But he\u2019s also starting back with fewer nail technicians to allow for empty work stations between them. Still, many business owners planned to remain closed in spite of the governor\u2019s insisting that new cases have leveled off enough for barbers, tattoo artists, massage therapists and personal trainers to return to work . The reopening also comes as experts warn of a potential new surge in coronavirus infections. Hello! I\u2019m Kenya Evelyn kicking off our live blog today. What\u2019s on tap? We\u2019re following Donald Trump\u2019s signing ceremony of the second economic stimulus package, expected at midday, and of course, all the latest on states and federal efforts to combat the US coronavirus outbreak. Thanks for following along with us today, stay tuned for more. Good morning, US blog readers, it\u2019s Friday but that\u2019s not going to slow the news cycle, so stay tuned for up-to-the-minute developments. The state of Georgia is first to venture out from effective coronavirus lockdown this morning, allowing a host of businesses to reopen despite warnings against the move from public health officials, city mayors and even the president (who had earlier encouraged Georgia and other states to reopen). This as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US comes close to a million and the official number of deaths is poised to reach 50,000. The unofficial totals of both cases and deaths are likely to be much higher, public health officials believe, especially in New York, the center of the US outbreak. At 12pm Donald Trump will sign the latest rescue package bill passed by the House yesterday that provides a further $484bn in funds for small businesses, as well as hospitals and the sorely-needed ramping up of coronavirus testing. The manufacturer of the popular home disinfectant brands Lysol and Dettol \u2013 Reckitt Benckiser \u2013 warned people against using disinfectants to treat the coronavirus, after Donald Trump suggested at the White House briefing last night that researchers try putting disinfectants into patients\u2019 bodies. Experts immediately went public warning of the dangers. \u201cUnder no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route),\u201d the company said. And presumptive Democratic 2020 nominee Joe Biden said at a fundraiser last night that he believes Trump is going to try to delay the November presidential election, in order to offset the damage to his chances of re-election amid a tanked economy, following a botched response the outbreak of the pandemic.",

From Germany to New Zealand and Denmark to Taiwan, women have managed the coronavirus crisis with aplomb. Plenty of countries with male leaders \u2013 Vietnam, the Czech Republic, Greece, Australia \u2013 have also done well. But few with female leaders have done badly. Ardern, 39, New Zealand\u2019s premier, has held Kiwis\u2019 hands through the lockdown, delivering empathetic \u201cstay home, save lives\u201d video messages from her couch and communicating daily through non-combative press conferences or intimate Facebook Live videos, her favourite medium. Her insistence on saving lives and her kindness-first approach \u2013 urging New Zealanders to look after their neighbours, take care of the vulnerable, and make sacrifices for the greater good \u2013 has won her many fans, while her emphasis on shared responsibility has united the country. Choosing to \u201cgo hard and go early\u201d, Ardern imposed a 14-day quarantine on anyone entering the country on 14 March and implemented a strict lockdown two weeks later, when fewer than 150 people had been infected and none had died.

With a doctorate in quantum chemistry, Merkel\u2019s clear, calm expositions \u2013 a clip of her explaining the scientific basis behind the government\u2019s lockdown exit strategy was shared thousands of times online \u2013 have also helped propel public approval of the fourth-term chancellor\u2019s handling of the crisis above 70%. In nearby Denmark, meanwhile, the prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, acted equally firmly, closing the Scandinavian country\u2019s borders as early as 13 March, and following up a few days later by shutting all kindergartens, schools and universities and banning gatherings of more than 10 people.

And since the very best leaders are both strong and decisive and capable of displaying feeling, women could, perhaps, \u201clead the way in showing that these are not competing and conflicting attributes, but complementary \u2013 and necessary for good leadership\u201d, she said. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 April 2020. An earlier version incorrectly described Sanna Marin as the world\u2019s youngest head of government.",

What did you talk about? Cricket, bad chat-up lines, the fact that my friend encouraged me to do this because I\u2019m apparently single and desperate, the accents we do when we get drunk and lie about our identities (me: scouse, him: South African). Everything but coronavirus. Any awkward moments? When neither of us could figure out how UberEats works (pathetic) and when it got to 8pm and people started loudly clapping for the carers. (But it was fine \u2013 we both had a clap, too.) Good table manners? His meal arrived a few minutes before mine, and he politely asked if I wanted him to wait. How long did you stay on the call? A casual four and a half hours (which is longer than about 90% of my in-person dates). Best thing about Josh? His dry sense of humour. Did you introduce him to your housemates? Sadly not, but he did carry me through the living room, where I got to say a brief hello to the flatmate who\u2019d put him up to this. Describe Josh in three words Funny, interesting, smart. What do you think he made of you? A ridiculous individual. Any connection issues? Not at all. And\u2026 did you swap numbers? We went for the millennial option and are now following each other on Instagram. How did the call end? It got late and we called it a night. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? I wouldn\u2019t have put perfume on for a video call, like an absolute idiot. Marks out of 10? Pair of eighters, I reckon. Would you meet again in person? If he ever makes it down to Brighton, I\u2019ll happily buy him a shot of Tuaca. Josh on Kayleigh What were you hoping for? Somebody with a bit of chat.

She was receptive to what was said. Did you introduce her to your housemates? I felt I had to as he\u2019d signed me up to this without my knowledge. Describe Kayleigh in three words Good blind date.

Yet with their mixture of bonhomie and quiet confidence, underpinned by the enduring strength of their jointly owned business, Hays Travel, the married couple from Sunderland were beginning to win over the sceptics. Less than six months later, their deal of a lifetime has been cast into tumult by an unprecedented pandemic that has shut down global tourism indefinitely. Could this be the unluckiest timing in the history of deal-making? \u201cYes, it\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d says John Hays, with a degree of stoic understatement. \u201cTwo months ago things were going fantastically but it\u2019s not anybody\u2019s fault and in these circumstances, all you can do is make the best of it. \u201cWe\u2019ll do what we can to protect our staff, protect the business and protect our customers.

Hays Travel is a different animal to the souped-up, debt-fuelled, bonus-happy beasts of the City, such as Thomas Cook and Carillion. The travel agent and tour operator has no debts and the couple haven\u2019t paid themselves a dividend for more than 10 years. \u201cWhen you look at our balance sheet it\u2019s incredibly strong and there are no shareholders to satisfy, just John and I,\u201d says Irene.

She plans for the campaign to culminate in August in a number of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Emmett-Till-Legacy-Foundation/138927669624\">commemorative events</a> in Mississippi \u2013 coronavirus permitting \u2013 to mark the 65th anniversary.</p> <p>She hopes the initiative will stimulate legislation to empower families of victims of civil rights era murders. The campaign aims to provide trauma counseling for those still suffering from the loss of loved ones decades ago, as well as legal advice on how to pursue restitution.</p> <p>In her own family\u2019s case, Watts said: \u201cWe want the record straight.

Describing Emmett as an n-word, she alleged he had propositioned her. \u201cHow about a date, baby?\u201d she claimed he said to her, grabbing her around the waist and telling her he had been \u201cwith white women before\u201d.</p> <p>Bryant\u2019s account of Emmett\u2019s alleged louche behavior was critical at trial because it spoke to one of the core white supremacist mores of the segregated south. Black men \u2013 or even a black boy, barely 14 \u2013 should on no account show sexual interest in a white woman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9ac538a2959612fa954f75563c9f8798524ccd62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ac538a2959612fa954f75563c9f8798524ccd62/0_0_3577_3670/975.jpg\" alt=\"This dramatic courtroom scene shows 64-year-old \u201cUncle Mose\u201d Wright, Grand-Uncle of murdered Emmett Till, 14-year-old Negro boy, as he stood up in the packed chamber and pointed a finger at defendants, Roy Bryant and John W.

Confident that they could not be prosecuted twice for the same crime under the double jeopardy rule, they admitted to abducting, beating and murdering Till. Milam said he did it \u201cjust so everybody can know how me and my folks stand\u201d.</p> <p>Given the key role that Carolyn Bryant\u2019s lurid account of Emmett\u2019s supposed sexual advances played in letting the murderers avoid justice, the revelations in the 2017 book were incendiary. In it, Bryant is quoted by author Timothy Tyson as saying \u201cThat part\u2019s not true\u201d, referring to her allegation that the boy had sexually accosted her.</p> <p>Carolyn Bryant\u2019s apparent recantation, her admission that she had lied to the court during the only trial ever to take place over the murder, was so significant it sparked the FBI\u2019s current investigation. The Guardian has learned that as soon as the FBI began reinvestigating the Till case three years ago, following the publication of Tyson\u2019s book, the author handed over all his manuscripts and notes on the murder to detectives.</p> <p>That included a manuscript that Carolyn Bryant had written and had given him for safe keeping. Tyson classifies the writings in his book as an \u201cunpublished memoir\u201d with the title More Than a Wolf Whistle.</p> <p>Tyson had agreed with Bryant that her manuscript, together with tape recordings of the interviews she gave the author, would be held at the Southern Historical Collection at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill\u2019s Wilson library. The documents and tapes are stored among Tyson\u2019s wider collection of research materials and as part of the agreement have been placed under a routine archival stipulation that they remain closed to the public until 2036 or until Bryant dies, whichever comes sooner.</p> <p>Tyson told the Guardian that having deliberated about the matter, he came to the conclusion that the FBI\u2019s investigation into such a critical case trumped the archival agreement he had reached with Bryant. He added that her manuscript, which he had correctly but perhaps unwisely termed a \u201cmemoir\u201d, was of little or no value to investigators.</p> <p>It runs to a mere 30 pages and is not complete. Tyson went as far as to describe the document as \u201cflimsy\u201d.</p> <p>To add to the complexity of the FBI\u2019s job in revisiting the case, since Tyson\u2019s book came out<a href=\"https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2018/08/24/what-did-carolyn-bryant-say-and-when/1030483002/\"> the Bryant family has denied</a> that she ever recanted her 1955 testimony. Bryant herself has said nothing more about it in public.</p> <p>The confusion surrounding the as yet unseen writings of Carolyn Bryant, compounded by the family\u2019s denial, has left her precise role in events uncertain to this day. The only person who could definitively set the history books \u2013 and the legal record \u2013 straight is Bryant herself, and she is maintaining her silence.</p> <p>The Guardian contacted her through a relative but she declined to comment. The relative, speaking on condition of anonymity, said her health is failing and she shrinks from public attention as tensions still run high over the murder.</p> <p>\u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aca404dc6439a9ab92c913ce995aa11d079e3a01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aca404dc6439a9ab92c913ce995aa11d079e3a01/0_0_1488_2231/667.jpg\" alt=\"In this Sept. 3, 1955, file photo, mourners pass Emmett Till\u2019s casket in Chicago.

It was to Edwards\u2019 family home in the tiny hamlet of Money, in the cotton-picking Mississippi delta, that Emmett travelled on vacation that summer of 1955 to stay with her parents, Moses and Elizabeth Wright.</p> <p>Edwards\u2019 late brother Simeon, then 12, was asleep in the same bed as Emmett when he was abducted.</p> <p>The trouble began three days after Emmett arrived in Mississippi. On the afternoon of 24 August 1955, he teamed up with Simeon and another cousin, Wheeler Parker, who had travelled down with him from Chicago.</p> <p>Together with a few friends they went to hang out at the Bryant\u2019s Grocery and Meat Market, a general store located in a wooden shack a couple of miles from the Wrights\u2019 home.</p> <p>What exactly happened when Emmett Till entered the store and encountered Carolyn Bryant, then 21, minding the counter, has been a matter of conjecture over many years. It is understood to be one of the key questions that the FBI has been grappling with in its reinvestigation.</p> <p>Wheeler Parker, 80, recently gave a speech at the New Brunswick Theological Seminary in New Jersey attended by the Guardian.

For Thelma and the rest of the Till family, a decades-long struggle for justice is fast approaching its conclusion. In August, it will be 65 years since the battered and bloated body of the 14-year-old Till was fished from the muddy waters of the Tallahatchie River in Mississippi. His kidnapping, torture and murder on 28 August 1955 for having whistled at a white woman was a defining moment of postwar American history. It set in train a sequence of events that led African Americans in the south to make an unprecedented stand, sparking the civil rights movement. Today his name is emblazoned on history books, memorialized in movies, while the glass-topped casket which tens of thousands of mourners walked by before his burial now stands as the centerpiece of the National Museum of African American history in Washington DC.

What the FBI may or may not have discovered about her role in the abduction of the boy and the aftermath of the murder amounts to the final hope for resolution in the case.

Both men are dead, as are all other individuals directly linked to the events leading up to the killing. With one exception: Carolyn Bryant, and even she is understood to be in poor health. As a result, the Till family knows that if justice is ever to be done, it must be done now. \u201cI have never got over the shock and pain of losing Emmett, it was barbaric what they did to him, he was just a kid,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting 65 years and still nothing. That makes us feel like second-class citizens, to be treated like that.\u201d \u2026 As the Till family anxiously awaits news of the FBI\u2019s investigation, Edwards and another of Emmett\u2019s cousins, Deborah Watts, are launching a new push for redress on behalf of Emmett Till as well as the hundreds of other victims of racially motivated murders from the civil rights era whose cases have never been solved. Watts, who is spearheading the new Justice for Emmett Till campaign, was a toddler at the time of her cousin\u2019s death. She plans for the campaign to culminate in August in a number of commemorative events in Mississippi \u2013 coronavirus permitting \u2013 to mark the 65th anniversary. She hopes the initiative will stimulate legislation to empower families of victims of civil rights era murders. The campaign aims to provide trauma counseling for those still suffering from the loss of loved ones decades ago, as well as legal advice on how to pursue restitution. In her own family\u2019s case, Watts said: \u201cWe want the record straight. We want to know what happened on the night Emmett was kidnapped. And before it\u2019s too late we want those responsible to be held accountable.\u201d When the FBI revisited the Till murder in 2017, its agents contacted Edwards and other members of the Till family. But since that initial flurry of activity, Edwards said she has heard nothing from investigators, leaving her feeling suspended in limbo. Speaking from her home in Ocala, Florida, Edwards told the Guardian: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that nothing seems to have happened. It feels to me they aren\u2019t trying to do anything, that\u2019s the way I feel.\u201d Last September, her son Ozzie Edwards wrote to the FBI in Jackson, Mississippi, appealing for information about the revived investigation. \u201cMy mother and I are anxiously awaiting some kind of news or progress report regarding the FBI\u2019s findings. We are much concerned with how the investigation is coming along.\u201d The FBI has yet to reply. Publicly, the FBI has kept silent about the nature of its latest inquiry. The agency declined to answer Guardian questions, citing justice department policy that would \u201cneither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation\u201d. But as it approaches the end of its work, pressure is mounting. Investigators will know how much is riding on a case of such historic significance. \u2026 The FBI investigation was triggered by the publication in 2017 of a book on the murder, The Blood of Emmett Till. It caused a sensation by reporting that Carolyn Bryant had recanted the testimony she had given at the murder trial of her husband and brother-in-law a month after Emmett was killed. Bryant told the court that the teenager had sexually accosted her inside the store. Describing Emmett as an n-word, she alleged he had propositioned her. \u201cHow about a date, baby?\u201d she claimed he said to her, grabbing her around the waist and telling her he had been \u201cwith white women before\u201d. Bryant\u2019s account of Emmett\u2019s alleged louche behavior was critical at trial because it spoke to one of the core white supremacist mores of the segregated south. Black men \u2013 or even a black boy, barely 14 \u2013 should on no account show sexual interest in a white woman. It took the jury just an hour of deliberations to set the brothers free. Four months later, Roy Bryant and Milam agreed to be interviewed by Look magazine for a $4,000 fee. Confident that they could not be prosecuted twice for the same crime under the double jeopardy rule, they admitted to abducting, beating and murdering Till. Milam said he did it \u201cjust so everybody can know how me and my folks stand\u201d. Given the key role that Carolyn Bryant\u2019s lurid account of Emmett\u2019s supposed sexual advances played in letting the murderers avoid justice, the revelations in the 2017 book were incendiary. In it, Bryant is quoted by author Timothy Tyson as saying \u201cThat part\u2019s not true\u201d, referring to her allegation that the boy had sexually accosted her. Carolyn Bryant\u2019s apparent recantation, her admission that she had lied to the court during the only trial ever to take place over the murder, was so significant it sparked the FBI\u2019s current investigation. The Guardian has learned that as soon as the FBI began reinvestigating the Till case three years ago, following the publication of Tyson\u2019s book, the author handed over all his manuscripts and notes on the murder to detectives. That included a manuscript that Carolyn Bryant had written and had given him for safe keeping. Tyson classifies the writings in his book as an \u201cunpublished memoir\u201d with the title More Than a Wolf Whistle. Tyson had agreed with Bryant that her manuscript, together with tape recordings of the interviews she gave the author, would be held at the Southern Historical Collection at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill\u2019s Wilson library. The documents and tapes are stored among Tyson\u2019s wider collection of research materials and as part of the agreement have been placed under a routine archival stipulation that they remain closed to the public until 2036 or until Bryant dies, whichever comes sooner. Tyson told the Guardian that having deliberated about the matter, he came to the conclusion that the FBI\u2019s investigation into such a critical case trumped the archival agreement he had reached with Bryant. He added that her manuscript, which he had correctly but perhaps unwisely termed a \u201cmemoir\u201d, was of little or no value to investigators. It runs to a mere 30 pages and is not complete. Tyson went as far as to describe the document as \u201cflimsy\u201d. To add to the complexity of the FBI\u2019s job in revisiting the case, since Tyson\u2019s book came out the Bryant family has denied that she ever recanted her 1955 testimony. Bryant herself has said nothing more about it in public. The confusion surrounding the as yet unseen writings of Carolyn Bryant, compounded by the family\u2019s denial, has left her precise role in events uncertain to this day. The only person who could definitively set the history books \u2013 and the legal record \u2013 straight is Bryant herself, and she is maintaining her silence. The Guardian contacted her through a relative but she declined to comment. The relative, speaking on condition of anonymity, said her health is failing and she shrinks from public attention as tensions still run high over the murder. \u2026 On one level, Emmett\u2019s brutal murder was just one among more than 4,000 terror lynchings that stained the soul of America from the 1870s until the 1950s. What made it exceptional was the insistence of his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, that his body be brought back up from Mississippi to Chicago where it would be displayed in an open casket for all the world to see what the sadism of white men had done to her son. Emmett was abducted to \u201cteach him a lesson\u201d for having wolf-whistled at Carolyn Bryant. For that insolence, for that violation of the rules of white supremacy, Roy Bryant and Milam took the boy from his bed in the middle of the night, drove him in a pickup truck to Milam\u2019s shed and tortured him over several hours. Witnesses passing by said they could hear a young boy\u2019s frightened voice crying out: \u201cMama, please save me\u201d; \u201cPlease, God, don\u2019t do it again.\u201d Later that day, the brothers shot the child above the right ear and threw his body in the river weighed down with a cotton-gin fan. When Mamie Till-Mobley saw the corpse for the first time, she could not recognize her own boy. His disfigured face, she said, had its \u201cright eye lying midway of his chest, his nose broken like someone took a meat chopper to it, and a bullet hole which I could look through and see daylight on the other side\u201d. One hundred days after the murder, Rosa Parks was riding on a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, when the driver ordered her to move to the segregated black seats at the back. She was about to do as told, but then the image of Emmett\u2019s brutalised body came back to her and she refused. Emmett Till. Rosa Parks. The Montgomery bus boycott. Martin Luther King. History draws a straight line from the lynching of that 14-year-old child to the eruption of the civil rights movement. And that straight line can be extended to the unfinished business that is the subject of the Justice for Emmett Till campaign today. \u2026. Thelma Wright Edwards remembers crying \u201cuntil I couldn\u2019t cry any more\u201d when news reached her outside Chicago of her cousin\u2019s death. The two were very close, having spent 10 years under the same roof after their families relocated to Illinois from Mississippi as part of the Great Migration of African Americans to the north. It was to Edwards\u2019 family home in the tiny hamlet of Money, in the cotton-picking Mississippi delta, that Emmett travelled on vacation that summer of 1955 to stay with her parents, Moses and Elizabeth Wright. Edwards\u2019 late brother Simeon, then 12, was asleep in the same bed as Emmett when he was abducted. The trouble began three days after Emmett arrived in Mississippi. On the afternoon of 24 August 1955, he teamed up with Simeon and another cousin, Wheeler Parker, who had travelled down with him from Chicago. Together with a few friends they went to hang out at the Bryant\u2019s Grocery and Meat Market, a general store located in a wooden shack a couple of miles from the Wrights\u2019 home. What exactly happened when Emmett Till entered the store and encountered Carolyn Bryant, then 21, minding the counter, has been a matter of conjecture over many years. It is understood to be one of the key questions that the FBI has been grappling with in its reinvestigation. Wheeler Parker, 80, recently gave a speech at the New Brunswick Theological Seminary in New Jersey attended by the Guardian. He told the audience that he had been in touch with the FBI and was hoping to learn the fruits of its latest efforts, though he declined to discuss details. Parker said he plans to reveal anything he learns in a forthcoming book about his cousin\u2019s murder, A Few Days Full of Trouble. Parker recounted his eyewitness recollections of that fateful afternoon. \u201cA lot of things have been said about what went on, things that incriminated Emmett, made him out to be a bad boy from Chicago,\u201d he said. The truth was more mundane. \u201cNothing happened. Nothing at all happened inside that store.\u201d It was only when they were back outside in the open air, Parker said, that Emmett did the deed. \u201cHe did whistle. He whistled outside the store. He gave the wolf whistle. Man, we could have all fainted. In Mississippi, in 1955! We knew he\u2019d violated southern mores, that in their eyes he\u2019d committed a great crime.\u201d What, if anything, will come of the current FBI investigation remains to be seen. It would be difficult to prosecute Bryant for lying at the trial because the statute of limitations on perjury has long since passed. The Guardian asked Emmett Till\u2019s three cousins to set out what they hoped would arise from the FBI investigation now drawing to a close. Deborah Watts answered the question as though talking to Carolyn Bryant. \u201cYou lied, Emmett died. If you were there, and we know you were, then you need to be held accountable.\u201d Wheeler Parker said his priority was for the real Emmett Till to be remembered. \u201cHe was painted in such a bad light. I want people to know him as he was.\u201d Thelma Wright Edwards said she had no hankering to see Carolyn Bryant put behind bars. \u201cShe\u2019s old, I don\u2019t want her in jail,\u201d she said. But she did have one final desire after so many years of waiting. \u201cI do want Miss Bryant to admit she lied. Stand up and tell the truth. We can\u2019t move on until we hear it from her mouth.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Coronavirus has already triggered a wave of high street failures, from Oasis and Warehouse to Laura Ashley and Cath Kidston. Hundreds of thousands of retail workers have been furloughed, with the aim that they will return to the shop floor when stores are allowed to reopen.</p> \n<p>But there are growing fears that the lockdown may prompt huge changes in the way we shop, ushering in an era of fewer shops, more home deliveries, more local shopping and changes in the way we buy fashion.</p> \n<p>The temporary closure of the high street has \u201cshaken people\u2019s reality\u201d, says retail analyst Richard Lim, adding that the situation has forced consumers to reassess how and what they buy: \u201cMost people have no experience of this kind of disruption so it\u2019s shaping their perception of what\u2019s possible.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/24/childcare-industry-crushed-by-coronavirus-crisis\">UK childcare industry 'crushed' by coronavirus crisis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>British retailers were battle weary after 2019 which was their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/09/uk-retailers-suffer-worst-year-record-job-cuts-store-closures\">worst on record</a>.

People who couldn\u2019t be bothered to try online shopping are getting past the initial friction of setting up an online account and inputting their payment details.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lim also believes the enforced holiday from consumption could lead to reduced materialism. \u201cTwo decades of importing deflation from China means we have had price falls in retail categories like clothing and footwear,\u201d he said. \u201cArguably we\u2019ve got an abundance of material possessions and we attach less economic value to certain products.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThe pause for reflection that consumers are making at the moment could lead to a reassessment of what\u2019s important,\u201d says Lim. \u201cIf I have sat here for the last three months and I haven\u2019t bought a new pair of shoes or a handbag maybe it wasn\u2019t as important as I thought it was?\u201d</p> \n<p>Consumers may need coaxing back to shopping centres with financial incentives and reassurances that it is safe.

      "bodyText": "Coronavirus has already triggered a wave of high street failures, from Oasis and Warehouse to Laura Ashley and Cath Kidston. Hundreds of thousands of retail workers have been furloughed, with the aim that they will return to the shop floor when stores are allowed to reopen. But there are growing fears that the lockdown may prompt huge changes in the way we shop, ushering in an era of fewer shops, more home deliveries, more local shopping and changes in the way we buy fashion. The temporary closure of the high street has \u201cshaken people\u2019s reality\u201d, says retail analyst Richard Lim, adding that the situation has forced consumers to reassess how and what they buy: \u201cMost people have no experience of this kind of disruption so it\u2019s shaping their perception of what\u2019s possible.\u201d British retailers were battle weary after 2019 which was their worst on record. Sales fell for the first time in 24 years as growth in online shopping failed to offset the downturn on the high street and shoppers spent spare cash on leisure and experiences rather than clothes and homewares. It is estimated that the financial reckoning faced by the retail sector will result in 20,620 store closures this year \u2013 up from about 16,000 in 2019 \u2013 and trigger nearly 250,000 job losses, according to a new analysis based on a three-month lockdown by the Centre for Retail Research (CRR). Prof Joshua Bamfield, the CRR\u2019s director, said the coronavirus was a \u201chammer blow\u201d for retailers: \u201cWe expect more companies to go into administration followed by the current pattern of an acquirer purchasing a small number of well-performing stores plus the brand names and the rest of the stores to remain unsold.\u201d The toll on jobs will be substantial. The demise of Laura Ashley and Cath Kidston alone has cost 3,000 jobs. Britons were already enthusiastic online shoppers but retailers including the John Lewis and Curry\u2019s PC World chains reported a near doubling of online sales since the quarantine began, and Bamfield predicts that rapid growth will continue, causing even \u201cgreater problems for bricks-and-mortar stores\u201d. This week Sharon White, the John Lewis group\u2019s chairman, said the company feared sales at its department store chain could fall by a third this year despite increased sales through its website. The financial pressure created by the abrupt shutdown has already put Debenhams into administration for the second time in a year. White, who had warned of looming store closures and job losses before the pandemic said she would now have to consider \u201cchanges in consumer behaviour to come out of the pandemic, such as a more pronounced shift to online and a desire to shop in more sustainable ways\u201d. Lim, who runs the consultancy firm Retail Economics, predicts the crisis will hasten changes already under way, resulting in half of all non-food spending moving online \u2013 up from around 30% today. Before the pandemic, only 7% of groceries were bought online \u2013 though capacity has doubled in recent weeks \u2013 whereas half of all electricals and books were already bought on the web. Lim says Covid-19 has forced shoppers who had never shopped on the internet to give it a try. \u201cSections of society are being forced to go on a customer journey they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have embarked on. People who couldn\u2019t be bothered to try online shopping are getting past the initial friction of setting up an online account and inputting their payment details.\u201d Lim also believes the enforced holiday from consumption could lead to reduced materialism. \u201cTwo decades of importing deflation from China means we have had price falls in retail categories like clothing and footwear,\u201d he said. \u201cArguably we\u2019ve got an abundance of material possessions and we attach less economic value to certain products.\u201d \u201cThe pause for reflection that consumers are making at the moment could lead to a reassessment of what\u2019s important,\u201d says Lim. \u201cIf I have sat here for the last three months and I haven\u2019t bought a new pair of shoes or a handbag maybe it wasn\u2019t as important as I thought it was?\u201d Consumers may need coaxing back to shopping centres with financial incentives and reassurances that it is safe. In China, the authorities have been giving away shopping vouchers to encourage shoppers back into the malls. In Dubai, the reopening protocols for retailers include thermal scanners at mall entrances, time-limited shopping sprees and signs outside indicating when the safe limit of customers has been reached inside. Closer to home Curry\u2019s intends to offer a \u201cdrive-through\u201d service in its car parks for those who no longer want to linger. Primark, which is losing \u00a3650m in sales for every month its stores remain closed, said this week that it expects shoppers to be cautious about returning. John Bason, finance director at Primark\u2019s owner, Associated British Foods, said he didn\u2019t \u201cexpect deserted high streets to just go bang\u201d but that trade would build over time. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard which specialises in tracking shopper numbers, said that smaller high streets had hung on to more shoppers than bigger towns as people stayed local, but she does believe that shoppers will return to bigger towns and cities \u201cif things work out and we don\u2019t get a second rush of cases\u201d. Springboard is working on an occupancy alert service for centre owners so they can use technology to manage crowds and keep shoppers in the loop. \u201cMalls will need to be able to track occupancy,\u201d said Wehrle. Customers will be kept up to date via social media. This week B&amp;Q reopened 155 stores with \u201cstrict\u201d safety measures that will make visiting a DIY retailer a chore even for the most avid enthusiast. Retailers such as John Lewis and Marks &amp; Spencer will have a head start when the time comes to reopen as they have been able to use their food businesses to devise workable social distancing measures. Shopping for pleasure seems a lifetime ago. The future of shopping Amid fears that some high street brands may be forced to close permanently under the UK lockdown, the Guardian asked readers about how they think their shopping habits may change after the lockdown ends. Breaking the takeaway coffee habit Andy Lee, 36, from Warrington, estimates he will save about \u00a350 a month. \u201cI was spending so much money in Starbucks,\u201d said Lee, who works as a local government worker. \u201cMy other half and I have discovered Nespresso though, and are using around 15 capsules a day between us.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t see myself going back to takeaway coffee but I miss not having meals out. It\u2019s a bit embarrassing but the first thing I want to do after lockdown is get a McDonald\u2019s.\u201d Sarah Crooks, who lives in the Peak District, will also be be giving up her takeaway coffee habit. \u201cBefore I must have bought up to 10 coffees a week, often accompanied by a biscuit, cake or a sandwich,\u2019\u201d said the lecturer ,who is in her mid-50s. \u201cI did it so often that it was almost a reflex. \u201cBreaking the habit and saving so much money is one of the positive side-effects of all this.\u201d Fewer clothes \u2013 but more online Sharanya Basu Roy, 29, an associate lecturer from Derby, said: \u201cThe lockdown has definitely made me less materialistic. I will be reducing my spending on eating out, clothing and fashion accessories. They are not environmentally sustainable and there are things in life that are more important.\u201d Anna Oldbury, 43, a food producer, from London. \u201cI will definitely spend less on seasonal garments and fast fashion,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not likely to shop on the high street anymore when you can buy it all online. However, I do still want to support independent shops and boutiques.\u201d Shopping locally A 54-year-old reader from Buckhurst Hill, who preferred not to give her name, said she had a poor experience with one of the larger supermarkets getting deliveries organised for her elderly father, but that local retailers had helped. \u201cI understand it\u2019s a terrible time but smaller companies have really stepped up to the mark and I\u2019d rather support them.

      "bodyText": "Durham University has retracted controversial plans to provide online-only degrees due to the coronavirus pandemic following a backlash from students and lecturers. The university\u2019s senate was due to vote on a resolution that would see Durham develop a range of online degrees to \u201ccomplement its existing high quality residential educational programme\u201d. But it was withdrawn on Wednesday after many senate members expressed opposition to the proposals. The plans, which would also reduce the number of modules taught in person by a quarter in the next academic year, were condemned by the Department of English as \u201cdangerous and damaging to the short- and long-term viability of the university\u201d. The department\u2019s submission to the senate, seen by the Guardian, criticised suggestions from a private education firm consulted on the plans that lecturers would only need six hours training in order to teach online. The document said Cambridge Education Digital\u2019s estimation of the work required to shift learning online displayed no realistic sense of the realities the staffing and technological support required to develop and deliver it. \u201cTraining staff to teach effectively online will take far, far more than the six hours indicated,\u201d it added. The submission also warned the plans posed a potential conflict of interest because CEG Digital is owned by private equity group Bridgepoint Capital, whose chief investment officer is a member of Durham\u2019s \u2018chancellor\u2019s circle\u2019 of donors. The plans will now be returned to the university\u2019s council, where they will be redrawn before being returned to the senate. More than 1,000 current and prospective Durham students signed a petition opposing the plans, with a letter sent to heads of departments ahead of the senate meeting adding that \u201conline teaching should not be considered an equitable substitute to in person degree\u201d. Nearly 500 academics also signed a letter opposing the proposals. Durham\u2019s vice-chancellor Stuart Corbridge said: \u201cThe university continues to plan for a full residential teaching offer in October while also ensuring that teaching can go online if there is a lockdown later in the year.\u201d The University and College Union, which represents lecturers, described the proposals as \u201can attack on the livelihoods and the professional expertise of hard-working staff\u201d. UCU general secretary Jo Grady said: \u201cThe best way to ensure universities offer the best for students is to work with us and ensure any changes are led by staff, not imposed from above.\u201d A Durham University spokesman said: \u201cWe have engaged CEG Digital to help us understand the online education market and to support our excellent staff deliver their teaching online, if this is required by COVID-19 restrictions. \u201cWe followed due process in awarding both of these contracts.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The coronavirus shutdown has cut a swathe through the world\u2019s cultural events, with UK casualties ranging from the Glastonbury festival to thousands of gigs and theatre performances.</p> \n<p>Theatre and music fans whose plans have been dashed are reporting long waits for refunds, with some claiming that companies are trying to fob them off with credit vouchers rather than giving them their money back.</p> \n<p>With the original dates for some events having passed, ticket firms, promoters and venues have been contacting affected customers \u2013 but they often seem to be reluctant to address the \u201cR\u201d word: refund.</p> \n<p>The UK\u2019s Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers (Star) \u2013 to which almost all leading ticket companies belong \u2013 has made clear that if an event is cancelled customers are entitled to a refund of at least the face value of the ticket. The same is true if an event has been rescheduled and you are unable to attend the new date.</p> \n<p>Some acts have avoided leaving fans in limbo. On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.bonjovi.com/blogs/news/bon-jovi-2020-tour-cancellation\" title=\"\">Bon Jovi axed their 2020 tour</a>, saying that cancelling, rather than postponing, \u201cwill enable ticketholders to get refunds to help pay their bills or buy groceries\u201d.</p> \n<p>But many concerts and other events have been rescheduled for later this year or 2021, with existing tickets valid for the new date.</p> \n<p>Many fans will be happy to stick with their booking. Glastonbury has offered the 135,000 people who had paid a \u00a350 deposit for this year\u2019s event the chance to roll it over, guaranteeing the opportunity to buy a ticket for 2021\u2019s festival. Given the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/06/glastonbury-tickets-sell-out-in-34-minutes\" title=\"\">annual scrum to buy tickets,</a> the vast majority will probably do that.</p> \n<p>But some who bought tickets for an event are now in a much more difficult position financially and want their money back as soon as possible.</p> \n<p>One of the companies facing criticism is ATG Tickets, part of the Ambassador Theatre Group that operates dozens of venues including many West End theatres hosting shows such as The Lion King, Wicked and Pretty Woman: The Musical.</p> \n<p>Many ticketholders have complained on social media that they have been waiting weeks for refunds. On Twitter there are scores of unhappy customers, some of whom say they have been sent credit vouchers they do not want.</p> \n<p>One, with the username Just Jack, claimed: \u201cI\u2019ve now had to ask @ATGTICKETS three times for a refund on my cancelled show from nearly three weeks ago because they\u2019re dodging the issue or offering freebies so they don\u2019t have to give me my money back.\u201d</p> \n<p>The same day another, Dan Clarke wrote: \u201cI made my refund request several weeks ago but have still had no reply.\u201d AndMeg Potter tweeted: \u201cI\u2019ve been on hold for nearly an hour trying to get a refund for my performance that has been rescheduled for two years\u2019 time! Is there any other way I can get my refund?\u201d </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e92a6986-a045-4bf3-bfb8-bee31fb6a0df\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xCr_dVmXYV8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On the <a href=\"https://theatreboard.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Theatreboard</a> <a href=\"https://theatreboard.co.uk/\" title=\"\">forum</a>, several ATG customers have complained, including one who said he had about \u00a3500 worth of cancelled events and was still waiting for his money. Another called for people who were having problems getting refunds from the company to contact him as he was \u201clooking to start [a] civil action against them\u201d.</p> \n<p>ATG is responding to people on Twitter, telling them that if they have emailed in a refund request, this will be processed and they should disregard any vouchers.</p> \n<p>But you would not know that from the long statement and Q&amp;A about Covid-19 on the firm\u2019s website. At the time of writing it does not mention refunds once \u2013 it talks about either switching to a future performance or receiving a credit voucher. And calling the company is not easy: on Monday, Guardian Money rang customer services and was put into a queue. We gave up holding after 55 minutes.</p> \n<p>Asked about customer complaints, an ATG spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re really sorry about the delay. At the moment we are dealing with approximately 300,000 individual bookings, which means we are taking a little longer than we hoped to react to every customer. We have brought in additional teams to respond as quickly as we can.\u201d</p> \n<p>ATG said it was prioritising ticketholders for performances that had been due to take place up to 2 May, so customers with events beyond that date may not have received an email yet.</p> \n<p>In the US, Ticketmaster has been at the centre of a row over allegations it changed its terms on refunds after the coronavirus shutdown began.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus shutdown has cut a swathe through the world\u2019s cultural events, with UK casualties ranging from the Glastonbury festival to thousands of gigs and theatre performances. Theatre and music fans whose plans have been dashed are reporting long waits for refunds, with some claiming that companies are trying to fob them off with credit vouchers rather than giving them their money back. With the original dates for some events having passed, ticket firms, promoters and venues have been contacting affected customers \u2013 but they often seem to be reluctant to address the \u201cR\u201d word: refund. The UK\u2019s Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers (Star) \u2013 to which almost all leading ticket companies belong \u2013 has made clear that if an event is cancelled customers are entitled to a refund of at least the face value of the ticket. The same is true if an event has been rescheduled and you are unable to attend the new date. Some acts have avoided leaving fans in limbo. On Monday, Bon Jovi axed their 2020 tour, saying that cancelling, rather than postponing, \u201cwill enable ticketholders to get refunds to help pay their bills or buy groceries\u201d. But many concerts and other events have been rescheduled for later this year or 2021, with existing tickets valid for the new date. Many fans will be happy to stick with their booking. Glastonbury has offered the 135,000 people who had paid a \u00a350 deposit for this year\u2019s event the chance to roll it over, guaranteeing the opportunity to buy a ticket for 2021\u2019s festival. Given the annual scrum to buy tickets, the vast majority will probably do that. But some who bought tickets for an event are now in a much more difficult position financially and want their money back as soon as possible. One of the companies facing criticism is ATG Tickets, part of the Ambassador Theatre Group that operates dozens of venues including many West End theatres hosting shows such as The Lion King, Wicked and Pretty Woman: The Musical. Many ticketholders have complained on social media that they have been waiting weeks for refunds. On Twitter there are scores of unhappy customers, some of whom say they have been sent credit vouchers they do not want. One, with the username Just Jack, claimed: \u201cI\u2019ve now had to ask @ATGTICKETS three times for a refund on my cancelled show from nearly three weeks ago because they\u2019re dodging the issue or offering freebies so they don\u2019t have to give me my money back.\u201d The same day another, Dan Clarke wrote: \u201cI made my refund request several weeks ago but have still had no reply.\u201d AndMeg Potter tweeted: \u201cI\u2019ve been on hold for nearly an hour trying to get a refund for my performance that has been rescheduled for two years\u2019 time! Is there any other way I can get my refund?\u201d On the Theatreboard forum, several ATG customers have complained, including one who said he had about \u00a3500 worth of cancelled events and was still waiting for his money. Another called for people who were having problems getting refunds from the company to contact him as he was \u201clooking to start [a] civil action against them\u201d. ATG is responding to people on Twitter, telling them that if they have emailed in a refund request, this will be processed and they should disregard any vouchers. But you would not know that from the long statement and Q&amp;A about Covid-19 on the firm\u2019s website. At the time of writing it does not mention refunds once \u2013 it talks about either switching to a future performance or receiving a credit voucher. And calling the company is not easy: on Monday, Guardian Money rang customer services and was put into a queue. We gave up holding after 55 minutes. Asked about customer complaints, an ATG spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re really sorry about the delay. At the moment we are dealing with approximately 300,000 individual bookings, which means we are taking a little longer than we hoped to react to every customer. We have brought in additional teams to respond as quickly as we can.\u201d ATG said it was prioritising ticketholders for performances that had been due to take place up to 2 May, so customers with events beyond that date may not have received an email yet. In the US, Ticketmaster has been at the centre of a row over allegations it changed its terms on refunds after the coronavirus shutdown began. While that relates only to the US, the Covid-19 statement on Ticketmaster\u2019s UK website this week said little about refunds, other than that because of the high number of cancellations and rescheduled events, \u201cwe encourage you not to reach out directly with a refund request\u201d. Again, unhappy customers have been tweeting about their experiences, with many saying they are waiting for refunds for cancelled perfomances and that their emails to the company have been ignored. Ticketmaster UK says that for cancelled events customers will automatically receive a refund on to the card they used to buy the tickets \u2013 they do not need to do anything. If a show is rescheduled, tickets will remain valid for the new date, though if the booker cannot attend they can ask for a refund. Ticketmaster says all refunds have either been processed or are being processed, and that for rescheduled shows, currently 98% of fans are opting to keep hold of their tickets for the new date. While scores of ticket companies and venues are signed up to Star and abide by its code of practice, there are smaller festivals, local theatre shows and other events where the organiser is not a member and will have its own terms and conditions. In some cases these will be facing a precarious future. Some people have donated the value of their tickets to venues to keep them going.

This right could be useful if an event has been postponed but the firm goes bust before the show is due to take place. In terms of what is a \u201creasonable\u201d period within which refunds have to be made, one ticketing expert says normally it would be about 14 days, however, these are extraordinary times.

But experts said consumers \u201cdo not have to take this lying down,\u201d and urged them to switch to one of the accounts still offering a semi-decent rate. The financial information firm Moneyfacts said savings deals were being \u201cpulled left, right and centre\u201d as banks and building societies reacted to the emergency measures to support the economy during the coronavirus crisis. Providers have been cutting already low rates. For example, NatWest\u2019s instant-access primary savings account currently pays between 0.1% and 0.25% depending on the balance.

The campaign, which will be rolled out next week, aims to encourage people to use vital services \u2013 such as cancer screening and care, maternity appointments and mental health support \u2013 as they usually would. The NHS chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, said delays in getting treatment posed a long-term risk to people\u2019s health.

While NHS staff have worked hard to put in place measures allowing people to access care safely \u2013 such as splitting services into coronavirus and non-coronavirus \u2013 attendances at A&amp;E departments are on course to be 1m lower this April than last.

Below is a look at how some other areas of the health service have been affected by coronavirus. Cancer The number of urgent referrals by GPs of people with suspected cancer has dropped by 75% during the pandemic, according to Cancer Research UK. Screening services have been formally paused in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and are de facto paused in England as invitations are not being sent out from screening hubs. One NHS chief executive was concerned to see GP referrals for two-week target turnaround cancer diagnostics drop from 500 a week to 105, NHS Providers reported. Heart attacks and strokes The latest Public Health England data, for 13-19 April, shows that the number of people attending emergency departments in England with symptoms of a possible heart attack was down by around 40% on numbers seen at the beginning of March. NHS England is putting figures together on the drop in stroke patients. Tony Rudd, clinical lead at the National Stroke Audit, said: \u201cNearly everywhere has seen a fairly dramatic drop-off in patients admitted for acute stroke, although it may be picking up again a bit over last week or so.\u201d Ambulance waiting times Response time for the most common ambulance callouts rose 45% in March nationally and almost trebled in London, NHS England data shows. The national average response time for a category two call \u2013 those classified as an emergency but not immediately life-threatening \u2013 rose to 32 minutes 6 seconds against an 18-minute target. Non-urgent operations Tens of thousands of non-urgent surgeries have been cancelled to free up space for coronavirus patients, with wards turned into intensive care units. Several acute trust chief executives have told the Health Service Journal that they are keen to resume more planned operations, as ministers and scientists say the peak of new Covid-19 cases may have passed. Some trust leaders said they believed routine elective surgery could be restarted as early as next week. Mental health Children\u2019s mental health services across England have recorded a sharp fall in referrals. \u201cThere is no overall figure [on referrals], but we are having discussions about this.

      "bodyText": "Good evening and here is our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Naaman Zhou bringing you the main stories on Saturday 25 April. Death toll rises to 80 Australia\u2019s national coronavirus death toll has risen after a 90-year-old man died in Tasmania on Friday night. Investigations are continuing into the source of the outbreak in the north-west of the state, but it is thought it began with a passenger from the Ruby Princess cruise ship. South Australia records third day with no new cases South Australia has recorded no new cases of Covid-19 for the third day in a row \u2013 the second three-day streak since a \u201ctesting blitz\u201d began last Thursday. From this Thursday, premier Steven Marshall said, the state may be ready to begin sentinel or surveillance testing. Meanwhile NSW recorded 12 new cases of Covid-19, its highest daily increase in a week. Four of those cases are at Newmarch House aged care home. Victorian Liberals consider applying for jobkeeper The Victorian branch of the Liberal party will explore the possibility of accessing the jobkeeper payment for its 12 employees after donations dried up. The party\u2019s administrative committee voted for the state director, Sam McQuestin, to \u201cexplore\u201d whether they would eligible for the scheme. Apple and Google update coronavirus app The tech giants have changed their planned contact tracing tool \u2013 which could or could not be integrated into Australia\u2019s coronavirus app. The Apple-Google app has been changed to encrypt metadata for Bluetooth communications and exclude people who are further away from you. However, the Australian government has not yet confirmed if it will use the Apple-Google tool, or these new elements. Anzac Day marked in isolation Ceremonies around Australia and New Zealand were held with small crowds or outside houses to mark Anzac Day. At the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, nurse Sharon Bown spoke at a televised but empty dawn service. The veteran combat nurse called on Australians to protect the most vulnerable during the coronavirus pandemic. Coalition MPs ask for permanent jobseeker increase The Nationals MP Pat Conaghan and the former prime minister Tony Abbott have asked Scott Morrison to make the higher jobseeker rate permanent when the coronavirus pandemic is over. Before the pandemic, the unemployment allowance (previously called Newstart) was only $40 a day, and had not been raised in real terms since 1994. Potential app to make league fans self-isolate for 14 days before game The chairman of the Australian Rugby League Commission has floated the possibility of having rugby league fans download an app and \u201cself-isolate\u201d for 14 days if they want to go to the State of Origin. Peter V\u2019landys has said the three-game series will go ahead at the end of the year, but the commission is still exploring ways to have a safer or smaller crowd. Kerry Stokes visits Canberra after WA quarantine The billionaire media mogul Kerry Stokes, who obtained an exemption from hotel quarantine and was allowed to go directly to his home after returning from overseas, travelled to Canberra for today\u2019s Anzac Day ceremony. Stokes had completed his 14-day quarantine in WA, but the state retains a border closure, meaning he cannot return to the state without again going into quarantine, unless he is granted an exemption.

      "body": "<p>Research to find a cure and effective treatment for Covid-19 is well under way, with <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01010-7\">hundreds of trials</a> already announced. But very few involve African researchers, and this is a mistake.</p> <p>Although Africa has yet to feel the full force of the coronavirus, preventing severe cases is a higher priority than it is elsewhere. Africa needs research that is tailored to our reality.</p> <p>Even hospitals in New York are overwhelmed; hospitals in many African countries barely have enough ventilators to fill one room. So research needs to be directed towards preventing hospitalisations, potentially though treatment of mild cases as early as possible.</p> <p>If research is not conducted in Africa, potential life-saving innovations will be delayed, not least because regulatory authorities in Africa will require local data on Covid-19 patients to register any new drug.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Local researchers are also more likely to maintain the trust of the population. Outrageous <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52151722\">comments made recently by two French researchers</a> about using Africa as a testing ground for vaccines have sparked fury throughout the continent. The indignation is understandable: just because there is a health crisis does not mean research ethics can be violated.</p> <p>Such careless talk threatens to undermine years of work by African scientists to gain trust among people.</p> <p>I am an infectious diseases researcher in Nairobi and a medical doctor. I have dedicated my career to developing better treatments for kala-azar, the \u201cblack fever\u201d, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/may/18/hope-in-battle-against-deadliest-disease-youve-never-heard-of\">deadly parasitic illness</a> that affects the most vulnerable people across eastern Africa. Too many patients \u2013 especially children \u2013 die because of the lack of effective tests and treatments for this disease.</p> <p>I see doctors on the news in New York and Milan telling their harrowing experiences of battling for patients with Covid-19 in the absence of a cure. As it knocks on our doors, I see their helplessness as a mirror of my own: when the treatment you need to save a life simply does not exist.</p> <p>I believe that our response to Covid-19 can be informed by our experience with kala-azar research.</p> <p>To find an effective treatment, I have travelled to the remotest areas of Kenya to sit with local leaders and gain their trust \u2013 explaining why clinical trials are vital to their communities. They have welcomed us as African researchers. As the Covid-19 threat looms, I feel this goodwill is at risk.</p> <p>In 2003, scientists, doctors and ministries of health from Kenya, Sudan, Ethiopia and, eventually, Uganda, decided that we needed to set our own research priorities for kala-azar.

      "bodyText": "Research to find a cure and effective treatment for Covid-19 is well under way, with hundreds of trials already announced. But very few involve African researchers, and this is a mistake. Although Africa has yet to feel the full force of the coronavirus, preventing severe cases is a higher priority than it is elsewhere. Africa needs research that is tailored to our reality. Even hospitals in New York are overwhelmed; hospitals in many African countries barely have enough ventilators to fill one room. So research needs to be directed towards preventing hospitalisations, potentially though treatment of mild cases as early as possible. If research is not conducted in Africa, potential life-saving innovations will be delayed, not least because regulatory authorities in Africa will require local data on Covid-19 patients to register any new drug. Local researchers are also more likely to maintain the trust of the population. Outrageous comments made recently by two French researchers about using Africa as a testing ground for vaccines have sparked fury throughout the continent. The indignation is understandable: just because there is a health crisis does not mean research ethics can be violated. Such careless talk threatens to undermine years of work by African scientists to gain trust among people. I am an infectious diseases researcher in Nairobi and a medical doctor. I have dedicated my career to developing better treatments for kala-azar, the \u201cblack fever\u201d, a deadly parasitic illness that affects the most vulnerable people across eastern Africa. Too many patients \u2013 especially children \u2013 die because of the lack of effective tests and treatments for this disease. I see doctors on the news in New York and Milan telling their harrowing experiences of battling for patients with Covid-19 in the absence of a cure. As it knocks on our doors, I see their helplessness as a mirror of my own: when the treatment you need to save a life simply does not exist. I believe that our response to Covid-19 can be informed by our experience with kala-azar research. To find an effective treatment, I have travelled to the remotest areas of Kenya to sit with local leaders and gain their trust \u2013 explaining why clinical trials are vital to their communities. They have welcomed us as African researchers. As the Covid-19 threat looms, I feel this goodwill is at risk. In 2003, scientists, doctors and ministries of health from Kenya, Sudan, Ethiopia and, eventually, Uganda, decided that we needed to set our own research priorities for kala-azar. Collectively, we ran large multi-country clinical trials to improve the toxic, ineffective, burdensome treatment options for kala-azar at the time. It was not easy \u2013 clinical sites were in areas marked by conflict and extreme poverty. But we endured, bringing clinical trial sites up to international standards, and together delivered an effective, shorter-course treatment that is now recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). We need to now come together in the same spirit to develop adapted solutions for Covid-19 in Africa. The Solidarity trial being run by the WHO has begun to include African countries, which is a good sign. A recently launched Clinical Research Coalition for Covid-19 is another important move, bringing together governments and research institutions to accelerate research in low- and middle-income countries. With kala-azar research, African countries showed that we could run high-quality clinical trials by working together, along with our international partners. This was research for Africans, by Africans. There are other examples: the Democratic Republic of the Congo led research, along with neighbouring countries, for the first all-oral treatment for sleeping sickness. Against all odds, Congolese researchers brought world-class clinical research to the most remote areas of the country. African-led clinical research can help us continue to build trust and confidence within our communities by showing them that our scientists are setting the priorities that make the most sense for our people. We must continue to work together and take control of our own research agenda. This is the best way to support our fellow African doctors, who have been on the frontline of so many disease outbreaks in the past and will be again very soon. \u2022 Dr Monique Wasunna is director of the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative\u2019s Africa regional office",

      "bodyText": "For the first weeks of the pandemic in St Louis, Missouri, the only ones to die from the virus were black. By 8 April the coronavirus had killed 12 people. Each and every one was African American. In this midwestern city that six years ago became the focal point for a national debate on race and policing after an unarmed African American teenager, Michael Brown, was killed by police in the suburb of Ferguson, the racial disparity attached to the Covid-19 death toll held a particular resonance. \u201cIt\u2019s an education system issue, it\u2019s a health and resources system issue and it\u2019s a public transportation issue,\u201d said Cedric \u201cC-sharp\u201d Redmon, a local rap artist and youth ambassador for the city of St Louis who is part of the city\u2019s outreach efforts, as he attempted to pinpoint the root causes of the disproportionate death toll. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff that would need to be rectified in order to stop something like this again.\u201d The death toll in St Louis now stands at 21, with 64% of all Covid-19 cases in the city being African American. They make up only 45% of the population. Although a nationwide statistical picture is nowhere near complete, St Louis is far from an anecdotal outlier. Major US cities including Chicago, New York and New Orleans report similar racial disparities in the thousands of lives now claimed by Covid-19. In 2014, Brown\u2019s death split the United States between those ready to recognise the entrenched racism that underpinned the black community\u2019s experience with law enforcement, and those unwilling to do so. In 2020, Covid-19 has begun to divide the country between those ready to explore the structural racism ingrained in America\u2019s public health outcomes, and those who are not. Earlier in the month, Donald Trump described evidence of the disproportionate effect of Covid-19 on black communities as \u201cterrible\u201d and a \u201ctremendous challenge\u201d, but the president has done little to respond to it since. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the administration\u2019s leading public health agency, has begun to publish more detailed data on the racial breakdown of confirmed coronavirus cases. But of the 828,441 confirmed cases documented, only 36% are broken down by race, largely due to many states and municipalities not recording racial data on those who test positive. According to the Associated Press, the CDC has offered little pathway to assist local governments to better record this information. In a marker of the pressing need to address this glaring hole in the national picture, Democrats in Congress introduced legislation last week to compel US government health officials to publish daily data on the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths broken down by race. \u201cBecause of government-sponsored discrimination and systemic racism, communities of color are on the frontlines of this pandemic,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the bill\u2019s backers, said in a statement. \u201cTo effectively slow the spread of the virus and ensure our response is robust and equitable, we need comprehensive national data on who is getting infected, who is getting treatment, and who is dying.\u201d Key aspects of the bill were passed as part of the latest coronavirus relief package on Friday. There are currently no Republican co-sponsors of the full legislation in the house. As with much of the scattergun approach to the pandemic in the US, the Trump administration has largely left the states to administer their own responses to racial disparities. In Michigan, one of the first states to create a racial disparity Covid-19 taskforce, the lieutenant governor, Garlin Gilchrist, told the Guardian that Trump \u201cis simply not taking strong enough action\u201d to address the disparities. The state began monitoring racial outcomes early in the pandemic. Over 2,900 people have now died in Michigan, with African Americans constituting 40% of the death toll, but only 14% of the population. Gilchrist, a Democrat, personally knows 15 people who have died from Covid-19 \u2013 all but two are black. \u201cThis is something that\u2019s very real for communities. I live in Detroit and part of the reason that communities of color are so anxious is because typically, when something so frightening is happening we come together to cope with it as a community. And this virus has made the act of coming together, dangerous and deadly.\u201d The taskforce will involve public health experts, labor organizers and politicians to examine a suite of issues believed to contribute to the disparity, from air pollution in minority neighbourhoods, less availability of testing, and the root causes of other underlying health issues, with an aim to push both real time solutions as well as longer-term legislative action. Numerous experts have pointed out how longstanding health and socio-economic disparities have made minorities more vulnerable to the worst consequences of infection along almost every point of the microbe\u2019s path. \u201cIf you look at the health conditions that we know dramatically increase the risk of death if you\u2019re infected with Sars Covid-2, African Americans have much higher prevalence of every one of those conditions. Diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, you name it, African Americans have a higher prevalence,\u201d explained Thomas LaVeist, dean and professor at Tulane\u2019s school of public health and tropical medicine. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a tragedy like this, or some sort of a major disaster occurs, it\u2019s going to be the least advantaged people who are going to be most harmed by it,\u201d he said. African Americans and Latinos are less likely to be able to work from home and more likely to be forced to take public transportation, increasing their risk of exposure to coronavirus. Minority and low-income communities are more likely to experience food insecurity, which is linked to higher rates of obesity and diabetes, and less able to stockpile supplies. Decades of segregation, discriminatory housing policies and poor environmental protections have left many African Americans living in substandard and high-density housing (where social distancing is that much harder) or areas of higher air pollution, leading to higher rates of asthma and other diseases. Racial and ethnic minorities of all education levels report they are typically less able than whites to handle financial setbacks. Black- and Hispanic-owned small businesses have less access to traditional financial lenders, making it more difficult or impossible to access coronavirus relief programs like the now drained $350bn paycheck protection program. \u201cWe need to understand that people\u2019s health is not a direct result of their behaviors and actions,\u201d said Dr Lisa Cooper, a Bloomberg distinguished professor and director of the center for health equity at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cPeople\u2019s individual actions and behaviors do play a role in health. But the environments in which they exist and the policies that we put in place that shape people\u2019s opportunities actually determine what choices they have to make.\u201d Only two states \u2013 Kansas and Illinois \u2013 are tracking racial and ethnic information on coronavirus testing, according to Johns Hopkins University. But city-level data has begun to reveal disparities in testing. An analysis last week by the New York Post found that 22 of the 30 most-tested zip codes in New York City, the center of the national outbreak, are whiter or wealthier (or both) than the city\u2019s average demographic profile. In Philadelphia, those living in higher-income zip codes have been tested at a rate six times greater than those in poor areas, according to an analysis by the Drexel University epidemiologist Usama Bilal. Rubix Life Sciences, a Massachusetts-based biotech company, recently released a report that found African Americans who reported common coronavirus symptoms were less likely to get a test. The study used patient survey and hospital billing data from seven states in February and March. Reginald Swift, CEO of the company, also said he expects to see racial disparities in access to clinical trials for experimental Covid-19 drugs. He claims trials in some cases have limited the drugs to patients without underlying illnesses, leaving out a large proportion of Covid-struck African Americans. There are also health insurance issues, where many low-cost insurance plans refuse to cover costly experimental trials. \u201cEverybody knows it\u2019s the elephant in the room,\u201d he said. Research from the last decade has also shown minorities are more likely to live in \u201chealthcare deserts\u201d. One study found black Americans were on average nearly 70% more likely to live in a zip code with a shortage of primary care physicians. African Americans in some major US cities are also more likely to live in an area with no hospital trauma center within five miles. Racial discrimination in the world of medicine has a particularly gruesome history in America, stretching back to the gynecological experiments of J Marion Sims on enslaved women in the 1840s, to the infamous Tuskegee experiment and the case of Henrietta Lacks. Cooper worried that the unprecedented stress on the healthcare system during the coronavirus crisis could exacerbate existing biases among already overloaded hospital staff. \u201cWe know that those biases tend to be increased at a time when there\u2019s a lot of stress on people,\u201d she said. Ultimately, Cooper said, the actions we take today will leave a lasting legacy in the future. \u201cWhat will people say about us?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid we think about everyone when we were trying to address this problem? Did we want to make a better life or a better country for everyone? Or do we just decide that certain groups of people didn\u2019t matter as much?\u201d Sophie Kasakove and Lauren Gambino contributed reporting",

      "body": "<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus pandemic</a> the transition from being apparently healthy to desperately ill on a ventilator can be very sudden. The experience of one day being surrounded by family, the next by people dressed as though they\u2019re in a science-fiction film must be terrifying. The fear of death is felt not only by the patient but by family and friends. In these moments, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> staff form the barrier between life and death. And the starkness of the daily images we see has brought great appreciation for those people who help us in the transition from home to hospital \u2013 and, hopefully, back again.</p> <p>Anxiety is common when we move across ordinary social boundaries or thresholds: from child to adult, from single to married, from student to graduate. We look up to those who help us, and are dependent upon their knowledge and skills to smooth the path. Currently, new boundaries are being created determining where we can go, who with and what for. Naturally, new anxieties are arising.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One consequence of elevating NHS staff to the sacred is we forget an essential element of religion: forgiveness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the most significant transition, one that fascinates and frightens us, is between existence and nonexistence. It has traditionally been the role of religion to help us make sense of this threshold, and help us across without fear \u2013 indeed, with some hope. Whether it\u2019s the ferryman crossing the River Styx or the last rites administered by a Catholic priest, belief systems and roles have been developed by most societies that can play a significant part in containing anxiety and opening up the promise of a better place to come. Today, in a modern, largely secular society, many have turned away from religion and priests as guides during this final transition.</p> <p>Working with the NHS over many years, I have for some time thought about how the NHS as an institution and its staff as individuals have come to take on, albeit unwittingly, this quasi-religious role at the end of life. The NHS has become sacred \u2013 and the sacred is always infused with symbolism. There is an assumption that those involved with the sacred have an ability to rise above normal feelings. This is exemplified by the symbolic language we constantly apply to NHS staff. They are \u201csaints\u201d; they are \u201cangels\u201d; they perform \u201cmiracles\u201d. This goes beyond the ordinary language of appreciation that we might use in relation to other people in public service.</p> <p>The applause and banging of saucepans for NHS staff springs from a genuine desire to find some form of public appreciation, but we must be wary if this new ritual makes people feel guilty if they don\u2019t join in.</p> <p>Is it not just appropriate recognition and appreciation? I think it goes beyond that. It is in effect, albeit inadvertently, elevating the NHS to the level of the sacred. My concern about this relates mainly to NHS staff members themselves. Well before the pandemic there was understandable concern about their wellbeing at work. Now we are potentially putting them under even more stress.</p> <p>The problem, I think, is one of unconscious identification. If staff are expected \u2013 publicly expected \u2013 to perform miracles, they might begin to feel that they can, or (worse) should, be able to do so. The bar is set ever higher, and stress and guilt over not meeting those standards can be detrimental to mental health and effectiveness. It is very moving to be appreciated, especially after long periods of austerity and lack of recognition. However, it can also be quite confusing when the very people who have denied pay rises and better conditions now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/uk-key-workers-ppe-ministers-clapping-protect-nhs\">join in this public appreciation</a>, reinforcing the expectation of miracles. Being called a saint or miracle-worker might be very complimentary but it may come at a price: the sense that you must conform to the image of a saint. Saints endure pain. Saints appear to need little or no rest or sustenance. Saints do not ask for pay rises. What happens when people do die, as they must? The danger is that the personal experience of the staff is one of failure and depression.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/new-zealand-nurse-i-treated-boris-johnson-like-any-other-patient\">New Zealand nurse: I treated Boris Johnson like any other patient</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Medicine is not a religion, and getting better is not simply a matter of belief or character. No matter what the advances in research, or the presence or absence of a pandemic, the NHS and its staff cannot stop us dying, even though they can prolong our lives. Of course the NHS does, and will always, play a part in managing the transition from life to death, for example in palliative care. Many have experienced directly the sensitivity of staff at such a time and their crucial work in managing a good death. However, we must be mindful that these people are human beings and take care not to idealise them. Assaults and abuse of NHS staff have risen significantly in recent years. The causes are likely to be many and varied, but it doesn\u2019t seem far-fetched that some could be the result of a failure to fulfil unrealistic expectations.</p> <p>NHS staff should not be placed under pressure to work unsafely \u2013 whether that is through long hours, the absence of appropriate PPE or the burden of unreasonable expectations. Courageous management and psychological support should be deployed to protect frontline staff from these stresses. Let us appreciate them through better pay and conditions rather than adulation for their \u201cmiracles\u201d. Let us recognise that they do have the same feelings as us \u2013 including confusion, uncertainty, fear and anger. One consequence of elevating NHS staff to the realm of the sacred is that we find ourselves in danger of forgetting an essential element of religion: forgiveness for being human.</p> <p>\u2022 Ian Macdonald is an organisational psychologist who has worked with the NHS</p>",

The experience of one day being surrounded by family, the next by people dressed as though they\u2019re in a science-fiction film must be terrifying. The fear of death is felt not only by the patient but by family and friends. In these moments, NHS staff form the barrier between life and death. And the starkness of the daily images we see has brought great appreciation for those people who help us in the transition from home to hospital \u2013 and, hopefully, back again. Anxiety is common when we move across ordinary social boundaries or thresholds: from child to adult, from single to married, from student to graduate. We look up to those who help us, and are dependent upon their knowledge and skills to smooth the path. Currently, new boundaries are being created determining where we can go, who with and what for. Naturally, new anxieties are arising. Perhaps the most significant transition, one that fascinates and frightens us, is between existence and nonexistence. It has traditionally been the role of religion to help us make sense of this threshold, and help us across without fear \u2013 indeed, with some hope. Whether it\u2019s the ferryman crossing the River Styx or the last rites administered by a Catholic priest, belief systems and roles have been developed by most societies that can play a significant part in containing anxiety and opening up the promise of a better place to come. Today, in a modern, largely secular society, many have turned away from religion and priests as guides during this final transition. Working with the NHS over many years, I have for some time thought about how the NHS as an institution and its staff as individuals have come to take on, albeit unwittingly, this quasi-religious role at the end of life. The NHS has become sacred \u2013 and the sacred is always infused with symbolism. There is an assumption that those involved with the sacred have an ability to rise above normal feelings. This is exemplified by the symbolic language we constantly apply to NHS staff. They are \u201csaints\u201d; they are \u201cangels\u201d; they perform \u201cmiracles\u201d. This goes beyond the ordinary language of appreciation that we might use in relation to other people in public service. The applause and banging of saucepans for NHS staff springs from a genuine desire to find some form of public appreciation, but we must be wary if this new ritual makes people feel guilty if they don\u2019t join in. Is it not just appropriate recognition and appreciation? I think it goes beyond that. It is in effect, albeit inadvertently, elevating the NHS to the level of the sacred. My concern about this relates mainly to NHS staff members themselves. Well before the pandemic there was understandable concern about their wellbeing at work. Now we are potentially putting them under even more stress. The problem, I think, is one of unconscious identification. If staff are expected \u2013 publicly expected \u2013 to perform miracles, they might begin to feel that they can, or (worse) should, be able to do so. The bar is set ever higher, and stress and guilt over not meeting those standards can be detrimental to mental health and effectiveness. It is very moving to be appreciated, especially after long periods of austerity and lack of recognition. However, it can also be quite confusing when the very people who have denied pay rises and better conditions now join in this public appreciation, reinforcing the expectation of miracles. Being called a saint or miracle-worker might be very complimentary but it may come at a price: the sense that you must conform to the image of a saint. Saints endure pain. Saints appear to need little or no rest or sustenance. Saints do not ask for pay rises. What happens when people do die, as they must? The danger is that the personal experience of the staff is one of failure and depression. Medicine is not a religion, and getting better is not simply a matter of belief or character. No matter what the advances in research, or the presence or absence of a pandemic, the NHS and its staff cannot stop us dying, even though they can prolong our lives. Of course the NHS does, and will always, play a part in managing the transition from life to death, for example in palliative care. Many have experienced directly the sensitivity of staff at such a time and their crucial work in managing a good death. However, we must be mindful that these people are human beings and take care not to idealise them. Assaults and abuse of NHS staff have risen significantly in recent years. The causes are likely to be many and varied, but it doesn\u2019t seem far-fetched that some could be the result of a failure to fulfil unrealistic expectations. NHS staff should not be placed under pressure to work unsafely \u2013 whether that is through long hours, the absence of appropriate PPE or the burden of unreasonable expectations. Courageous management and psychological support should be deployed to protect frontline staff from these stresses. Let us appreciate them through better pay and conditions rather than adulation for their \u201cmiracles\u201d. Let us recognise that they do have the same feelings as us \u2013 including confusion, uncertainty, fear and anger. One consequence of elevating NHS staff to the realm of the sacred is that we find ourselves in danger of forgetting an essential element of religion: forgiveness for being human. \u2022 Ian Macdonald is an organisational psychologist who has worked with the NHS",

      "body": "<p>We have always given each other strange advice in times of plague. During the yellow fever outbreak in Philadelphia in 1793, it was thought you could purify the air by firing muskets, both indoors and out, and for a while it became impossible to go for a walk without some earnest citizen shooting you in the ear. In London in 1665, it was said that powdered dried toad would protect against the terrifying sweep of death. Tobacco was used to ward off bubonic plagues, with toddlers puffing at pipes at the kitchen table.</p> <p>But there has been good advice, too, and that advice is more constant across history: we have always told each other to tell stories and try not to despair. Tomaso del Garbo, a Florentine physician working during the 14th-century Black Death, wrote that those who could not \u201cflee the pestilence\u201d must \u201cuse songs and games and pleasant stories that do not exhaust the body\u201d. Writing at the same time, Nicholas de Burgo urged that people \u201ctake care to be able to be joyful \u2026 listen to lullabies, stories and melodies\u201d. A 15th-century revised edition of Aldobrandino of Siena\u2019s <em>R\u00e9gime du Corps</em>, which circulated widely during epidemic outbreaks, told its readers to \u201cread joyful and strange things\u201d.This prescription was down, in part, to the ancient Galenic idea that fear and sorrow could alter the temperature of a person\u2019s body and thereby render them more prone to sickness: but it was also a sense that, in the midst of horror, we need to be transported.</p> <p>I am not in the Galen camp: I don\u2019t believe stories will protect us against Covid-19, any more than would strength of character or moral probity. The solutions lie with science and the radical global cooperation of governments, but we will need the stories, even so. Tales of transformation and of emancipation, both real and fictional, can be a set of stars and maps. They point us both towards action and hope. Real hope, I think, is not the promise that everything will be all right, but a sense that the world has so many complexities and possibilities that despair is misplaced; that we still live in a universe shot through with the unexpected. There has never been a decade when we have not taken ourselves by surprise: we have never yet exhausted our capacity for change. I struggle with optimism, but nor am I a pessimist; I tell the children I write for that I am a possibilityist. I truly believe in the potential for human transformation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The world has so many possibilities that despair is misplaced \u2013 our universe is shot through with the unexpected</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So a few weeks ago, in search of that defibrillation for the imagination that happens when the right reader meets the right story (and in truth, in part to fight back at my own sadness and fear), I emailed some of the children\u2019s writers and artists whose work I love most. I asked them to write something, or draw something, anything, that would offer that galvanic sense of possibility even in darkness. The response was glorious, which shouldn\u2019t have surprised me. So many children\u2019s writers and illustrators are themselves already hunters and gatherers of hope; manufacturers and peddlers of wonder.</p> <p>Now, a few weeks later, the pieces have been collected into <em>The Book of Hopes</em>. The stories and essays and images aren\u2019t explicitly about hope: rather, they aim to create it, through delight or comfort or new ideas, ridiculous jokes, wild heroic tales. There are true accounts of cats and hares and plastic-devouring caterpillars, there are doodles and flowers, revolting and beautiful poems, there are stories of space travel and new shoes and dragons. They are designed to be dipped into: you can eat one with your breakfast and another at midday. The psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott believed that during times of privation, the imagination can be a place of shelter for children. I hope that <em>The Book of Hopes</em> might help, even if only a little.</p> <p>The collection is a free downloadable PDF, hosted on the website of the <a href=\"https://literacytrust.org.uk/\">National Literacy Trust</a>. It\u2019s dedicated to the doctors, nurses, carers and all those working in hospitals to protect us: they are the stuff that wild, heroic tales are made of.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Katherine Rundell\u2019s fee for this feature has been donated to <a href=\"https://www.nhscharitiestogether.co.uk/\">NHS Charities Together</a>.

He sits on his branch and listens.</p> <p>It was blackbird\u2019s idea. He sang out this morning at dawn from his treetop in the garden, to fox half asleep behind the garden shed. She thought it a good idea too. It was a wake-up call. Fox was on her feet at once, and trotting through Bluebell Wood, where she barked it to deer who ran off across the stream. Kingfisher was there, otter and dipper too. They heard, and piped it on, and swallow swooped down over the meadow, and passed it on to cows waiting to go into their milking, and to sheep resting quietly under the hedge with her lambs in the corner of the dew-damp field.</p> <p>And they all agreed, bleating it out to bees already busy at their flowers, to weaving spiders, and grasshoppers, and scurrying mice. Trees heard sheep calling too, the whole flock of them, and waved their budding leaves in wild enthusiasm; and high above, the clouds wandered through the skies driven by wind, and wind took blackbird\u2019s idea over the cliffs across heaving seas, where gulls and albatross cried it out, and whales and dolphins and porpoises heard it, and wailed and whooped it down into the deep, where turtles listened, and they too loved the idea. So did plankton and every fish and crab and sea urchin and whelk, they all whispered that it was a fine notion, the best they ever heard.</p> <p>And the whisper went over the sea on the curling waves to the shores of Africa, where lions roared their approval, and elephants trumpeted it, leopards yawned it, water buffalo belched it, wild dogs yelped it. Wildebeest murmured it out across the savanna; and storm lifted the idea up over rainforests, where rain took it and poured it down on gorillas in the mist, on chimpanzees in their sleeping nests. Howler monkeys and gibbons echoed their calls loud over all the earth \u2013 they are that loud; and then from far up high, sun heard it too and shone it down over deserts where oryx stamped her foot impatient to be getting on with it and doing it \u2013 she loved the idea that much. Even camel, who rarely joined in anything, thought this was the best and most beautiful idea he had ever heard.</p> <p>Back in the garden, blackbird waited till everyone was ready. And then he began to sing. And the whole carnival of animals, every living thing on this good earth joined in, until the globe echoed with the joy of it.</p> <p>And blackbird was very pleased.</p> <p>But I was still lost in sadness, as I heard the earth singing around me. It was a song of forgiveness. I knew that. So I asked blackbird if I could join in. And he sang his answer back to me.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you think we are doing this, you silly man? We want you and yours to be happy again. Only then will you treat us and the world right again, as you know you should. Only then will all be well. Sing, silly man, sing, sing.

Our Lily used to pass down her boots to me, but now my feet have grown too big, even though she\u2019s much older than me. She\u2019s away in service, working as a lady\u2019s maid.</p> <p><em>I </em>don\u2019t want to be a lady\u2019s maid. I want to be the lady! My teacher says I\u2019ve got a chance of getting a scholarship to the Girls\u2019 High School next year. I go past it when I go to Biggerton market on errands for Ma. I can\u2019t see me fitting in with all those posh girls in their fancy uniform to be honest. Mind you, I don\u2019t really fit in at the village school either.</p> <p>They all call me Spud. It is not my real name, obviously. Ma gave us girls flowery names. I\u2019m Rose, and my older sisters are Lily and Violet. I\u2019m called Spud because of my brown frock. Ma made it out of cheap material, and it\u2019s so coarse it sets me itching something chronic. The children at school say it\u2019s made out of old potato sacking. Hence Spud.</p> <p>If I ever get to be a Lady I shall wear silk frocks all the shades of the rainbow.

      "bodyText": "We have always given each other strange advice in times of plague. During the yellow fever outbreak in Philadelphia in 1793, it was thought you could purify the air by firing muskets, both indoors and out, and for a while it became impossible to go for a walk without some earnest citizen shooting you in the ear. In London in 1665, it was said that powdered dried toad would protect against the terrifying sweep of death. Tobacco was used to ward off bubonic plagues, with toddlers puffing at pipes at the kitchen table. But there has been good advice, too, and that advice is more constant across history: we have always told each other to tell stories and try not to despair. Tomaso del Garbo, a Florentine physician working during the 14th-century Black Death, wrote that those who could not \u201cflee the pestilence\u201d must \u201cuse songs and games and pleasant stories that do not exhaust the body\u201d. Writing at the same time, Nicholas de Burgo urged that people \u201ctake care to be able to be joyful \u2026 listen to lullabies, stories and melodies\u201d. A 15th-century revised edition of Aldobrandino of Siena\u2019s R\u00e9gime du Corps, which circulated widely during epidemic outbreaks, told its readers to \u201cread joyful and strange things\u201d.This prescription was down, in part, to the ancient Galenic idea that fear and sorrow could alter the temperature of a person\u2019s body and thereby render them more prone to sickness: but it was also a sense that, in the midst of horror, we need to be transported. I am not in the Galen camp: I don\u2019t believe stories will protect us against Covid-19, any more than would strength of character or moral probity. The solutions lie with science and the radical global cooperation of governments, but we will need the stories, even so. Tales of transformation and of emancipation, both real and fictional, can be a set of stars and maps. They point us both towards action and hope. Real hope, I think, is not the promise that everything will be all right, but a sense that the world has so many complexities and possibilities that despair is misplaced; that we still live in a universe shot through with the unexpected. There has never been a decade when we have not taken ourselves by surprise: we have never yet exhausted our capacity for change. I struggle with optimism, but nor am I a pessimist; I tell the children I write for that I am a possibilityist. I truly believe in the potential for human transformation. So a few weeks ago, in search of that defibrillation for the imagination that happens when the right reader meets the right story (and in truth, in part to fight back at my own sadness and fear), I emailed some of the children\u2019s writers and artists whose work I love most. I asked them to write something, or draw something, anything, that would offer that galvanic sense of possibility even in darkness. The response was glorious, which shouldn\u2019t have surprised me. So many children\u2019s writers and illustrators are themselves already hunters and gatherers of hope; manufacturers and peddlers of wonder. Now, a few weeks later, the pieces have been collected into The Book of Hopes. The stories and essays and images aren\u2019t explicitly about hope: rather, they aim to create it, through delight or comfort or new ideas, ridiculous jokes, wild heroic tales. There are true accounts of cats and hares and plastic-devouring caterpillars, there are doodles and flowers, revolting and beautiful poems, there are stories of space travel and new shoes and dragons. They are designed to be dipped into: you can eat one with your breakfast and another at midday. The psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott believed that during times of privation, the imagination can be a place of shelter for children. I hope that The Book of Hopes might help, even if only a little. The collection is a free downloadable PDF, hosted on the website of the National Literacy Trust. It\u2019s dedicated to the doctors, nurses, carers and all those working in hospitals to protect us: they are the stuff that wild, heroic tales are made of. \u2022 Katherine Rundell\u2019s fee for this feature has been donated to NHS Charities Together. Her latest adventure story, The Good Thieves, is published by Bloomsbury. The Book of Hopes is available at literacytrust.org.uk. * * * New Classmates by Emily Gravett Emily Gravett is the illustrator and author of Meerkat Mail and The Odd Egg (Two Hoots). * * * Hope by Anthony Horowitz The town of Hope, near Aberdeen Is somewhere I have seldom been But then it\u2019s not a tourist trap \u2013 It isn\u2019t even on the map! There\u2019s certainly not much to see They\u2019ve closed the local library Because they said there is no need When no-one in the town can read They\u2019ve got a pub and a hotel But neither of them\u2019s doing well The hotel isn\u2019t quite the Ritz The beds have fleas: the staff have nits The only pub, \u201cThe Rose and Crown\u201d Is easily the worst in town The one theatre\u2019s sadly gone It burned down while a play was on (The critics thought the play so dire That all of them preferred the fire.) The cinema is second rate The films are always out of date The last James Bond film that I saw Had Bond still played by Roger Moore. The pavements are never clean Because the council\u2019s far too mean To pay for cleaners \u2013 and the park Is only open after dark The grass is lumpy, full of weeds And dogs can only walk on leads There is a children\u2019s playground but When school is finished, it is shut The Chief of Police is eighty-two He can\u2019t catch crooks. He can\u2019t catch flu! The vicar surely won\u2019t be missed Since he\u2019s become an atheist The mayor sold his golden chain And then was never seen again The local paper isn\u2019t bought Because there\u2019s nothing to report. The school is like a concrete bunker Matron\u2019s drunk. The head is drunker. Now, living here must really stink At least, that is what you might think But that is simply not the case There is no more delightful place The fun and laughter never ends Everyone is best of friends. And all the residents agree There\u2019s nowhere else they\u2019d rather be. So if you\u2019re feeling uninspired, Sleeping badly, waking tired If everything is going wrong. The day feels dark, the night\u2019s too long Remember all the people who Have found the following is true: It\u2019s so much easier to cope If you decide to live in Hope. \u00a9 Anthony Horowitz 2020 \u2022 Anthony Horowitz\u2019s latest book in the Alex Rider series, Nightshade, is published by Walker. * * * The Hope Tree by Axel Scheffler Axel Scheffler is the illustrator of The Gruffalo, Zog and Room on the Broom (Pan Macmillan). His latest work is Coronavirus, a free book explaining the pandemic to children. * * * A Song of Gladness by Michael Morpurgo I\u2019ve been talking every morning to blackbird, telling him why we are all so sad at the moment. He sits on his branch and listens. It was blackbird\u2019s idea. He sang out this morning at dawn from his treetop in the garden, to fox half asleep behind the garden shed. She thought it a good idea too. It was a wake-up call. Fox was on her feet at once, and trotting through Bluebell Wood, where she barked it to deer who ran off across the stream. Kingfisher was there, otter and dipper too. They heard, and piped it on, and swallow swooped down over the meadow, and passed it on to cows waiting to go into their milking, and to sheep resting quietly under the hedge with her lambs in the corner of the dew-damp field. And they all agreed, bleating it out to bees already busy at their flowers, to weaving spiders, and grasshoppers, and scurrying mice. Trees heard sheep calling too, the whole flock of them, and waved their budding leaves in wild enthusiasm; and high above, the clouds wandered through the skies driven by wind, and wind took blackbird\u2019s idea over the cliffs across heaving seas, where gulls and albatross cried it out, and whales and dolphins and porpoises heard it, and wailed and whooped it down into the deep, where turtles listened, and they too loved the idea. So did plankton and every fish and crab and sea urchin and whelk, they all whispered that it was a fine notion, the best they ever heard. And the whisper went over the sea on the curling waves to the shores of Africa, where lions roared their approval, and elephants trumpeted it, leopards yawned it, water buffalo belched it, wild dogs yelped it. Wildebeest murmured it out across the savanna; and storm lifted the idea up over rainforests, where rain took it and poured it down on gorillas in the mist, on chimpanzees in their sleeping nests. Howler monkeys and gibbons echoed their calls loud over all the earth \u2013 they are that loud; and then from far up high, sun heard it too and shone it down over deserts where oryx stamped her foot impatient to be getting on with it and doing it \u2013 she loved the idea that much. Even camel, who rarely joined in anything, thought this was the best and most beautiful idea he had ever heard. Back in the garden, blackbird waited till everyone was ready. And then he began to sing. And the whole carnival of animals, every living thing on this good earth joined in, until the globe echoed with the joy of it. And blackbird was very pleased. But I was still lost in sadness, as I heard the earth singing around me. It was a song of forgiveness. I knew that. So I asked blackbird if I could join in. And he sang his answer back to me. \u201cWhy do you think we are doing this, you silly man? We want you and yours to be happy again. Only then will you treat us and the world right again, as you know you should. Only then will all be well. Sing, silly man, sing, sing. Our song is your song, your song is our song.\u201d So I sang, we all sang, sang away our sadness. In every house and flat and cottage, we clapped and sang, in every hut and tent, in every palace and hospital and prison. And they heard and we heard our song of gladness echoing all together, in glorious harmony across the universe. \u00a9 Michael Morpurgo 2020 \u2022 Michael Morpurgo founded the Farms for City Children charity. * * * Peanut by Rob Biddulph Rob Biddulph is the illustrator of books including Blown Away, GRRRRR! and Odd Dog Out (HarperCollins Children\u2019s Books). * * * HOPE by Chris Haughton Chris Haughton is the illustrator and author of Oh No, George! and A Bit Lost (Walker Books). * * * Care of Exotic Pets: Number 1.

      "bodyText": "Just recapping the major developments of the day again: The death toll from Covid-19 in Australia now sits at 81, with the death on Saturday of an 83-year-old man who was a resident at Newmarch House aged care home and a 90-year-old man in Tasmania on Friday. It\u2019s the sixth death at Newmarch House. An aged care worker in the Blue Mountains is among 12 people to have tested positive to Covid-19 in NSW overnight, the highest daily total in seven days. South Australia has recorded no new cases for the third day in a row and is preparing to start sentinel testing next week. The Liberal party and the ALP are reportedly considering applying for the jobkeeper payment. Beaches in eastern Sydney have been shut again, after attracting crowds. The media mogul Kerry Stokes, who is also the chairman of the Australian War Memorial Council, flew to Canberra to participate in the only official Anzac Day ceremony to be held today as thousands of Australians and New Zealanders, including the New Zealand PM, marked the day by lighting a candle in their driveway. You can read a more extensive summary here and follow the rolling global coverage here. Once again, goodnight. An 83-year-old man has become the sixth person to die at Sydney aged care home Newmarch House after testing positive to Covid-19. It brings Australia\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus to 81. Anglicare Sydney said the man died on Saturday morning, and had \u201cmultiple health issues\u201d. His family were contacted where they were able to visit and pay their respects. All the relevant authorities have been informed. His cause of death will be officially confirmed over the coming days. We continue to think of, pray for, and remember all our residents who have died and for their families as they mourn the loss of their loved ones. Just dipping back in to let you know that a woman who works at the Catholic Healthcare Bodington aged care home in Wentworth Falls, in the Blue Mountains, has tested positive to Covid-19, according to reports. The woman had reportedly not been at work for 48 hours before showing symptoms. She tested positive yesterday. The aged care home has 120 residents. With that, we will say goodnight again. We will leave you here for the day. You can continue to follow our rolling global coverage of the coronavirus crisis here and read a summary of the day\u2019s news in Australia here. South Australia has recorded its third day in a row with no new cases despite expanded testing, the second time in a week they have reached that milestone. New South Wales recorded 12 new cases \u2013 its biggest daily increase since last Saturday \u2013 including four new cases at the Newmarch House aged care home. Victoria recorded three new cases, including one more among inpatients at a private psychiatric facility. Fifteen people \u2013 nine staff members and five patients \u2013 have tested positive at the clinic. Tasmania recorded two new cases and the death of a 90-year-old man, bringing the national death toll to 80. Queensland also recorded two new cases, while Western Australia and the ACT both recorded one. Beaches in Sydney\u2019s east were closed again at 9am today after crowds flocked to them on Friday and Saturday morning. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said he was disappointed people still can\u2019t be trusted not to go to the beach when the beach is open. A flight carrying about 180 Australians and New Zealanders will arrive in Melbourne tomorrow night. It\u2019s the last government-supported repatriation flight from Argentina. Anzac Day was celebrated quietly and privately, with people lighting a candle in their driveway and listening to the sound of a bugle or trumpet sounding the Last Post across their suburb. Scott Morrison led a small dawn service at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, which was also attended by the media mogul Kerry Stokes. Stokes is the chairman of the Australian War Memorial Council and had only recently cleared quarantine at home in Perth, having obtained an exemption to mandatory hotel quarantine for medical reasons. And both the Liberal party and the ALP are reportedly planning to apply for the $1,500 per week jobkeeper payments for party staffers, citing a fall in donations. But their year-on-year results are skewed by the 2019 election (that was less than 12 months ago!) which was preceded by higher-than-usual donations. Stay at home and stay well, we\u2019ll see you in the morning. News Corp\u2019s Samantha Maiden has reported that national officials for the Liberal and Labor parties are considering applying for the jobkeeper payment. It follows that earlier report in the Age that the Victorian Liberal party is considering applying for the payment, despite concerns from some party officials that it will be a \u201cbad look\u201d. Maiden writes that it is a \u201ccheeky proposition for political parties to claim it because donations always nosedive after an election\u201d. The St Vincent de Paul Society has welcomed changes to the jobkeeper payment announced yesterday, to exclude government grants from revenue calculations. Registered charities are eligible for the program, which pays out $1,500 per employee per fortnight to cover employee wages, if they have had a decline in turnover of 15% or more. Amendments announced on Friday mean that calculation will now exclude government grants, so that charities don\u2019t miss out on support because they have, for example, received funding to support bushfire victims. Here\u2019s the St Vincent de Paul Society national council CEO, Toby O\u2019Connor: The St Vincent de Paul Society is one of many charities in Australia which has received government funding to help ameliorate the impact of the drought, bushfires and Covid-19. The government\u2019s announcement addresses any unintended consequence of the jobkeeper assistance package which would have required charities to include government grants which are distributed to Australians in need. In other news, it is world penguin day. A bit more on that two-week testing blitz that has been conducted in South Australia. Between 16 April and 30 April, all South Australians with any symptoms of Covid-19 are eligible to be tested. SA is the first state in the country to introduce such a broad testing regime, although all other jurisdictions have now followed suit. The next stage of the testing is currently being designed. Steven Marshall says his state has \u201cplenty of testing reagent\u201d and will be looking at doing targeted testing as well as potentially sentinel or surveillance testing in SA. He also promoted the coronavirus tracing app, which is expected to be released some time next week. We will be very keen to promote it. I certainly will be downloading it. The South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, says his government received a letter from the AFL yesterday, canvassing the possibility of establishing an \u201cAFL hub\u201d in the state. The AFL is feeling out every footy-playing state as a potential hub to host the game, on the assumption that if the season is to resume all players and teams will have to be located in the same place to minimise the risk of infection and get around border restrictions. Unsurprisingly, the Sydney Swans want the AFL to choose NSW. Marshall says he would love to host the AFL in Adelaide, but he\u2019s awaiting health advice from the AHPPC, which will come in the national cabinet meeting on Friday. He says: We will do what we are advised to by the health authorities ... if the risk is acceptable then I would be very keen to see AFL. I would be very keen to see the FFA. I would be keen to see a lot of sport back here in SA. But we don\u2019t want to shoot ourselves in the foot at the last point. We have done really well in SA, we have to stay the course. South Australian AFL fans are really, really, really into their footy so this would go down very well in Adelaide, with the bonus of being the bitterest pill to Melbourne. The AFL has said it will make an announcement about the resumption of the season this week. A reporter at the press conference in Adelaide asks Cusack if he is concerned that if South Australia continues to report no new cases people will begin to relax their adherence to social distancing laws. Cusack says that\u2019s just \u201can expression of human nature\u201d, but if you explain the reason behind public health orders people are more likely to comply. He says: I think if people understand why they are being asked to behave in a certain way or why they are being asked to comply with certain directions then I think it\u2019s much easier for them to do so. I think what we see from other countries, where perhaps that messaging has been less clear is where we perhaps see less compliance and, unfortunately, the very serious effects that the virus can have in those communities. South Australia has recorded no new coronavirus cases for the third day in a row. This is the state\u2019s second three-day streak \u2013 it also recorded no new cases for three days over last weekend, before recording three cases midweek. The state\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, Mike Cusack, says there are currently 32 active cases in SA, including four people in hospital. Two people \u2013 a 68-year-old man and a 75-year-old man \u2013 are in intensive care in the Royal Adelaide hospital and are in a \u201ccritical condition\u201d, Cusack says. The state is currently undertaking a testing \u201cblitz\u201d, which is due to finish on Thursday. It has conducted 51,000 tests since February. Cusack says the state will now start doing targeted testing, including testing groups of asymptomatic people, to ensure there is no undetected spread in the community. Coogee beach in Sydney was closed at 9am today. This photo, of the scenes that disappointed the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, was apparently snapped at 9.11am. I\u2019ll be handing over the blog now to my colleague Calla Wahlquist. Thanks for following along today, and stay safe. Today\u2019s news in one image: Western Australia has recorded only one new case of Covid-19, taking the state\u2019s total to 549. The person who contracted the virus is a 65-year-old woman in metropolitan Perth, linked to the Costa Luminosa cruise ship, according to WA Health. 16 people are in Perth hospitals with Covid-19, including four in intensive care. The chairman of the Australian Rugby League Commission has floated the possibility of having rugby fans download an app and \u201cself-isolate\u201d for 14 days if they want to go to the State of Origin. Peter V\u2019landys made the comments to Triple M radio this morning, saying he was looking at ways to hold the event with a safer or smaller crowd. The ARLC has already announced that a three-game Origin series will be held at the end of the year, but the exact details are yet to be determined. Today V\u2019landys floated a number of possibilities, including holding the games in a way that \u201crewards health workers\u201d. \u201cWe may not have the crowds of a normal State of Origin, but a limited crowd with social distancing, and there\u2019s a few ideas we have in rewarding the emergency workers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s another one where we put people on an app and if you\u2019re a really hardcore supporter and you can stay at home for 14 days and isolate yourself and we track you on the app, you can go to the game. \u201cThere\u2019s a few things we can do in that period of time.\u201d Some photos now from Anzac Cove in Turkey, empty save for some wreaths laid this morning. You may have been reading our weekly How we stay together column. Well don\u2019t forget that you can be a part of it Share your story, and tell us how you stay together during this trying time. More information and the form are below: People are getting creative wth Anzac Day under lockdown rules: The ACT has recorded only one new case of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, taking its total to 106. The person is a woman under 30 and it is \u201c believed to be related to overseas travel\u201d, ACT health said. The territory\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Kerryn Coleman, has reminded people to stay at home. \u201cWith nice weather today we know that Canberrans will want to get out and about,\u201d she said. \u201cWhilst we understand that staying active and connected is important, please avoid any unnecessary travel, gatherings of people, and do not use playgrounds, skate parks, outdoor exercise stations or dog parks.\u201d The billionaire media mogul Kerry Stokes \u2013 who you may recall was granted an exemption to hotel quarantine on medical grounds and allowed to self-isolate in his Perth mansion upon returning from the US in his private jet earlier this month \u2013 travelled to Canberra for Anzac Day. He and his wife, Christine Simpson Stokes, completed their mandatory 14-day quarantine on Wednesday. Stokes is the chairman of the Australian War Memorial council. He and Simpson Stokes laid a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier this morning. They were photographed doing so by Alex Ellinghausen, who was the pool photographer for the day, and reporters at WAToday.com.au, which first reported on Stokes\u2019s quarantine exemption, picked it up. There are no travel restrictions on entering either the ACT or NSW from another part of Australia. But the hard border remains in place in WA, so if they return to Perth before that\u2019s lifted they will be subject to another mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine period \u2013 unless they again apply for and are granted an exemption. About 900 people have been granted an exemption so far, on medical, compassionate, or other grounds. I asked Stokes\u2019s public relations contact whether they planned to apply for an another exemption and was told the couple had gone on to their home in Sydney. I\u2019m seeking further clarification on whether they intend to remain there until the hard border is lifted. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, is \u201cdisappointed\u201d in Sydneysiders who flocked to recently reopened beaches in Sydney\u2019s east, prompting them to be swiftly closed again. \u201cI have to express a degree of disappointment and agitationa bout the fact that some people, when the rules are relaxed, when we try and do the right thing by giving people the opportunity to have some outside exercise, [they] are disregarding the very strong message of social distancing,\u201d he said earlier today. Coogee, Clovelly and Maroubra beaches were all closed on Friday after being open for only a few days. Victoria has recorded three more cases of Covid-19, bringing the total to 1,346. One is linked to a private inpatient psychiatric facility, bringing the total number of cases linked to that cluster to 15. At least five of those infected were patients, the rest were staff. The deputy chief health officer, Dr Annaliese van Diemen, is due to give an update shortly. Twenty-four people remain in hospital in Victoria and 11 are in intensive care. Sixteen people have died. 93.7% of all cases have recovered, and the level of active cases sits at 68. 135 cases in Victoria are confirmed to have been acquired through untraced community transmission. Only two new cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in Queensland overnight, despite what the health minister described as record testing. Stephen Miles said 2,093 tests were undertaken in the past 24 hours. The state\u2019s total is 1,026: 217 people are still considered active cases, 803 people have recovered and six people have died. Hazzard is asked if sunlight can kill the virus. \u201cI watched Mr Trump with amazement, that is all I can really say,\u201d he says. NSW has recorded 12 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, the health minister, Brad Hazzard, has just said. About 150 Australians and New Zealanders are scheduled to leave Buenos Aires on Saturday afternoon local time in what will be the final government-supported repatriation flight from Argentina. The Qantas flight is due to land in Melbourne at 7.30pm on Sunday. It was announced last weekend, after an earlier attempt to organise a commercial flight was delayed. Argentina has closed its borders, meaning the flight was only open to those already in the country. Another flight is due to leave Uruguay on Sunday. In a video message on Facebook an hour ago, Brett Hackett, the Australian ambassador to Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, urged everyone booked on the flight to be punctual when picked up from their hotel and taken to the embassy for medical checks. \u201cFor some of you there will be periods of sitting around doing very little tomorrow either at the embassy while you are awaiting your medical clearance or at the airport,\u201d Hackett said. \u201cThis is simply an unavoidable fact. We have to comply with the rules that the government of the province of Buenos Aires, the city of Buenos Aires and the federal government have imposed on us. \u201cWe understand that you will be impatient but you have to understand that we need to comply with the rules that are given to us.\u201d Hackett said the embassy had to cancel its Anzac Day commemorations because of Argentina\u2019s lockdown: \u201cBut I reckon helping Australians and New Zealanders return home on the 25th of April is just as good if not better.\u201d A bit more from AAP on the death of a 90-year-old man in Tasmania from coronavirus. The man, who was from the state\u2019s north-west, died at the Mersey Community hospital in Latrobe on Friday. \u201cOn behalf of the Tasmanian government I would like to extend my heartfelt sympathies to [his] family, friends and loved ones,\u201d the premier, Peter Gutwein, said on Saturday. The man\u2019s death takes the national Covid-19 toll to 80. The Victorian health department will give an update at 1pm. The Victorian branch of the Liberal party is considering applying for the jobkeeper payment, the Age reports. The state branch is looking for ways to pay its 12 employees after donations reportedly \u201cfell off a cliff\u201d and finances dried up during the pandemic. The party\u2019s administrative committee voted for the state director, Sam McQuestin, to \u201cexplore\u201d whether they would eligible for the scheme. A 90-year-old man has died at Tasmania\u2019s Mersey Community hospital, the ABC reports. This takes the national death toll from Covid-19 to 80. Victoria police have issued 55 fines in the past 24 hours for people breaching coronavirus restrictions. That includes busting \u201cfive friends having a party in Melbourne\u2019s north-west\u201d. They conducted 879 spot checks on homes and businesses over the past 24 hours. Overnight Apple and Google announced some changes to their planned tool for contact tracing that can be integrated into apps such as the one the Australian government has made. The most noteworthy change is that the IDs used for figuring out who you\u2019ve been around are more randomised now, and the metadata for Bluetooth communications will be encrypted. The other big change is that the app developers will be given information about the power level of Bluetooth signal in the data exchanged between phones. This means it\u2019ll be easier for app developers to get a precise measure of how close you are to someone else in deciding whether you would be a close contact who should get tested in the event someone you\u2019re nearby tests positive for coronavirus. This is better because it is likely to exclude, for example, people in adjacent cars to you in traffic. If it is developed properly. For more background on the Apple-Google version of contact tracing you can read our explainer here. So far the Australian government appears reluctant to integrate this into the app we\u2019re going to get soon. The biggest issue we are likely to see from the Australian app, aside from the privacy concerns, is the Singapore version of the same app for iPhones requires you to keep the app open in order to work. The proposal by Apple and Google does not require that. And some music and culture for you for the weekend. In Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, musicians are in lockdown but streaming free dance and music to communities that ordinarily would be together. The livestreams begin today. And every Saturday, Guardian Australia\u2019s culture desk add 15 new songs from local artists to a Spotify playlist \u2013 designed to get you through physical distancing and help your favourite musos get paid. This month another 49 organisations have missed out on Australia Council funding in yet another blow to Australian music. Some of the many people commemorating Anzac Day in isolation: Also earlier this morning, a bushfire in Western Australia was contained. The fire, which started near the intersection of Howie Road and South Coast highway, initially threatened lives and homes in the town of Manypeaks, near Albany, in Western Australia\u2019s Great Southern region, AAP reported. It burnt about 60ha. It is now under control. MPs from within the government are asking the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to make the higher jobkeeper rate permanent when the coronavirus pandemic is over, Daniel Hurst reports. Before the pandemic, the unemployment allowance (previously called Newstart) was only $40 a day, and had not been raised in real terms since 1994. The Nationals MP for Cowper in NSW, Pat Conaghan, said the temporary doubling of jobseeker should continue well beyond the six-month deadline. Even former prime minister Tony Abbott said the same, writing an op-ed to that effect in the Australian yesterday. Also from this morning is Ben Butler\u2019s piece on why the banks are not to blame for the failings of jobkeeper, despite what the politicians may tell you. Businesses say the fundamental problem with the jobkeeper scheme is that it\u2019s paid in arrears. In other words, businesses have to front up the money to pay their workers for each month ... None of this is the fault of Australia\u2019s banks \u2013 it is instead a fundamental flaw in the way the program was designed by Morrison and his treasurer, Josh Frydenberg. And here is reporter Matilda Bosely\u2019s feature on the ways people are marking Anzac Day today from their homes. For the first time since the Gallipoli campaign in 1915, there was no formal Anzac Day service in New Zealand. But the country\u2019s leaders found their own ways at dawn to commemorate the day, AAP reports. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, was one of many who spent at least a minute of their morning in contemplation by their letterbox. Ardern has relocated her family to Wellington for the lockdown, and left the official residence at Premier House just before 6am. \u201cWhile we cannot gather in person, we join in spirit as we remember the service and sacrifice of New Zealanders in times of war and crisis,\u201d she said in a statement. The defence minister, Ron Mark, also had a message read out as part of Radio New Zealand\u2019s official broadcast of the morning. \u201cWhile there can be none of the customary dawn services, no breakfasts, tots of rum, or pints with old mates, almost none of the events we normally associate with this special day, we can still take the time to pause, reflect and pay our respects to those who gave so much,\u201d he said. In Adelaide, a small dawn service was held at the city\u2019s war memorial as state laws allow gatherings of up to 10 people. The Anzac Day committee chairman, Ian Smith, said it was important for veterans to stay connected during physical distancing. \u201cMany men and women commemorating alone or with close family in Australia, New Zealand and across the world will be missing their mates and finding this Anzac Day particularly hard,\u201d he said. \u201cMany will appreciate a call from former comrades, friends and family.\u201d Wreaths were laid by the SA governor, Hieu Van Le, the premier, Steven Marshall, and the opposition leader, Peter Malinauskas, AAP reports. In Brisbane, the Tomkins family played The Last Post in the driveway. Nurse Sharon Bown also spoke at the televised, mostly empty service today and called on Australia to protect its most vulnerable. Bown has served as a combat nurse for 16 years and her great-uncle took part in the Gallipoli landings. \u201cLet us do more than just honour those who have defended Australia,\u201d she said this morning. \u201cIn this time of crisis, let us realise the innate capacity within each of us to do the same \u2013 to unite and to protect the more vulnerable among us.\u201d In a televised dawn service at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, paid tribute to Carolyn Griffiths, a nurse who has served in Afghanistan and Iraq, and an Afghanistan war veteran, corporal Matt Williams. \u201cWillie is in isolation today because his immune system depends on all of us keeping our distance,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cHe has served us, but now we must do the right thing by him.\u201d He reflected on the Anzac ceremony in Gallipoli in 1919. \u201cThere was no pomp at that little service,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were no dignitaries, no band. Just the sound of lapping water on the lonely shore. And so our remembrances today, small, quiet and homely, will be.\u201d Overnight: The US\u2019s Covid-19 death toll passed 50,000 and the number of people infected passed 875,000. That\u2019s the highest death toll of any country, and has doubled in only 10 days. The UK also recorded 684 more hospital deaths and Sweden reported its highest number of infections yet: 812 new cases. The US Food and Drug Administration has warned doctors against prescribing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine touted by the US president, Donald Trump, weeks ago. And the Guardian has revealed that the leader of the group peddling bleach as a coronavirus \u201ccure\u201d wrote to Trump earlier this week, before the president suggested that injecting disinfectant could defeat the virus. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in Australia this Saturday, Anzac Day. Today\u2019s ceremonies have taken on a different tone. Marches, large gatherings and your traditional dawn services are all off. Overseas, all official Australian-led ceremonies were cancelled weeks ago, including the Gallipoli service in Turkey. But that hasn\u2019t stopped people marking the day. At the Australian War Memorial, nurse Sharon Bown delivered a unique dawn service \u2013 to a mostly empty room, but beamed out on TV across the country. Bown has served as a combat medic for 16 years and her great-uncle was part of the Gallipoli landings. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, the governor general, David Hurley, New Zealand\u2019s high commissioner, Dame Annette King, and the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, were also in attendance.

      "bodyText": "Coping with lockdown life is hard enough without having to listen to other members of your household while you are trying to work. If you can\u2019t get away physically, a set of noise-cancelling headphones could be just the ticket to isolate you just enough to concentrate. From amazing value to truly fantastic sound, at a price, here\u2019s a guide to the best available. Lindy BNX-60 RRP: \u00a350 Most cheaper noise-cancelling headphones are terrible, but the Lindy BNX-60 are actually pretty good. They\u2019re a little old, originally released in 2016, but having been reduced to just \u00a350 they offer incredible value. The noise-cancelling handles background drone fairly well, while the ear cups enclose your ears to help quieten the rest of the world. They have a reasonable set of controls on the outside too, but two different volume levels that can be a bit confusing. They\u2019re a bit cheap-feeling, and fairly tight on the head. They also don\u2019t fold up particularly compact for travel, which probably isn\u2019t a concern right now. The battery lasts for up to 12 hours and charges via the older microUSB. You get a choice of a solid Bluetooth 4.1 connection, with support for AAC and aptX Bluetooth audio standards, or an included 3.5mm audio cable. They sound better with noise cancelling turned on with bright and punchy audio \u2013 better than you would expect for \u00a350 \u2013 that\u2019s a little over accentuated in the treble. Verdict: A cheap and cheerful bargain. Sony WF-1000XM3 RRP: \u00a3220 \u2013 deals from \u00a3170 Want noise cancelling without the bulk of headphones or a cable? Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM3 are the best sounding, most effective noise-cancelling true wireless earbuds you can get. They feature impressive noise-cancelling technology that rivals the best full-size headphones. They sound fantastic, have steady Bluetooth connection with support for AAC, and solid touch-panel controls on each earbud that now include volume adjustment. The earbuds last up to six hours of continuous playback with noise cancelling active, with more than three full charges in the case for a total of 22 hours, all in making them some of the longest-lasting true wireless earbuds available. Built-in support for Google Assistant, Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Apple\u2019s Siri is the icing on the cake. All that technology makes the earbuds massive \u2013 but get the fit right and they\u2019re worth it. They even undercut rivals on price too. Verdict: Amazingly effective noise cancelling without the bulk or wires. Alternatives: Libratone Track Air+ (\u00a3179), Apple AirPods Pro (\u00a3250), Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 (\u00a3279) Bose QC35 II RRP: \u00a3250 \u2013 deals from \u00a3219 Bose pioneered the first noise-cancelling headsets in 1986 and has been a market leader ever since for good reason: its products offer excellent active noise cancellation. Now in their second iteration, launched in 2017, the QC35 II combine excellent noise suppression with good sound, simple operation, reliable connectivity and supreme comfort. Though they do not support the latest audio standards, they still have SBC and AAC and a stable connection. You can connect to two devices at once, such as your phone for calls and your computer for work, and the headphones last for up to 20 hours between charges. You can use a headphones cable too when the battery runs out.

They are built to last, fold neatly for travel and sound pretty good too. The best bit is their unparalleled comfort: light and airy with good adjustments \u2013 ideal for long work days. Verdict: Effective, comfortable and built for the road. Alternatives: Jabra Elite 85H (\u00a3170), Marshall Monitor II (\u00a3270), Beats Solo Pro (\u00a3270) B&amp;W PX7 RRP: \u00a3350 If price is no object and you want the very best sound in a set of noise-cancelling headphones that will work wireless, wired and even over USB-C, with practically every option ticked including top-tier comfort, you want the B&amp;W PX7 from the upmarket British manufacturer Bowers &amp; Wilkins.

      "bodyText": "The public has been urged to stay at home, as forecasters predict warm and sunny weather across most of the country for the UK\u2019s fifth weekend under lockdown. The long spell of high temperatures is prompting concerns that people may defy lockdown rules, which came into force on 23 March. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has not ruled out granting police additional powers to enforce lockdown measures, the Daily Express reported. She is expected to reinforce the message to stay at home at Saturday\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, urged people on Friday to continue to adhere to the restrictions despite some encouraging signs that the coronavirus crisis is beginning to ease. \u201cThe country has done incredibly well in adhering to social distancing and there is a danger as we go into yet another warm sunny weekend that people think that perhaps these graphs are showing that the peak is over,\u201d he said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t over.

The public has been instructed to stay at home, but the restrictions allow daily outdoor exercise and essential journeys for supplies and work. Government figures published on Wednesday also showed UK vehicle traffic levels at their highest since the lockdown began. Calls for the government to announce details of an exit strategy have intensified over the past week, and Shapps said any easing of restrictions would depend to some extent on people\u2019s behaviour. \u201cWhen people ask me, when will the measures, the social distancing, the stay-at-home measures, be altered, my answer in some ways is that some of this lies in your own hands,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more we adhere to it and are strict about the social distancing that is required, the faster that decision will be able to be made.\u201d A police and crime commissioner had previously said \u201cisolation fatigue\u201d could set in and pose a genuine threat to the lockdown, predicting that public frustration would increase after Easter.

      "bodyText": "In many ways, Washington Castro was a typical resident of Rocinha, the immense redbrick favela that towers over Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Atlantic coast. Industrious, God-fearing and the offspring of migrants from Brazil\u2019s parched and impoverished north-east, he supported two young children by working two separate jobs and wore a suit and tie when attending his local church. \u201cHe was a marvellous boy. He worked Monday to Monday,\u201d his grief-stricken father, Jos\u00e9 Osmar Alves da Silva, remembered as he reflected on his son\u2019s death. \u201cNow there\u2019s this hole inside of me and I just can\u2019t make sense of anything.\u201d Castro died of suspected Covid-19 last Saturday at age 27 \u2013 one of at least six Rocinha residents to lose their lives to the coronavirus as it begins what many fear could be a devastating march through some of Latin America\u2019s most vulnerable communities. \u201cHe was a cutie \u2026 Whenever we met he was always wearing the same smile,\u201d said Cec\u00edlia Vasconcelos, a childhood friend who grew up with him in this sprawling hillside community of some 100,000 residents in southern Rio. The coronavirus appears to have been brought into Brazil by members of the country\u2019s middle and upper classes as they returned from February holidays in Europe or the United States. In Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo, many of the early infections were concentrated in the richest neighbourhoods, such as Copacabana and G\u00e1vea, where Castro had worked as an assistant at an accountancy firm and a poolside waiter at a club for Brazil\u2019s wealthy elites. One of the most famous clusters was Rio\u2019s Country Club, an ultra-exclusive enclave of privilege and power just three miles from Rocinha where at least 60 of the 850 members were infected. But two months after Brazil\u2019s first reported Covid-19 case the disease is making headway in the deprived, densely populated favelas of both cities, with potentially far-reaching political and humanitarian consequences. \u201cYou can see that it\u2019s moving towards the urban peripheries \u2013 gradually, but it\u2019s getting there,\u201d said Paulo Lotufo, an epidemiologist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, warning that its proliferation in such places could exact a terrible human toll on residents lacking access to private healthcare or sometimes even basic sanitation. \u201cI tend to believe that in some places we\u2019re going to see something on the scale of Ecuador,\u201d where hospitals have been overwhelmed and bodies dumped in the streets, Lotufo warned. Pedro Doria, a Rio-based writer, said he believed coronavirus\u2019s spread through the favelas could also carry a heavy political price for Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has called for containment measures to be relaxed in an apparent attempt to ingratiate himself with the poor. \u201cRight now what is hurting people [in the favelas] is the economy. So right now Bolsonaro is making a lot of sense to them,\u201d Doria said. But he thought attitudes would change \u201cthe moment people we love start dying around us\u201d. \u201cDepending on how the pandemic goes \u2013 especially in the the urban peripheries and the favelas \u2013 Bolsonaro will lose a lot of his support,\u201d Doria predicted, speculating that it could even end his presidency through impeachment. \u201cPeople will not forget that he said it was OK to go out on the streets.\u201d So far at least 18 people have reportedly lost their lives to Covid-19 in Rio\u2019s favelas, which house about 20% of the city\u2019s 6.7 million residents. At least 140 cases have been detected, 54 in Rocinha, which is one of the communities closest to the city\u2019s affluent south zone. Other deaths have taken place in some of Rio\u2019s most deprived areas including Acari, Manguinhos and the City of God favela made famous by Fernando Meirelles\u2019s film. Wallace Pereira, a community leader in Rocinha, said he feared a lack of testing meant the true numbers were in fact far higher. \u201cWe\u2019re facing a public disaster here,\u201d he said, warning that the political skirmish between Rio\u2019s governor, who has ordered residents to stay at home, and Bolsonaro, who has downplayed the pandemic, was leaving favela residents confused and exposed. \u201cPeople are getting sick and they have nowhere to go,\u201d Pereira said. \u201cThe situation is getting worse because many people are going around saying: \u2018This virus won\u2019t get me\u2019 \u2013 which is a fantasy.\u201d Across town in the portside Morro da Provid\u00eancia, Rio\u2019s oldest favela, Maur\u00edcio Rodrigues de Oliveira, 64, was found dead last Tuesday by neighbours who suspect Covid-19 was the cause. \u201cThe day before he complained of a temperature and fainted in the street,\u201d said Ladelson Soares, a 41-year-old neighbour. \u201cHe was a wonderful person \u2013 a waiter in some of Rio\u2019s most famous restaurants,\u201d said Soares, who claimed authorities had taken two days to collect his corpse. The death has left many neighbours \u2013 already struggling with the economic impact of lockdown \u2013 in panic. \u201cToday I got some money together to buy hand sanitiser because I\u2019ve got two kids at home. But I know that means we won\u2019t have the money to eat,\u201d said Claudene Carvalho, an unemployed local who found his body and has been begging community leaders for help. For Castro\u2019s family the tragedy began on the morning of 6 April when he set off for work on the number 539 bus. Shortly after reaching the office Castro began feeling ill and went to a nearby public health clinic where he was admitted complaining of a headache and breathing difficulties. By then, Covid-19 had already killed more than 500 Brazilians. On Friday the death toll hit 3,670. But \u2013 apparently relaxed about his situation \u2013 Castro sent his dad a WhatsApp photo in which he appeared wearing an oxygen mask. Nobody imagined what was to come. Two days later Castro was rushed to a hospital for Covid-19 patients in western Rio where he was intubated on arrival. \u201cWe\u2019d go there \u2013 but we couldn\u2019t see him,\u201d his 56-year-old father remembered. \u201cWe only talked to the doctors.\u201d After 10 days in intensive care \u2013 and, for relatives, 10 days of prayer \u2013 Castro was declared dead about 4.30am on 18 April, the death certificate listing severe acute respiratory syndrome as the official cause of death. He left two children, Maria Clara and Pierre, aged three and seven. Not far from Castro\u2019s former home in Rocinha, another family is also in mourning. Ant\u00f4nio Edson Mariano, a 67-year-old street vendor who sold biscuits on the beach, died on 30 March \u2013 three days after first complaining of a stomach ache \u2013 and was the first of the favela\u2019s residents killed by the coronavirus. On the day of his cremation, Mariano\u2019s wife, Maria L\u00facia Moreira Mariano, was herself taken to hospital, where she was given the same diagnosis and informed of her partner\u2019s death. But as she fights for her own life, Maria has yet to be told of another fatality. One day after her admittance, the couple\u2019s 45-year-old son, Alexandre, also lost his life to Covid-19.",

The only thing that comes close is a hug from Kingsley\u2019s mascot wife, Queensley. Do not ask why a mascot needs a mascot wife, because I cannot explain that in any meaningful way. Mascots intersect society at the exact same angle as cereal box characters: we never question why they are there, what they mean, or why they never blink; but we do demand complicated backstories for them, and extended family trees.</p> <p>Before all this happened \u2013 before the lockdown and the boarded-up pubs, and the groups of no more than two, and the two-metre distancing and the isolation and the ransacked supermarkets, and most crucially the suspension of every single sport on the planet, all at once \u2013 I became obsessed with mascots. There they were: jiggling, expressionless monoliths made of felt, pacing up and down the touchline, a seen-but-unseen aspect of modern sport, ever-present and never questioned. In the current void, you could be forgiven for forgetting all about them; but they are just as crucial to the matchday experience as the people kicking the ball, and the other people running after it, as crucial as being one 60,000-throated voice, shouting them all on, as crucial as the pies and the scarves and the long winding walk to the stadium, the urinal queues and the matchday programmes. And there, look: there\u2019s a person in a bumblebee outfit, waving at you. Who are they? What are they for?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7f7502cb88d6fb0612b1e0a71fadf713fc78b6d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f7502cb88d6fb0612b1e0a71fadf713fc78b6d5/1206_0_3324_4472/743.jpg\" alt=\"Partick Thistle\u2019s abstract yellow monster mascot designed by artist David Shrigley.\" width=\"743\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Partick Thistle\u2019s mascot designed by artist David Shrigley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On a wet weekend before lockdown, I went walking through the labyrinthine corridors that make up the backstage of Reading\u2019s Madejski Stadium, trying to find out. Kingsley (a lion, who shouldn\u2019t be confused with Kingsley the Partick Thistle mascot, the abstract yellow monster designed by artist David Shrigley) has been a Reading FC fixture since 1997. Kingsley has the dubious honour of being one of the few mascots in sport to receive a red card (for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/11/the-most-obscure-person-sent-off\" title=\"\">straying too close to the pitch</a> in 2007). But when I visited him, he was behaving himself, warming up the crowd before a vital 3\u20130 win over Luton. Spirits had been low in previous weeks, with a faltering run of form and a recent managerial change, but mascots cannot sit these periods out: rain or shine, good form or bad, they are pitchside, dancing and pointing.</p> <p>I stood behind the king and queen, Kingsley and his wife, like a page as they waved at their subjects. I held doors open for them to squeeze through while they smiled at the various birthday parties they had wafted into. I basked in the reflected glory as they shimmied through the pre\u2011match bar. Everywhere Kingsley and Queensley went, people responded with joy. Children whisper-shouted their names to each other when they spotted their lion eyes glimmering through a door window. Unsmiling, 50-year season ticket holders went mushy as they shook Kingsley\u2019s royal paw.</p> <p>\u201cYou just have to be yourself in there,\u201d Kingsley\u2019s actor, Craig Peters, told me, headless, when we spoke in the staff kitchen an hour before the game. \u201cAnd I would also say: don\u2019t be afraid to get out of your comfort zone.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to say where mascots began, exactly. History is written by the winners, and the winners rarely stop to write, \u201cOh yeah, bit of a weird one: we took a pig to a football game today. Won. Might do it again, every match, for ever.\u201d </p> <p>Yes, mascots bring happiness, but who allowed them to happen? They skim into the arena on a zipline. They cover their big unblinking eyes with their hands when an eight-year-old skies a half-time penalty. We accept all this. We look at Manchester United\u2019s cuddly devil mascot, Fred the Red, and think: <em>I\u2019m completely OK with the fact that a demon sent</em> <em>to punish us for our sins is</em> <em>standing on the halfway line right now,</em> <em>having physical banter with Bruno Fernandes</em><strong>.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ff3aad91890cf535d525e699173d6aa0122383c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ff3aad91890cf535d525e699173d6aa0122383c/0_621_8256_4951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joel Golby as football mascot Bertie the Beaver with fans at Hampton & Richmond Borough FC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joel Golby as Bertie the Beaver: \u2018Mascots are just as crucial to the matchday experience as the people kicking the ball.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Muir Vidler/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baseball, a game riddled with superstition, pioneered the US mascot, though they were mostly just children, rather than adults in animal suits. The first recorded use of the term in sport, in 1883, described a young batboy called \u201cChic\u201d, who the Pottsville Anthracites considered a good luck charm, as well as being the grunt they got to hand out bats and uniforms to the team. By the late 19th century, the mascot had moved into other sports: Yale\u2019s Handsome Dan (a bulldog belonging to student Andrew Graves) played an essential role in the ceremonial pomp that preceded the college\u2019s American football games.</p> <p>Live-animal mascots also made their way to Britain. Manchester United, newly minted from the ashes of Newton Heath, replaced Major the St Bernard with Billy the Goat, an animal belonging to half-back Charlie Roberts.

      "bodyText": "There is no force in the universe more irresistible than a high five from Reading FC\u2019s lion mascot, Kingsley. The only thing that comes close is a hug from Kingsley\u2019s mascot wife, Queensley. Do not ask why a mascot needs a mascot wife, because I cannot explain that in any meaningful way. Mascots intersect society at the exact same angle as cereal box characters: we never question why they are there, what they mean, or why they never blink; but we do demand complicated backstories for them, and extended family trees. Before all this happened \u2013 before the lockdown and the boarded-up pubs, and the groups of no more than two, and the two-metre distancing and the isolation and the ransacked supermarkets, and most crucially the suspension of every single sport on the planet, all at once \u2013 I became obsessed with mascots. There they were: jiggling, expressionless monoliths made of felt, pacing up and down the touchline, a seen-but-unseen aspect of modern sport, ever-present and never questioned. In the current void, you could be forgiven for forgetting all about them; but they are just as crucial to the matchday experience as the people kicking the ball, and the other people running after it, as crucial as being one 60,000-throated voice, shouting them all on, as crucial as the pies and the scarves and the long winding walk to the stadium, the urinal queues and the matchday programmes. And there, look: there\u2019s a person in a bumblebee outfit, waving at you. Who are they? What are they for? On a wet weekend before lockdown, I went walking through the labyrinthine corridors that make up the backstage of Reading\u2019s Madejski Stadium, trying to find out. Kingsley (a lion, who shouldn\u2019t be confused with Kingsley the Partick Thistle mascot, the abstract yellow monster designed by artist David Shrigley) has been a Reading FC fixture since 1997. Kingsley has the dubious honour of being one of the few mascots in sport to receive a red card (for straying too close to the pitch in 2007). But when I visited him, he was behaving himself, warming up the crowd before a vital 3\u20130 win over Luton. Spirits had been low in previous weeks, with a faltering run of form and a recent managerial change, but mascots cannot sit these periods out: rain or shine, good form or bad, they are pitchside, dancing and pointing. I stood behind the king and queen, Kingsley and his wife, like a page as they waved at their subjects. I held doors open for them to squeeze through while they smiled at the various birthday parties they had wafted into. I basked in the reflected glory as they shimmied through the pre\u2011match bar. Everywhere Kingsley and Queensley went, people responded with joy. Children whisper-shouted their names to each other when they spotted their lion eyes glimmering through a door window. Unsmiling, 50-year season ticket holders went mushy as they shook Kingsley\u2019s royal paw. \u201cYou just have to be yourself in there,\u201d Kingsley\u2019s actor, Craig Peters, told me, headless, when we spoke in the staff kitchen an hour before the game. \u201cAnd I would also say: don\u2019t be afraid to get out of your comfort zone.\u201d *** It\u2019s hard to say where mascots began, exactly. History is written by the winners, and the winners rarely stop to write, \u201cOh yeah, bit of a weird one: we took a pig to a football game today. Won. Might do it again, every match, for ever.\u201d Yes, mascots bring happiness, but who allowed them to happen? They skim into the arena on a zipline. They cover their big unblinking eyes with their hands when an eight-year-old skies a half-time penalty. We accept all this. We look at Manchester United\u2019s cuddly devil mascot, Fred the Red, and think: I\u2019m completely OK with the fact that a demon sent to punish us for our sins is standing on the halfway line right now, having physical banter with Bruno Fernandes. Baseball, a game riddled with superstition, pioneered the US mascot, though they were mostly just children, rather than adults in animal suits. The first recorded use of the term in sport, in 1883, described a young batboy called \u201cChic\u201d, who the Pottsville Anthracites considered a good luck charm, as well as being the grunt they got to hand out bats and uniforms to the team. By the late 19th century, the mascot had moved into other sports: Yale\u2019s Handsome Dan (a bulldog belonging to student Andrew Graves) played an essential role in the ceremonial pomp that preceded the college\u2019s American football games. Live-animal mascots also made their way to Britain. Manchester United, newly minted from the ashes of Newton Heath, replaced Major the St Bernard with Billy the Goat, an animal belonging to half-back Charlie Roberts. Billy was paraded at Old Trafford before games, but his time came to an abrupt end following the 1909 FA Cup final win over Bristol City when, as United Museum curator Jon Sutton writes, \u201cBilly sadly died of alcohol poisoning after taking part in the post-match celebrations.\u201d I talked to Nick Miller, the author of Dance Like Everybody\u2019s Watching!: The Weird And Wonderful World Of Sporting Mascots, for which he studied mascots from Australia, Japan, the US and the Olympic Games, as well as West Bromwich Albion\u2019s baffling Boiler Man, a combi-boiler with arms and legs, but no eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand why a lot of these mascots can\u2019t just be nice and cuddly, or why they have to go down the nightmare route,\u201d Miller says. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be for kids, really.\u201d Mascots graduated from dogs and small children to more haunting cartoon characters with the introduction of the New York Mets\u2019 Mr Met in 1964. The body of a man with the head of a gigantic baseball, Mr Met debuted the year before as a drawing on the front of a matchday programme, but took corporeal form at the opening of the team\u2019s then-new home, Shea Stadium. His pre-match shtick proved popular: by the 1970s he was joined by Mrs Met (becoming, arguably, the first mascot power couple) and then three little Mets \u2013 all nameless, all with eerie baseball heads. Over the next decade, the Mets\u2019 Major League baseball rivals rushed to catch up. In 1974, the San Diego Padres introduced the San Diego Chicken, heralding a frenzied period of invention in the US, climaxing with San Francisco Giants\u2019 Crazy Crab. The crab was designed as a sort of \u201canti-mascot\u201d, who deliberately got the crowd so riled that they pelted him with beer bottles and batteries (actor Wayne Doba had to wear protective equipment inside his soft outer shell). In 1984, Crazy Crab was tackled by two of the San Diego Padres, leaving Doba incapacitated for the last two games of the season. Crazy Crab was quietly retired in 1985. Mascots don\u2019t share an overarching aesthetic. They can be fuzzy, furry, hairy or slick; they can be aliens or monsters or animals. But the one recurring theme is that they have someone inside them, most often someone who already works for the team, who has acquired the job because, put simply, they were there. \u201cIt was a pre-season game against Bournemouth, actually,\u201d Peters tells me. \u201cMy intention was to go and just watch the game.\u201d Peters also works for Reading\u2019s community outreach programmes. \u201cAnd then my colleague said, \u2018What are you doing?

Miller has spoken to more mascots than anyone else alive, and tells me he has noticed a pattern. \u201cYou don\u2019t get many careerist mascots. The origin story is always, \u2018Oh, you know, the previous guy was ill, or they needed someone, anyone, to prance around in this thing. I was there.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s not to diminish the role: on a good day, the mascot becomes an extension of the crowd, urging the ball towards the net; on a bad day, they are a focal point for anger, the home crowd\u2019s howling after going 3-0 down.

What started as a single infection in Washington state ballooned until the US became the global hotspot for Covid-19, with exponentially more confirmed cases than any other nation. Mixed messages from Donald Trump and his administration have caused confusion over when or if Americans will return to life as usual. Squabbles between the president, governors and mayors have inspired headlines as critics assail missed chances to contain the virus. Now, the US has passed another grim milestone, 50,000 Covid-related deaths, while closing in on 1m confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. More than 26 million are out of work and protesters are demanding an end to stay-at-home orders, even as experts say such rallies could make outbreaks worse. These are the defining moments from the US under Covid-19 so far. 21 January The US confirms its first case of Covid-19, after a 35-year-old man who lives north of Seattle returns from Wuhan, China. A day later, Trump tells CNBC: \u201cIt\u2019s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control.\u201d 29 January The White House announces a taskforce to \u201cmonitor, contain and mitigate the spread of the virus\u201d. 30 January The World Health Organization (WHO) labels the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. But Trump continues to downplay it, telling a crowd in Iowa: \u201cWe only have five people. Hopefully, everything\u2019s going to be great.\u201d 31 January Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services, declares a public health emergency. Trump restricts travel from China, a decision that he later claims, erroneously, saved hundreds of thousands of lives. 5 February After becoming the third president to be impeached, Trump is acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate. 6 February The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ships coronavirus testing kits to labs, but early tests are contaminated, handicapping the response. The US experiences its first known death from Covid-19, in California, though it will not be identified and reported as such for months. 24 February The economy shows signs of free fall, even as Trump tweets: \u201cStock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d His administration asks Congress for $2.5bn to pay for vaccine development and protective equipment. 26 February The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces that a patient in California has tested positive for Covid-19, potentially the first US case where the source of infection is unknown. At Life Care Center, a nursing home outside Seattle, two residents contract the virus. Dozens will succumb. Trump taps Mike Pence to lead the coronavirus response. 29 February The US makes public what is then believed to be its first Covid-related death, a man in his 50s. The case is in Washington state, ground zero for the virus. Trump restricts travel from Iran. 6 March Trump signs an $8.3bn aid bill that receives near-unanimous support in Congress. He says: \u201cAnybody that wants a test can get a test,\u201d a claim that confuses Americans and hamstrings healthcare workers. 11 March The WHO redefines the outbreak as a pandemic. Trump restricts travel from Europe, excluding the UK. Days later, he announces a bar on travel from the UK and Ireland. 12 March Broadway closes and the NCAA cancels March Madness. The US has more than 1,600 confirmed coronavirus cases, across almost every state. 13 March Trump declares a national emergency, the same day Washington state orders its schools closed. 18 March Trump signs a second coronavirus relief bill. 19 March Californians must stay at home to curtail the spread of the virus. A day later, New York issues a similar order, beginning a war of words between Trump and a number of governors. 24 March Trump tells Fox News he \u201cwould love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter\u201d, 12 April. He faces immediate criticism. 26 March The US reports its first 1,000 deaths. The next day, Trump signs a $2.2tn stimulus package that includes a $1,200 check for many Americans. Trump later takes heat for making sure the checks, intended to help struggling workers during catastrophic levels of unemployment, bear his signature during an election year. 28 March The US death toll doubles, to more than 2,000, in just two days. 31 March In a significant shift in tone, exactly a week after he floated the idea of reopening the country by Easter, Trump says \u201cour country is in the midst of a great national trial, unlike any we have ever faced before\u201d. 3 April The CDC recommends all Americans wear face coverings in public \u2013 after weeks of suggesting otherwise. New York\u2019s mayor warns that D-Day is looming as hospitals struggle to find personal protective equipment, ventilators, beds and staff. 13 April Trump claims total authority over the states, saying: \u201cThe president of the United States calls the shots.\u201d He is challenged by governors, who say he does not have the constitutional right to reopen the country without their involvement. 17 April Two days after thousands of protesters in Michigan gathered to decry their state\u2019s stay-at-home order, Trump tweets to \u201cLIBERATE MINNESOTA\u201d, \u201cLIBERATE MICHIGAN\u201d and \u201cLIBERATE VIRGINIA\u201d. Protesters in other states follow suit. 23 April The House of Representatives approves another relief bill to help small businesses and hospitals, after previous funds for small businesses fell into the hands of large companies such as Shake Shack and Potbelly.

      "body": "<p>On 6 January, I wrote a short memo to our newsdesk: \u201cSomething we probably want to keep an eye on are these severe viral pneumonia cases that have been racking up (now 44) in Wuhan \u2013 China has said that it is not Sars.\u201d</p> <p>Since then, I have been reporting on coronavirus from Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai and most recently Wuhan. I could not have known then how my life would soon be consumed by this story. I have spent the four months since constantly weighing the risks to my family, my colleagues and the people we interviewed against my responsibility as a journalist.</p> <p>Reports about a mysterious strain of pneumonia in Wuhan \u2013 a city I had only vague memories of from a reporting trip in 2013 \u2013 began cropping up in late December. I relayed to my editor the government\u2019s assurance that there was no sign the virus was being transmitted between humans.</p> <p>Partly, I didn\u2019t think the Chinese authorities would get this wrong after the cover-up and fallout from Sars in 2002-03. But also I wanted to believe them \u2013 even as a trained sceptic who has covered China for years. I knew how complicated and difficult life would become if this turned into an epidemic.</p> <p>Within two weeks, officials announced the virus was contagious. Hospitals in Wuhan were rammed with panicked, sick residents, and the city went into lockdown. I struggled with the decision of when to go to Wuhan, or whether or not to stay in China. We knew very little about how the virus was transmitted and how serious it could get.</p> <p>For a few weeks, my mum called every day demanding I come back to the US. She would send message after message, including audio recordings of Taiwanese news shows in case I didn\u2019t have access to the news. My husband, also in the US at the time, was more measured and trusted me to make the right call. My editors said to leave as soon as I felt unsafe. I promised to if things got worse.</p> <p>Over the next few months, I worked in a state of de facto quarantine from my living room in Beijing, in friends\u2019 apartments in Hong Kong and in a hotel in Shanghai with so few guests the staff turned most of the lights off to save electricity. I called people in Wuhan and watched videos of dead bodies in hospitals, health workers breaking down under the strain, residents pleading for help. I scrolled through pages of online posts from people asking for advice after being turned away from hospitals and ignored by overwhelmed government staff. There were several accounts of suicides.</p> <p>Seemingly small, random details about people trying to care for their elderly relatives would bring me to tears. A woman described putting a blanket down in a hospital lobby for her parents, turned away but too sick for the journey home. They slept on the floor and later both died. A young woman studying abroad talked with her sick father until his phone battery ran out as, unable to find transport, he walked several miles home from the hospital. The last time I spoke to her, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/15/coronavirus-outbreak-wuhan-china\">in critical condition</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c11738022598dce8bd0a28f13349cf35ae6e65f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c11738022598dce8bd0a28f13349cf35ae6e65f7/0_0_6048_3628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers arriving at Wuhan station for a train to Shanghai after lockdown measures in the city were lifted.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers arriving at Wuhan station for a train to Shanghai after lockdown measures in the city were lifted.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: H\u00e9ctor Retamal/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These stories were difficult because I could see myself in them. If my mother were dying and police would not let me through a checkpoint to get her help, I would also rage at them \u2013 demanding to know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/people-have-been-awakened-seeking-covid-19-answers-in-wuhan\">whether or not they were human beings</a>.</p> <p>Then, almost suddenly, the story shifted. The number of daily new infections in China began dropping. After 76 days of people being shut inside their city and their homes, Wuhan would soon begin to let residents leave. I went to witness the end of the lockdown at the start of this month and report on what went wrong in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/birth-of-a-pandemic-inside-the-first-weeks-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak-in-wuhan\">early days of the outbreak.</a></p> <p>Wuhan felt strangely calm. People seemed ready to move on, commenting only that things were \u201cmuch better\u201d. They were no longer angry at authorities for suppressing early warnings of the virus. Seeing other countries struggle, they were appreciative of their own government\u2019s efforts. \u201cNow we know what the word motherland means,\u201d a nurse said while giving me a throat swab to test if I had the virus \u2013 a requirement before coming back to Beijing.</p> <p>But there were signs of trauma and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/people-have-been-awakened-seeking-covid-19-answers-in-wuhan\">resentment below the surface</a>. One woman broke down crying during an interview. Even though the lockdown was lifted, she was scared to go out and she was still angry at whoever had allowed this to happen. Others were filing lawsuits, demanding officials be held accountable.</p> <p>Reporting those stories was also difficult. I was repeatedly told by local contacts that patients, doctors and nurses had been told not to speak to foreign media. \u201cYou are Chinese. Don\u2019t have contact with them,\u201d one resident said he had been told by his neighbourhood committee.</p> <p>Still, people spoke to us and I worried about the impact on them. Several said local police had tried to intimidate them for talking to the Guardian, and that they had been ordered to cut off communication. When I apologised for causing them trouble, one said: \u201cI\u2019m glad I got to share with you. It\u2019s what we should do.\u201d Another told me repeatedly: \u201cI\u2019m not scared of them.\u201d</p> <p>Recently I was woken up by a phone call from someone I had interviewed in Wuhan. They were frantic. Had I published the story? Could it be deleted? Local authorities had called them in, warning that foreign journalists like me would try to \u201cuse\u201d people like them.</p> <p>\u201cI am just a normal person. I don\u2019t want anything to do with politics,\u201d they said, pausing to apologise for calling so early.</p> <p>I groggily tried to explain that we had not used a name, given identifying details or printed any comments that could be construed as opposition to the government. Still, they were worried about their job and family, and confused as to why sharing a personal experience was politically sensitive.</p> <p>That is what has been the hardest, but also most inspiring, thing about covering this outbreak. Not only are people reliving the most painful experiences of their lives when they talk to us, but they are also risking being harassed, or worse, so that the rest of the world can know what really happened in Wuhan. Many of them speak out anyway. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Global confirmed death toll approaches 200,000 According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 197,577 people are confirmed to have died worldwide, while at least 2.82 million are known to have been infected. The figures for infections are likely to underestimate the true scale of the pandemic due to suspected under-reporting and differing testing regimes. Death toll figures are also controversial, with some countries reporting deaths as confirmed Covid-19 cases on the basis of symptoms and in the absence of a positive test, while others are not including them. \u2018No evidence\u2019 you can\u2019t get Covid-19 twice, says WHO The World Health Organization said on Friday that there was currently \u201cno evidence\u201d that people who have recovered from coronavirus are protected from a second infection \u2013 even if they now have antibodies against it. In a statement, the UN health agency warned against issuing \u201cimmunity passports\u201d or \u201crisk-free certificates\u201d to people who have been infected, saying the practice may actually increase the risk of spread as those given them may ignore standard advice. It also warned that the accuracy and reliability of tests for antibodies to coronavirus were not certain. China sought to block EU disinformation report China sought to block a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak, according to four sources and diplomatic correspondence reviewed by Reuters. The report was eventually released, albeit just before the start of the weekend in European time and with some criticism of the Chinese government rearranged or removed, a sign of the balancing act Brussels is trying to pull off as the coronavirus outbreak puts strain on international relations. Brazilian city health systems on verge of collapse Cases of the coronavirus are overwhelming hospitals, morgues and cemeteries across Brazil as Latin America\u2019s largest country veers closer to becoming one of the world\u2019s pandemic hotspots, the Associated Press reports. Medical officials in Rio de Janeiro and at least four other major cities have warned that their hospital systems are on the verge of collapse, or already too overwhelmed to take any more patients. Health experts expect the number of infections in the country of 211 million people will be much higher than what has been reported because of insufficient, delayed testing. Greece prepares to end lockdown Greece is preparing to ease lockdown measures, with the country\u2019s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, holding back-to-back teleconference calls today to discuss how best to roll back the restrictions. A return to post-lockdown normality is expected to begin on Monday 4 May, when small shops, hairdressers, barbers and beauticians will go back to work. One senior government aide told the Guardian that the opening of barbers and hairdressers was regarded as a much-needed \u201cpsychological boost\u201d after what would be almost two months of severe restrictions. Britons urged to go to hospital in an emergency NHS England has launched an awareness campaign to urge people to seek medical help if they need it, after visits to hospital emergency departments fell by almost half this month amid fears over the coronavirus outbreak. NHS officials said they were worried that meant people were avoiding hospitals for fear of catching the virus, thereby jeopardising their lives and potentially becoming collateral damage.",

But social distancing in the <em>neuf-trois, </em>the deprived Seine-Saint-Denis <em>d\u00e9partement</em> north of Paris, looks very different to that of Saint-Tropez, where <a href=\"https://news-24.fr/le-centre-de-test-exclusif-des-milliardaires-sur-les-coronavirus-suscite-la-colere-des-habitants-de-saint-tropez/\">billionaires in a gated compound were reported last week to be paying for private Covid-19 tests</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe are locked down in our inequality,\u201d said the Seine-Saint-Denis MP Alexis Corbi\u00e8re. \u201cThe virus has just amplified the problems the <em>banlieue</em> has had for a long time.

      "bodyText": "A man has been arrested after a gun was fired as hundreds of mourners gathered for the Manchester funeral of a criminal known as \u201cMr Ibiza\u201d, despite social distancing rules. Armed police scrambled to Gorton Cemetery in Manchester on Thursday after chaos broke out during the funeral of Clive Pinnock, 38, from Longsight, south Manchester, who died in a road crash earlier this month. After the gun was fired, a 34-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after police found him suffering from minor knife wounds. Greater Manchester police (GMP) said that the force had decided to allow the crowd of mourners to gather after a \u201ccareful assessment\u201d of the situation, and having come to the conclusion that it would be \u201cin the interests of public safety\u201d. Supt Rebecca Boyce of GMP said in a statement that the force had engaged with the Pinnock family to discuss funeral arrangements and government social distancing rules. \u201cOur overriding priority was to ensure that the wider public were kept safe,\u201d she said. \u201cWe continued to closely monitor the situation and as it progressed it was clear that the emotions of those at the gathering were high and therefore a decision was made, in the interests of public safety, not to intervene unless the wider public were put at risk by the groups.\u201d In 2015, Pinnock was jailed for 11 years and six months after stabbing two men following a row in a pub in the city. The force\u2019s decision was criticised by members of the public on social media. Many families have been forced to hold remote funeral services for loved ones who died since the coronavirus lockdown began. Earlier this month, the funeral of a 13-year-old boy from Brixton who died after testing positive for coronavirus took place without his family members. \u201cWe understand that there has been public concern regarding the events of yesterday,\u201d Boyce said. \u201cWe want to sincerely thank the majority of the public, many of whom are struggling with the loss of loved ones, who have not risked the safety of others by attending gatherings such as funerals in breach of government guidelines,\u201d she added. Last week, a teenager died after he was hit by a motorcycle at a funeral in Kent attended by 150 people in defiance of coronavirus physical distancing rules. Aaron Smith, 17, who had three children, suffered fatal head injuries in the incident near Sittingbourne on Thursday.",

On Monday, for example, Dan Patrick, the <a href=\"https://rewire.news/ablc/2020/03/25/texas-covid-19-response-ban-abortion-kill-grandma/\">virulently </a><a href=\"https://rewire.news/ablc/2020/03/25/texas-covid-19-response-ban-abortion-kill-grandma/\">\u201cpro-life\u201d</a> lieutenant governor of Texas, called for the reopening of the country, saying there are \u201c<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/493879-texas-lt-governor-on-reopening-state-there-are-more-important-things\">more important things than living</a>\u201d.</p> <p>This is the same guy, by the way, who went on Fox News last month and said \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/older-people-would-rather-die-than-let-covid-19-lockdown-harm-us-economy-texas-official-dan-patrick\">lots of grandparents</a>\u201d would rather die than see the US economy suffer.

But other times, these behaviors \u2026might signal that children view women in a negative light, as weak, incompetent, and unable to survive or thrive without a man\u2019s help. The study, which examined the attitudes of more than 200 children, aged five to 11, also found that benevolent sexism decreased with age only for girls. \u201cBoys may be less likely to recognize that their benevolent attitudes toward women are, in fact, patronizing.\u201d</p> <h2>Texas will allow abortions to resume</h2> <p>Abortion services have been largely unavailable for over a month after Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s 21 March executive order suspending \u201cnon-essential\u201d medical procedures.

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s wildlife may be thriving during the current lockdown but its long-term future is looking bleak, according to leading conservation organisations.</p> <p>Nikki Williams, head of campaigns at the Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cThe current crisis means nature is losing out, because many organisations are having to scale back important work caring for special places, which they usually do with the vital help of thousands of volunteers.\u201d</p> <p>Just one example, she said, was the continual battle with the invasive plant <a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/wildflowers/himalayan-balsam\">Himalayan balsam</a>, which smothers riverbanks and out-competes native wildflowers. If left to its own devices over the summer, this plant will be even harder to eradicate next year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, valuable habitats, such as lowland heaths in southern England and East Anglia, need continual management to ensure they do not turn back into scrub, reducing the opportunities for specialised creatures such as the Dartford warbler, sand lizard and smooth snake.</p> <p>While staff and volunteers are unable to do the majority of conservation work, they are still able to carry out surveys, for example of breeding birds, many of which are run by the British Trust for Ornithology.</p> <p>One noticeable phenomenon of late has been the daily chorus of birdsong, especially in the heart of our cities.</p> <p>According to the BTO\u2019s Paul Stancliffe, the current lack of noise might indeed be helping singing birds to be heard by potential mates and rivals, thus increasing their breeding success. He said we wouldn\u2019t know if that was the case unless crucial survey work continued. This is why the BTO has offered free membership of its <a href=\"https://www.bto.org/our-science/projects/gbw?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIn6CSqMOB6QIVkuvtCh36YAjnEAAYASAAEgIlmfD_BwE\">Garden BirdWatch scheme</a>, signing up more than 5,000 new observers, many of whom have urban gardens, whose birdlife often goes under-recorded.</p> <p>Mathew Frith, of the London Wildlife Trust, said: \u201cMany of our birds, such as the robin, wren, chiffchaff, skylark and meadow pipit, nest on or close to the ground, and so are easily flushed by dogs. With parks so much quieter than usual, these species may do well this spring.\u201d</p> <p>The RSPB also notes that the lack of people visiting the seaside will help shore-nesting species such as little terns and ringed plovers, which are especially prone to being disturbed by holidaymakers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"157a5f8de1ca1e792f274a4b12913ee652e81a68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/157a5f8de1ca1e792f274a4b12913ee652e81a68/0_176_5271_3163/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People pass a herd of fallow deer grazing on the lawns of a housing estate in Harold Hill in east London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grazing fallow deer are unfazed by passers-by in Harold Hill, east London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as the possible benefits to birds of the current reduction in noise and disturbance, some animals also appear to be flourishing. There have been reports of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2020/mar/31/goats-take-over-empty-welsh-streets-llandudno-coronavirus-lockdown-video\">goats roaming the streets of Llandudno</a>, and fallow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/20/stags-in-the-city-how-deer-found-their-way-into-our-town-centres-and-back-gardens\">deer in the east London suburbs</a>, along with numerous sightings of normally shy mammals such as moles, stoats and weasels.</p> <p>The lack of traffic is especially helpful for mammals that are vulnerable to being run over by vehicles, such as hedgehogs and badgers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/16/home-birds-how-to-spot-20-of-the-most-common-species-from-your-window-walk-or-garden\">Name that song - it's the perfect time to learn to identify birds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The big question for conservationists is what will happen when lockdown restrictions are lifted. Any short-term gains made by wildlife may vanish once people, traffic and other aspects of daily life returned to some kind of \u201cnormal\u201d, but if our habits do permanently change, as many people are hoping, nature might reap the benefit.</p> <p>But that will also depend on pushing through recent shifts in government policy, as the Wildlife Trusts\u2019 Williams points out. \u201cWhen the crisis ends, wildlife will still be in decline. The only way to ensure its recovery is to create strong agriculture and environment bills, which put nature, and all the benefits it brings, at the heart of policy and our daily lives.\u201d</p>",

Nikki Williams, head of campaigns at the Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cThe current crisis means nature is losing out, because many organisations are having to scale back important work caring for special places, which they usually do with the vital help of thousands of volunteers.\u201d Just one example, she said, was the continual battle with the invasive plant Himalayan balsam, which smothers riverbanks and out-competes native wildflowers. If left to its own devices over the summer, this plant will be even harder to eradicate next year. Meanwhile, valuable habitats, such as lowland heaths in southern England and East Anglia, need continual management to ensure they do not turn back into scrub, reducing the opportunities for specialised creatures such as the Dartford warbler, sand lizard and smooth snake. While staff and volunteers are unable to do the majority of conservation work, they are still able to carry out surveys, for example of breeding birds, many of which are run by the British Trust for Ornithology. One noticeable phenomenon of late has been the daily chorus of birdsong, especially in the heart of our cities. According to the BTO\u2019s Paul Stancliffe, the current lack of noise might indeed be helping singing birds to be heard by potential mates and rivals, thus increasing their breeding success. He said we wouldn\u2019t know if that was the case unless crucial survey work continued. This is why the BTO has offered free membership of its Garden BirdWatch scheme, signing up more than 5,000 new observers, many of whom have urban gardens, whose birdlife often goes under-recorded. Mathew Frith, of the London Wildlife Trust, said: \u201cMany of our birds, such as the robin, wren, chiffchaff, skylark and meadow pipit, nest on or close to the ground, and so are easily flushed by dogs. With parks so much quieter than usual, these species may do well this spring.\u201d The RSPB also notes that the lack of people visiting the seaside will help shore-nesting species such as little terns and ringed plovers, which are especially prone to being disturbed by holidaymakers. As well as the possible benefits to birds of the current reduction in noise and disturbance, some animals also appear to be flourishing. There have been reports of goats roaming the streets of Llandudno, and fallow deer in the east London suburbs, along with numerous sightings of normally shy mammals such as moles, stoats and weasels. The lack of traffic is especially helpful for mammals that are vulnerable to being run over by vehicles, such as hedgehogs and badgers. The big question for conservationists is what will happen when lockdown restrictions are lifted. Any short-term gains made by wildlife may vanish once people, traffic and other aspects of daily life returned to some kind of \u201cnormal\u201d, but if our habits do permanently change, as many people are hoping, nature might reap the benefit. But that will also depend on pushing through recent shifts in government policy, as the Wildlife Trusts\u2019 Williams points out. \u201cWhen the crisis ends, wildlife will still be in decline. The only way to ensure its recovery is to create strong agriculture and environment bills, which put nature, and all the benefits it brings, at the heart of policy and our daily lives.\u201d",

The club insists negotiations are both amicable and continuing, but after originally asking players to take the 30% cut suggested by the Premier League during the coronavirus crisis, Chelsea are unwilling to approve what the players have offered, which is believed to be less than the 10% figure that has been reported. Arsenal recently agreed a 12.5% cut that was subject to performance incentives, whereas Chelsea players were apparently willing to take an unconditional reduction in wages for the next four months, but the Stamford Bridge dressing room and board have been unable to agree on a precise figure. Frank Lampard has not been involved in discussions about possible pay cuts, with the head coach preferring not to take sides between players and club management, but after \u201cextensive talks\u201d between Azpilicueta and the Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia, the situation remains unresolved. Chelsea\u2019s impasse is in stark contrast to Aston Villa whose players, first-team coaches and senior management have agreed to defer 25% of their salaries for four months. The club\u2019s chief executive, Christian Purslow, said: \u201cOur players and staff feel great solidarity with the many clubs in the football pyramid who have financial problems and we believe it is right and proper that the Premier League as a whole takes action on its finances collectively to enable it to be able to continue to provide vital funding throughout the game in England.\u201d Chelsea are not furloughing any non-playing staff and have promised to keep paying the full wages of casual and matchday workers until 30 June, but the players remain on full pay with the club merely encouraging them to keep up their charitable donations. A statement on the club website on Saturday read: \u201cAt this time the men\u2019s first team will not be contributing towards the club financially and instead the board have directed the team to focus their efforts on supporting charitable causes. \u201cAs this crisis develops the club will continue to have conversations with the men\u2019s first team regarding financial contributions. We are grateful to the team for having played their role in assisting the club with community activities. \u201cThe club can also confirm we will not be taking advantage of the government\u2019s current coronavirus job retention scheme which runs to 30 June.

Young people get such a bad press, but they\u2019re so keen to help \u2013 they\u2019re an absolute inspiration.\u201d Wrexham councillor Phil Wynn, who has been heavily involved with the project, said: \u201cWe\u2019d hoped to make a few hundred masks, but we\u2019ve gone from this to a project where we make 1,000 visors a week \u2013 and that number is growing. We have people at home working on their own machines and in schools across the town.\u201d The boys are still producing visors at home, and visiting the hub regularly, said Sparey-Taylor. They have been astonished at how quickly the project developed. \u201cI heard Joseph describing it as like having a caterpillar in your hand which grows into a beautiful butterfly and flies away.\u201d Isaac said he felt \u201ckind of overwhelmed\u201d by the speed of events. \u201cThere\u2019s so much going on now, but I feel proud at helping to start it off.\u201d",

Last week, Adam Tschorn, deputy fashion editor of the <em>LA Times</em> , <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2020-04-17/working-from-home-regular-work-wardrobe-dress-up\">wrote an impassioned plea</a> against the rise of the tracksuit bottom in our work-from-home environment. \u201cPlease, can we put away those sweatpants, ratty, grey, decades-old collegiate sweatshirts and obscure minor league baseball caps, and start our workdays looking like we deserve the pay we\u2019re lucky enough to be earning while the world around us burns?\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps he was recalling the last time sweatpants were popular \u2013 in the early 2000s, with the rise of brands like Juicy Couture, and celebrities such as Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, Amy Poehler (as the naff \u201ccool mom\u201d in <em>Mean Girls</em>) and Paris Hilton (she<a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/10/29/paris-hilton-says-she-owns-100-juicy-couture-tracksuits/\"> infamously said</a> she owned 100 pairs), wearing them as loungewear.</p> <p>The popularity of the jogging bottom has prompted questions about our post-coronavirus workwear: will we be trading our pencil skirts and chinos for something with an elasticated waist? \u201cI was wondering that myself,\u201d says Sofia Prantera, the designer behind label Aries Arise, whose No Problemo tie-dyed tracksuits have become a cult favourite. </p> <p>\u201cI think there are two outcomes: \u2018I never want to see sweatpants ever again\u2019 or \u2018how will I ever be comfortable in fixed-waist trousers?\u2019 Hopefully for us the latter.\u201d </p> <p>Rees says: \u201cWe\u2019ve moved a long way (forward) with office attire. There\u2019s absolutely a place for them in the workplace.\u201d</p> <p>But, cautions David Telfer head of design at <a href=\"https://info.sunspel.com/latest-from-sunspel/made-in-britain-the-road-trip\">Sunspel</a>, \u201cit is about what you feel socially comfortable going to work in\u201d.</p> <p>Are joggers indicative of a bigger change? A hitherto previously unexplored era where all areas of our lives are inextricably mixed? Kim Toffoletti, associate professor of sociology at Deakin University in Australia, thinks so. \u201cTheir popularity at the moment might precipitate a move away from more formal attire, an emphasis on looking \u2018professional\u2019 at work, and more flexibility between boundaries of living and working,\u201d she says.</p>",

The popularity of the jogging bottom has prompted questions about our post-coronavirus workwear: will we be trading our pencil skirts and chinos for something with an elasticated waist? \u201cI was wondering that myself,\u201d says Sofia Prantera, the designer behind label Aries Arise, whose No Problemo tie-dyed tracksuits have become a cult favourite. \u201cI think there are two outcomes: \u2018I never want to see sweatpants ever again\u2019 or \u2018how will I ever be comfortable in fixed-waist trousers?\u2019 Hopefully for us the latter.\u201d Rees says: \u201cWe\u2019ve moved a long way (forward) with office attire. There\u2019s absolutely a place for them in the workplace.\u201d But, cautions David Telfer head of design at Sunspel, \u201cit is about what you feel socially comfortable going to work in\u201d. Are joggers indicative of a bigger change? A hitherto previously unexplored era where all areas of our lives are inextricably mixed? Kim Toffoletti, associate professor of sociology at Deakin University in Australia, thinks so. \u201cTheir popularity at the moment might precipitate a move away from more formal attire, an emphasis on looking \u2018professional\u2019 at work, and more flexibility between boundaries of living and working,\u201d she says.",

      "body": "<p>Repeat after me: there is no magic bullet for getting us through this pandemic. And smartphone-based proximity-sensing is definitely not that bullet, though it might be useful if two conditions are met. One is that it\u2019s perceived by citizens to be trustworthy and protects their privacy; the other is that it\u2019s deployed in conjunction with a massive increase in state capacity for testing and treatment. Neither condition will be easy to satisfy.</p> <p>There are clear indications that the UK government is now actively considering use of the technology as a way of easing the lockdown. If this signals an outbreak in Whitehall of <a href=\"http://bostonreview.net/books-ideas/whats-wrong-technological-fixes\">tech \u201csolutionism</a>\u201d \u2013 the belief that for every problem there is a technological answer \u2013 then we should be concerned. Tech solutions often do as much harm as good, for example, by increasing social exclusion, lacking accountability and failing to make real inroads into the problem they are supposedly addressing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/france-apple-google-privacy-contact-tracing-coronavirus\">France urges Apple and Google to ease privacy rules on contact tracing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The technology involved, though complex, in essence provides a way of automating what has been a way of dealing with plagues since at least the 1600s: find those infected, lock them away or treat them and then trace everyone with whom they\u2019ve been in contact and quarantine them too. This is a very labour-intensive task that is not feasible in a society such as the UK\u2019s. But many smartphones have low-energy Bluetooth sensors that automatically register the proximity of other similarly equipped phones, while most smartphones also log their location using GPS signals. So in principle we could use smartphones to do contact-tracing on a large scale.</p> <p>That\u2019s the principle. In practice, there are various ways of using these capabilities in the Covid-19 context. Centralised models involve phones equipped with an app to relay their data, supposedly anonymised, to a central server run by a government health authority. This may make things simple for the government, but it\u2019s a nightmare in terms of state surveillance especially if the authorities try to make installation of the app compulsory.</p> <p>Decentralised models involve keeping most of the data on your phone and only broadcasting to all the phones to which you\u2019ve been close via a secure relay server if you\u2019ve been diagnosed. All of your contacts\u2019 phones will then inform their owners that they\u2019ve been in contact with a diagnosed case of Covid-19. And of course all of the communications implied by this are encrypted by default. Because the individuals involved are notified immediately as soon as someone in their proximity is diagnosed, this method shortens exposure risk and enables health providers to suppress the virus rapidly. It restores agency to the individual, lessens the risks of state surveillance and better protects users\u2019 privacy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Smartphone contact-tracing would mark a step-change in state surveillance capabilities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You don\u2019t need to be a rocket scientist, let alone an IT expert, to realise that there are legions of devils in the details. (Harvard\u2019s Safra Center for Ethics has a <a href=\"https://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/white_paper_5_outpacing_the_virus_final.pdf\">very good guide</a> to some of them.) Who tells your phone that you\u2019ve been diagnosed, for example? Given the possibility that \u2013 in a post-lockdown scenario \u2013 individuals with Covid-19 might be subjected to stigma, harassment or dismissal, they might be understandably reluctant to broadcast the fact.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the problem that not everyone has a smartphone, even though it\u2019s commonly supposed in tech circles that they do. The pandemic has revealed that a significant minority of the population (mostly older people) still relies on olde-worlde feature phones. Moreover, it turns out that not all smartphones are created equal: <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/04/2-billion-phones-cannot-use-google-and-apple-contract-tracing-tech/\">one estimate</a> is that 50% of all smartphones can\u2019t use the proximity-sensing systems being developed by Apple and Google. Given that any proximity-sensing system would probably have to cover at least 60% of the population to be truly effective, does this mean that Matt Hancock is going to be giving out Huawei handsets like Smarties to the Nokia-using poor?</p> <p>I could go on but you get the point. The problem with magic bullets is that they sometimes miss their target. The biggest issue of all with smartphone contact-tracing, though, is that it would mark a step-change in state surveillance capabilities. Such a momentous decision cannot be left to Matt Hancock and his colleagues in their Downing Street bunker. This is a central point in a <a href=\"https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/exit-through-the-app-store-how-the-uk-government-should-use-technology-to-transition-from-the-covid-19-global-public-health-crisis/\">landmark review</a> of the issue conducted by UK research group the Ada Lovelace Institute. A decision to deploy mandatory proximity-sensing technology, says the institute, is too important to be left to technocrats. There has to be proper parliamentary scrutiny and primary legislation with real sunset clauses. No fudging with orders in council by frightened ministers. I agree.

      "bodyText": "Repeat after me: there is no magic bullet for getting us through this pandemic. And smartphone-based proximity-sensing is definitely not that bullet, though it might be useful if two conditions are met. One is that it\u2019s perceived by citizens to be trustworthy and protects their privacy; the other is that it\u2019s deployed in conjunction with a massive increase in state capacity for testing and treatment. Neither condition will be easy to satisfy. There are clear indications that the UK government is now actively considering use of the technology as a way of easing the lockdown. If this signals an outbreak in Whitehall of tech \u201csolutionism\u201d \u2013 the belief that for every problem there is a technological answer \u2013 then we should be concerned. Tech solutions often do as much harm as good, for example, by increasing social exclusion, lacking accountability and failing to make real inroads into the problem they are supposedly addressing. The technology involved, though complex, in essence provides a way of automating what has been a way of dealing with plagues since at least the 1600s: find those infected, lock them away or treat them and then trace everyone with whom they\u2019ve been in contact and quarantine them too. This is a very labour-intensive task that is not feasible in a society such as the UK\u2019s. But many smartphones have low-energy Bluetooth sensors that automatically register the proximity of other similarly equipped phones, while most smartphones also log their location using GPS signals. So in principle we could use smartphones to do contact-tracing on a large scale. That\u2019s the principle. In practice, there are various ways of using these capabilities in the Covid-19 context. Centralised models involve phones equipped with an app to relay their data, supposedly anonymised, to a central server run by a government health authority. This may make things simple for the government, but it\u2019s a nightmare in terms of state surveillance especially if the authorities try to make installation of the app compulsory. Decentralised models involve keeping most of the data on your phone and only broadcasting to all the phones to which you\u2019ve been close via a secure relay server if you\u2019ve been diagnosed. All of your contacts\u2019 phones will then inform their owners that they\u2019ve been in contact with a diagnosed case of Covid-19. And of course all of the communications implied by this are encrypted by default. Because the individuals involved are notified immediately as soon as someone in their proximity is diagnosed, this method shortens exposure risk and enables health providers to suppress the virus rapidly. It restores agency to the individual, lessens the risks of state surveillance and better protects users\u2019 privacy. You don\u2019t need to be a rocket scientist, let alone an IT expert, to realise that there are legions of devils in the details. (Harvard\u2019s Safra Center for Ethics has a very good guide to some of them.) Who tells your phone that you\u2019ve been diagnosed, for example? Given the possibility that \u2013 in a post-lockdown scenario \u2013 individuals with Covid-19 might be subjected to stigma, harassment or dismissal, they might be understandably reluctant to broadcast the fact. Then there\u2019s the problem that not everyone has a smartphone, even though it\u2019s commonly supposed in tech circles that they do. The pandemic has revealed that a significant minority of the population (mostly older people) still relies on olde-worlde feature phones. Moreover, it turns out that not all smartphones are created equal: one estimate is that 50% of all smartphones can\u2019t use the proximity-sensing systems being developed by Apple and Google. Given that any proximity-sensing system would probably have to cover at least 60% of the population to be truly effective, does this mean that Matt Hancock is going to be giving out Huawei handsets like Smarties to the Nokia-using poor? I could go on but you get the point. The problem with magic bullets is that they sometimes miss their target. The biggest issue of all with smartphone contact-tracing, though, is that it would mark a step-change in state surveillance capabilities. Such a momentous decision cannot be left to Matt Hancock and his colleagues in their Downing Street bunker. This is a central point in a landmark review of the issue conducted by UK research group the Ada Lovelace Institute. A decision to deploy mandatory proximity-sensing technology, says the institute, is too important to be left to technocrats. There has to be proper parliamentary scrutiny and primary legislation with real sunset clauses. No fudging with orders in council by frightened ministers. I agree. If we get this wrong, not only will we not succeed in easing the lockdown, but we might also be kissing goodbye to the shrivelled democracy we still possess.

      "bodyText": "The US shale industry was forecast to deliver record high oil production this year. Only a few months ago the Permian basin was expected to increase its oil output to a new high of 4.8 million barrels per day, on the way to spurring the entire US market to a record daily output rate of 9 million bpd in 2020. The Permian, North America\u2019s largest shale basin, has been one of the biggest drivers of a shale oil boom that helped make the United States the biggest oil producer in the world, ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia. Instead, the region \u2013 which stretches from western Texas to eastern New Mexico \u2013 has endured its biggest one-month production decline in history. Now observers expect to see a string of oil-well closures, rising debts and bankruptcies as the coronavirus pandemic slashes demand for crude and threatens to wipe out hundreds of startup frackers. Suddenly, reaching 9 million bpd has become highly unlikely. The impact of the virus has slashed demand for oil across the globe, triggering a race to fill the world\u2019s remaining storage facilities with unwanted crude to avoid shutting down wells entirely In the US, this has forced producers to pay customers to take their barrels, and caused the worst price collapse in market history. \u201cThe current price environment is more or less a complete disaster for the majority of shale companies,\u201d says Artem Abramov, head of global shale research at the consultancy Rystad Energy. \u201cAt $30 a barrel, many companies would be able to adapt gradually. But at $20 a barrel, many players \u2013 especially those with poor balance sheets \u2013 will struggle financially.\u201d The benchmark price of US crude, known as the West Texas Intermediate (WTI), crashed below zero for the first time last week for May deliveries, and the price for June dropped by a third to just over $15. The rest of the price curve for 2020 shows prices under $30 a barrel \u2013 well below the $55 that most US producers need to break even. The US largest storage facility \u2013 at Cushing in Oklahoma \u2013 is already two-thirds full and the remaining capacity is understood to have been snapped up by oil traders and brokers. Meanwhile, off the US coast, supergiant oil tankers \u2013 each filled with around 2 million barrels of crude \u2013 have been paid to stand idle as makeshift storage. Oil producers without storage space have limited options: sell crude at a loss to those still willing to take it, or shut down oil wells and risk financial ruin. \u201cThere are no good answers for the industry in a $30-per-barrel environment,\u201d says Stephen Richardson, an analyst at Evercore ISI. \u201cLet\u2019s not fool ourselves: it\u2019s all uneconomic and likely to stay that way.\u201d Abramov says: \u201cMarket forces will ultimately regulate the industry in a very brutal manner, forcing massive \u2018shut-ins\u2019 [well closures] across the country before the market imbalance can improve.\u201d The crash threatens to change the face of the industry, say experts. The number of fracking projects in America\u2019s shale heartlands has already fallen by two-thirds as oil producers struggle to find buyers for their crude, or space to store it. Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture tightly packed shale rock and release trapped oil and gas. It is a controversial method, with environmental groups warning that it could pose a health hazard by poisoning water aquifers \u2013 on top of producing more carbon-intensive fossil fuels. But it has made the US a powerhouse in oil and gas production once more. Continental Resources, the largest oil producer in North Dakota, has reportedly stopped all drilling and shut in most of its wells in the state\u2019s Bakken shale field. The company, owned by billionaire Harold Hamm, is understood to have told customers it will not be supplying oil after the collapse in oil markets last week. The US oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron have also set out plans to rein in production and spending. Exxon will cut planned spending by 30% or $10bn (\u00a38.1bn) this year, while Chevron will cut spending by a fifth, or $4bn, compared with last year. The downturn is likely to hit the thousands of small, sometimes family-owned, US fracking companies, which will be forced into administration or into mergers with more financially resilient rivals. \u201cThis will be oil\u2019s last dance for many US producers, as the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to save the shale industry will fall short,\u201d says Konstantinos Venetis, a senior economist at research firm TS Lombard. \u201cNorth American shale oil producers will be forced to shut in very soon and most of the smaller players will not be able to survive this low-price and dismal-demand environment.\u201d President Trump is preparing to use treasury funds to buy US oil to store in the government\u2019s strategic reserves, and is understood to be considering blocks on all imports of crude from Saudi Arabia which are already en route. The measures may offer respite to a few producers but are too little too late, analysts say. The industry cannot expect the same help from investors that was offered following the 2015 oil market crash either.

Then the virus chomped down on the US, it began to snow and Underwood has been trapped there alone for over a month, boiling snow for water.

Well, not quite like Underwood\u2019s, because the supernatural element really does give his snowed-in spooktacular an extra show-offy kind of edge, but there are plenty of people who have found themselves stuck in places they did not expect to be stuck in. I am fascinated by each and every one of them and collect them like Panini stickers for my Covid-19 album. There are the low-level modern urban legends, of couples who decided to shack up together permanently, speeding up their courtship, <em>Catastrophe</em>-style, after only a date or two.

      "bodyText": "A few weeks ago, a man called Brent Underwood arrived for a week-long stay in the uninhabited town of Cerro Gordo, California, which he bought for \u00a31.1m in 2018. He sent the live-in caretaker of this former silver mining resort home when the pandemic began to bite. Then the virus chomped down on the US, it began to snow and Underwood has been trapped there alone for over a month, boiling snow for water. The ghost town is, of course, also haunted by the spirits of dead children. \u201cFor the most part, I leave the ghosts alone and they leave me alone. I try to respect their space,\u201d Underwood told the NY Post. If he can only have a go at respecting the ghosts\u2019 space while self-isolating in an empty town, imagine being cooped up with him in a city flat with no garden. There are lots of stories such as Underwood\u2019s doing the rounds. Well, not quite like Underwood\u2019s, because the supernatural element really does give his snowed-in spooktacular an extra show-offy kind of edge, but there are plenty of people who have found themselves stuck in places they did not expect to be stuck in. I am fascinated by each and every one of them and collect them like Panini stickers for my Covid-19 album. There are the low-level modern urban legends, of couples who decided to shack up together permanently, speeding up their courtship, Catastrophe-style, after only a date or two.

      "bodyText": "Pregnant women on the lowest incomes are being denied vital financial support during the Covid-19 crisis, according to unions and women\u2019s support groups, who are calling for urgent reforms to universal credit. An anomaly in the way universal credit differentiates between pregnant earners has created an unfair system, it is argued. Universal credit treats maternity allowance, which is paid to the lowest-earning women and those who are self-employed, as \u201cunearned income\u201d, which means it is deducted from their benefit payments. By contrast, statutory maternity pay, paid to higher-earning women by their employers, who claim it back, is treated as \u201cearnings\u201d, and is therefore largely ignored when their benefit payments are calculated. Both forms of payment are supposed to give women financial support at a time when they need to bond with their baby. Maternity Action, a charity that campaigns on behalf of pregnant mothers, says the inequitable system means some women on maternity allowance who apply for universal credit end up more than \u00a34,100 worse off over 39 weeks of their paid maternity leave than women on statutory maternity pay. \u201cWe do appreciate that the support schemes have been developed in difficult circumstances,\u201d said Rosalind Bragg, Maternity Action\u2019s director. \u201cHowever, it would take little effort to resolve the unfair treatment of maternity allowance in universal credit calculations\u2026 The financial cost to government would be extremely low, but it would make a massive difference to women and their families.\u201d Last week, an alliance of 14 unions, women\u2019s rights groups, charities and law firms wrote to Dominc Raab, urging him to take action. Their letter claims that \u201cthe prime minister\u2019s announcement on 16 March that pregnant women are classed as vulnerable led directly to many pregnant women being sent home on sick leave, in breach of existing health and safety law\u201d. A DWP spokesperson said: \u201c It is right that a claimant\u2019s award is adjusted to take into account support they are already receiving, including income through benefits.\u201d But TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said the imbalance was another example of why universal credit needed overhauling. \u201cBritain\u2019s lowest-paid mums are having financial support unfairly deducted at a time when family budgets are already under stress from a new baby,\u201d she said. \u201cCoronavirus has exposed gaping holes in our safety net.\u201d",

Along with myriad NHS procedures, fertility treatment has been deemed \u201cnon-essential\u201d during the pandemic. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority announced that it was <a href=\"https://www.hfea.gov.uk/treatments/covid-19-and-fertility-treatment/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-patients/\">suspended until further notice</a> \u2013 affecting not just new patients but those in the middle of treatment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/ivf-funding-cut-luxury-rich-coronavirus\">Coronavirus has slashed my chances of IVF treatment | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In response, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/thousands-lose-last-hope-of-having-a-baby-as-lockdown-closes-ivf-clinics\">IVF patients</a> talked about their distress at the decision. The years trying to conceive and of waiting for treatment. Painful injections. Hormonal rollercoasters. Failed attempts. The physical, psychological and emotional toll. Anxiety that funding could be withdrawn. For some, the hopelessness about time running out, particularly for women over 40. As harrowing as the accounts were, they were also instructive: contrary to certain stereotypes peddled over the years, there was nothing entitled or presumptuous about these women.</p> <p>Everyone understands the terrible impact that coronavirus is having on the NHS, including for cancer patients.

      "bodyText": "Don\u2019t we owe it to those desperate for IVF treatment not to fall for the persistent spoilt/demanding female infertility narrative? Along with myriad NHS procedures, fertility treatment has been deemed \u201cnon-essential\u201d during the pandemic. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority announced that it was suspended until further notice \u2013 affecting not just new patients but those in the middle of treatment. In response, IVF patients talked about their distress at the decision. The years trying to conceive and of waiting for treatment. Painful injections. Hormonal rollercoasters. Failed attempts. The physical, psychological and emotional toll. Anxiety that funding could be withdrawn. For some, the hopelessness about time running out, particularly for women over 40. As harrowing as the accounts were, they were also instructive: contrary to certain stereotypes peddled over the years, there was nothing entitled or presumptuous about these women. Everyone understands the terrible impact that coronavirus is having on the NHS, including for cancer patients. However, this shouldn\u2019t cancel our sympathy for those devastated by the suspension of IVF, some of whom may be feeling that they\u2019re at the fertility last-chance saloon.

      "bodyText": "More than 20,000 people have now died in UK hospitals after testing positive for coronavirus, making the country the fifth in the world to pass that grim milestone. Following a rise of 813 deaths since the number announced on Friday, the total now stands at 20,319, almost six weeks after the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said on 17 March that keeping the toll under 20,000 would be \u201ca good outcome in terms of where we would hope to get\u201d. The government is not going to give a date for schools reopening or more general relaxing of lockdown rules until the five tests are met, Priti Patel said. The home secretary said it would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d to get people\u2019s hopes up as this is still a dangerous time for the country, and tests including a decline in the death rate and not risking a second surge in infections. The tests, previously laid out by the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, are: to protect the NHS\u2019s ability to cope with coronavirus cases, to see a consistent fall in the daily death rate, to produce reliable data on infection and death rates, to be confident that testing and PPE are being managed properly, and to not risk a second peak of infections. Test slots and testing kits for key workers and their households ran out for a second day in a row in England and Wales. The BBC reported that home testing kits ran out within 15 minutes and test slots were fully booked by 10am. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said more would be available by 8am on Sunday. A campaign was launched in England to urge people seriously ill with non-coronavirus conditions to seek medical help if they need it. Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, stressed that the health service is still there for patients without coronavirus who needed urgent and emergency services for stroke, heart attack, and other often fatal conditions. The campaign urges people to contact their GP or NHS 111 as they normally would, or to dial 999 in an emergency. As ever, thank you to everybody who got in touch throughout the day with tips and suggestions. That\u2019s it for today from us on the UK side, but you can continue to follow the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the pandemic over on the global live blog. As UK universities face huge losses due to the coronavirus pandemic, experts have warned they need to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to shift their degrees online. Only around 20 universities are in a position to provide a good range of high-quality online courses by the new academic year in September, according to Prof Sir Tim O\u2019Shea, the former vice-chancellor of Edinburgh University. Some of the country\u2019s top-ranked Russell Group institutions, including Oxford and Cambridge, were not in that category, he added. The warning comes as the sector seeks to attract and retain students already deterred from starting or continuing degrees next year, with physical distancing likely to mean lecture theatres and campus bars are closed. Most universities would face costs of at least \u00a310m to create five or six new online degrees in different faculties, said O\u2019Shea, a leading expert on computer-based learning. This would total well over \u00a31bn across the sector. Durham University this week retracted controversial plans to deliver online-only degrees after protests by students and lecturers. Meanwhile, the vice-chancellor of Manchester University said it was preparing to expand its online courses to offset a predicted \u00a3270m loss next year. Q. Parents are trying to juggle childcare with work as schools are closed and the economy has to keep running, do you sympathise with them? Priti Patel says these are very difficult and unusual times. She pays tribute to schools, especially teachers and headteachers, staying open for children of key workers. The five tests will have to be met before schools can reopen, she adds. The tests, previously laid out by Dominic Raab and Gavin Williamson, are: to protect the NHS\u2019s ability to cope with coronavirus cases, to see a consistent fall in the daily death rate, to produce reliable data on infection and death rates, to be confident that testing and PPE are being managed properly, and to not risk a second peak of infections. Q. There was much debate about the timing of entering the lockdown. What was the point of delaying it if it\u2019s going to go on and on? Patel says this isn\u2019t a binary choice. We can\u2019t just remove restrictions and move back to how things were, she says. She says she cannot give a date for when it will end and when schools and businesses can reopen. That would be irresponsible and get hopes up, she says. Prof Stephen Powis says the timing was a really difficult decision, particularly regarding economic harm as a result of a lockdown. And that\u2019s the end of today\u2019s press conference. Q. The Royal College of Surgeons says the backlog of cancelled operations could take five years to clear \u2013 is that the timescale you\u2019re working on and how many lives do you estimate these delays will cost? Priti Patel says decisions about prioritisation of treatments will be based on resources and capacity in the NHS. Prof Stephen Powis adds that elective surgery had to be stepped down in order to cope in the surge in patients with coronavirus. As soon as we can, we want to step that back up again, he says. Q. When Dominic Cummings attended Sage, did he ever say anything and if so, what? Prof Stephen Powis says he has been participating since towards the end of February. His experience of Sage is that it has been about scientists and science, with experts from a variety of disciplines. It is a scientific discussion between scientific advisers in his experience, he says. The contributions and advice goes from the scientific experts in that group to the government. He does not comment on Cummings. Q. Regarding the rise in motor vehicle use, is the government sending out mixed messages by telling people to stay at home while also allowing non-essential work to take place? Prit Patel says that if you can\u2019t work from home, you can go to work as long as physical distancing is practised. She says she understands it is frustrating being at home for five weeks, but physical distancing will continue to be vital in the future. Q. Why can\u2019t households be extended to a small group rather than just people living under the same roof? Prof Stephen Powis says the virus can spread from household to household, so the purpose of the lockdown was to disrupt that chain of transmission. I think we\u2019d all be disappointed if we forfeited those gains by allowing chains of transmission to start to be re-established, because then we would start going backwards. Q. When do you expect the peak to come in care homes? Prof Stephen Powis says that all along they have tried to resist predicting when the peak will come. With care homes, Public Health England is assisting when outbreaks occur and the government is increasing testing. Q. Doctors and nurses coming into the country have to pay a surcharge for themselves and their families \u2013 isn\u2019t it time to scrap it? Priti Patel says a range of measures are under review. They are taking questions from the media now. Q. You said weeks ago the UK will have done well if the death rate stayed below 20,000. We have passed that number now \u2013 does this mean the strategy should have been different? Prof Stephen Powis says every death is tragic and his heart goes out to their loved ones. This is a once-in-a-century global crisis, he says, and there were bound to be challenges. Even countries who got on top of it early on are starting to see new infections. This will continue to be something we work through in the months ahead \u2013 a sprint not a marathon, he adds. Moving past this milestone shows it is still absolutely critical to follow physical distancing guidelines, he says, because we are seeing benefits and this will only continue if we keep doing that. Priti Patel adds that we are not out of the woods yet, despite the fact we\u2019re making progress. This is a deeply tragic and moving moment. Q. Are you able to envisage relaxing any of the lockdown measures now? Patel says it isn\u2019t optional that the five tests have to be met, so the science can judge when we can revise the measures. It is not now, she says. We need people to continue. Prof Stephen Powis says the number of new cases diagnosed by testing is reasonably stable. With the number of tests expanding, we can expect to see a rise in new cases, but it is fairly stable for now. There is a sustained reduction in the number of people being treated in hospitals, particularly in London and beginning in other parts of the country, he says. He says the number of patients in critical care is starting to decline, although that will lag behind the overall number of admissions to hospitals. A new line for Northern Ireland has been introduced, showing new data that is not currently comparable with the other data as it is cumulative rather than daily, he adds. The number of deaths is showing a trend towards a decline, which will occur later than the trend in hospital admissions and critical care. If we continue to adhere to physical distancing we will begin to see a decline in deaths, he says. Powis says transport use continues to fall across public transport and roads. There is concern that motor vehicle use is starting to rise again. Data from Apple Maps shows a decrease since lockdown in requests for walking, driving or public transport directions. He says it\u2019s tempting to go out in warm, sunny weather, but he can\u2019t emphasise enough that we are not through this yet and it\u2019s critical people continue to comply with physical distancing measures. It would be foolish and not right if we lost the benefits we\u2019ve gained over the last four weeks, which have been hard for everybody. Prof Stephen Powis is speaking now. The NHS has not been overwhelmed and has capacity to cope, he says. He reminds people the NHS is still available for treatment of conditions that are not related to coronavirus, including sick children, pregnant women, and those who fear they may be suffering from stroke or heart conditions. Call 111, contact your GP or dial 999 in a real emergency, he reminds everyone. Fast diagnosis and treatment is absolutely crucial, he says, so do not delay. The NHS is still there for you. Lynne Owens says thinkyouknow.co.uk has materials and details to help protect children online. Fraudsters target members of the public by phone, text and email with scams relating to fake prescription drugs, she says. She urges the public to exercise caution and report anything suspicious to your bank and to Action Fraud. Lynne Owens is speaking now. Criminals have adapted to this situation but so has law enforcement, she says. Serious and organised criminals are looking to take advantage of these unprecedented times \u2013 they are \u201camoral, corrupt and exploitative\u201d, she says. Offenders are trying to avoid lockdown rules to continue illicit activities, she says. More than 2,000 scams relating to coronavirus have been taken down online, including fake shops, phishing scams, and the selling of fake testing kits and PPE, she says. Priti Patel says staying at home for almost five weeks has been tough for many. Every single person across the UK has given up a great deal, she says. Our efforts are working and your sacrifices are saving lives, she says. It\u2019s imperative that people continue to follow the rules designed to protect their loved ones, she adds. We all want to return to normal as soon and as safely as we can, Patel says. The five tests must first be met, she says. These five conditions under which the lockdown might be eased were set out by Dominic Raab earlier this month. Patel says criminals will not be allowed to take advantage of these unprecedented times. Crime has fallen compared to the same period last year. However, she says criminals continue to capitalise on this crisis. Law enforcement is on to you, she tells them. Priti Patel says the entire nation is grieving as the UK passes another significant milestone. She pays tribute to frontline workers whose exceptional public service and sacrifice, she says, will not be forgotten. The home secretary is speaking now. As of 9am, 640,792 tests have now been carried out in the UK, including 28,760 yesterday. 148,377 people have tested positive, an increase of 4,913 cases since yesterday. 16,411 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down from 17,049 yesterday. Of those in hospital, 20,319 have died, an increase of 813 fatalities since yesterday. The government\u2019s daily coronavirus news briefing is due to start shortly and will be led for the second time by the home secretary, Priti Patel. She will be joined by Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director for NHS England, and Lynne Owens, the director-general of the National Crime Agency. Here is some much-needed joy. A six-month-old \u201cmiracle baby\u201d born with a heart condition has recovered from coronavirus. Nurses clapped and cheered through tears as baby Erin was moved out of isolation at Alder Hey hospital having tested positive two weeks ago. She remains in the Merseyside hospital for treatment for other ongoing conditions but is doing well, staff said. The Liverpool Echo has the story. A further 813 people have died in hospital after testing positive for Covid-19, taking the UK total to 20,319. It comes almost six weeks after the chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance said on 17 March that keeping the toll under 20,000 would be \u201ca good outcome in terms of where we would hope to get\u201d. Northern Ireland has confirmed a further 16 patients have died after testing positive for Covid-19, taking the total there to 294. Another 104 patients have tested positive, taking the total number of positive cases to 3,226. The public in Wales are getting used to stricter regulations about leaving their homes as they spend their fifth weekend under lockdown. Revised restrictions which came into force on Saturday across Wales tell people they must exercise \u201cas close as possible\u201d to home. While parts of the country enjoyed the warm weather, police were continuing to carry out patrols to enforce the stay-at-home rules. Dyfed-Powys police said there had been reports of an increase in traffic in Montgomeryshire and checks would be carried out throughout the weekend. In Gwent, officers described it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d that people drove nearly 12 miles from Newport to the blue lagoon at Pantygasseg. Police in Swansea also questioned whether it was necessary to queue up to enter the B&amp;Q store at the Morfa retail park. Cyclists are being told they should travel no farther than a \u201creasonable walking distance from home\u201d. The legal guidance states people should not drive to exercise unless absolutely necessary but people with disabilities can exercise more than once a day. The changes were announced by the Welsh government alongside a three-phase \u201ctraffic light\u201d system to lift Wales out of lockdown. The first minister Mark Drakeford denied his government\u2019s plan means Wales is moving away from an all-UK approach to ending the lockdown. NHS England has announced a further 711 deaths in hospital of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total to 18,084. Of the 711 new deaths announced today, 105 occurred on 24 April, 236 on 23 April and 66 on 22 April. The figures also show that 235 of the new deaths took place between 1 and 21 April while the remaining 69 deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 11 March. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for postmortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated. The figures published by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day, with a current total of 855. A total of 1,231 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for Covid-19, a rise of 47 from 1,184 on Friday, the Scottish government has confirmed. The number of people who have tested positive is 10,051, up 354 from Friday\u2019s figure of 9,697. The figures published on the government\u2019s website confirmed 1,748 patients were in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, a rise of 38 from 1,710 the previous day, 140 of whom were in intensive care, down one. A further 23 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Wales, taking the total to 774, health officials said. Public Health Wales said following data cleaning, 22 previously reported deaths which did not have a positive test result have been removed. A further 299 people have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 8,900. Dr Chris Williams of Public Health Wales, said: Based on the new case numbers there is emerging evidence suggesting a levelling-off in the number of new cases of Covid-19 in Wales, which may be an indication of the effectiveness of lockdown measures. However, it is still too early to tell for sure, and it is too soon to end the current social distancing rules. Public Health Wales continues to fully support the extension of lockdown measures, which is essential to avoid reversing the gains we have made in slowing the spread of this virus, protecting our NHS and saving lives. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has urged the government to advise the public to wear \u201cnon-medical face coverings\u201d in environments where it is difficult to maintain a safe distance from others. The former Brexit secretary David Davis has said no political appointee should attend Sage meetings to ensure there are no outside influence on the formulation of scientific advice. Labour urged the government earlier this morning to bar the prime minister\u2019s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, from meetings of the secret scientific group advising on the coronavirus pandemic over concerns that its independence has been compromised. The president of the Dutch football association has cast doubt on the feasibility of the Premier League playing matches behind closed doors in June after the government suggested it might be possible for some sports to resume within a few weeks. Just Spee\u2019s intervention comes after the Dutch Eredivisie became the first major European football league to cancel its season in response to the coronavirus crisis. For the first time since 1944-45, the Dutch top flight will not have a champion and there will be no relegation or promotion either from the 18-team division. He said: The UK will hold on to a sliver of hope as long as it is there, but in reality the chances of completing the Premier League season are slim. The English season will need a number of weeks to complete and I doubt there will be enough time. Seeing what is happening with things getting postponed week by week it is probably not realistic. The public has been told to stay at home as forecasters predict warm and sunny weather across most of the country for the UK\u2019s fifth weekend under lockdown. The long spell of high temperatures is prompting concerns that people may defy lockdown rules, which came into force on 23 March. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, urged people on Friday to continue to adhere to the restrictions despite some encouraging signs that the coronavirus crisis is beginning to ease. The country has done incredibly well in adhering to social distancing and there is a danger as we go into yet another warm sunny weekend that people think that perhaps these graphs are showing that the peak is over. It isn\u2019t over, we\u2019re riding perhaps, we hope, a downward trend but it is by no means, no means established yet. Chelsea Football Club have announced they will not furlough any full-time staff and that they continue to be paid 100% of their wages. In a statement, several weeks after Liverpool reversed a controversial decision to put around 200 non-playing staff on furlough, Chelsea \u2013 thought to be one of the 10 richest football clubs in the world \u2013 said they were not planning to make any staff redundant and that match day staff employed directly would be \u201ccompensated as if we had been operating as normal\u201d. Liverpool sparked outrage after they announced they would follow Newcastle, Tottenham, Norwich and Bournemouth in using the coronavirus job retention scheme to cover 80% of wages due to staff whose work has stopped since the football calendar was suspended on 13 March. The Premier League leaders had confirmed they would pay the remaining 20% to those on furlough, with almost 90 of those affected working in the club stores, and would consider reimbursing monies received at a later date. Low-cost airline Wizz Air has announced plans to resume flights from Luton Airport on 1 May. The airline said it would implement measures to encourage physical distancing, as well as enhancing cleanliness on board. Destinations will include Budapest, Lisbon and Tenerife. Owain Jones, managing director of Wizz Air UK, said: As we restart selected Luton flights to provide an essential service to passengers who need to travel, our primary concern is the health, safety and well-being of our customers and crew. The protective measures that we are implementing will ensure the most sanitary conditions possible. We encourage our customers to watch our new video on how to stay safe when travelling, as well as for more details on our new health and safety measures. This week, the Ryanair chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, said that its planes would not return to the sky if the airline had to leave middle seats empty. He told the Financial Times: We can\u2019t make money on 66% load factors. Even if you do that, the middle seat doesn\u2019t deliver any social distancing, so it\u2019s kind of an idiotic idea that doesn\u2019t achieve anything anyway. Downing Street has removed China from a list of nations from which it draws international comparisons over the spread of coronavirus amid concerns about the accuracy of the country\u2019s figures, according to the Times. Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said: This data is used to judge the effectiveness of our own response, whether good or bad. It\u2019s important we are comparing like with like, otherwise our own responses could be distorted leading to more deaths in the UK. Clearly No 10 believes the same as the rest of the world \u2014 that China\u2019s data is unreliable and possibly false. A government spokeswoman said: The data on China has been removed from the daily press conference slide used to compare the number of deaths from coronavirus internationally. This is because a significant revision to China\u2019s data on April 17 means we are unable to compare their daily death rates with other countries, as we do not know when deaths occurred. Although not a major revision, an additional 40 previously unreported coronavirus deaths occurred in England and Wales in March, according to official backdated figures that suggested almost one in five coronavirus deaths are occurring outside hospitals. It has also been reported that people who have died in the UK and had Covid-19 mentioned on their death certificates have been underreported. In case you missed it, here is the exclusive story from the Guardian\u2019s environment editor Damian Carrington that coronavirus has been detected on particles of air pollution by scientists investigating whether this could enable infections at longer distances. The research is still in its infancy but other research has indicated correlations between increased Covid-19 deaths and higher levels of air pollution before the pandemic. And long-term exposure to dirty air is known to damage lung health, which could make people more vulnerable to Covid-19. Matt Hancock has shared a picture of himself taking part in the clinical trial to establish if plasma from the blood of recovered patients could help treat others who have contracted the coronavirus. The health secretary recovered after testing positive for Covid-19 in late March and urged people to take part in the trial if asked, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s painless.\u201d An NHS trust is to offer maternity care at Aston Villa\u2019s home ground, following the success of a similar tie-up with West Bromwich Albion. The Sandwell and West Birmingham trust said Villa Park\u2019s North Stand would host weekday clinics for expectant mothers and new parents from Monday. Postnatal and antenatal care by midwives is already being hosted at Albion\u2019s Hawthorns ground, including health visitors holding appointments for new parents, as well as newborn hearing screening tests. The service at Villa Park will be staffed by 10 midwives and two support workers, with two health visitors taking appointments. The trust\u2019s deputy director of midwifery Louise Wilde, who is also a Villa fan, said: I decided to approach our local football teams because they are in a perfect position to help us deliver these clinics. There are no matches being played and geographically they are both in the right place for our patients. It also provides an alternative to a hospital setting, which some of our women felt anxious about coming to. We\u2019ve already been getting some great feedback from those attending the Hawthorns, home of the Baggies. Guy Rippon, head of foundation and community partnerships at Aston Villa, said: We are delighted to be able to help out our local NHS hospitals by opening up Villa Park as a temporary maternity clinic. The UK could hit the grim milestone of 20,000 Covid-19 deaths later today, when the daily count is added to the current toll of 19,506 people who tested positive for the new coronavirus and died in hospital. The death toll from Covid-19 in hospitals across the country increased on Friday by 684 in 24 hours to 19,506. Passing the 20,000 mark will be an uncomfortable moment for the government, whose chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance said on 17 March that keeping the toll under that number would be \u201ca good outcome in terms of where we would hope to get\u201d. The UK has the fifth highest official coronavirus death toll in the world, after the United States, Italy, Spain and France. Scientists have said that the death rate will start to decline quickly only in another couple of weeks. The total number of fatalities is likely to be thousands higher once more comprehensive but lagging figures that include deaths in nursing homes are added. As of 10 April, the hospital toll underestimated deaths by around 40%. Burberry said it has donated more than 100,000 pieces of PPE while it has also transformed its Yorkshire trench coat factory to produce protective equipment for hospital staff. The fashion giant said it had donated PPE, including masks the company has sourced, and has transformed its Castleford factory to manufacture non-surgical gowns and supply them to the NHS. It added that it will maintain its base pay for employees who have been unable to work due to closures and senior bosses announced they will take a 20% pay cut from April to June. Meanwhile, rival fashion brand Mulberry said it has switched its handbag factory in Somerset to making 8,000 gowns for NHS workers in Bristol. Coronavirus tests for key workers through the government\u2019s new booking website have run out in England and Wales for a second day in a row. More than 10 million key workers and their households are now eligible for Covid-19 tests as officials race to hit their 100,000-a-day testing target by next Thursday. However, home testing kits were listed as \u201cunavailable\u201d on the government\u2019s booking website just 15 minutes after it reopened on Saturday morning, according to the BBC. It was also not possible to book tests at drive-through regional sites in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by 10am. According to the site, tests at a drive-through regional site in Scotland are still available. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said more would be made available from Sunday morning at 8am. Killing Eve writer Luke Jennings, actor Robert Webb and Booker prize winner Bernardine Evaristo are to take part in a virtual book festival to be broadcast over three days during the first bank holiday weekend in May. The Big Book Weekend will during 8-10 May \u201cbring together the best of the cancelled UK literary festivals\u201d, organisers said. It will feature video interviews, panel discussions and \u201cin conversation\u201d sessions. Former hostage Terry Waite will talk about how to cope with solitude, and it will also feature Alexander McCall Smith, Maggie O\u2019Farrell, Marian Keyes, Neil Gaiman and Michael Morpurgo, while Sir Tim Rice discusses his life and career. The festival is part of BBC Arts\u2019 Culture In Quarantine, \u201cbringing the very best arts and culture to the homes of everyone in the UK\u201d, and is supported by BBC Arts and Arts Council England. Author Kit de Waal, who co-founded the festival with Molly Flatt, said: It has been a joy working with so many of the literary festivals around the UK in bringing some of their events to an online audience. I\u2019m particularly excited by our opening event on Friday, with Maggie O\u2019Farrell in conversation with Damian Barr on why books festivals are so important, particularly at a time like this. You can find more information here. A government campaign has been launched to encourage people seriously ill with non-coronavirus conditions such as heart attacks to seek help amid concerns some are avoiding hospitals, my colleagues Sarah Marsh and Nazia Parveen report. The campaign, which will be rolled out next week, aims to encourage people to use vital services \u2013 such as contacting their GP, dialling 111 for urgent care needs or 999 in an emergency, cancer screening and care, maternity appointments and mental health support \u2013 as they usually would. The NHS chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, said delays in getting treatment posed a long-term risk to people\u2019s health, and stressed that the NHS was still there for patients without coronavirus who needed urgent and emergency services for stroke, heart attack, and other often fatal conditions. Council chiefs have been praised after heeding the communities secretary\u2019s call to reopen parks and cemeteries to allow the public open space to exercise in during the lockdown, ITV News reports. As the UK enters its fifth weekend of lockdown, 340 parks and green spaces across the country have been reopened. The government has also updated its guidance to make it clear that burial grounds and cemeteries, grounds surrounding crematoria and gardens of remembrance may remain open. Robert Jenrick said: We know that the lockdown is much harder for people who don\u2019t have a lot of living space, a garden, or anywhere for their children to run around. People need parks. Here are a range of reactions to the Cummings story that came in last night: From Sir David King, the former chief scientific adviser From the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth A thread from BBC Newsnight\u2019s Lewis Goodall From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh And from the Conservative MP and former first secretary of state Damian Green The Conservative former chancellor Philip Hammond has called on the government to begin easing the lockdown and focus on restarting the economy while accepting life alongside coronavirus. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme the country could not afford to wait until a vaccine had become available before resuming more normal economic activity. The reality is that we have to start reopening the economy. But we have to do it living with Covid. We can\u2019t wait until a vaccine is developed, produced in sufficient quantity and rolled out across the population. The economy won\u2019t survive that long. But we are going to have to do it alongside the measures that are in place to protect the population from Covid. That\u2019s going to be a much more complex phase of this crisis than the initial acute phase. Locking everything down and keeping everything locked down is relatively straightforward. The challenge of how to carefully, progressively, methodically reopen protecting both health and jobs is much, much more challenging and calls for a really skilful political leadership. The Times (paywall) reports that the Treasury is drawing up measures to allow non-essential businesses to reopen and \u201cget Britain back to work\u201d. To achieve this in a \u201csafe and practical way\u201d, the measures include telling businesses to put up signs instructing workers to keep two metres apart and for staff to be sent home if they have coronavirus symptoms. Companies will also be told to close \u201ccommunal spaces\u201d like canteens if people can\u2019t physically distance and ensure widespread availability of hand-washing facilities and hand gel. Good morning. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has been thrust into the limelight after the Guardian revealed that the prime minister\u2019s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, has been taking part in meetings of the senior scientists advising the upper echelons of government on its response to the coronavirus crisis. It\u2019s left the government facing ever growing calls for the scientific advice given to ministers on the pandemic to be published and for Sage\u2019s secret membership to be disclosed. Elsewhere, the NHS is launching a new campaign to make sure people seek urgent care during a medical emergency after visits to A&amp;E dropped by almost 50% this month. Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director for England, told BBC Breakfast he was concerned that lives were being lost because fewer people were presenting themselves to doctors. He said: What we absolutely want people to do is if you do have a condition, particularly an emergency that is not coronavirus, you should not be afraid of accessing healthcare services. And, as the UK heads into its fifth weekend of lockdown, the public is being urged to stay at home and not be tempted by the warm, sunny weather.

That\u2019s what it comes down to.\u201d",

(There\u2019s little real about it, I should add.) YouTube said it had no truck with \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d and did the same.</p> <p>They weren\u2019t serious. If they had been, they would have banned Icke and his imitators. As it was, Facebook and YouTube did not say they could no longer tolerate Icke on their platforms. They gave him the aura of being a free speech martyr by removing one interview, which he gratefully <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB4TZ8vMFuE\">exploited</a>, then allowed him to carry on as before. At the time of writing, close to 500,000 had watched a recent Icke video entitled \u201cIs There a Virus?\u201d that YouTube had not taken down. Icke\u2019s jowls bubble with suppressed fury. \u201cThey\u201d were \u201credesignating\u201d deaths from flu and from 5G waves as deaths from Covid-19, he explains. And why would \u201cthey\u201d go to the time and trouble of doing that? Because \u201cthey\u201d want to \u201cdestroy independent income\u201d and impose a \u201cmassive fascistic global Orwellian control of the population\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I can\u2019t think of a subject more saturated with dishonesty than freedom of speech</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The far left and alt-right cannot put forward a conspiracy theory without hitting on Jews. The legacies of religious, fascist and communist antisemitism are invisible forces propelling them forward to the irresistible conclusion that only one people had the occult power to fool and impoverish the whole wide world without anyone except the wised-up Icke and his kind noticing. Who are his \u201cthey\u201d? Where can we find \u201cthem\u201d? They are the 1%, Icke explains. Specifically, an \u201cultra-Zionist billionaire\u201d.</p> <p>I spoke to Google, the owner of YouTube, and asked why, if it meant what it said, it had not closed Icke down. Apparently most Icke content was still within its guidelines and would not be censored, I was told, an answer that leads us into a swamp.</p> <p>I can\u2019t think of a subject more saturated with dishonesty than freedom of speech. Opponents say it does not matter if a social media platform or a university bans speakers. Private organisations deciding for themselves who they wish to be associated with cannot be compared to state censors. They refuse to acknowledge that if a feminist academic is deemed transphobic and cannot talk in universities, there are precious few other venues open to her. Nor that many public figures are heard on social media or not heard at all. In the past decade, to cite the case of an almost forgotten figure, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/milo-yiannopoulos-nazi-salutes-video-karaoke-richard-spencer-white-nationalists-karaoke-bar-a7987486.html\">the far-right fop</a> Milo Yiannopoulos was a social media celebrity feted and hated in equal measure. Twitter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/20/milo-yiannopoulos-nero-permanently-banned-twitter\">banned him</a> in for leading a pile-on against a black actress, and its censorship finished him off. If Facebook and YouTube were to ban the corona conspiracists, that would be censorship too, and it is deceitful to pretend otherwise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-sparks-perfect-storm-of-state-led-disinformation\">Malicious forces creating 'perfect storm' of coronavirus disinformation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alongside the pretence that censorship is not censorship is a hyperinflation in the notion of what speech should be punished for causing harm. The liberal, as distinct from the libertarian, argument is that only speech that directly incites crime should be prohibited, a demagogue whipping up anti-Muslim sentiment outside a mosque, for instance. Since the 1970s supposed \u201cliberals\u201d have wanted offence to be included as a harm. No one should deny that words are weapons that can hurt more than a blow. Unfortunately, no one can measure the psychic wounds that an offended person feels with the accuracy of a doctor measuring physical wounds on a victim of crime. The woolliness of their \u201chate speech\u201d laws all but guarantees that they will punish the innocent.</p> <p>Yet, in the case of Icke, there is no need for debates about whether the harm is real or whether it is just hurt feelings. Knuckle-dragging fantasists have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/06/at-least-20-uk-phone-masts-vandalised-over-false-5g-coronavirus-claims\">physically attacked phone masts</a>. Daniel Allington and his colleague Nayana Dhavan at King\u2019s College London have shown that Ickean conspiracy theories pose <a href=\"https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/127048253/Allington_and_Dhavan_2020.pdf\">a physical risk to public health</a>. Conspiracists put their own lives and, crucially, the lives of those around them at risk. Because their gurus have persuaded them that health advice is a giant lie, they see no need to stay at home, wash their hands or observe social distancing. YouTube and the social media companies are complicit, because they want the audience and revenue that crank celebs bring.</p> <p>They can pocket it because of a legal absurdity. Television broadcasts are regulated. Last week, Ofcom <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/features-and-news/david-icke-and-eamonn-holmes-decision\">sanctioned a tiny TV station</a> called London Live because it broadcast Icke \u201ccasting doubt on the motives behind official health advice to protect the public from the virus\u201d. Yet it has no power to regulate YouTube when it broadcasts Icke saying that health workers and governments were responsible for deception on a supernatural scale.</p> <p>Parliament should have intervened in 2016 when the extent of Russian manipulation of social media was made painfully clear. There is a stronger argument for forcing the tech companies to live by their pious words now that so many are suffering. Liberals should always defend freedom of speech. But they have no obligation to help turn their countries into morgues.</p> <p>\u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist</p>",

The legacies of religious, fascist and communist antisemitism are invisible forces propelling them forward to the irresistible conclusion that only one people had the occult power to fool and impoverish the whole wide world without anyone except the wised-up Icke and his kind noticing. Who are his \u201cthey\u201d? Where can we find \u201cthem\u201d? They are the 1%, Icke explains. Specifically, an \u201cultra-Zionist billionaire\u201d. I spoke to Google, the owner of YouTube, and asked why, if it meant what it said, it had not closed Icke down. Apparently most Icke content was still within its guidelines and would not be censored, I was told, an answer that leads us into a swamp. I can\u2019t think of a subject more saturated with dishonesty than freedom of speech. Opponents say it does not matter if a social media platform or a university bans speakers. Private organisations deciding for themselves who they wish to be associated with cannot be compared to state censors. They refuse to acknowledge that if a feminist academic is deemed transphobic and cannot talk in universities, there are precious few other venues open to her. Nor that many public figures are heard on social media or not heard at all. In the past decade, to cite the case of an almost forgotten figure, the far-right fop Milo Yiannopoulos was a social media celebrity feted and hated in equal measure. Twitter banned him in for leading a pile-on against a black actress, and its censorship finished him off. If Facebook and YouTube were to ban the corona conspiracists, that would be censorship too, and it is deceitful to pretend otherwise. Alongside the pretence that censorship is not censorship is a hyperinflation in the notion of what speech should be punished for causing harm. The liberal, as distinct from the libertarian, argument is that only speech that directly incites crime should be prohibited, a demagogue whipping up anti-Muslim sentiment outside a mosque, for instance. Since the 1970s supposed \u201cliberals\u201d have wanted offence to be included as a harm. No one should deny that words are weapons that can hurt more than a blow. Unfortunately, no one can measure the psychic wounds that an offended person feels with the accuracy of a doctor measuring physical wounds on a victim of crime. The woolliness of their \u201chate speech\u201d laws all but guarantees that they will punish the innocent. Yet, in the case of Icke, there is no need for debates about whether the harm is real or whether it is just hurt feelings. Knuckle-dragging fantasists have physically attacked phone masts. Daniel Allington and his colleague Nayana Dhavan at King\u2019s College London have shown that Ickean conspiracy theories pose a physical risk to public health. Conspiracists put their own lives and, crucially, the lives of those around them at risk. Because their gurus have persuaded them that health advice is a giant lie, they see no need to stay at home, wash their hands or observe social distancing. YouTube and the social media companies are complicit, because they want the audience and revenue that crank celebs bring. They can pocket it because of a legal absurdity. Television broadcasts are regulated. Last week, Ofcom sanctioned a tiny TV station called London Live because it broadcast Icke \u201ccasting doubt on the motives behind official health advice to protect the public from the virus\u201d. Yet it has no power to regulate YouTube when it broadcasts Icke saying that health workers and governments were responsible for deception on a supernatural scale. Parliament should have intervened in 2016 when the extent of Russian manipulation of social media was made painfully clear. There is a stronger argument for forcing the tech companies to live by their pious words now that so many are suffering. Liberals should always defend freedom of speech. But they have no obligation to help turn their countries into morgues. \u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "The selection of Trevor Phillips to investigate why Covid-19 is killing more Black, Asian and minority ethnic people has sparked a row after leading Muslims criticised his appointment as \u201cinsensitive\u201d. Phillips, the former chairman of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, was asked by Public Health England to provide expert support to an inquiry into why increasing numbers of victims of the coronavirus pandemic are from BAME backgrounds. Early evidence shows that black people are dying from the virus at almost twice the rate of their proportion of the population, according to analysis of NHS England data for the first 12,600 deaths from the virus in English hospitals. While black people account for 3.4% of the population, they make up 6.4% of the deaths so far. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), the umbrella group for leading mosques and other Islamic institutions, said the review into the deaths was urgently needed but have objected to Phillips\u2019s appointment. They say it is inappropriate that a man recently suspended from the Labour party over allegations of Islamophobia, and who has a history of making controversial remarks about Muslims, should form part of the team leading the inquiry. Harun Khan, the secretary general of the MCB, said it was \u201cwholly inappropriate to give that responsibility to someone being investigated \u2026 The decision is particularly insensitive given that British Muslims overwhelmingly come from BAME communities and so many Muslim doctors have died at the frontline of this pandemic\u201d. Khan alleged that Phillips has a \u201cconsistent record in pushing the divisive narrative of Muslims being apart from the rest of British society\u201d. \u201cThe disproportionate impact of the pandemic on BAME communities is a serious issue which has seen many Muslims lose loved ones.\u201d This \u201csends a clear signal to British Muslims that Public Health England is not taking this matter seriously\u201d, he said. Phillips\u2019s appointment was also criticised by the Labour MP Naz Shah, who tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s an insult to the memory of the numerous Muslims who have lost their lives, and also an insult to those Muslims who continue to serve on the frontline.\u201d The Labour party launched its own inquiry, asking Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, to examine why the virus seems to disproportionately affect people from certain minority backgrounds. Phillips, an anti-racism campaigner, was suspended from Labour pending an investigation into prior statements including a reference he made to UK Muslims being \u201ca nation within a nation\u201d. At the time he condemned the suspension, which he claimed was a form of political gangsterism from the party under Jeremy Corbyn, whom he had criticised. Labour backbencher Khalid Mahmood, the longest-serving Muslim MP, criticised Phillips\u2019s suspension. Phillips, when asked earlier why more BAME people were infected by the virus, urged people \u201cnot to rush to judgment\u201d. Prof Kevin Fenton, PHE\u2019s regional director, London, said: \u201cTrevor Phillips and Prof Richard Webber have been asked to support this critical work as their specialist consultancy has the right skills and experience. We need to move fast to understand why and what can be done about this.\u201d When contacted, Phillips said he had no comment to make on the subject.",

After global incredulity at US President Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that ingesting or injecting bleach could prevent or cure coronavirus, which he later disowned as \u201csarcasm\u201d, the search for cures or prophylactics continues. The French government is limiting the sale of products containing nicotine after reports from a Paris hospital that it may reduce the risk of catching the coronavirus. Described by the French health authorities as \u201cjust a hypothesis\u201d, clinical trials of nicotine patches are to be carried out, but in order to prevent people self-medicating a new decree declared that pharmacies were instructed to limit the sale of products containing nicotine - patches, chewing gum and lozenges - to one month\u2019s supply. As the international debate about the origins and spread of the virus continues, Reuters has reported that China sought to block a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak. The report was eventually released, albeit just before the start of the weekend Europe time and with some criticism of the Chinese government rearranged or removed, a sign of the balancing act Brussels is trying to pull off as the coronavirus outbreak scrambles international relations. In other coronavirus developments: The US navy is seeking to reinstate the fired captain of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, whose crew hailed him as their hero for risking his job to safeguard their lives from coronavirus, officials have said. Nearly 60 new cases of coronavirus infections have been confirmed in Nagasaki among crew members of an Italian cruise ship docked there for repairs, Japanese domestic media has reported. With testing of all crew members complete, the new number brings the total infections onboard the Costa Atlantica to around 150, roughly one-quarter of the vessel\u2019s 623 crew members Thailand has reported 53 new coronavirus cases and the death of a 48-year-old Thai man who was infected with the virus along with four other family members. Of the new cases, three were linked to previous cases, one had no known links, and 42 were migrant workers who have been under quarantine at an immigration detention centre in the southern province of Songkhla There have reportedly been discussions within the White House about changing its coronavirus briefings to curtail the president\u2019s role. Donald Trump has refused to answer questions at his latest briefing, after a day earlier promoting a sham treatment that involves ingesting a powerful chlorine bleach. In Australia and New Zealand it is Anzac Day, the annual day of remembrance for armed forces. With both countries under lockdowns or strict social distancing rules, there were not the usual parades or public dawn services, with people observing a minute\u2019s silence in the streets outside their houses instead. Serbia sent four planes carrying medical equipment including gloves, masks and protective suits to Italy as a donation. Another four will be sent in the next two days, the president Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 said, noting that Italy sent aid to Serbia after devastating floods in 2014. Italy was Serbia\u2019s second-largest trade partner after Germany last year, and Italian companies including Fiat employ more than 20,000 people in Serbia. China reported 12 new coronavirus cases on Friday compared with six the previous day, National Health Commission data showed on Saturday. Of the new cases, 11 were imported, compared with two cases reported previously, the data said. The UK has removed China from a list of nations from which it draws international comparisons over the spread of coronavirus amid concerns about the accuracy of the country\u2019s figures.",

This group of predominantly middle-aged men is defiant in the face of the deaths that could follow an accelerated easing of lockdown, which it supports for economic reasons. \u201cThat inevitably will mean that there will be, at each time, more coronavirus cases. And we just have to accept that,\u201d Clifton-Brown has said. Is he well cast as the reaper\u2019s apprentice? Perhaps, if you accept that Clifton-Brown\u2019s tolerance of possibly large-scale virus-hastened exits may be perfectly reconcilable with his vote against assisted dying.

      "body": "<p>The government is \u201creviewing\u201d the surcharge that some migrant doctors and nurses working in the NHS must pay to access the health service, the home secretary Priti Patel has said.</p> <p>In the daily press conference at Downing Street on Saturday, after the UK became the fifth country to pass 20,000 total deaths from coronavirus \u2013 behind the US, Italy, Spain and France \u2013 Patel reiterated the government\u2019s stay-at-home message and rejected suggestions that allowing non-essential work to continue sent mixed messages.</p> <p>The government has been criticised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/28/scrap-625-pound-surcharge-for-nhs-ovserseas-staff\">for planning to increase the immigration health surcharge for migrants</a> from outside the European Economic Area, including nurses and doctors, from \u00a3400 to \u00a3625 a year each from October. The fees were introduced in 2015.</p> <p>The move was described as a perverse deterrent to workers the government needed to attract, and there have been reports of nurses facing fees of thousands of pounds a year in both visa charges and the surcharge so they and their families can access the health service and remain in the UK.</p> <p>Asked if this was the right time to abolish it for NHS workers, Patel said: \u201cYou\u2019ll be aware of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nhs-frontline-workers-visas-extended-so-they-can-focus-on-fighting-coronavirus\">many changes</a> we have already made around the immigration status, the visa status for NHS workers, extending their visas already if they were coming up for expiry.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a range of measures that are, like most things in government, under review, and we are looking at everything including visas, surcharge \u2026 We are looking at everything we can do to continue to support everyone on the frontline in the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>At the end of March, the Home Office said that NHS workers \u2013 and their family members \u2013 would automatically have their visas extended free of charge for one year.</p> <p>Speaking at the daily briefing for the first time, Lynne Owens, the director general of the National Crime Agency (NCA), also warned that \u201camoral, corrupt and exploitative\u201d criminals were seeking to take advantage of the crisis.</p> <p>More than 2,000 online scams relating to coronavirus have been taken down including fake shops selling bogus testing kits and PPE, she said.</p> <p>Patel sought to warn criminals seeking to exploit the current situation that they would be pursued. She said the NCA had flagged up 1,300 possible child sexual offences to police.</p> <p>In her closing remarks, the home secretary said: \u201cAny criminal seeking to exploit this virus for their own gain, our outstanding police and law enforcement agencies are absolutely on to you.\u201d</p> <p>The press conference came amid apparent concern in government about waning respect for physical distancing measures.</p> <p>NHS England\u2019s medical director, Stephen Powis, exhibited a slide showing a slight increase in the number of journeys taken and warned people to avoid travel and to physically distance \u2013 with the measures now in place until at least 7 May \u2013 during the UK\u2019s fifth weekend under lockdown.</p> <p>The Home Office said: \u201cWe are immensely grateful for the work NHS doctors, nurses and paramedics are doing to tackle coronavirus, and this is why we applied a one-year visa extension to all those whose visas are due to expire before 1 October 2020 \u2013 this is completely free of charge and includes an exemption from the immigration health surcharge.</p> <p>\u201cWe will continue to look at whether we can provide further assistance during the fight against this virus.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 April 2020. An earlier version said the UK had become the fifth country to pass 20,000 deaths in hospital from coronavirus. This should have referred to all deaths, not just those in hospital. This has been corrected.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government is \u201creviewing\u201d the surcharge that some migrant doctors and nurses working in the NHS must pay to access the health service, the home secretary Priti Patel has said. In the daily press conference at Downing Street on Saturday, after the UK became the fifth country to pass 20,000 total deaths from coronavirus \u2013 behind the US, Italy, Spain and France \u2013 Patel reiterated the government\u2019s stay-at-home message and rejected suggestions that allowing non-essential work to continue sent mixed messages. The government has been criticised for planning to increase the immigration health surcharge for migrants from outside the European Economic Area, including nurses and doctors, from \u00a3400 to \u00a3625 a year each from October. The fees were introduced in 2015. The move was described as a perverse deterrent to workers the government needed to attract, and there have been reports of nurses facing fees of thousands of pounds a year in both visa charges and the surcharge so they and their families can access the health service and remain in the UK. Asked if this was the right time to abolish it for NHS workers, Patel said: \u201cYou\u2019ll be aware of many changes we have already made around the immigration status, the visa status for NHS workers, extending their visas already if they were coming up for expiry. \u201cWe have a range of measures that are, like most things in government, under review, and we are looking at everything including visas, surcharge \u2026 We are looking at everything we can do to continue to support everyone on the frontline in the NHS.\u201d At the end of March, the Home Office said that NHS workers \u2013 and their family members \u2013 would automatically have their visas extended free of charge for one year. Speaking at the daily briefing for the first time, Lynne Owens, the director general of the National Crime Agency (NCA), also warned that \u201camoral, corrupt and exploitative\u201d criminals were seeking to take advantage of the crisis. More than 2,000 online scams relating to coronavirus have been taken down including fake shops selling bogus testing kits and PPE, she said. Patel sought to warn criminals seeking to exploit the current situation that they would be pursued. She said the NCA had flagged up 1,300 possible child sexual offences to police. In her closing remarks, the home secretary said: \u201cAny criminal seeking to exploit this virus for their own gain, our outstanding police and law enforcement agencies are absolutely on to you.\u201d The press conference came amid apparent concern in government about waning respect for physical distancing measures. NHS England\u2019s medical director, Stephen Powis, exhibited a slide showing a slight increase in the number of journeys taken and warned people to avoid travel and to physically distance \u2013 with the measures now in place until at least 7 May \u2013 during the UK\u2019s fifth weekend under lockdown. The Home Office said: \u201cWe are immensely grateful for the work NHS doctors, nurses and paramedics are doing to tackle coronavirus, and this is why we applied a one-year visa extension to all those whose visas are due to expire before 1 October 2020 \u2013 this is completely free of charge and includes an exemption from the immigration health surcharge. \u201cWe will continue to look at whether we can provide further assistance during the fight against this virus.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 29 April 2020. An earlier version said the UK had become the fifth country to pass 20,000 deaths in hospital from coronavirus. This should have referred to all deaths, not just those in hospital. This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "The federal government is attempting to convince Australians it can be trusted to handle personal data collected by the coronavirus contact tracing app. But it\u2019s an uphill battle due to a long history of secrecy and failures to live up to promises on security and privacy of Australians\u2019 data. Governments around the world are dealing with the same problem: everyone wants to be able to resume some level of normal life, but authorities will need to be able to quickly find and contain people who might have the virus and not yet know it. Currently they do this by relying on human memory of who a person who tests positive has been around and where they have been \u2013 and cases can be easily missed. But if everyone is running an app that records a list of everyone they\u2019ve been in close contact with, the process would be much more simple, and faster. There will be some people who want to help the effort and will use the government\u2019s proposed coronavirus contact tracer app on that basis, along with those who adopt the view that they already give a lot of information out to other services, so what difference does it make? There will be some who flat out refuse or just aren\u2019t able to use the app, and then there are those who are sceptical and need to be convinced. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said the government needs 40% of the population to agree to use the app in order for it to be effective, and he will need to win over some of the last category in order to meet that target. The problem he faces is that the government\u2019s history in this area is littered with tech fails, data breaches and misuse of personal data. Less than two months ago, senior bureaucrats were being accused by the deputy chair of the parliament\u2019s national security committee, Labor MP Anthony Byrne, of having a \u201ccavalier disregard\u201d for the handling of Australians\u2019 personal data. When the parliament passed mandatory data retention legislation in 2015 (which requires internet companies to hold much more personal data than would be held by the app for two years), promises were made that only 21 agencies, including law enforcement, would be able to access the data without a warrant. Then the internet companies began reporting councils and 87 other agencies that should not have access to the data were still accessing it, over 8,000 times in the 2018-19 financial year. Law enforcement were supposed to get special warrants if needing to access a journalist\u2019s metadata, but the AFP failed to do that in one instance. Some agencies were getting sent the history of websites people had been visiting, despite the government ruling that out five years ago. The government released the personal Centrelink information of a writer critical of the botched robodebt scheme. It rushed the passage of anti-encryption legislation before the end of 2018, arguing failure to do so could cause a terrorist attack over Christmas, despite the fact that key parts of the legislation would not be able to be used until well after Christmas, and amendments are now being considered to fix up issues with the law because it was rushed. Under that legislation the government can force you to unlock your phone. We\u2019re not allowed to know what vulnerabilities the government has forced tech companies to put in their products, and it is also a crime for tech companies to disclose what they\u2019ve been made to do. Medicare numbers ended up for sale on the dark web. The government accidentally published a spreadsheet with the personal details of 10,000 asylum seekers online. Supposedly de-identified Medicare data was able to be reidentified, and rather than addressing the data breach, the government tried to make it a crime to reidentify the data in the first place. The 2016 census was taken offline by a DDoS attack, and according to Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s memoir, A Bigger Picture, the Australian Bureau of Statistics was prepared to blame a nation state for the attack, even though it was mostly just IBM not doing the job it had been paid to do. When people tried to sign up for jobseeker payments, Services Australia couldn\u2019t handle the traffic. The government services minister, Stuart Robert, incorrectly blamed a DDoS attack for that before correcting the record. The Australian federal police conducted an invalid raid at the home of a News Corp journalist trying to hunt down her source. The AFP raided the home of a Labor staffer and Parliament House during the 2016 election in order to find out who was leaking out of NBN Co. The government was eventually forced to change legislation to prevent police from being able to access information from My Health Record after first arguing it was not an issue. It is not difficult to see why some are not so keen to place their utmost trust in the government over handling this incredibly personal information. The app, if developed properly and with appropriate protections in place, could work well to slow the spread and make it much easier for health officers to contact trace. These are the protections the government has offered up so far: The data collected from the people you are in contact with (name, age range, phone number and postcode) remains encrypted and on the phone and deletes after the infection period passes. Location information (outside of postcode) isn\u2019t retained. It doesn\u2019t get uploaded to the onshore Amazon server unless you test positive. Only the health officers in your state will be able to access the unencrypted data. All the data will be deleted on the government\u2019s server at the end of the pandemic. It will be a crime to move the data offshore. Some, if not all, of the app\u2019s source code will be made public. The privacy impact assessment will be public. The privacy protections will be legislated. There is still much detail the government has promised to release in the next few days, meaning much of the concern around the app is based on public comments from politicians rather than clear information. Until now the government has forced a lot of these incursions on our privacy on the Australian population, warning the public that threats demand a sacrifice of our privacy, and if you\u2019ve got nothing to hide you\u2019ve got nothing to fear. Now faced with a tangible threat, while also empowering every Australian to make the decision themselves for the first time, the trust may be found wanting.",

I\u2019m quite happy to spin and knit and read books and do crossword puzzles and go for walks with the dog.\u201d Both retired and with two adult children, Harry and Margaret have been together for almost 37 years. They met in 1983 as student nurses studying in Canberra. He was 20 and, as a second year nursing student, he was sent to meet the incoming first year students. He caught sight of the then 21-year-old Margaret. \u201cI can remember thinking, \u2018Oh, hello, I like the look of you.\u2019\u201d They quickly became close friends, frequently spending time together. One night, she invited him along to a friend\u2019s dinner party, purportedly to make up the numbers. Harry remembers the night vividly: \u201cIt was cold and it was dark and I can remember thinking to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to marry this girl\u2019.\u201d He says he just knew: \u201cIt just felt so comfortable that I knew this would be the person I\u2019d spend the rest of my life with. Margaret agrees: \u201c[It was like] putting the key in the lock and it fits and you turn the key and your life was on the other side of the door.\u201d That night, they shared their first kiss \u2013 and eight days later, they got engaged. \u201cI was taking Margaret to the bus in the city and she said to me, \u2018If someone were to ask me to marry them right now, I would say yes.\u2019 So I did.

On Thursday the premier, Peter Gutwein, said four more cases connected to the north-west outbreak had been identified overnight. More than 200 cases have been confirmed across the state since the pandemic began. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/we-can-save-lives-tasmanias-isolated-north-west-succumbs-to-australias-strictest-coronavirus-rules&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1587617062140000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGrtyZNbR4TyBIhOFOvSZXXriTo_A\">Tighter restrictions in the north-west</a> as a result of the cluster, that were due to be lifted on Sunday, were likely to remain in place for an extra week, Gutwein said.

Most new patients requiring admission are in the meantime being sent to Launceston hospital or, if they need high-level care, Hobart.

      "bodyText": "More than 400 plants and nearly 200 invertebrates need urgent attention after the bushfire crisis, new analysis for the federal environment department has found. Freshwater mussels, shrimps, burrowing crayfish, land snails, spiders, millipedes, bees, dragonflies and butterflies were among the invertebrates whose ranges have been severely affected by the unprecedented fires through spring and summer. The most severely affected species have had at least 30% of their range burned, and in some cases the figure was much higher. Publication of the list of 471 plants and 191 invertebrates comes as business groups and governments emphasise the need to reduce bureaucracy around environmental assessments as part of the economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis. Australia\u2019s national environment laws \u2013 the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act \u2013 are being independently reviewed but the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said this week she was prepared to introduce legislative changes before it the review was complete. The government has not said what those changes might be, but it has emphasised its desire to speed up assessments for major projects. Environmental advocates have stressed the act has been failing to stem Australia\u2019s high rate of extinction and the need to improve the system of protections has been made more urgent by the bushfire crisis. As well as the 191 invertebrate species listed as needing urgent attention, 147 have been prioritised for further assessment. And the invertebrate analysis, compiled by a conservation biologist, John Woinarski, acknowledged that those figures were likely to be an underestimate of the impact of the fires on Australia\u2019s invertebrate species because of large gaps in knowledge about these species. Australia has about 320,000 invertebrates \u2013 much greater than the number of vertebrate or plant species \u2013 and monitoring of even the most threatened is often lacking. \u201cAssessment of the impacts of the 2019-20 fires on Australian invertebrates is also constrained by the absence or limited extent of monitoring of Australian invertebrates, with little monitoring even for most threatened invertebrate species,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn the absence of such monitoring, it is difficult to evaluate the extent of loss, or progress to recovery, of most invertebrate species.\u201d The lists were developed using maps of fire grounds and the known ranges of threatened and near-threatened species, as well as species for which state agencies had signalled particular concern. The 471 plants include a variety of vegetation types, among them trees and shrubs in rainforest areas that do not regularly burn. One species, monga waratah, had 50% of its range burned. \u201cSome species were considered threatened before the fires, and the fires have now likely increased their risk of extinction,\u201d the department\u2019s summary said. The plant analysis, led by Dr Rachael Gallagher from Macquarie University, said some species such as the forrester\u2019s bottlebrush, betka bottlebrush and grey deua pomaderris are at imminent risk of extinction because all their known or modelled range has been burned, and they are exposed to significant other stresses such as pre-fire drought conditions, high fire frequency or severity, or diseases. It said the Wollemi pines were a priority for immediate action to mitigate post-fire impacts, along with several species of ground orchid. The Greens environment spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, said she was concerned that EPBC review would not account for \u201cthe full impact\u201d of the bushfires because much of the assessment work was still to be done. \u201cHow could you have a comprehensive and extensive review without factoring in that information, given the baseline has now changed?\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "On what some might call the margins, the coronavirus pandemic is not just an invisible source of health and economic destruction. It is the brutal compounding of an already bulging list of difficulties and challenges, fuelled by longstanding structural problems: low Centrelink payments, insecure housing and inadequate support for people with disabilities or mental ill-health. With the curve flattening, many are looking ahead to a future when the pubs will reopen and the football will be back on the television. But others \u2013 like the six people the Guardian has spoken to below \u2013 are taking things one day at a time. And bracing for what comes next. Mahlie Jewell, 37, Sydney I\u2019m a Wiradjuri woman living on Eora. I\u2019ve worked in non-for-profit community services since I was in my early 20s. I\u2019m a qualified counsellor and I\u2019m in my second year of my master\u2019s in art therapy. Forty-three days ago I made the decision, long before many others, to go into total self-isolation. The last places I went were the chemist and the grocery store. Since then, I haven\u2019t left my building. Once a day I take my dog around the back of our building to run around, but mostly she goes out by herself. I live in social housing alone with my pug and two cats and have no biological family, so my friends are my family. I have managed severe mental health issues since a young age. I also live with chronic health issues \u2013 high blood pressure, asthma and other respiratory issues, and under-functioning thyroid and kidneys. In the beginning, friends came around and sat outside my door to chat \u2013 they have been my lifeline. They got me groceries, picked up my medications and my mail. They were my only connection to the outside world. When everyone started to enter lockdown, I asked them to stop coming. Just before the Covid-19 outbreak I was supposed to begin investigation into autoimmune disease, but that has been paused. I had to wait three or so weeks before my psychologist could get funding access to telehealth so I was left alone in that space, but I did OK. I know that if we got to the stage that they had to make terrible choices about who lives and dies, I wouldn\u2019t make the cut. It\u2019s likely I\u2019ll have to remain in social isolation after many others have been back out into the world. But honestly, I cannot complain, as I do have savings and also am still getting some work. Carolyn Davis, 38, Melbourne I have neuromyelitis optica (similar to multiple sclerosis) and I\u2019ve been on the disability support pension since 2018 after a two-year fight to get it. I live in complete fear now because Covid would be a death sentence for me. The financial stress on top of that is just awful. Medical bills pile up, of course. If it wasn\u2019t for friends and family I would have been screwed. I have to see private specialists when the wait for public is too long. I just spent my entire stimulus payment ($1,500) on a ketamine treatment at a private hospital for chronic pain because the public hospital I get it done at cancelled all elective admissions. I\u2019m very lucky to have bought a shitty apartment while I was still working that a small inheritance paid off. If I was renting I\u2019d be utterly fucked, so I know I\u2019m doing better than a lot of people, so I try to be grateful for that. I well understand the economic reasoning for the stimulus and as a socialist I agree with it, but it\u2019s unconscionable to be leaving disabled people behind once again. I think about the ones trapped in abusive relationships (which we are much more at risk of) being even more stuck now because of financial issues. I see the attempts at manufactured consent to \u201copen the economy\u201d, ending the lockdown because it\u2019s only \u201cold\u201d people at risk right? People like me just don\u2019t exist.

      "body": "<p>When the publisher Martin Hughes talks about the moment five weeks ago when the coronavirus crisis first hit Australia full throttle, he talks about panic. \u201cPanic in the community, the business community and the publishing community. Everyone was looking for plan B.\u201d</p> <p>The CEO of Affirm Press, Hughes was about to oversee the release of two big titles when the shutdowns started \u2013 Pip Williams\u2019 escapist historical drama, The Dictionary of Lost Words, and forthcoming thriller The Safe Place by Anna Downes. Rights had been sold internationally for both debut novels, and staff had been working on the publicity campaigns since January. The dilemma: \u201cThese are big books, it\u2019s really important for our business that these go well; do we move them [back] now that certain parts of the infrastructure are crumbling?\u201d</p> <p>The kinds of calculations that Hughes and his team made five weeks ago have been happening in publishing houses around the country as the coronavirus crisis and shutdown measures to control it take a massive bite out of the arts sector.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/23/malcolm-turnbull-memoir-new-book-a-bigger-picture-bestseller-after-launch\">Malcolm Turnbull's book A Bigger Picture 'a bestseller' days after launch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other publishers were postponing their releases, in some cases for 12 or 18 months. Trent Dalton\u2019s follow-up to his bestselling Boy Swallows Universe has been held by HarperCollins until September; novelist Kathryn Heyman announced last week that her forthcoming memoir has been postponed by Allen &amp; Unwin until 2021. Hughes and his team, however, foresaw a frenzy of delayed big-name titles all coming out at once. They felt that releasing books in that competitive landscape would hurt more than it helped.</p> <p>\u201cWe decided we\u2019d stick with plan A,\u201d Hughes tells Guardian Australia.</p> <p>There were early signs that the enforced stay-at-home measures were having a positive effect on book sales. Nielsen Book Australia reported industry revenue for the week ending 28 March \u2013 the first of widespread shutdowns \u2013 was up 15% on the same time last year. But it has since <a href=\"https://www.asauthors.org/news/sales-data-for-authors-applying-for-jobkeeper\">reported</a> a \u201csharp decline\u201d in the following weeks, and Bianca Whiteley from Nielsen told Guardian Australia that the Australian book market had recorded a 7.1% decline in value sales in 2020 so far, though unit sales were up slightly, at 1.5%. Children\u2019s books and adult fiction were strongest, while trade nonfiction has continued to slow.</p> <p>The reasons for the decline are multifaceted: the books industry relies on an ecosystem of bookstores, festivals, events and media interest to shift copies. Many bookstores have shut their physical premises since the lockdowns started, airports are closed, festivals cancelled. Manufacturing and supply have also been affected \u2013 early on in the crisis, shutdowns in China caused printing delays; more recently, increased burdens on freight and logistics networks are affecting stock management and distribution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edf0398dfebd9d9570c1c8d25e8e43bbc6f5bd33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edf0398dfebd9d9570c1c8d25e8e43bbc6f5bd33/0_0_3500_1576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some bookstores in Australia have started up free local bicycle delivery services during the lockdowns\" width=\"1000\" height=\"450\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some bookstores in Australia have started up free local bicycle delivery services during the lockdowns.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cordelia Hsu/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many publishing houses have responded to the market shocks by reducing salaries and cutting staff. Thames and Hudson, Allen &amp; Unwin and Hardie Grant have cut salaries locally by up to 25%, with the latter also making seven of its 200 staff redundant. Melbourne-based small press Scribe issued redundancies to two of its 27 staff, an editor and a publicist \u2013 the first time the publishing house has made anyone redundant in its 44-year history.</p> <p>Affirm is in the unusual position of having neither laid off staff nor reduced hours. It doesn\u2019t rely on deals with bigger publishing houses to sell to retailers, so it has that advantage over similarly sized companies who are at the mercy of their larger competitors. Nevertheless, uncertainty is still rippling through the industry. Hughes says his own staff\u2019s fears were quelled somewhat by the fact that he was upfront with them about the company\u2019s contingency plans: \u201c[We told them that] if we had to reduce overheads in a hurry \u2026 we would all go down to 80% of our salary if needed, but that any pain that had to be felt would be felt evenly across the team.\u201d</p> <p>Likely also helping morale is the fact that The Dictionary of Lost Words has been one of the fastest selling books this month. It\u2019s no prime ministerial memoir \u2013 Hardie Grant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/23/malcolm-turnbull-memoir-new-book-a-bigger-picture-bestseller-after-launch\">reported on Friday</a> that Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s A Bigger Picture has sold more than 50,000 copies in four days \u2013 but it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/16/all-words-are-not-equal-the-debut-novelist-whos-become-a-lockdown-sensation\">a solid showing for debut fiction</a>, especially with so many curtailed publicity avenues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4c47f222defefb5432c7795b8caf5dbea11b3961\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c47f222defefb5432c7795b8caf5dbea11b3961/0_0_1664_2500/667.jpg\" alt=\"Australian author James Bradley\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian author James Bradley, whose novels include Wrack, The Resurrectionist, Clade and the forthcoming Ghost Species.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>James Bradley, whose seventh novel, Ghost Species, is out on 27 April, describes the usual book tour for an Australian author with a new release: \u201cYou\u2019d go to several capital cities, you\u2019d do some events, you\u2019d do a lot of radio, and you\u2019d probably visit a number of bookshops,\u201d he says. That would be followed by a run of interstate appearances, usually in the form of panels or keynote addresses over the autumn and winter festival season.</p> <p>While sales yields from festival appearances can vary, the direct income to a writer from the event fee is often more important \u2013 something Bradley says has become more apparent in the decades since 1997, when he published his first book. \u201cAs the book trade has changed, I think authors tend to make more of their money from those ancillary events and appearances than they did when I was first writing.\u201d</p> <p>Bookstore visits and signings also make a noticeable difference to sales, and the curatorial aspect of a physical store, geared towards browsing \u2013 tables of new releases, posters, staff picks and so on \u2013 are difficult to replicate online.</p> <p>Still, some literary organisations have tried to adapt to the new world. The Sydney Writers\u2019 festival has started to schedule online panels; the Wheeler Centre collaborated with the Stella prize to stream the prize ceremony via YouTube; the prestigious Vogel award for an unpublished manuscript followed suit; and smaller festivals like the Emerging Writers festival have been running digital supplementary programs for years.</p> <p>The Melbourne Writers festival, which was not scheduled to take place until August, announced in mid-April that it would be putting forward \u201ca smaller online program to keep literary arts audiences connected\u201d.

      "bodyText": "This week we began to discover just how badly the coronavirus is hitting jobs, and also just how little change there is in thinking about how the economy should be structured in the future. The Bureau of Statistics this week released new data which showed the week-by-week impact on the coronavirus on jobs. It was quite horrific \u2013 the hospitality sector was reduced by a quarter, and overall there were 6% fewer Australian with a job in the first week of April compared to a month earlier. Even if we assume that is the full impact this month (which is optimistic), such a fall is utterly unprecedented. It is roughly equivalent to the amount of jobs lost during the 1990s recession. But whereas that occurred over 30 months, this took just one. The problem of course is that as a rule it takes longer to recover the jobs than it does to lose them. And so we see the government, economists and (to paraphrase Paul Keating) every pet-shop galah talking about what is needed to get the economy moving again. The obvious point is that until the health situation returns to some level of normalcy, all talk of snapping back is just pabulum. But that aside, what is clear is that any thought that we\u2019re about to see a kumbaya moment of coming together of opposing views on the economy is completely gone. The coronavirus may have seen the government engage in the largest economic spending in history but do not expect it to remain of the view that a large government is needed. This week the head of the RBA, Philip Lowe, gave a speech which was variously reported and commented on by the prime minister and treasurer as being a sort of a game changer. Scott Morrison suggested the speech showed \u201cit\u2019s not business as usual\u201d. Yet governor Lowe\u2019s speech was hardly revelatory \u2013 the things he was calling for are things he has long been calling for. The Reserve Bank has also spent the better part of three years calling for more fiscal stimulus from the government, which was studiously ignored, and yet now apparently the RBA needs to be listened to with intent. And when we look at the things Morrisons listed as being needed, we see he is actually talking about business as usual: \u201cIt\u2019s about the federal government and the state governments working together in a whole field of areas from tax to industrial relations to infrastructure to skills and, of course, to cutting red tape and deregulation\u201d. Morrison and Frydenberg both spoke of productivity and referenced the Productivity Commission\u2019s \u201cShifting the Dial\u201d report issued in 2017 as needing to be revisited. But it\u2019s business as usual when it comes to the government dismissing policy ideas it disagrees with, such as putting a price on carbon, and promoting things it does agree with, such as cutting red tape, as necessary \u201creform\u201d. Indeed we\u2019ve already seen this week the government looking to reduce environmental regulations. It is worth nothing that economists do not agree on what will improve productivity and when politicians say \u201creform\u201d they mostly mean \u201cpolicy I am in favour of\u201d. Stephen Kirchner, for example, says we need to encourage foreign investment flows and migration as well as a reduction of regulations, while John Quiggin argues that the impact of \u201cmicroeconomic reform\u201d such as industrial relations \u201chas been, and is likely to remain, marginal\u201d. He argues instead we need technology growth and a better skilled workforce. We should also note that the Productivity Commission itself, when looking at industrial relations in 2015, noted that \u201cthere is little robust evidence that the different variants of [workplace relations] systems over the last 20 years have had detectable effects on measured economy-wide productivity\u201d. The job losses are going to be dire, but don\u2019t let the crisis blind you to thinking any \u201creform\u201d is needed. While the government hopes to keep its stimulus spending (including the doubling of dole payments) to the short term, any changes to industrial relations and taxation \u2013 for good or ill \u2013 will be here for the long-term. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "When the Australian government announced a $130bn wage subsidy employers, unions cheered. Here was the solution to growing queues for unemployment benefits, and a neat way to support workers\u2019 livelihoods without sending businesses broke, keeping them in jobs until coronavirus restrictions were lifted. But while both still support the jobkeeper program, some of the shine has come off as employers and workers are bogged down in eligibility questions and fights for their share of the $1,500 fortnightly payment. The subsidy was the first of its kind in Australia, requiring changes to industrial laws so employers could order employees to work at their usual rate of pay for as many hours as matched the payment. But those powers \u2013 and employees insisting they want to stay home during the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 are now the source of class conflict, with payment or exclusion from jobkeeper the ultimate carrot and stick. The first controversies about jobkeeper centred on eligibility. While Labor and unions welcomed the scheme, they criticised the exclusion of 1 million shorter-term casuals and 1.1 million temporary visa holders. Not every business can meet the 30% revenue downturn threshold to participate. Many industries are excluded explicitly, such as the public sector, including all local government employees, or in practice \u2013 such as those with high rates of contract work or short-term engagements including education, construction and the arts. Partnerships can only claim jobkeeper for one partner and employees. Employment barrister Ian Neil says many employers are not applying for the scheme because they are concerned about uncertainty if they make a claim but then fall short of the 30% revenue reduction to be eligible. Neil says the Australian Tax Office has issued guidance that it will \u201csubstantially accept their self-assessment\u201d, provided the employer has an objective basis for predicting the revenue downturn and the assessment was reasonable. But most employers are unaware of this flexibility. The biggest hurdle is the month-long gap in payments that must be bridged. Although jobkeeper is backdated to 30 March, employers must stump up the $1,500 payment all through April until reimbursement in the first week of May in order to be eligible. The one-in all-in rule, that every eligible employee who nominates must be given a payment if the employer chooses to participate, prevents employers playing favourites and requires every worker to be paid. And because workers are entitled to $1,500 even if their regular pay packet is less, in many cases businesses will have a larger wage bill than usual, while suffering from the downturn. For Blossom McKenzie-King\u2019s employer, that month of above-average wage bills was the difference between dropping out and participating in the scheme. McKenzie-King, who worked for four years in a retail store in Melbourne\u2019s CBD, tells Guardian Australia she and her co-workers \u201cgot all our hopes up\u201d when jobkeeper was announced. \u201cWe thought \u2018we\u2019ll be fine, and this is really good news for the employer too\u2019.\u201d But the business, which had already suffered poor sales as bushfire smoke blanketed Melbourne over summer, did not have enough cash to pay McKenzie-King and others until jobkeeper was reimbursed. \u201cSpeaking for my employer \u2013 they\u2019ve said they might not be able to reopen the store \u2026 and if another opportunity comes up I should take it. \u201cThey want to keep me employed, but it\u2019s hard to make promises when you can\u2019t be 100% sure you can keep them, when everything is so uncertain. It\u2019s a bit disappointing \u2013 I was expecting to be able to ride this out.\u201d Emily Bitto, the co-owner of Heartattack and Vine, is one such employer who couldn\u2019t afford to make a month of payments for employees to access jobkeeper at her small cafe and wine bar in inner-city Melbourne suburb Carlton. The cafe managed to keep its eight permanent staff, but with the business reduced to a takeaway window and home delivery, revenues are down about 80% and it could not afford to keep 18 casuals. Bitto says that Heartattack and Vine had 11 casuals eligible for the scheme, but the business would have to pay them $48,000 to cover the first month, before it was reimbursed. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have the cash flow to do it without a loan,\u201d she says. Bendigo Bank offered \u201ca regular sort of loan at 12% interest\u201d. \u201cWe considered that but then we realised that because the scheme is continuously paid in arrears, even if we took out that loan to cover the first month, we get that reimbursement, pay back the bank, then we\u2019re essentially in the exact same position for the next month and the next month up until the end of the six-month period where we get the last payment.\u201d On Thursday, the Morrison government offered a stop-gap: the big four banks agreed to set up \u201cdedicated hotlines\u201d for customers calling asking for bridging finance to pay staff ahead of receiving jobkeeper payments. Bitto said a bank hotline might not help. \u201cI already feel like it\u2019s, not too late, because it goes for six months,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve already missed the boat for the first month. \u201cIf you lose two months of the program trying to get that bridging finance it\u2019s an issue.\u201d Despite the teething problems, more than 900,000 employers registered their interest in the scheme, and 400,000 businesses covering 2.4m employees have completed applications. Half of those are sole-traders and 90% are microbusinesses. Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary, Sally McManus, says \u201cthe slow uptake of jobkeeper is concerning\u201d. \u201cIf workers are missing out on payments because companies are simply choosing to opt out, that\u2019s a serious problem that people can address by applying pressure through their union.\u201d Opting to participate in the scheme is just the first hurdle. Employers and employees increasingly find themselves locked in battles about attendance at work and duties while physical distancing restrictions are still in place. Luke, a hairdresser in Sydney\u2019s inner west, asked his employer to apply for jobkeeper after the salon shut down in late March. When the salon reopened last week, Luke offered to work from home, answering phone calls, taking bookings and preparing salon equipment for use but the boss insisted he come back in to work. He refused, citing his roommate\u2019s asthma and his fears that working in close proximity to customers in the personal services industry wasn\u2019t safe. Luke is not sure if his employer will pay jobkeeper to other employees or start his payments in May, and will approach the ATO rather than ask his boss. \u201cWe stopped \u2026 contact the last week. It really exploded \u2013 our discussion over it \u2013 with the reopening of the salon.\u201d Luke says he loves his job and coworkers but \u201cnow that I\u2019ve had this massive disagreement with my boss I feel like I can\u2019t return\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a really good workplace \u2013 in just trying to get \u2026 what I\u2019m owed, or what\u2019s mine.\u201d Participation in the scheme is more complicated than a straight $1,500 payment to workers. Employers can use jobkeeper to pay down leave entitlements until just two weeks of annual leave remain, and Qantas has innovated by using it to pay penalty rates. Unions are on the lookout for employers that go beyond pushing the envelope to outright illegal practices, such as paying workers less than $1,500 fortnightly or demanding they repay a portion of jobkeeper, a practice resembling the infamous \u201ccash-back\u201d scam at some 7-Eleven franchise convenience stores. Neil said enforcement \u201cwill be very strict\u201d for employers who don\u2019t pass on the full amount, but the epidemic of wage theft has unions worried. From employers\u2019 perspective, staff expecting to get paid the subsidy not to work is the biggest potential abuse. Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox, accused \u201csome employees\u201d of \u201ca misguided view that they can choose not to come to work if their employer is accessing the jobkeeper scheme\u201d. \u201cIf the employee is not stood down or on approved or authorised leave, the employee must comply with any lawful and reasonable direction given by their employer,\u201d he said. \u201cThis includes any reasonable and safe direction to carry out work.\u201d The Council of Small Business Organisations Australia, Peter Strong, blames unions, who he claims are \u201cnot being helpful, they\u2019re saying everyone should be allowed to work from home\u201d. \u201cEmployers are busting their guts out and the majority of employees are doing the right thing,\u201d Strong says. \u201cBut we\u2019re getting enough people saying \u2018you can\u2019t tell me what to do\u2019, \u2018I won\u2019t come to work because it\u2019s unsafe\u2019 \u2013 but then they also say \u2018you can\u2019t tell me what to do at home\u2019 either.\u201d McManus rejects the \u201cbizarre\u201d charge, explaining that \u201cmany businesses just can\u2019t operate at the moment because of the decisions governments have rightly made regarding social distancing to keep us safe\u201d.

The Great Depression went on for four years. You want to talk about economic anxiety? You want to talk about people losing homes, not being able to feed themselves, people living in camps, people living in cars. World War II, six years.

On an individual level and on a societal level. Things happen and you have to deal with it and it\u2019s hard. But on the other hand it makes us who we are, you get shaped by your experiences. <strong>This is a terrible experience to go through.

Every expert, every expert \u2013 CDC, White House task force, Cornell University, Columbia University, McKinsey, that group that Bill Gates funded \u2013 every one of them projected that there would be at least 100,000 more serious infections in state of New York. One hundred thousand more serious infections, more hospitalizations. What happened? We did what we had to do, which was hard and <em>is</em> hard. Well, what did we accomplish? One hundred thousand fewer serious infections. That\u2019s what\u2019s 56 days of our relative living through hell has accomplished. And that is a hell of an accomplishment.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a look at today\u2019s biggest news items: Donald Trump stays away from briefings amid fallout from disinfectant comments. The president remained behind closed doors after advisers reportedly warned him that the briefings were hurting his campaign. Michigan senator sorry for wearing \u2018Confederate\u2019 facemask. State senator Dale Zorn has apologized after wearing a facemask that appeared to depict the Confederate flag. Cuomo to sign an executive order allowing pharmacists to conduct diagnostic coronavirus tests. The New York governor called quarantining this generation\u2019s defining challenge in his daily briefing. Georgia, Oklahoma and Alaska have begun loosening lockdown orders on their pandemic-wounded businesses. US states\u2019 moves to ease coronavirus lockdowns risk dangerous patchwork with the confirmed US death toll from Covid-19 having passed 50,000. Dr Anthony Fauci, White House coronavirus task force member and infectious diseases chief at the National Institutes of Health, said on Saturday that a randomized controlled trial is the only way to prove whether any of the drugs being explored as Covid-19 treatments in fact work. \u201cWe need something out there, but safety and efficacy is something we owe to the global population,\u201d Fauci said during an online meeting of the National Academy of Sciences. He added that caution must be of paramount importance as economies re-open, lest areas wounded by infections experience a resurgence. \u201cAny attempt to leapfrog over these almost certainly will result in a rebound, and then we can set ourselves back,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get control of it we will never get back to normal. I know we will, but we\u2019ve got to do it correctly.\u201d He added: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get fixated on how many tests you need. ... Instead, places must \u201chave enough tests to respond to the outbreaks that will inevitably occur.\u201d Florida governor Ron DeSantis said the re-opening of his state\u2019s economy will begin with \u201ca very, very small step forward\u201d. DeSantis said decisions on which businesses and activities will be permitted when the statewide stay-at-home order ends on Thursday will be made \u201cbased on data, where trends are\u201d during a news conference. Orthopedic surgeon Wael Barsoum, speaking alongside the governor at Cleveland Clinic Florida in Weston, said any changes will be evaluated daily. \u201cI think that there is a lot of excitement about seeing what happens as we move forward, as we start slowly seeing changes with the requirements that we\u2019ve had put in place,\u201d Barsoum said. \u201cBut please recognize that we will learn every day, and we may have to step back from some of those decisions as a society.\u201d The state\u2019s department of health released data on Saturday showing that 612 people have died from Covid-19 in south Florida \u2013 including Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties \u2013 an increase of 28 people from Friday. Statewide, 1,055 people have died and 30,839 individuals have tested positive. While many Los Angeles area beaches remain closed to the public due to Covid-19, a handful are permitting visitors in a limited capacity amid California governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s pleas to practice social distancing. One such beach is in San Clemente, where the local council voted to reopen the beach for recreational activity such as walking, running, swimming and surfing, but it also said residents should not bring a blanket and hang out. The early returns have been mixed. According to the Orange County Register: This weekend, with a heat wave hitting the region, will be a test to see if keeping the beach open is possible. Will people be able to keep moving and use the sand and surf just for exercise, as San Clemente requires? Can they remember to space out 6-feet away from others to adhere to social distancing rules? Newport Beach had tens of thousands of beachgoers Friday afternoon as the hot weather hit, an influx that concerned residents who worry about out-of-towners and careless beachgoers flooding into the tourist town. The sentiment from residents was mixed \u2013 some griping on social media that the sand looked like a hot summer day or the Fourth of July holiday with careless crowds disregarding stay-at-home orders \u2014 while others said beachgoers seemed to be mindful of other people\u2019s space and, for the most part, adhered to the rules. \u201cIt was extremely crowded, it was the biggest crowd we have seen since last summer,\u201d said Brian O\u2019Roarke, Newport Beach Lifeguard Battalion Chief. \u201cWith the boardwalks and parking lots closed, it\u2019s kept the activity more to people on the beach.\u201d With closures of other beaches in Los Angeles, San Diego and next door in Laguna \u2013 as well as regular visitors from inland, the crowds have been \u201cpretty thick,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting people coming from other counties, without a doubt,\u201d O\u2019Roarke said. \u201cOur message is that the beaches are open, we are encouraging social distancing and discouraging gathering points \u2014 that\u2019s why the parking lots, the Wedge and boardwalks and piers are closed. \u201cWe want people to follow Gov. Newsom\u2019s stay-at-home order, go out and get exercise, jump in the water, but we\u2019re saying it\u2019s essential to keep up with our social distancing.\u201d Lifeguards are beefing up staffing for the weekend, though a thick, cool coastal fog on Saturday may help ease crowds. Authorities are approaching groups of six or more to remind them about social distancing, he said. \u201cThey understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d O\u2019Roarke said. Mike Pence\u2019s office has announced the vice president will lead a White House coronavirus task force meeting at 4pm today in the Situation Room, suggesting there will be no press briefing today. According to reports, Trump is planning to \u2018pare back\u2019 the daily briefings after falsely claiming his suggestion to inject cleaning products had been \u2018sarcastic\u2019. Yesterday\u2019s presser offered one of the strangest twists of the pandemic so far: the president gave a short pre-written statement and then exited the stage without taking a single question. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has said the country\u2019s economy should not reopen until there is enough personal protection equipment for workers. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be reopening any sector of the economy until we have enough material to protect Canadians and ensure that we are stopping the spread of Covid-19,\u201d said Trudeau during a press conference on Saturday. The prime minister said he expected \u201cplane loads\u201d of PPE to arrive next week. \u201cWe know we have to take a gradual and progressive approach and be very careful about reopening the economy,\u201d he said. Canada had recorded 2,350 fatalities from Covid-19 as of Saturday morning. Donald Trump has dipped his toes into Twitter, boasting about the US\u2019s testing program. \u201cWe have now Tested more than 5 Million People. That is more than any other country in the World, and even more than all major countries combined!,\u201d he wrote. That\u2019s not quite right. Russia, Italy and Germany alone have issued more than 5.5m tests. Trump also went back to an old theme: China\u2019s place in the pandemic. \u201cThe Do Nothing Democrats are spending much of their money on Fake Ads. I never said that the CoronaVirus is a \u201cHoax\u201d, I said that the Democrats, and the way they lied about it, are a Hoax. Also, it did start with \u201cone person from China\u201d, and then grew, &amp; will be a \u201cMiracle\u201d end!,\u201d he wrote. Trump is correct when he says he did not refer to the virus as a \u201choax\u201d. However, as Snopes reports, he \u201clikened the Democrats\u2019 criticism of his administration\u2019s response to the new coronavirus outbreak to their efforts to impeach him, saying \u2018this is their new hoax.\u2019\u201d Miami is considering how it will handle a planned easing of restrictions in the city next week, according to a story in the Miami Herald. Some parks are expected to reopen but measures will be in place to maintain social distancing. For example, people will be able to shoot baskets on basketball courts but not play full games, while tennis will be allowed but only if people play singles rather than doubles. Enforcement of the new rules will require huge amounts of manpower, and security staff from Miami\u2019s sports stadiums could be used, reports the Herald. Stadium workers have found themselves out of jobs during the shutdown, which has effectively suspended professional sports in the US. You can read some of the workers\u2019 stories here: Georgia\u2019s governor, Brian Kemp, eased some of the state\u2019s lockdown measures on Friday. That included the reopening of nail salons and barber shops. Keisha Lance Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta, clearly does not agree with that policy and tweeted out statistics on death rates in Georgia on Saturday, along with a message for people to stay home. \u201cIf you\u2019re getting your nails done right now, please share these noon numbers with your manicurist #StayHomeGeorgia,\u201d the mayor wrote. New Jersey has the second-highest death toll from Covid-19 for any state other than New York. The state\u2019s governor, Phil Murphy, reported 249 deaths over the last 24 hours, bringing the total deaths in New Jersey to 5,863 since the start of the pandemic. However, Murphy said the number of deaths now appear to be flattening. \u201cWe need to see more progress and more slowing before we can begin implementing any effort to get ourselves on the road to the new normal that awaits our state on the other side of this pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cThose curves are all going largely in the right direction.\u201d He also called the state\u2019s efforts against the virus \u201ca war\u201d. He wrote on Twitter: \u201cWe\u2019ve lost more New Jerseyans to coronavirus than we lost in World War I, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War COMBINED. When we say we\u2019re in a war, we mean it. This is literally a war.\u201d Some have debated how useful war metaphors are during the pandemic. Here\u2019s our own Marina Hyde on language and coronavirus: The global death toll for Covid-19 has now passed 200,000. The Coronavirus Resource Center, run by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, shows that the global death toll stands at 200,698 as of Saturday. The figures for infections are likely to underestimate the true scale of the pandemic due to suspected under-reporting and differing testing regimes. You can read more on developments around the world in our global Covid-19 liveblog: Michigan state senator Dale Zorn has apologized after wearing a facemask that appeared to depict the Confederate flag. Zorn, a Republican, wore the mask during a senate vote at the Michigan capitol in Lansing on Friday. He initially defended his actions, saying his wife had made the mask and that it depicted the flag of Tennessee or Kentucky. \u201cI told my wife it probably will raise some eyebrows, but it was not a Confederate flag,\u201d Zorn told Lansing TV station WLNS on Friday. \u201cEven if it was a Confederate flag, you know, we should be talking about teaching our national history in schools and that\u2019s part of our national history and it\u2019s something we can\u2019t just throw away because it is part of our history.\u201d When Zorn was asked what the meaning of the Confederate flag is, he replied, \u201cThe Confederacy\u201d. However, after receiving criticism from both Republicans and Democrats in the Michigan senate, Zorn issued an apology on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for my choice of pattern on the face mask I wore yesterday on the Senate floor. I did not intend to offend anyone; however, I realize that I did, and for that I am sorry. Those who know me best know that I do not support the things this pattern represents,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cMy actions were an error in judgment for which there are no excuses and I will learn from this episode.\u201d Earlier, a spokesperson for Michigan\u2019s senate majority leader, Republican Mike Shirkey said Shirkey \u201cwould not support or encourage any senator to display an insensitive symbol on the Senate floor.\u201d The leader of the Democrats in the Michigan senate, Jim Ananich, said: \u201cI\u2019m just really disappointed to see him make a choice that is deeply hurtful to so many people. When he was called out for it, he didn\u2019t seem to even understand or acknowledge what the problem was.\u201d Zorn was in Lansing on Friday to vote on measures that would increase oversight of Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s powers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Michigan is one of a number of states that have attracted protests against stay-at-home orders during the pandemic. Zorn said he supported bipartisan oversight of Whitmer\u2019s actions. \u201cThe founding idea of a government for the people and by the people should not be tossed aside lightly, even in cases of a public health emergency,\u201d Zorn said in a statement on Friday. \u201cI supported this legislation to give the Michigan people more input into the governor\u2019s use of emergency powers that limit their freedom and affect their lives. \u201cEmergency actions were necessary to protect the public when the coronavirus came to Michigan. This reform is about speeding up the process for ensuring that elected officials listen to the people and work together to both address the crisis and, when appropriate, enable people to live their lives.\u201d There is currently no White House press briefing scheduled for today, although that\u2019s been the case on previous weekends so we could still hear from the president. Mike Pence is expected to attend a task force meeting at 4pm ET though. New York will begin conducting antibody testing starting today for healthcare workers at four hospitals in NYC: Montefiore, Elmhurst, SUNY Downstate and Bellevue. Other essential workers including MTA employees, NYPD and state police will receive testing next week. Cuomo ends today\u2019s briefing by saying he\u2019s going to go hiking with a mask later today. \u201cBy the way I have a whole colledction of really beautiful masks that have been sent to me from people all across the country, I\u2019m going to show you,\u201d he says. \u201cMask art is a new boutique specialization that has developed. Mask art.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been 56 long days,\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cGenerations are called upon to deal with high levels of difficulty. We are called upon to deal with this crisis. Day 56. The 1918 pandemic went on for two years. We\u2019re in day 56. World War I went on for four years. The Great Depression went on for four years. You want to talk about economic anxiety? You want to talk about people losing homes, not being able to feed themselves, people living in camps, people living in cars. World War II, six years. Vietnam War \u2013 that intensity, every night, every night to have to hear about the tragedies \u2013 went on for eight years. \u201cI get 56 days is a long time, and I get it\u2019s the worst thing that we have experienced in modern history. I get that. But just a little perspective \u2013 not that it makes our situation any better, but it gives you a sense of perspective: Yes, in life, things happen. On an individual level and on a societal level. Things happen and you have to deal with it and it\u2019s hard. But on the other hand it makes us who we are, you get shaped by your experiences. This is a terrible experience to go through. But we will manage it, we will handle it and will be the better for it. \u201cFifty-six days, all this inconvenience. Think of it this way: what you\u2019re doing is actually saving lives. That\u2019s not rhetorical, that\u2019s not overly dramatic. You are saving lives. What we have done has saved lives. Every expert, every expert \u2013 CDC, White House task force, Cornell University, Columbia University, McKinsey, that group that Bill Gates funded \u2013 every one of them projected that there would be at least 100,000 more serious infections in state of New York. One hundred thousand more serious infections, more hospitalizations. What happened? We did what we had to do, which was hard and is hard. Well, what did we accomplish? One hundred thousand fewer serious infections. That\u2019s what\u2019s 56 days of our relative living through hell has accomplished. And that is a hell of an accomplishment. So yes, it\u2019s not for naught: 100,000 fewer infections. \u201cLife is better than death, even if it is not your own.\u201d Cuomo, stressing the need for more testing and federal assistance, says he is signing an executive order that will allow independent pharmacists to conduct diagnostic coronavirus tests. There are about 5,000 pharmacies in New York, Cuomo says. He adds that he is expanding the scope of eligibility to get a coronavirus test in New York state. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll get to the point where anyone who wants a test they can get a test,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the dream.\u201d \u201cAll evidence says we\u2019re on the decline,\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo says, noting that total hospitalizations are down again to around 1,100 \u2013 a level where they were three weeks ago. However, the death toll increased slightly to 437 people in the last 24 hours \u2013 418 in hospitals and 19 in nursing homes \u2013 bringing the overall total to 16,599 in the state to date. \u201cThis is just terrible, terrible, horrific news,\u201d he says. This is Bryan Graham in New York, taking over for Lauren Aratani. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is expected to give his daily briefing from Albany shortly. WHO: \u2018No evidence\u2019 that those with Covid-19 antibodies are immune to second infection In a move warning countries against issuing \u201cimmunity passports\u201d or \u201crisk-free certificates\u201d to people who have been infected with Covid-19, the World Health Organization said that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that those who have the illness\u2019 antibodies cannot be infected again. \u201cThere is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection,\u201d WHO said this morning in a statement. Authorities in countries such as Italy and Chile have made moves to identify people who have antibodies against the illness to potentially bring them back to the workforce and restart the economy. WHO\u2019s statement said research has shown that most people who have had Covid-19 develop antibodies to the virus, though it is unclear whether those antibodies translate to immunity from a second infection. Trump leads Biden in Texas poll Donald Trump has a slight edge over Joe Biden in Texas, according to a poll released last night. If the election was held today, Trump would beat Biden 49% to 44%, with 7% of voters saying they are undecided. While Texas is not one of the key swing states and usually goes red in presidential elections, the state has the second highest number of voters in the electoral college behind California. Though recent polls show Biden slightly leading Trump in key swing states Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania, Hillary Clinton had a stronger lead over Trump in those states at the same point in the election in 2016. Donald Trump retweeted this morning an advisory from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from yesterday that says household cleaners \u201ccan cause problems when not used properly\u201d. It hasn\u2019t even been 48 hours since Trump said during a press briefing that researchers should look into injecting disinfectant into the bodies of infected Covid-19 patients. \u201cI see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute\u2026 Is there a way we can do something, by an injection inside or almost a cleaning? \u2026 So, that you\u2019re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me.\u201d Of course medical experts and even the manufacturers of disinfectants said in no circumstances should they consume or inject disinfectant into a human body. Trump later backtracked on the comments, blaming the media for not seeing that he was being sarcastic. \u201cI was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen,\u201d Trump told reporters at his press briefing yesterday. It\u2019s not entirely clear whether viewers of the press briefings took Trump\u2019s comments as sarcasm. New York City\u2019s Poison Control Center reported a doubling of calls regarding possible exposure to disinfectants Thursday night to Friday afternoon. Happy Saturday, and welcome to our live coverage of Covid-19 developments. Reports are out this morning that Donald Trump\u2019s advisers are telling the president to pare back his appearance at the White House\u2019s daily press briefings. His advisers are saying that his daily appearances are actually hurting him in the polls, where he is trailing Joe Biden ever so slightly. \u201cI told him it\u2019s not helping him \u2026 Seniors are scared. And the spectacle of him fighting with the press isn\u2019t what people want to see,\u201d one adviser to the president told Axios. Advisers are recommending that Trump leave the technical, day-to-day updates to members of the special taskforce and make appearances only when there are special announcements. But it\u2019s unclear whether Trump will heed this advice given his roots as a reality television personality who loves the cameras. Axios says that Trump reportedly defended his frequent appearances, saying that it gets good ratings. \u201cHe\u2019s going to want to get media attention and control his message,\u201d Sam Nunberg, who briefly served on Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016, told Politico. \u201cHe is the only one who thinks he can do this message best, and that\u2019s just the reality. That\u2019s how he works.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "After more than a month of near-daily White House coronavirus press briefings, Donald Trump stayed behind closed doors on Saturday after advisers reportedly warned the president that his appearances were hurting his campaign. Trump himself referenced his absence when he wrote on Twitter that the briefings are \u201cnot worth the time &amp; effort\u201d. The president wrote the tweet on Saturday evening, when he would usually be taking the podium to address journalists. \u201cWhat is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, &amp; then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey get record ratings, &amp; the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time &amp; effort!\u201d In recent weeks Trump has used the briefings to dole out unproven and debunked medical advice, suggesting that things like sunlight and an anti-malaria drug are cures to Covid-19, often causing his own medical experts to try to correct the record. But on Friday Trump surprised observers by taking no questions and stalking out of the room after an unusually short briefing of just 22 minutes. Some took the move as an acknowledgement from Trump himself that he may have taken things too far when he said on Thursday that disinfectant could be used to cure Covid-19. Those comments sparked shock and ridicule \u2013 and warnings from healthcare experts \u2013 and prompted Trump to make a ham-fisted attempt at a clawback when he later said he had made the remarks sarcastically \u2013 despite video proving he had not. While the press briefings are meant to give members of the coronavirus task force an opportunity to provide updates on the state of Covid-19 in the country, the attention around the briefings has been centered on Trump\u2019s use of the podium as his bully pulpit. The president has used the briefings as uncensored airtime, praising his administration for its response to the crisis while criticizing the media and Democrats for any negative comeback.

      "body": "<p>China has been accused of using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to take some bold and provocative actions, including expansions in the South China Sea, crackdowns on activists in Hong Kong and further detention of activists in the mainland. Some analysts have suggested Beijing is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-security/china-rattles-sabres-as-world-battles-coronavirus-pandemic-idUSKBN2230GC\">sending a message that China\u2019s aggressive foreign policy is still business as usual</a>, or <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2020/04/same-as-it-ever-was-chinas-pandemic-opportunism-on-its-periphery/\">testing its adversaries for weaknesses</a>.</p> <h2>Rounding up activists</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong+protest\">frequent protests</a> that have rocked Hong Kong for months were already in a lull when the outbreak started, but amid fears of an epidemic in Hong Kong they have almost completely stopped. The Chinese government and its supportive Hong Kong counterparts are taking advantage of the break to try ensure they don\u2019t start up again.</p> <p>More than 7,000 people have been arrested on charges relating to the protest rallies, some of which drew millions to the street, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-arrested-on-charges-of-illegal-assembly\">arrests of senior figures in February</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/police-in-hong-kong-arrest-14-activists-amid-autonomy-warnings\">again on Saturday</a> have drawn sharp rebuke. </p> <p>Martin Lee, the 81-year-old founder of Hong Kong\u2019s Democratic party, has said there will be more fatalities and protests if authorities try to pass anti-subversion laws \u2013 which would outlaw \u201csedition, subversion and the theft of state secrets\u201d \u2013 before the September legislature election. \u201cThe Communist party won\u2019t show any mercy\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/fresh-hong-kong-crackdown-will-result-in-deaths-says-democracy-leader-martin-lee\">he told the Guardian</a>. \u201cThey have already stated their stance.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/hong-kong-using-covid-19-crisis-as-golden-opportunity-for-crackdown-says-arrested-leader\">Veteran activist and politician Lee Cheuk Yan,</a> who was arrested in both roundups, said: \u201cThey are using this opportunity of the pandemic so we can\u2019t come out in the marches.\u201d</p> <p>The arrests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/us-and-uk-condemn-arrest-of-hong-kong-democracy-activists\">drew condemnation from around the world</a>, and China director at Human Rights Watch, Sophie Richardson, said the arrests of the 15 activists were \u201canother nail in the coffin of \u2018one country two systems\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>Authorities maintained the action was about the rule of law, creating a deterrence, and securing the city before the protests started up again.</p> <h2>\u201cNon-release releases\u201d</h2> <p>After four-and-a-half years in prison for \u201csubversion\u201d, human rights lawyer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/china-quarantines-human-rights-lawyer-wang-quanzhang-400km-from-home\">Wang Quanzhang was released from a Chinese prison two weeks ago</a>. But he was immediately sent to compulsory quarantine in his home town of Jinan, not in Beijing where he lives with his wife and son.</p> <p>The US state department and human rights groups have called for Wang, jailed after the 2015 roundup of more than 300 human rights lawyers and legal associates, to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/us-urges-china-to-let-human-rights-lawyer-return-home-after-unjust-detention\">released from \u201cunjust detention\u201d</a> and allowed to return home.</p> <p>Poet and activist Li Bifeng was <a href=\"https://www.nchrd.org/2011/01/prisoner-of-conscience-li-bifeng/\">released on 7 April</a> after serving a 10-year sentence but forced into \u201cquarantine\u201d in a guesthouse in Sichuan province. Authorities refused to disclose his location to his family.</p> <p>The practice of \u201cnon-release releases\u201d of dissidents has been criticised by rights groups.</p> <h2>Further detentions</h2> <p>Police detained film maker and poet Chen Jiaping in early March, according to his wife. Chen had been making a documentary about legal scholar and activist Xu Zhiyong, who went missing in February and is believed to be held by police under a secretive detention system known as residential surveillance at a designated location.</p> <p>Zhao Huaiguo, the pastor of an underground house church in Hunan was detained on 14 March on charges of \u201cinciting subversion\u201d. Consumer rights activist Wang Qing, known for using China\u2019s open government information system to hold officials accountable, was charged alongside three other men for extortion and blackmail last year. In April, he was denied an appeal on his case.</p> <p>Three citizen journalists disappeared in Wuhan after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/li-zehuajournalist-wouldnt-stay-quiet-covid-19-coronavirus\">reporting on the outbreak</a>, Chen Qiushi, Fang Bin and Li Zehua. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/missing-wuhan-citizen-journalist-reappears-after-two-months\">Li resurfaced in the past week</a> with a video detailing his detention by police and forced quarantine.</p> <p>Numerous activists and lawyers remain in jail, despite international calls for their release. Veteran activist and founder of a human rights website, 64 Tianwang, Huang Qi was detained in November 2016, on suspicion of \u201cillegally leaking state secrets abroad.\u201d Last year he was jailed on a 12-year sentence.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch said authorities have refused requests from his lawyers for documents, and disbarred two of them. Sichuan police have also harassed his mother, a woman in her eighties, including placing her under house arrest and sending government agents to live in her home, HRW said.</p> <p>\u201cWhile everyone\u2019s attention is on Covid-19, we should not let the Chinese government off the hook for their ongoing crackdown on human rights activists, lawyers and independent journalists,\u201d said Human Rights Watch China researcher, Yaqiu Wang.</p> <h2>One country, one system</h2> <p>While Hong Kong is supposed to enjoy semi-autonomy until 2047 before it is returned to Chinese rule, the past week has seen some suggest China is trying to bring that deadline forward.</p> <p>Last week Beijing\u2019s top organisations in the region, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) and the liaison office, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/police-in-hong-kong-arrest-14-activists-amid-autonomy-warnings\">weighed into domestic political arguments</a>, criticising pro-democracy legislators over filibustering tactics and creating a backlog of legislation.</p> <p>The office was accused of overreach and intruding into Hong Kong affairs in contravention of Hong Kong\u2019s mini constitution, the Basic Law, which guarantees non-interference.</p> <p>Beijing authorities claimed the protections in the Basic Law article didn\u2019t apply to them, and that the Central government exercised \u201cfull governance\u201d over Hong Kong.</p> <p>It came as the head of China\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong, Luo Huining, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/china-official-hong-kong-luo-huining-pushes-national-security-law\">called for long-shelved national security legislation to be introduced</a> as soon as possible to safeguard against threats to national security, like the protests.</p> <h2>South China Sea</h2> <p>The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has accused China of exploiting the world\u2019s focus on the virus with \u201cprovocative behaviour\u201d, including <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-security-malaysia/australia-joins-u-s-ships-in-south-china-sea-amid-rising-tension-idUSKCN2240FS\">advancing its presence in the South China Sea.</a></p> <p>China claims ownership of much of the South China Sea, but this is disputed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan and Malaysia.</p> <p>State broadcaster CGTN<strong> </strong>said on Saturday that China had established administrative districts on the Paracel islands and Spratly islands, the site of overlapping ownership claims.</p> <p>Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the People\u2019s Liberation Army naval military studies research institute, told China\u2019s Global Times the new districts would \u201cfulfil the responsibility of safeguarding our national sovereignty\u201d and \u201cbring convenience to residents on the islands and fishermen\u2019s lives\u201d.</p> <p>Vietnam\u2019s foreign ministry quickly accused China of having \u201cseriously violated its sovereignty\u201d, demanding it \u201cabolish its wrongful decisions\u201d.</p> <p>Last week a Chinese survey ship was seen tagging a Malaysian state oil company drillship, just north of Malaysia\u2019s exclusive economic zone, in disputed waters claimed by Vietnam and Malaysia.</p> <p>It also drew criticism from the US, but the Chinese foreign ministry accused US officials of smearing Beijing and said the vessel was conducting normal activities.</p> <p>US and Australian warships also arrived in the region this week.</p> <p>Vietnam also lodged a formal protest after a Chinese military ship rammed and sank a Vietnamese fishing vessel off the coast of the Paracels, in the second such confrontation in a year.</p> <h2>Buzzing Taiwan</h2> <p>China has also been <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3075526/taipei-says-chinese-military-aircraft-flew-night-exercise\">flying regular fighter patrols near Taiwan</a>, which China claims is part of its territory despite having not governed the island in modern times. In mid-March the People\u2019s Liberation Army sent warplanes across the median line of the Taiwan Strait, and briefly approached Taiwan.

      "bodyText": "China has been accused of using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to take some bold and provocative actions, including expansions in the South China Sea, crackdowns on activists in Hong Kong and further detention of activists in the mainland. Some analysts have suggested Beijing is sending a message that China\u2019s aggressive foreign policy is still business as usual, or testing its adversaries for weaknesses. Rounding up activists The frequent protests that have rocked Hong Kong for months were already in a lull when the outbreak started, but amid fears of an epidemic in Hong Kong they have almost completely stopped. The Chinese government and its supportive Hong Kong counterparts are taking advantage of the break to try ensure they don\u2019t start up again. More than 7,000 people have been arrested on charges relating to the protest rallies, some of which drew millions to the street, but the arrests of senior figures in February and then again on Saturday have drawn sharp rebuke. Martin Lee, the 81-year-old founder of Hong Kong\u2019s Democratic party, has said there will be more fatalities and protests if authorities try to pass anti-subversion laws \u2013 which would outlaw \u201csedition, subversion and the theft of state secrets\u201d \u2013 before the September legislature election. \u201cThe Communist party won\u2019t show any mercy\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThey have already stated their stance.\u201d Veteran activist and politician Lee Cheuk Yan, who was arrested in both roundups, said: \u201cThey are using this opportunity of the pandemic so we can\u2019t come out in the marches.\u201d The arrests drew condemnation from around the world, and China director at Human Rights Watch, Sophie Richardson, said the arrests of the 15 activists were \u201canother nail in the coffin of \u2018one country two systems\u2019\u201d. Authorities maintained the action was about the rule of law, creating a deterrence, and securing the city before the protests started up again. \u201cNon-release releases\u201d After four-and-a-half years in prison for \u201csubversion\u201d, human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang was released from a Chinese prison two weeks ago. But he was immediately sent to compulsory quarantine in his home town of Jinan, not in Beijing where he lives with his wife and son. The US state department and human rights groups have called for Wang, jailed after the 2015 roundup of more than 300 human rights lawyers and legal associates, to be released from \u201cunjust detention\u201d and allowed to return home. Poet and activist Li Bifeng was released on 7 April after serving a 10-year sentence but forced into \u201cquarantine\u201d in a guesthouse in Sichuan province. Authorities refused to disclose his location to his family. The practice of \u201cnon-release releases\u201d of dissidents has been criticised by rights groups. Further detentions Police detained film maker and poet Chen Jiaping in early March, according to his wife. Chen had been making a documentary about legal scholar and activist Xu Zhiyong, who went missing in February and is believed to be held by police under a secretive detention system known as residential surveillance at a designated location. Zhao Huaiguo, the pastor of an underground house church in Hunan was detained on 14 March on charges of \u201cinciting subversion\u201d. Consumer rights activist Wang Qing, known for using China\u2019s open government information system to hold officials accountable, was charged alongside three other men for extortion and blackmail last year. In April, he was denied an appeal on his case. Three citizen journalists disappeared in Wuhan after reporting on the outbreak, Chen Qiushi, Fang Bin and Li Zehua. Li resurfaced in the past week with a video detailing his detention by police and forced quarantine. Numerous activists and lawyers remain in jail, despite international calls for their release. Veteran activist and founder of a human rights website, 64 Tianwang, Huang Qi was detained in November 2016, on suspicion of \u201cillegally leaking state secrets abroad.\u201d Last year he was jailed on a 12-year sentence. Human Rights Watch said authorities have refused requests from his lawyers for documents, and disbarred two of them. Sichuan police have also harassed his mother, a woman in her eighties, including placing her under house arrest and sending government agents to live in her home, HRW said. \u201cWhile everyone\u2019s attention is on Covid-19, we should not let the Chinese government off the hook for their ongoing crackdown on human rights activists, lawyers and independent journalists,\u201d said Human Rights Watch China researcher, Yaqiu Wang. One country, one system While Hong Kong is supposed to enjoy semi-autonomy until 2047 before it is returned to Chinese rule, the past week has seen some suggest China is trying to bring that deadline forward. Last week Beijing\u2019s top organisations in the region, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) and the liaison office, weighed into domestic political arguments, criticising pro-democracy legislators over filibustering tactics and creating a backlog of legislation. The office was accused of overreach and intruding into Hong Kong affairs in contravention of Hong Kong\u2019s mini constitution, the Basic Law, which guarantees non-interference. Beijing authorities claimed the protections in the Basic Law article didn\u2019t apply to them, and that the Central government exercised \u201cfull governance\u201d over Hong Kong. It came as the head of China\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong, Luo Huining, called for long-shelved national security legislation to be introduced as soon as possible to safeguard against threats to national security, like the protests. South China Sea The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has accused China of exploiting the world\u2019s focus on the virus with \u201cprovocative behaviour\u201d, including advancing its presence in the South China Sea. China claims ownership of much of the South China Sea, but this is disputed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan and Malaysia. State broadcaster CGTN said on Saturday that China had established administrative districts on the Paracel islands and Spratly islands, the site of overlapping ownership claims. Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the People\u2019s Liberation Army naval military studies research institute, told China\u2019s Global Times the new districts would \u201cfulfil the responsibility of safeguarding our national sovereignty\u201d and \u201cbring convenience to residents on the islands and fishermen\u2019s lives\u201d. Vietnam\u2019s foreign ministry quickly accused China of having \u201cseriously violated its sovereignty\u201d, demanding it \u201cabolish its wrongful decisions\u201d. Last week a Chinese survey ship was seen tagging a Malaysian state oil company drillship, just north of Malaysia\u2019s exclusive economic zone, in disputed waters claimed by Vietnam and Malaysia. It also drew criticism from the US, but the Chinese foreign ministry accused US officials of smearing Beijing and said the vessel was conducting normal activities. US and Australian warships also arrived in the region this week. Vietnam also lodged a formal protest after a Chinese military ship rammed and sank a Vietnamese fishing vessel off the coast of the Paracels, in the second such confrontation in a year. Buzzing Taiwan China has also been flying regular fighter patrols near Taiwan, which China claims is part of its territory despite having not governed the island in modern times. In mid-March the People\u2019s Liberation Army sent warplanes across the median line of the Taiwan Strait, and briefly approached Taiwan. The move, which analysts said was at least partly to intimidate Taiwan, prompted Taiwan to scramble fighter planes to intercept. China is also sending military flotillas past Taiwan and Japan on a semi-regular basis. Last week a six-vessel strike group led by China\u2019s only aircraft carrier sailed through the Miyako Strait and past Taiwan, under watch by the Taiwanese and Japanese defence forces. In January, a military flotilla, again led by the aircraft carrier, passed through the straits of Taiwan. It didn\u2019t enter Taiwan\u2019s waters, but did cross its air defence identification zone. Investing in India Several countries including India and Australia have introduced new laws or regulations covering foreign investments amid concerns about Chinese acquisitions while nations and companies struggle during the pandemic. This month the People\u2019s Bank of China bought shares in HDFC, India\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, eventually obtaining more than 1%. Under the new laws in India, anyone from a country sharing a border with India needs government approval before any kind of investment, local media reported. While this included many nations, it has been seen as geared towards China, since it includes Hong Kong. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 April 2020. An earlier version said that China had never governed Taiwan. This has been corrected to say that it has not governed the island in modern times.",

But although he will probably leave Sainsbury\u2019s with the share price lower than when he took over in 2014, the boost to the supermarket\u2019s online capabilities from the Argos deal may have helped it cope with the virus-induced demand for deliveries.</p> <p>The anticipated recession will bring more challenges for Sainsbury\u2019s under its new boss. Analysts warn that cash-strapped consumers will start searching out cheaper alternatives, and may switch to discounters Aldi and Lidl, while a fall in disposable incomes could hit discretionary spending at Argos. Supermarkets have performed comparatively well during the lockdown, but the longer this crisis drags on, the more difficult it will be for grocers to avoid its economic consequences.</p>",

The group will be well aware of the criticism that met Tesco\u2019s decision to pay out \u00a3635m to shareholders, having received a similar-sized handout from the government by way of a business rates holiday for the rest of the year. Since the coronavirus crisis began, Coupe has become a regular correspondent in his customers\u2019 inboxes, urging them not to stockpile, reassuring them about the availability of groceries and explaining social distancing measures in stores. As his tenure comes to an end, he will be best remembered for the deal he didn\u2019t manage to pull off \u2013 the intended merger with Asda \u2013 rather than the one he did: the acquisition of the catalogue retailer Argos. But although he will probably leave Sainsbury\u2019s with the share price lower than when he took over in 2014, the boost to the supermarket\u2019s online capabilities from the Argos deal may have helped it cope with the virus-induced demand for deliveries. The anticipated recession will bring more challenges for Sainsbury\u2019s under its new boss. Analysts warn that cash-strapped consumers will start searching out cheaper alternatives, and may switch to discounters Aldi and Lidl, while a fall in disposable incomes could hit discretionary spending at Argos. Supermarkets have performed comparatively well during the lockdown, but the longer this crisis drags on, the more difficult it will be for grocers to avoid its economic consequences.",
