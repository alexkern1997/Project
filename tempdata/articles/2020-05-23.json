Here\u2019s is what\u2019s foremost today so far:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>America\u2019s top public health expert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/19/trump-fauci-relationship-coronavirus-us\">Anthony Fauci</a>, the head of the White House coronavirus task force, urges caution as millions head out of doors for the Memorial Day weekend</strong>, the first weekend that signals the start of the summer holiday season. All 50 states have reopened for business in some fashion \u2013 some much more restricted than others \u2013 and the public is heading to the beaches, bars and bowling alleys. There is potential for chaos and risk of infection. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Fauci said last night: \u201cGo out, wear a mask. Stay six feet away from anyone you see.\u201d</strong> Not everyone will be taking that advice and some local leaders are not echoing that message. Donald Trump last night ordered flags to fly at half staff on federal buildings and national monuments over the weekend, to mark the deaths from coronavirus and to honor America\u2019s military dead.</li> \n   <li><strong>Donald Trump hit out last night at the attorney general of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michigan\">Michigan</a>, Dana Nessel, after she severely</strong> <strong>criticized his refusal to don a mask</strong> for the cameras at the Ford factory he visited in the state yesterday, as an example to others and to comply with Michigan law, even if he, as he said, had tested negative for coronavirus that morning. She called him a \u201cpetulant child\u201d, he called her a \u201cwacky do nothing\u201d, so that\u2019s all useful stuff.

      "bodyText": "Live reporting on the coronavirus in the US continues in Saturday\u2019s blog: That\u2019s all for our live coverage today, thanks for following along. Here are some key links and events from the day: Trump declared churches, mosques and synagogues \u201cessential services\u201d and threatened to override governors who refuse to reopen them this weekend \u2013 a power he does not possess. Joe Biden was criticized for saying African American voters were not actually black if they were still deciding between him and Trump. \u201cIf you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black,\u201d said Biden, who later apologized. The lawyer representing Tara Reade, who has accused Biden of sexual assault, said he was dropping her as a client although he continued to believe in the truth of her allegations. Health officials in south-eastern Wisconsin have warned Amazon that if they don\u2019t fully cooperate with state testing and tracing efforts, its Kenosha campus located 40 miles south of Milwaukee could be shut down. Hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial drug Donald Trump is taking to prevent Covid-19, has increased deaths in patients treated with it in hospitals around the world, a study has shown. The Trump administration sent a letter to the mayor of Los Angeles saying the federal government is concerned that the city\u2019s \u201carbitrary and heavy-handed approach\u201d to shelter-in-place regulations could be \u201cunlawful\u201d. White House coronavirus task force resource coordinator Deborah Birx said she was concerned about persistent high numbers of cases in some cities that have had lasting restrictions on residents, namely Washington DC, Chicago and LA. In California, the governor said he was approving plans for 45 of 58 counties to move further into phases of reopening. Trump has also just called the editor of the New York Times \u201cone of the dumbest men\u201d in journalism, and as CNN\u2019s fact checker has noted, this is the third time in the last month he has called a prominent black journalist \u201cdumb\u201d. He has also been particularly aggressive in his attacks on women in the White House press corps during the pandemic: The president is spending Friday evening attacking his former attorney general, Jeff Sessions: Sessions is in a race to win back his old Senate seat after falling out of favor with the president. After failing to win a knockout blow last year, he now faces a run-off in July against the former Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville. Despite Sessions continuing to embrace Trumpism on the trail, his old boss has continued the attacks. A helpful fact check of Trump\u2019s tweet tonight: And our past coverage of his Senate campaign: The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports today on the devastating impacts on California\u2019s Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander communities: The coronavirus is tearing through Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander communities in California, fanning longstanding health disparities and killing community members at a higher rate than any other racial group in the state. Data from California\u2019s department of public health reveals that Pacific Islanders have contracted coronavirus at nearly twice the state\u2019s overall rate. As of 17 May, they have died from the virus at a rate 2.6 times higher than the state population \u2013 the highest death rate of any racial or ethnic group. The pattern extends beyond California. Oregon, Utah, Washington and Arkansas \u2013 where many Marshallese work in meatpacking plants \u2013 have all seen similar trends. Public health experts have often said the group\u2019s relatively small size can skew the numbers, making percentages appear outsized. But to community members and advocates, that argument obfuscates a long history of overlooked needs and health disparities. The Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho reports on San Francisco\u2019s first sanctioned tent encampment for homeless individuals: The Safe Sleeping Village is one of San Francisco\u2019s new officially sanctioned homeless encampments, a rare initiative announced by Mayor London Breed in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Occupants of the 70 tents spaced out in socially distanced, painted squares in the shadow of City Hall have access to steady meals, electricity to charge their phones, toilets, fresh water, hand-washing stations, healthcare \u2013 and those much-desired showers. But for many, the project comes as too little, too late. Breed launched the plan earlier this month as a solution to a homelessness crisis compounded by an outbreak. With shelters no longer taking in new guests during the pandemic and forced to reduce capacity by 76% to adhere by social distancing guidelines, the number of tents throughout the city had leapt by at least 71%. In the historically underserved Tenderloin neighborhood, a low-income community in the heart of the city experiencing the brunt of the crisis, tents have increased by 258%. The Trump administration has sent a letter to the mayor of Los Angeles saying the federal government is concerned that the city\u2019s \u201carbitrary and heavy-handed approach\u201d to shelter-in-place regulations could be \u201cunlawful\u201d. The warning letter to LA\u2019s mayor, Eric Garcetti, came from Eric S Dreiband, the assistant attorney general for the civil rights division of the US justice department, the LA Times reported. Dreiband wrote: Reports of your recent public statements indicate that you suggested the possibility of long-term lockdown of the residents in the city and county of Los Angeles, regardless of the legal justification for such restrictions. Any such approach may be both arbitrary and unlawful.\u201d California had one of the earliest lockdowns in the US and has continued to take relatively cautious steps toward reopening. LA and the surrounding region remain the state\u2019s primary hotspot for Covid-19 cases, and the DoJ letter came the same day that the White House coronavirus task force resource coordinator Deborah Birx said she was concerned about persistent high numbers of cases in LA, Washington DC and Chicago. Earlier this month, LA officials moved to make \u201cminor adjustments\u201d to lockdown rules, allowing some brick-and-mortar business to start curbside pickup, including music stores, bookshops, florists and clothing stores. In LA, residents must wear face coverings when they leave their homes and will be near other people. This first phase of reopening, LA officials said, is the beginning of \u201ca slow and gradual change to a new reality\u201d for Angelenos. The mayor\u2019s office didn\u2019t immediately comment on the DoJ letter, the Times reported. More on the Covid crisis in LA: Following questions today about Trump\u2019s lack of an annual physical exam, despite the fact that he\u2019s taking hydroxychloroquine (an anti-malaria drug linked to heart irregularities), here\u2019s a look back at November 2019 when Trump had an unscheduled visit to the hospital: At the time, he denied he had a heart attack. As we noted in November, there were unanswered questions about his health and the hospital trip: Trump is the oldest president ever sworn into office for the first time. Speculation over his health intensified as he stayed out of the public eye for two days following his trip to Walter Reed, a short journey for which he used a motorcade including an ambulance rather than the Marine One helicopter as usual. More reading here: Tara Reade said she is looking for a new attorney. Following the announcement this morning that the attorney Douglas H Wigdor was no longer representing Joe Biden\u2019s accuser, two weeks after he had taken her on as a client. Reade, through a spokesperson, told a BuzzFeed News reporter that she was \u201ccurrently seeking counsel with PR support\u201d: In his earlier statement, Wigdor said his decision to no longer represent her was \u201cby no means a reflection on whether then-Senator Biden sexually assaulted Ms Reade\u201d. From our global coronavirus blog: The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has treated 1,300 coronavirus patients with the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which a study has tied to an increased risk of death. The Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who received the information from the VA in response to questions he submitted on the issue, said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the data. Trump has urged use of hydroxychloroquine against the virus and recently said he has been taking it himself, despite evidence that the treatment could be harmful. A study published on Friday in the medical journal Lancet tied the drug to an increased risk of death in hospitalised patients with Covid-19. The US is planning a large testing effort involving more than 100,000 volunteers and the most promising vaccine candidates in hopes of producing a safe and effective one by the end of 2020, according to a new report in Reuters. The scientists involved say they aim to take only months to complete a process that is typically completed in a 10-year time frame. Leading vaccine makers will be sharing data and other resources. Vaccine candidates that prove to be safe in initial studies will be tested in larger trials, and that process will begin in July, Reuters said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t see a safety problem, you just keep going,\u201d said Dr Larry Corey, with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, who is helping design the trials. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s science editor on the long road ahead in the search for an effective vaccine: Hello \u2013 Sam Levin in Los Angeles here, taking over our live coverage for the rest of the day as we head into the long weekend. Trump still hasn\u2019t completed his annual physical six months after he started it, and the White House is declining to explain why, according to an NBC News report. Some are raising questions about the lack of a physical after the president has continued to assert that he is taking the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as protection against coronavirus despite federal regulators warning of potentially serious, even fatal, dangers. In early March, when Trump was asked about his physical, he suggested he would complete it in the next three months, telling reporters, \u201cI\u2019m so busy, I can\u2019t do it.\u201d A study out today showed that hydroxychloroquine has increased deaths in patients treated with it in hospitals around the world. More from the Guardian\u2019s health editor: A report from our west coast office, on California governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s reopening plans in light of Donald Trump\u2019s demand to open houses of worship: California has been approaching plans to reopen the state gingerly, but pressure is mounting as business owners, faith leaders and some county officials call on the governor to accelerate. On Friday, speaking from a veteran\u2019s home in Napa county, one that operated through a deadly influenza epidemic a century ago, Gavin Newsom said California was moving quickly but with diligence. By day\u2019s end, he said, he expects to have approved plans for 45 of 58 counties to move further into phases of reopening. Many sectors, including manufacturing, retail and restaurants have already reopened to various degrees. Soon, every sector will be given the green light, provided it can make good on safety protocols the new reality demands. Churches and houses of worship are sure to remain a point of tension. Newsom said he and his team have been working with faith leaders to craft plans to welcome back parishioners, depending on church size and other factors. But with California just days away from releasing that guidance, Trump muddied the water, deeming houses of worship \u201cessential\u201d and threatening to \u201coverride\u201d governors who don\u2019t approve. This week, more than 1,200 pastors in California said they would resume in-person services this month in defiance of Newsom\u2019s stay-at-home order. Even as case rates statewide appear to have stabilized, hospitals in Imperial county, in southern California, are stretching resources to cope with a surge in cases. Last week, Newsom said, the county was using more than 70% of its ventilators. Plans are in motion to dispatch a 125-bed field hospital to help alleviate pressure, Newsom said. Newsom appeared unmoved by a legal challenge to the state\u2019s plan to move forward with mail-in ballots for the November election. \u201cWe\u2019re on firm legal ground. Vote by mail is not novel in the state of California, nor was it in the recent special election\u201d said Newsom. \u201cPublic health is a nonpartisan issue\u201d. Joe Biden has apologised for his comment earlier today that if African Americans \u201chave a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black\u201d. At the same time, Donald Trump is seeking to press home Republican attacks on the matter. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been such a wise guy,\u201d Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said on a call with the US Black Chambers, an African-American business group. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been so cavalier.\u201d The president, meanwhile, retweeted Senator Tim Scott\u2019s view that Biden\u2019s comments \u201care the most arrogant and condescending thing I\u2019ve heard in a very long time\u201d and commended an African American Fox News host, Harris Faulkner, as \u201cA GREAT AMERICAN\u201d. Faulkner said Biden\u2019s comment was \u201cmore than just a little offensive, it is short sighted, it is a blind spot for this former vice-president. He should\u2019ve got up immediately on whatever venue, microphone he had.\u201d She then read a statement from Black Voices for Trump. The statement was authored by Katrina Pierson, a Trump spokeswoman who spoke to reporters with Senator Scott earlier and according to the New York Times \u201cgrew defensive in response to questions about Mr Trump\u2019s own history of racist remarks\u201d. The Times added: I know the president and I know his heart and I know his intent,\u2019 she said, accusing the news media of taking Mr Trump \u2018out of context\u2019. At the White House earlier, Donald Trump cited \u201cliquor stores and abortion clinics\u201d as services some governors have deemed essential and allowed to stay open during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d the president said, announcing his decision to \u201ccall houses of worship essential\u201d and call upon governors to allow such places \u201cto open right now\u201d. Trump does not like liquor. He is a teetotaler, and vocally so, and claims never to have taken a drink. Trump does not like abortion, vocally so since he declared his run for the presidential nomination of a party committed to achieving its end. Back in 2016, however, he wasn\u2019t very vocal when a New York Times columnist asked if any woman he had been involved with had ever had an abortion. \u201cSuch an interesting question,\u201d Trump told Maureen Dowd. \u201cSo what\u2019s your next question?\u201d There\u2019s also the perennial question of just how religious Trump is, and what support for him says about evangelical Christians in particular. Here\u2019s John S Gardner\u2019s review of a recent attempt to make the Christian case for Trump: Yahoo News and YouGov are out with a startling poll, which among its findings says 44% of Republicans believe Microsoft founder Bill Gates \u201cis plotting to use a mass Covid-19 vaccination campaign as a pretext to implant microchips in billions of people and monitor their movements\u201d. Gates has given $300m to fund efforts to find a vaccine for the coronavirus, which has killed nearly 100,000 people in the US and nearly 336,000 worldwide. Earlier this month he participated in a global summit which the Trump administration skipped. The idea that Gates is pushing vaccine efforts out of some sinister, world-dominating motive is actually a conspiracy theory too outlandish even for the Trump administration and Fox News, which have not pushed it. (Trump supporters Diamond and Silk did go there in April, on their own live stream, after their last Fox Nation show.) To some Americans, that doesn\u2019t seem to matter. Among those who say their primary source of news is Fox News, the new poll says, the figure for believing the Gates conspiracy theory is 50%. The Yahoo/YouGov poll found widespread concern about the spread of misinformation amid the coronavirus pandemic. A majority of Democrats blamed the Trump administration while Republicans blamed the mainstream media. The tendency to believe and spread conspiracy theories is \u201cmore widespread on the right\u201d, Yahoo reported, \u201calthough liberals also believe some false narratives (including that Covid-19 deaths have already surged in states that were quick to reopen)\u201d. Joe Biden has apologized for his comments earlier on Friday. Christian leaders in several states were already making plans to open to congregants on the week of Pentecost, May 31, despite restrictions in those states, and evidence of heightened risks of spreading Covid-19 They, and others, are likely to be emboldened President Trump\u2019s remarks on Friday about opening \u201cessential\u201d houses of worship. The Associated Press reports: The president suggested on Thursday that friction over the issue was more common in states run by Democrats because \u201cchurches are not being treated with respect\u201d by many of their governors. One of those Democrats, California governor Gavin Newsom, was warned this week by Trump\u2019s Justice Department that the state\u2019s phased-in plan to restart economic activity puts an \u201cunfair burden\u201d on worship by not permitting churches to open earlier in the process. More than 1,200 California pastors are planning to restart worship on May 31 despite Newsom\u2019s stay-at-home orders, which he has said would likely allow for religious gatherings within weeks. In Florida, Rodney Howard-Browne - arrested in March for holding a large in-person service at his church, charges that were later dropped - is preparing to reopen with an outdoor service on Pentecost. Catholic and Lutheran churches in Minnesota, meanwhile, have notified that state\u2019s Democratic governor that they plan to resume Mass this week in advance of the holiday, in defiance of his order. And an evangelical pastor who\u2019s been a key Trump backer, Jack Graham, plans to reopen his Texas megachurch on Pentecost weekend. But while Pentecost promises to escalate the number of churches seeking to reopen, many other houses of worship are still expecting to wait until June or beyond to resume in-person services with restrictions aimed at protecting public health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bought up a case just this week about the risks of holding religious services in person. The CDC published an example in a weekly report, which centers around an Arkansas church where the pastor and his wife had Covid-19. According to the report, the local ABC station said, the couple attended church-related events from March 6 through March 8, developing symptoms of illness just a few days following the events. ABC further reported that: In total, 92 people attended the church events leading to 35 people later being confirmed to have contracted COVID-19. Three of the attendees at these events died. The investigation states those who tested positive ranged from under 18 years of age to over 65 with the majority being between 19 to 64-years-old. In addition, another 26 people were confirmed to have contracted coronavirus among members in the community who had contact with those who attended church events. Following reports members of the church were experiencing symptoms, the pastor closed the church indefinitely. Trouble continues for Joe Biden over his remarks to radio host Charlamagne tha God this morning. The Democratic presumptive nominee said that \u201cif you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black\u201d. Michigan Republican and candidate for Senate John James has put out a furious tweet. Here\u2019s the clip. The FBI said on Friday that the agency\u2019s director Christopher Wray had ordered an internal review into possible misconduct in the investigation of former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn. This follows the Justice Department\u2019s controversial decision earlier this month to move to dismiss the criminal case against Flynn, who had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Judge Emmet Sullivan, however, has put a hold on attorney general William Barr\u2019s attempt to drop the case against Flynn, and appointed a retired judge, John Gleeson, to argue against the motion to dismiss. The FBI review announced on Friday will examine whether any employees engaged in misconduct during the course of the investigation and evaluate whether any improvements need to be made, the bureau said. The move to drop the case was condemned by almost 2,000 former justice department figures. Returning to White House coronavirus task force resource coordinator Deborah Birx\u2019s lengthy presentation for a moment. She mentioned that people shouldn\u2019t go to religious services if they are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus. But she and all the other experts have said repeatedly that people can be asymptomatic while still having coronavirus and be shedding the virus, potentially infecting people, for days without realizing it. In follow-up Q &amp; A with White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, she was asked several times by different reporters what authority the president has to \u201coverride the governors\u201d and she skirted round it in various ways but ended up admitting that where it comes to lifting restrictions on houses of worship opening for services \u201cthat\u2019s up to the governors\u201d. Some churches are defying governors\u2019 orders not to hold in-person services, and this was asked about. McEnany said Trump \u201cwants to see all these churches open.\u201d White House coronavirus task force resource coordinator Deborah Birx is giving a detailed presentation in the press briefing room. She said she is concerned about persistent high numbers of cases in some cities that have had lasting restrictions on residents, namely Washington, DC, Chicago and LA. Birx just warned people to wear masks and observe social distancing over the holiday weekend. \u201cPlay tennis with masks on,\u201d she said. \u201cPlay golf with marked balls.\u201d She told Americans to keep distance and think \u201cthat\u2019s your space and you need to protect it.\u201d She then says: \u201cI know you can do it,\u201d as if we\u2019re all elementary school children. But most folks can probably attest to having seen people acting frighteningly irresponsibly out in public, or just without thinking. Whether it\u2019s the mask around the mouth but not nose, or walking around the store with a mask under the chin, like a useless little head hammock, etc, etc, and that\u2019s even without all the people getting into violent incidents over social distancing, mask wearing and all that. So. Drs Birx and Fauci wish you a safe Memorial Day weekend. Speculating here that the president will hit the links. Here\u2019s one of the other points Donald Trump just made in his exceedingly short address to the press. \u201cSome governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics essential, but have left out churches ... it\u2019s not right. So I am correcting this injustice and am calling houses of worship essential,\u201d the president said. Donald Trump says \u201cAmerica needs more prayer, not less.\u201d The president just demanded places of worship reopen for in-person services and he talked about guidelines being issued for \u201ccommunities of faith\u201d. He wants them open \u201cfor this weekend\u201d. Called upon governors to life quarantine restrictions relating to religious gathering places. \u201cIf they do not do it I will override the governors,\u201d he said. He then turned on his heel and left the White House press briefing room without taking any questions. Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany then brought up Deborah Birx, response coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, to the podium for an expert briefing. Press briefing with Donald Trump begins. The president said: \u201cChurches and mosques are places that provide essential services \u2026I call upon governors to open houses of worship right now \u2026 these are places that hold our society together. People are demanding to go to church, to synagogue, to the mosque.\u201d Meanwhile, someone jumped the fence at the White House. We still await the surprise press conference with the president that the White House said would begin at 1pm ET. Donald Trump may want to talk about new guidelines for opening churches in the US for in-person services, which he brought up yesterday during his visit to Michigan. He will no doubt be asked about the latest, large study of hydroxychloroquine, which he has been taking as a prophylactic against Covid-19 after at least two staffers at the White House tested positive for the disease. This despite his own federal regulators strongly advising against and speaking about the dangers for non-Covid use. A new study published in the Lancet showed it has increased deaths in patients treated with it for Covid-19 in hospitals around the world. The major study of the way hydroxychloroquine and its older version, chloroquine, have been used on six continents \u2013 without clinical trials \u2013 reveals a sobering picture. Scientists said the results meant the drug should no longer be given to Covid-19 patients except in proper research settings. Yesterday World Health Organization said hydroxychloroquine should not be taken for coronavirus outside of clinical trials. Donald Trump is about to hold a briefing at the White House. This was not originally scheduled. So we\u2019ll see what the president has to say. Coronavirus deaths just passed the 95,000 mark in the US. Joanna Walters will be taking over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Dr Anthony Fauci urged Americans to take precautions when celebrating Memorial Day this weekend. \u201cGo out, wear a mask. Stay six feet away from anyone you see,\u201d Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said last night. Trump said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would soon release guidance on reopening churches. The CDC and the White House have reportedly clashed over the issue, with administration officials pushing to reopen churches with no restrictions despite concerns about the spread of coronavirus. Joe Biden was criticized for saying African American voters were not actually black if they were still deciding between him and Trump. \u201cIf you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black\u201d Biden said in an interview with \u201cThe Breakfast Club.\u201d The comment was criticized as \u201cracist essentialism.\u201d The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Senator Tim Scott slammed Joe Biden\u2019s comment about black voters as \u201carrogant\u201d and \u201ccondescending\u201d in an interview with Fox Business. Biden said in an interview released earlier today, \u201cIf you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black.\u201d Scott, the only African American Republican in the Senate, said in response, \u201cWho in the heck does he think he is? That is the most arrogant, outrageous comment I\u2019ve heard in a very long time, and I take offense to that.\u201d The South Carolina senator noted that 1.3 million African Americans voted for Trump in 2016, and he said the president had reversed some of the damage of the 1994 crime bill, which Biden helped write. Similar to his other recent speeches, Trump\u2019s remarks at the White House, which were meant to focus on honoring American veterans, turned overtly political as the president lashed out against Democrats. Trump criticized Joe Biden for calling his response to coronavirus \u201cxenophobic\u201d and said Nancy Pelosi was \u201cdancing in the streets of Chinatown\u201d as coronavirus started to spread across the country. \u201cThese are sick people,\u201d the president said before returning to the intended topic of his speech. The event ended with a surreal scene at the White House, with motorcyclists driving their bikes around the South Lawn while Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 \u201cSweet Child O\u2019 Mine\u201d played over speakers. The scene made the Memorial Day event feel more like a Trump campaign rally, and some commentators were quick to say the display was inappropriate as the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll approaches 100,000. Trump said he expected the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to soon release guidance on reopening churches and other places of worship. Speaking during a White House event honoring American veterans, the president said the agency unveil a \u201cstrong recommendation\u201d on reopening churches. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make that essential,\u201d Trump said. The CDC and the White House have reportedly clashed over guidance to reopen churches, with Trump administration officials resisting any limitations on places of worship. The CDC published a report earlier this week showing that an Arkansas church had been connected to dozens of coronavirus cases and three coronavirus deaths, raising concerns about relaxing restrictions on places of worship. Days after CNN raised questions about Tara Reade\u2019s educational background, a spokesperson for Antioch University confirmed to the New York Times that she had not received a degree from the school. Defense lawyers in California are now reviewing cases in which Reade, who has accused Joe Biden of sexual assault, served as an expert witness on domestic violence, claiming she misrepesented her educational credentials in major cases. The Times has more on that: Then known as Alexandra McCabe, Ms. Reade testified as a government witness in Monterey County courts for nearly a decade, describing herself as an expert in the dynamics of domestic violence who had counseled hundreds of victims. But lawyers who had faced off against her in court began raising questions about the legitimacy of her testimony, and the verdicts that followed, after news reports this week that Antioch University had disputed her claim of receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree from its Seattle campus. The public defender\u2019s office in Monterey County has begun scrutinizing cases involving Ms. Reade and compiling a list of clients who may have been affected by her testimony, according to Jeremy Dzubay, an assistant public defender in the office. Roland Soltesz, a criminal defense lawyer, says he believes Ms. Reade\u2019s testimony made a significant difference in the outcome of the 2018 trial of his client Victoria Ramirez. Both Ms. Ramirez and her co-defendant, Jennifer Vasquez, received life sentences for attempted murder, arson and armed robbery. The lawyer representing Tara Reade, who has accused Joe Biden of sexual assault, has dropped her as a client. \u201cOur decision, made on May 20, is by no means a reflection on whether then-Senator Biden sexually assaulted Ms. Reade,\u201d Douglas H. Wigdor said in a statement. \u201cOn that point, our view \u2014 which is the same view held by the majority of Americans, according to a Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll \u2014 has not changed.\u201d Biden has denied the accusation. Wigdor said his decision was made on Wednesday, a day after CNN published a story raising questions about Reade\u2019s background and her past statements. Defense lawyers in California said yesterday that they were reviewing criminal cases in which Reade has served as an expert witness on domestic violence, out of concern that she had misrepresented her educational credentials in court. House intelligence committe chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s request to declassify transcripts between Michael Flynn and the former Russian ambassador to the US comes as the justice department has moved to drop its criminal case against Flynn. The former national security adviser pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in 2017, but Trump and his allies have complained Flynn was unfairly targeted by the bureau. The justice department moved to drop the case earlier this month, sparking criticism that the president was politicizing the department. The federal judge overseeing the case is currently trying to determine how to move forward, considering Flynn was set to be sentenced. Schiff\u2019s request also comes a day after Republican congressman John Ratcliffe was confirmed as the next director of national intelligence in a party-line Senate vote. House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff is asking the ourgoing director of national intelligence, Ric Grenell, to declassify transcripts of calls between former national security adviser Michael Flynn and the former Russian ambassador to the US. Schiff is also asking Grenell to share reports related to his decision to release a list of Obama administration officials who requested to have Flynn unmasked in intelligence reports about his contact with Russian officials. The California Democrat said Grenell\u2019s decision to release the names was a \u201ctransparent political act\u201d used to \u201cinsinuate wrongdoing by officials who acted appropriately in requesting the identity of masked US persons.\u201d Meanwhile, the president is once again complaining about his coverage on Fox News and expressing a fondness for the late Roger Ailes, the network\u2019s late former CEO who was pushed out over allegations of sexual harassment. \u201cHope Roger A is looking down and watching what has happened to this once beautiful creation!\u201d the president tweeted. Trump similarly tweeted earlier this week that he missed Ailes and was \u201clooking for a new outlet\u201d after Fox News host Neil Cavuto expressed alarm about the president taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent coronavirus despite FDA warnings about using the drug outside a hospital setting. A new study shows that 96,000 coronavirus patients who were treated with hydroxychloroquine saw a higher death rate and were at a higher risk of developing heart complications. Black Voices for Trump, an advisory board to the president\u2019s reelection campaign, released a statement condemning Joe Biden\u2019s comments this morning. \u201cBiden has a history of racial condescension and today he once again proved what a growing number of Black Americans and I have always known: Joe Biden does not deserve our votes,\u201d said senior campaign adviser Katrina Pierson. Biden has previously been criticized for some of his comments on race, such as when he reminisced about the former \u201ccivility\u201d of the Senate by recalling his work with two senators who opposed racial integration. Joe Biden was immediately criticized for saying, \u201c\u2018If you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black.\u201d Republican senator Tim Scott, who is black, noted the number of African Americans who voted for Trump in 2016 and said Democrats were taking the black community for granted. Other Twitter users said Biden should be reminded that race does not determine political identity. A senior adviser to the Trump campaign compared the moment to Hillary Clinton describing some of her Republican rival\u2019s supporters as a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d in 2016. Joe Biden has made a comment that he will almost certainly have to walk back, a situation the presumptive Democratic nominee finds himself in fairly often. The former vice president did an interview with Charlamagne tha God, a co-host of the radio show \u201cThe Breakfast Club.\u201d Charlamagne had pressed Biden on a number of issues, including the legalization of marijuana and his choice of running mate. After a campaign aide interjected to say Biden had to wrap it up, Charlamagne said, \u201cListen, you\u2019ve got to come see us when you come to New York, VP Biden. It\u2019s a long way until November. We\u2019ve got more questions.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got more questions?\u201d Biden replied. \u201cWell I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black.\u201d \u201cIt don\u2019t have nothing to do with Trump,\u201d Charlamagne protested. \u201cIt has to do with the fact -- I want something for my community.\u201d \u201cTake a look at my record, man!\u201d Biden said, before claiming his decades-long record as a senator and vice president was \u201csecond to none.\u201d Biden\u2019s comments immediately attracted a lot of criticism on social media, and the Trump campaign jumped to capitalize on the gaffe. This is Joan Greve, taking over for Jo Walters. Another study has emerged indicating hydroxychloroquine is not an effective coronavirus treatment, which will surely complicate Trump\u2019s efforts to promote the anti-malaria drug. According to the study published in the medical journal the Lancet, 96,000 coronavirus patients who were treated with hydroxychloroquine saw a significantly higher death rate and were more likely to experience heart complications. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing not to have benefit, but this shows distinct harm,\u201d cardiologist Eric Topol told the Washington Post. \u201cIf there was ever hope for this drug, this is the death of it.\u201d Trump has touted hydroxychloroquine as a potential \u201cgame changer,\u201d and he announced this week that he has been using the drug to prevent coronavirus, sparking widespread alarm about the US president taking an untested drug. He has said he will finish taking the drug in the next couple of days. The Guardian\u2019s Amy Walker reports: Pictures of Donald Trump wearing a face mask while on a visit in Michigan have emerged. In a video published by Sky News, the US president can be seen wearing a navy blue mask. The images emerged after a state attorney general called Trump a \u201cpetulant child\u201d because he allegedly refused to wear the covering during a tour of a plant belonging to the Ford car company. Surrounded by Ford executives who were wearing masks, Trump told reporters he had put one on earlier in the visit. \u201cI had one on before. I wore one in the back area. I didn\u2019t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,\u201d he said. Good morning, US live blog readers, welcome to another vigorous day of politics and coronavirus news, with all the up-to-the-minute developments covered here. Here\u2019s is what\u2019s foremost today so far: America\u2019s top public health expert Anthony Fauci, the head of the White House coronavirus task force, urges caution as millions head out of doors for the Memorial Day weekend, the first weekend that signals the start of the summer holiday season. All 50 states have reopened for business in some fashion \u2013 some much more restricted than others \u2013 and the public is heading to the beaches, bars and bowling alleys. There is potential for chaos and risk of infection. Fauci said last night: \u201cGo out, wear a mask. Stay six feet away from anyone you see.\u201d Not everyone will be taking that advice and some local leaders are not echoing that message. Donald Trump last night ordered flags to fly at half staff on federal buildings and national monuments over the weekend, to mark the deaths from coronavirus and to honor America\u2019s military dead. Donald Trump hit out last night at the attorney general of Michigan, Dana Nessel, after she severely criticized his refusal to don a mask for the cameras at the Ford factory he visited in the state yesterday, as an example to others and to comply with Michigan law, even if he, as he said, had tested negative for coronavirus that morning. She called him a \u201cpetulant child\u201d, he called her a \u201cwacky do nothing\u201d, so that\u2019s all useful stuff. Pictures did emerge, as the president predicted they would, of him wearing a mask behind the scenes before he stepped in front of the assembled media and told them he didn\u2019t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it. Democratic congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer had asked the president to lower the flags to mark the grim milestone of 100,000 US deaths from coronavirus, which will be reached any day now. Trump chose his own way of doing it. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US has now surpassed 1.57m and the death toll has surpassed 94,000. The US has called on the World Health Organization (WHO) today to begin work immediately on investigating the source of the coronavirus, as well as its own handling of the response to the pandemic. Brett Giroir, US Assistant Secretary for Health, told the WHO\u2019s executive board in a written statement: \u201cThere is no time to waste to begin on the reforms needed to ensure such a pandemic never happens again.\u201d An independent, comprehensive review of the WHO-led global response \u2013 as agreed in a resolution adopted by the WHO\u2019s annual ministerial assembly on Tuesday \u2013 should seek \u201ccomplete and transparent understanding of the source, timeline of events, and decision-making process for the WHO\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d, he said. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has scheduled a press briefing at 2pm ET.",

People usually celebrate by travelling, visiting family and gathering for lavish meals, all of which will be largely prohibited as authorities try to prevent new virus outbreaks. The holiday will begin on Saturday or Sunday, depending on the sighting of the new moon, and the dawn-to-dusk fasting of Ramadan will come to an end.</p> \n  <p>Some countries, including Turkey, Iraq and Jordan, will impose round-the-clock curfews for the holiday. In Saudi Arabia, home to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, people will be allowed to leave their homes only to buy food and medicine. </p> \n  <p>Most restrictions have been lifted in Jerusalem, but the Al-Aqsa mosque compound \u2013 the third holiest site in Islam \u2013 will remain closed until. Shopkeepers in the Old City, empty of tourists and pilgrims since March, are reeling from the six weeks of lockdown. </p> \n  <p>In Egypt, authorities have extended the curfew, which will now begin at 5pm instead of 9pm, and halted public transportation until 29 May. Shopping centres, malls, beaches and parks will be closed.<br></p> \n  <p>In Indonesia, the largest Muslim-majority country, the president, Joko Widodo, said restrictions would remain in place through the holiday. The country, with a population of 270m, has reported more than 18,000 cases, including about 1,200 deaths. Since the start of the Ramadan, the government has imposed an outright ban on \u201cmudik\u201d, a holiday tradition in which millions of Indonesians living in big cities flock to their home towns to celebrate with relatives.

He writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Sweden has received considerable media scrutiny in recent days. According to figures published on Tuesday, it now has the highest <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/20/sweden-becomes-country-highest-coronavirus-death-rate-per-capita/\">coronavirus-per-capita death rate in the world</a>, with an average of 6.08 deaths per million inhabitants a day on a rolling seven-day average between 13 and 20 May. As of 22 May, Sweden has had 32,172 confirmed cases and 3,871 deaths. These figures are lower than those of Italy or the UK. But they are higher than those of Portugal and Greece, two countries with a similar size of population to Sweden. The <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\">figures</a> are also much higher than Sweden\u2019s Nordic neighbours, with Denmark at 11,182 cases and 561 deaths, Norway at 8,309 and 235, and Finland at 6,537 and 306 ...</p> \n   <p>But despite the high number of deaths, about 70% of Swedes <a href=\"https://www.msb.se/contentassets/01163f676a3348cfa68491c617b5e1d0/1544449-msb_resultat-coronaundersoknng_200510.pdf\">support</a> their government\u2019s approach. In fact, there has not been much public debate or organised opposition to the strategy. The deaths have indeed shocked many Swedes, especially the disproportionately high number of deaths among those over 70 in care homes and those from working-class, immigrant backgrounds. The debates, however, seem to be taking a more socioeconomic angle. In other words, the reasons for these deaths are being blamed on structural, economic, and social deficiencies \u2013 but not on the strategy itself.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/sweden-u-turn-controversial-covid-19-strategy\">Why Sweden is unlikely to make a U-turn on its controversial Covid-19 strategy | Tae Hoon Kim</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T18:07:44.933Z\">at 7.07pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec7ea0e8f0886ce4f5d8a05\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T15:21:38.106Z\">4.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Africa reaches 100,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More than 100,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus have now been reported across Africa, according to figures collated by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).</p> \n  <p>According to the <a href=\"https://africacdc.org/covid-19/\">interactive coronavirus dashboard</a> hosted on the African Union health agency\u2019s website, there have so far been 3,101 deaths across the continent from Covid-19, while 39,416 people have recovered. </p> \n  <p>Unlike other regions, particularly Europe to the north, the coronavirus has been slow to spread across Africa.

Muslims worldwide will celebrate one of their biggest holidays under the long shadow of the coronavirus, with millions confined to their homes and others gripped by economic concerns during what is usually a festive time of shopping and celebration. The three-day Eid al-Fitr marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan for the world\u2019s 1.8bn Muslims. People usually celebrate by travelling, visiting family and gathering for lavish meals, all of which will be largely prohibited as authorities try to prevent new virus outbreaks. The holiday will begin on Saturday or Sunday, depending on the sighting of the new moon, and the dawn-to-dusk fasting of Ramadan will come to an end. Some countries, including Turkey, Iraq and Jordan, will impose round-the-clock curfews for the holiday. In Saudi Arabia, home to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, people will be allowed to leave their homes only to buy food and medicine. Most restrictions have been lifted in Jerusalem, but the Al-Aqsa mosque compound \u2013 the third holiest site in Islam \u2013 will remain closed until. Shopkeepers in the Old City, empty of tourists and pilgrims since March, are reeling from the six weeks of lockdown. In Egypt, authorities have extended the curfew, which will now begin at 5pm instead of 9pm, and halted public transportation until 29 May. Shopping centres, malls, beaches and parks will be closed. In Indonesia, the largest Muslim-majority country, the president, Joko Widodo, said restrictions would remain in place through the holiday. The country, with a population of 270m, has reported more than 18,000 cases, including about 1,200 deaths. Since the start of the Ramadan, the government has imposed an outright ban on \u201cmudik\u201d, a holiday tradition in which millions of Indonesians living in big cities flock to their home towns to celebrate with relatives. Health experts had warned it could set off a wave of new cases. Brazil overtook Russia on Friday in terms of the number of coronavirus cases, Reuters reports, having registered 330,890 people who have contracted the virus \u2013 second only to the United States. Brazil registered 1,001 daily coronavirus deaths on Friday, taking the total deaths to 21,048, according to the health ministry. However, the true numbers \u2013 both of cases and deaths \u2013 is probably higher as Latin America\u2019s top economy has been slow to ramp up testing. Meanwhile Brazil\u2019s environment minister, Ricardo Salles, called on the government to push through further deregulation of environmental policy while people are distracted by the coronavirus pandemic, in a video the supreme court ordered to be released. The video of a ministers\u2019 meeting surfaced in an investigation of whether the president, Jair Bolsonaro, interfered in appointing leaders of the federal police for personal gain. During the meeting, other ministers spoke, including Salles, with environmental groups saying his remarks prove that the Bolsonaro government is systematically seeking to dismantle environmental protections. \u201cWe need to make an effort while we are in this calm moment in terms of press coverage, because they are only talking about Covid, and push through and change all the rules and simplify norms,\u201d Salles said in the video. Deforestation hit an 11-year high last year and has increased 55% in the first four months of the year, compared with a year ago, with environmentalists blaming Bolsonaro\u2019s policies. Travellers arriving in Britain will face 14 days\u2019 quarantine from next month to prevent a second coronavirus outbreak, the government announced on Friday, warning that anyone breaking the rules faced a fine or prosecution. The new rules will apply to all international arrivals except Ireland from 8 June and come after weeks of calls for tougher restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19. Healthcare professionals travelling to work in the crisis, seasonal agricultural workers and those working in freight and road haulage, among others, will be exempt. \u201cWe want to reduce the risk of imported cases being introduced into the UK,\u201d the home secretary, Priti Patel, told the government\u2019s daily media briefing. Patel said the measure would be reviewed every three weeks, adding: \u201cWe are not shutting down completely. We are not closing our borders. What we are seeking to do is control the spread of the virus because we do not want a second wave of this virus.\u201d The quarantine move is controversial, especially with the aviation sector, where flights have been grounded and passenger numbers slumped. France also expressed disappointment that despite initial reassurances it would not be exempt from the plan. Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have issued a joint statement expressing deep concern at proposals from China for introducing legislation related to national security in Hong Kong that will impinge on civil liberties. \u201cMaking such a law on Hong Kong\u2019s behalf without the direct participation of its people, legislature or judiciary would clearly undermine the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 principle under which Hong Kong is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy,\u201d the statement says. New Zealand bookshops are experiencing an \u201cextraordinary\u201d boom in New Zealand as Kiwis commit to buying local to resuscitate the economy after seven weeks of lockdown. Eleanor Ainge-Roy writes that many readers have sworn off shopping offshore after the Covid-19 crisis, which claimed 21 lives in New Zealand. \u201cPeople are really thinking about where they want to spend their money and the businesses they love. They got a taste of what it was like if you weren\u2019t there,\u201d says Jenna Todd of Time Out bookstore in Mt Eden, Auckland. Libraries have also benefited from the book boom, with borrowers queuing round the block. There have been no new cases of the virus in New Zealand since 19 May1. Meanwhile, the finance minister, Grant Robertson, has said the government is considering distributing free cash directly to individuals as a way of policy stimulus to help boost the economy. \u201cI am pretty keen on making sure that fiscal policy remains the role of the government,\u201d he said. Good morning, Melissa Davey here in Melbourne, taking over from Kevin Rawlinson in London to continue bringing you updates from around the world. While many countries are still struggling to contain the virus, here in Australia people are heading into the weekend with more freedom to visit cafes, travel throughout their state or territory and visit friends and family. Restrictions are loosening at different rates around the country, with just over 500 active cases. There have been 101 deaths. State leaders continue to spar over the refusal of some premiers to reopen state borders as debates continue over when interstate travel should resume. It prompted the federal home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, who describes himself as a \u201cproud Queenslander\u201d, to weigh in on Friday, telling people in that state to test whether the border closures were allowed by the constitution. \u201cPeople are right to test that if they think it\u2019s not [allowed by the constitution] because it\u2019s affecting people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not taking advice from people south of the border at all, but I believe it\u2019s in Queensland\u2019s best interests, given that we are a mining state, we\u2019re a tourism state, and we want to get people back to work.\u201d Dutton\u2019s comments came as the federal government blamed employers incorrectly filling in a form for massively overestimating the size of the jobkeeper payment scheme. The error between the number of employees businesses estimated would be covered by the scheme and the actual amount receiving the payment means the scheme will cover 3.5 million workers, down from 6.5 million. It makes this exchange particularly interesting: It will also cost about $70bn, not $130bn. The government is so far resisting calls from Labor to extend the payment to casuals and those workers who were not eligible for the payment. Indigenous organisations in Brazil have protested against the inclusion in a bill on emergency assistance to tribes in the pandemic of a paragraph authorising Christian missionaries to remain in indigenous communities. It provides rapid Covid-19 tests, medicine and food to indigenous communities while allowing them to control access to their territories to avoid the spread of virus. But in an inclusion called \u201csneaky\u201d by critics, the bill said evangelising missionaries that are already in indigenous communities could stay subject to medical exams. The largest umbrella organisation representing Amazon indigenous tribes, COIAB, said: We absolutely reject this attempt to allow access of missionaries to indigenous territories here there are isolated tribes. COIAB said the presence of evangelizing missionaries has historically brought \u201ctragedy and death\u201d to indigenous people in the Amazon, and was a particular threat to isolated tribes that have only entered recent contact with Brazilian society. The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has treated 1,300 coronavirus patients with the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which a study has tied to an increased risk of death. The Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who received the information from the VA in response to questions he submitted on the issue, said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the data. The US president Donald Trump has urged use of hydroxychloroquine against the virus and recently said he has been taking it himself, despite evidence that the treatment could be harmful. A study published on Friday in the medical journal Lancet tied the drug to an increased risk of death in hospitalised patients with Covid-19. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest news: The global known death toll has passed 335,000 people. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 5,178,911 people have become infected, while at least 336,404 have died around the world. The figures, which are based on official releases and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale of the pandemic. South America has become a new centre of the pandemic, the World Health Organization has said. Brazil is hardest-hit, while cases are rising in some African countries that so far have a relatively low death toll. \u201cIn a sense South America has become a new epicentre for the disease,\u201d Dr Mike Ryan, WHO\u2019s top emergencies expert, says; adding that Brazil is \u201cclearly the most affected\u201d. In the UK, police have spoken to the prime minister\u2019s key adviser Dominic Cummings about breaching the government\u2019s lockdown rules. Cummings was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had symptoms of coronavirus. Officers approached him days after he was seen rushing out of Downing Street when the prime minister tested positive for the virus at the end of March, a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Mirror has found. Peru has extended its state of emergency until the end of June. The country introduced only a very partial lifting of its lockdown as infections continue to climb despite more than two months of confinement. Peru is the second-worst affected Latin American country, with more than 111,000 cases and a death toll of 3,148, according to official figures. Iceland is set to lower its national emergency rating on Monday. Authorities say there are just two people left in isolation waiting to recover from their infections. Iceland has recorded 1,803 confirmed cases, with 10 people having died and 1,791 having recovered. You can see a summary of earlier events here. The spread of coronavirus has been catastrophic in Brazil, with the country now ranking third for infections behind only the US and Russia. The infection rate has been growing rapidly in Latin America, and as global infections passed 5m, Brazil reported a record 19,951 cases on 20 May, according to the ministry of health, taking total infections to 291,579. From a sceptical president to a healthcare system on the verge of collapse, the Guardian\u2019s Tom Phillips explains the factors that have put Brazil at risk of becoming the next hotspot for the virus: In the UK, a source close to the No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings has indicated he does not intend to resign after it emerged police spoke to him about breaching the government\u2019s lockdown rules. The anonymous source\u2019s quote was given to the Press Association after Downing Street refused to offer any official comment. Earlier this month, a senior government resigned after it emerged he had flouted lockdown rules. At the time, the health secretary Matt Hancock declared himself \u201cspeechless\u201d and said he would back any action the police chose to take against Prof Neil Ferguson. The placentas of 16 pregnant women found to have Covid-19 during routine testing at a Chicago hospital all showed evidence of injury, indicating that women infected with coronavirus may need close monitoring during pregnancy, researchers have said. Of the group, 15 delivered healthy babies, while one miscarried. None of the live babies tested positive for Covid-19. The study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Pathology, found that 12 of the women, or 80%, had a type of injury that can impair blood flow from the mother to the foetus called vascular malperfusion. Six of them, or 40%, had blood clots in the placenta. A historical comparison group showed vascular malperfusion in 55% of patients and placental blood clots in 9% of cases. The research involved women who gave birth at Northwestern Medicine Prentice Women\u2019s Hospital between 18 March and 5 May. Dr Jeffrey Goldstein, a Northwestern pathologist and study author, told Reuters: These findings support that there might be something clot-forming about coronavirus, and it\u2019s happening in the placenta. Peru has extended its state of emergency until the end of June with only a very partial lifting of its lockdown as infections continue to climb despite more than two months of confinement. Peru is the second-worst affected Latin American country, with more than 111,000 cases and a death toll of 3,148, according to official figures. The daily number of new infections peaked at 4,550 earlier this week, despite one of the region\u2019s strictest lockdowns. Peru\u2019s president Mart\u00edn Vizcarra implored Peruvians to comply with quarantine measures in a country where the majority work in the informal, unregulated economy. It\u2019s not just an extension ... there is a strategy to combat the virus. This disease will not beaten in a short time. It\u2019s not a 100m sprint, it\u2019s a marathon. Peru has struggled to cope with fierce outbreaks in its northern and Amazon regions, particularly in the city of Iquitos. And it is hindered by a weak and historically underfunded health sector. The country\u2019s health ministry will double the number of hospital beds to 20,000, and intensive care beds from 1,000 to 2,000, Vizcarra pledged. Field hospitals were under construction in the capital Lima and in Covid-19 hotspots across the country. Over the course of the last 60 days we have made great efforts but we have to make another qualitative jump in the health sector. The slightly relaxed quarantine rules will allow online shopping for clothes and domestic products. Some sporting activities, such as professional football, will restart but matches will be played in empty stadiums. France regrets a British decision to impose a quarantine on people arriving from mainland Europe and stands ready to impose reciprocal measures, the Agence France-Presse news agency has quoted the country\u2019s interior ministry as saying. The UK\u2019s home secretary Priti Patel announced earlier on Friday that travellers arriving in the UK from 8 June will have to tell the authorities where they will be staying and face spot checks to ensure they quarantine themselves for 14 days. People arriving from Ireland will be exempt, but not those coming from mainland Europe. In the UK, the opposition Labour party is demanding a \u201cvery swift explanation\u201d from Downing Street as it emerges that police spoke to Boris Johnson\u2019s senior aide Dominic Cummings about breaching the government\u2019s lockdown rules. If accurate, the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser appears to have breached the lockdown rules. The government\u2019s guidance was very clear: Stay at home and no non-essential travel. The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings. No 10 needs to provide a very swift explanation for his actions. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 1,089 more deaths and 20,522 new cases of infection, taking the totals in the nation to 94,150 and 1,571,617, respectively. In the UK, police have spoken to the prime minister\u2019s key adviser Dominic Cummings about breaching the government\u2019s lockdown rules after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had symptoms of coronavirus. Officers approached him days after he was seen rushing out of Downing Street when the prime minister tested positive for the virus at the end of March, a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Mirror has found. At the time, the government had instructed people not to travel and to stay at their family homes. Cummings, however, was seen in Durham. A member of the public is understood to have seen him and made a complaint to the police. Downing Street has previously refused to disclose where Cummings was staying during the lockdown. Chile\u2019s president, Sebastian Pi\u00f1era, has kicked off a programme to provide support for families struggling during the pandemic. About 2.5m packages of food and hygiene products will be distributed over the weekend to families in Santiago before the scheme expands to other parts of the country. Pi\u00f1era said: It is a support and relief for millions and millions of Chilean families who need urgent help. However, poorer communities claim they are not receiving the support they need to survive during the pandemic, with many unable to work as parts of the country approach a second month of strict lockdown measures. Among those most affected are the 30% of the Chilean workforce who make up the country\u2019s informal economy. Unrest broke out earlier this week in several parts of the country over hunger, most notably in the Santiago district El Bosque, when dozens of people took to the street to express their desperation. Police swiftly arrived, leading to violent clashes between police and protesters. \u201cAfter four weeks of quarantine, despair and hunger begin to appear,\u201d said the mayor of El Bosque, Sadi Melo Moya, who condemned the police\u2019s heavy-handed reaction. The hunger protests have led to the emergence of dozens of makeshift soup kitchens in the city\u2019s working-class neighbourhoods, where communities have united under the mantra \u201conly the people help the people\u201d. Videos circulating on social media show police interrupting community support efforts, confiscating donated goods and shutting down soup kitchens. The police denied accusations of excessive repression, claiming one of the gatherings filmed required intervention as it had \u201cinitiated disorder\u201d and did not respect the quarantine. Chile\u2019s former president and the current UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, said: \u201cIt is key to generate important mechanisms for social protection.\u201d A Berlin church is hosting Muslims who are unable to fit into their mosque for Friday prayers because of physical distancing guidelines, Reuters reports. The Dar Assalam mosque in the Neuk\u00f6lln district normally welcomes hundreds of Muslims to its Friday services. But it can only accommodate 50 people at a time under Germany\u2019s restrictions. During Ramadan, the nearby Martha Lutheran church stepped in to help, hosting Muslim prayers in Arabic and German. \u201cIt is a great sign and it brings joy in Ramadan and joy amid this crisis,\u201d said Mohamed Taha Sabry, the mosque\u2019s imam, who led his congregation in prayer watched over by a stained-glass window depicting the Virgin Mary. \u201cThis pandemic has made us a community. Crises bring people get together.\u201d Places of worship reopened in Germany on 4 May after being shut for weeks, but worshippers must maintain a minimum distance from one another of 1.5 metres. The church, a red-brick neo-Renaissance building in Berlin\u2019s Kreuzberg district could hardly offer a sharper contrast to the cultural centre in Neuk\u00f6lln where the Muslim congregation is accustomed to gathering. One worshipper, Samer Hamdoun, said: It was a strange feeling because of the musical instruments, the pictures. But, when you look, when you forget the small details. This is the House of God in the end. The Islamic Council, an umbrella group of 400 mosques, said in April that many face bankruptcy because the closures stretched into the holy fasting month of Ramadan, usually a vital period for donations. The church\u2019s pastor, Monika Matthias, said she had felt moved by the Muslim call to prayer. I took part in the prayer. I gave a speech in German. And during prayer, I could only say yes, yes, yes, because we have the same concerns and we want to learn from you. And it is beautiful to feel that way about each other. South America has become a new centre of the pandemic, with Brazil hardest-hit, while cases are rising in some African countries that so far have a relatively low death toll, the World Health Organization has said. \u201cIn a sense South America has become a new epicentre for the disease,\u201d Dr Mike Ryan, WHO\u2019s top emergencies expert, told a news conference, adding Brazil is \u201cclearly the most affected\u201d. Ryan noted Brazilian authorities have approved broad use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine. He reiterated that current clinical evidence does not support the unproven drug\u2019s widespread use against the new disease, given its risks. Some nine African countries had 50% rises in cases in the past week, while others have seen a decline or have stable rates, Ryan said. The low mortality rate may be due to half of the continent\u2019s population being 18 years old or younger, he said, adding he still is worried the disease will spread on a continent with \u201csignificant gaps\u201d in intensive care services, medical oxygen and ventilation. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: About 80 million infants may have missed out on vaccines for diseases including diphtheria, measles and polio as a result of the disruption to healthcare services caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization says. Fighting has forced 660,000 people to flee their homes since the UN secretary general called for a global ceasefire to focus on handling the pandemic, an NGO says. The Norwegian Refugee Council says the UN security council has failed to provide leadership for ceasefires during the pandemic. Two-week quarantines will be imposed on new arrivals to the UK from 8 June, with a \u00a31,000 fine awaiting anyone who breaches the measure. The home secretary, Priti Patel, announces that mandatory self-isolation would not apply to people coming from Ireland The UK\u2019s coronavirus epidemic is \u201ceither flat or declining ... and in most areas it is declining,\u201d said thegovernment\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. He said the country\u2019s coronavirus R0 number - the number of people to whom each infected person passes the virus - is between 0.7 and 1. The 54 countries in Africa have collectively identified more than 100,000 cases of infection, according to figures collated by the Africa Centres for Disease Control. There have so far been 3,101 deaths across the continent. Germany\u2019s tax revenues for April fell by a quarter compared to the same month last year. According to the finance ministry\u2019s monthly report, the central government and the 16 federal states pulled in about \u20ac39bn (\u00a334.87bn). The Madrid region and the Barcelona metropolitan area will be able to move into the next phase of lockdown de-escalation from Monday, the Spanish government says. The two regions have been the areas hardest hit by Covid-19. One of Europe\u2019s biggest music events, Exit festival in Serbia, has been rescheduled for August. Originally meant to take place in July in Novi Sad, the fate of the festival was uncertain. But, as Serbia emerges from its lockdown, its prime minister, Ana Brnabi\u0107, said the event can take place after all. That\u2019s it from me, Damien Gayle, for another day. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The British Grand Prix faces a race against time to resolve the problem created by the government\u2019s imposition of quarantine on all people arriving in the UK, writes Giles Richards for the Guardian\u2019s sports desk. The chances of the race at Silverstone being held look increasingly slim but Formula One is understood to be remaining in a dialogue with the government in an attempt to find a solution. F1 has yet to comment and is studying the full quarantine document before entering further talks with the government. As things stand, with F1 denied any exemption from the quarantine procedures, not only is the British GP under threat but the sport faces an increasingly complex challenge as it attempts to create and implement a new calendar for the 2020 season. Human rights activists in Zimbabwe have accused the country\u2019s police and other officials of more than 200 violations linked to the country\u2019s coronavirus lockdown. The Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum, a coalition of 20 rights groups, said it had petitioned the country\u2019s police chief and home affairs minister over escalating rights abuses, according to AFP. \u201cAbout 245 violations \u2026 have been recorded since the start of the lockdown,\u201d Jestina Mukoko, who chairs the coalition, told reporters in Harare. The forum is \u201cappalled and outraged by the continued human rights violations that are openly taking place in Zimbabwe and perpetrated by the members of the \u2026 police\u201d, Mukoko said. The monitors in particular called on police to launch a criminal investigation into the \u201cabduction and torture\u201d of a lawmaker from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change and two other senior party officials. They said the women, who were arrested after flash demonstrations over food shortages, were taken by unidentified men and driven several miles out of town, beaten up, sexually assaulted and dumped by a roadside. Zimbabwe has so far recorded 51 cases of coronavirus, including four deaths. Last weekend the president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, said a lockdown imposed on March 30 to control the spread of the virus would stay in place for the moment, but be reviewed every two weeks. Iceland is set to lower its national emergency rating on Monday, as authorities said there were just two people left in isolation waiting to recover from their coronavirus infections. The north Atlantic island state, which acted quickly to contain its outbreak, has so far recorded 1,803 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Ten people have died and 1,791 have recovered. Iceland\u2019s chief epidemiologist, \u00de\u00f3r\u00f3lfur Gu\u00f0nason, has reportedly submitted proposals to now significantly ease Covid-19 restrictions, including reopening bars and permitting gatherings of up to 200 people. With rising uncertainty around the coronavirus pandemic and most of the world still practising physical distancing, people are finding new ways to keep each others\u2019 spirits up. From a llama delivering essentials to older people, drive-in concerts and Capt Tom Moore\u2019s reaction to a knighthood, these are the week\u2019s most uplifting clips Ramzan Kadyrov, the strongman leader of the southern Russian republic of Chechnya, has not been seen publicly in the 24 hours since Russian state media said he had been hospitalised in Moscow with coronavirus symptoms, writes Andrew Roth, the Guardian\u2019s Moscow correspondent. While online sleuths have sought to track planes or motorcades that may have ferried Chechnya\u2019s leader in Moscow, local officials have either declined to give information about his whereabouts or health, or have opted to troll journalists who have asked. Experts on the region said that Kadyrov\u2019s status was unclear but that hiding an illness would fit a wider strategy of minimising problems in Chechnya, particularly when reporting to the Kremlin. \u201cKadyrov is a hostage of his own PR, he is caught by his own approach, which doesn\u2019t allow him to recognise problems in Chechnya,\u201d said Grigory Shvedov, the editor of the Caucasian Knot, an independent news agency reporting on the North Caucasus region. \u201cHe reports to the Kremlin that everything is fine in Chechnya \u2026 and he is a hostage of this report.\u201d Italy recorded 130 new deaths from Covid-19 epidemic on Friday against 156 the day before, the civil protection agency said, while the daily tally of new cases rose marginally to 652, from 642 on Thursday, Reuters reports. The total death toll now stands at 32,616, the agency said, the third highest in the world after those of the US and Britain. However, statisticians believe Italy, like many other countries, has had considerably more deaths from the virus than its official data suggests, because many casualties were never tested. A study this week by Italy\u2019s social security agency, INPS, showed there were almost 47,000 more deaths between 1 March and 30 April than in the average for the same period over the previous five years. Senior government officials in Russia have said the country will experience a sharp rise in mortality figures for May, as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to spread. \u201cThere will be a significant mortality increase in May,\u201d the deputy prime minister, Tatiana Golikova, was quoted by AFP as saying at a government meeting with the president, Vladimir Putin, referring to official analysis and the country\u2019s coronavirus curve. \u201cThe illness and chronic conditions don\u2019t always have a positive ending,\u201d Golikova said, despite doctors trying to \u201csave the maximum number of patients.\u201d The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, also said the number of Covid-19 death in the city for May would be \u201cconsiderably higher than in April\u201d. Russia registered 150 deaths from the coronavirus on Friday, its highest daily rate yet, amid criticism that the authorities are under-reporting the virus fatalities to play down the scale of the crisis. Health officials have reported a total of 3,249 virus-related deaths, a fraction of the number in some European countries, while Russia has the second-highest number of infections in the world, after the US, with 326,448 cases. Germany has announced a series of reforms of the country\u2019s meat industry, including a ban on the use of subcontractors and fines of \u20ac30,000 (\u00a326,000) for companies breaching labour regulations, as slaughterhouses have emerged as coronavirus hotspots, writes Holly Young in Berlin. A number of meat plants across the country have temporarily closed after hundreds of workers tested positive for Covid-19 in recent weeks. This week more than 90 workers were reported to have fallen ill at a plant in Dissen, Lower Saxony. Following an outbreak at a plant in Coesfeld, where more than 270 out of 1,200 workers tested positive, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia announced mass testing of industry employees. An outbreak at a plant in Bavaria in the district of Straubing-Bogen coincides with numbers of infections reaching the \u201cemergency break\u201d level of 50 cases per 100,000 residents. States passing this point are allowed to reimpose lockdown restrictions. \u201cThe corona outbreaks have not surprised us at all,\u201d said Jonas Bohl, from the German Food, Beverages and Catering Union. \u201cRather the surprise was that they took a while to emerge. \u201cThe people not only work closely together but more importantly they live together, in very cramped conditions where there is no possibility to keep social distance.\u201d Spain\u2019s Covid-19 daily death toll has remained under 100 for the sixth consecutive day, according to the latest health ministry figures, which show that 56 deaths have been recorded in the past 24 hours, reports Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent. To date, the country has recorded 234,824 cases of the disease and 28,628 deaths. YouTube has reinstated a video in which a former senior World Health Organization official said he believed the coronavirus pandemic could \u201cburn out\u201d without a vaccine being necessary. Karol Sikora, a former director of the WHO\u2019s cancer programme, who is now professor of medicine at the University of Buckingham medical school, said in an interview with the UK news website UnHerd that the past two weeks of official statistics suggested that the outbreak was petering out. The video was subsequently removed from YouTube. But on Thursday, it was allowed back on the platform. Travellers arriving in the UK from 8 June will have to tell the authorities where they will be staying and face spot checks to ensure they quarantine themselves for 14 days, the home secretary, Priti Patel, has confirmed. All new arrivals, including UK citizens, will be expected to fill in an online \u201ccontact locator form\u201d, including onward travel information. Anyone failing to comply could face a fine of \u00a31,000. Patel said: As the world begins to emerge from what we hope is the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, we must look to the future and protect the British public by reducing the risk of cases crossing our border. We are introducing these new measures now to keep the transmission rate down and prevent a devastating second wave. Arrivals will be required to travel directly from their port or airport of arrival, preferably by car, to an address where they must then self-isolate for a fortnight. The details they provide the authorities will allow them to be traced, if someone they travelled with subsequently contracts the disease, and public health authorities will be also be able to check up to ensure the quarantine rules are being obeyed. A study of nearly 100,000 coronavirus patients has shown no benefit in treating them with anti-viral drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. According to the study, which was published on Friday in the Lancet, the drugs actually increased the likelihood of patients with Covid-19 dying in hospital. Hydroxychloroquine is normally used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and other conditions, but pronouncements from public figures including Donald Trump, who announced this week he is taking the drug, has prompted governments to bulk buy the medicine. Chloroquine is an anti-malarial. Both drugs can produce potentially serious side-effects, particularly heart arrhythmia. \u201cTreatment with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine does not benefit patients with Covid-19,\u201d said Prof Mandeep Mehra, lead author of the study and executive director of the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital Center for Advanced Heart Disease in Boston. \u201cInstead, our findings suggest it may be associated with an increased risk of serious heart problems and increased risk of death.\u201d The authors estimated that the drugs put patients at up to 45% higher risk of dying from Covid-19 compared with underlying health issues. About 80 million infants may have missed out on vaccines for diseases including diphtheria, measles and polio as a result of the disruption to healthcare services caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization has said. According to data collected by WHO and its partners, the provision of routine immunisations for under-ones has been hindered in at least 68 countries, causing disruption to vaccine programmes not seen since their inception in the 1970s. More than half of the 129 countries where data was available reported moderate-to-severe disruptions, or a total suspension of vaccination services during March-April 2020, WHO said in a press release on Friday. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, said: Immunisation is one of the most powerful and fundamental disease prevention tools in the history of public health. Disruption to immunisation programmes from the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to unwind decades of progress against vaccine-preventable diseases like measles. The WHO\u2019s warning comes before a global vaccine summit due to be hosted on 4 June in London, where international donors will be asked to pledge support to the vaccine alliance Gavi, a public-private partnership that aims to increase roll out of vaccines in poorer countries. Tedros added: From the bottom of my heart, I urge donors to fully fund the alliance. These countries, these children especially, need vaccines, and they need Gavi. In April, WHO and its partners recommended a temporary halt to polio vaccine campaigns despite recognising that the move would lead to a resurgence of the highly infectious, water-borne disease. More than a dozen countries in Africa have reported polio outbreaks this year, all caused by a rare mutation in the virus contained in the vaccine. France will hold the postponed second round of municipal elections next month if the coronavirus crisis remains under control, the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, has said, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent. A commission will look at the rules for postal and proxy voting so a maximum number of the electorate can take part in the vote on 28 June, Philippe added. The first round of France\u2019s municipal election was held on 15 March, two days before the country went into strict lockdown. The second round was to be held the following Sunday, but was cancelled. A second round vote will only be held just under 5,000 communes \u2013 with a total of 16 million voters \u2013 out of more than 30,643 places where the mayor was not elected outright in the first round. Many of the 5,000 second votes are in major towns and cities including Paris. Philippe said if there was a second wave of Covid-19 cases, the election would be put back until the beginning of next year. The interior minister, Christophe Castaner, announced that voters would be required to wear face masks. \u201cThe election must not be a factor in spreading the virus,\u201d he said. He added that candidates would be expected to campaign differently, giving priority to online and television canvassing as opposed to public meetings, currently banned. Sweden reported 54 more deaths from Covid-19 on Friday, taking the total death toll in the country to 3,925. According to the latest figures from Sweden\u2019s public health agency, 637 more people have tested positive for the coronavirus. In total, Sweden has 32,809 confirmed cases, with 4,971 recoveries. As regular readers of the blog will now, we have been following the situation in Sweden with some interest, after its government chose not to implement the kinds of compulsory lockdown measures imposed elsewhere in the world. Today, the Guardian\u2019s comment section has published an op-ed by Tae Hoon Kim, a South Korean geopolitical and economic analyst based in Stockholm, on why he believes that, despite it having a much higher death rate than its neighbours, Sweden is unlikely to make a U-turn on its strategy. He writes: Sweden has received considerable media scrutiny in recent days. According to figures published on Tuesday, it now has the highest coronavirus-per-capita death rate in the world, with an average of 6.08 deaths per million inhabitants a day on a rolling seven-day average between 13 and 20 May. As of 22 May, Sweden has had 32,172 confirmed cases and 3,871 deaths. These figures are lower than those of Italy or the UK. But they are higher than those of Portugal and Greece, two countries with a similar size of population to Sweden. The figures are also much higher than Sweden\u2019s Nordic neighbours, with Denmark at 11,182 cases and 561 deaths, Norway at 8,309 and 235, and Finland at 6,537 and 306 ... But despite the high number of deaths, about 70% of Swedes support their government\u2019s approach. In fact, there has not been much public debate or organised opposition to the strategy. The deaths have indeed shocked many Swedes, especially the disproportionately high number of deaths among those over 70 in care homes and those from working-class, immigrant backgrounds. The debates, however, seem to be taking a more socioeconomic angle. In other words, the reasons for these deaths are being blamed on structural, economic, and social deficiencies \u2013 but not on the strategy itself. More than 100,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus have now been reported across Africa, according to figures collated by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). According to the interactive coronavirus dashboard hosted on the African Union health agency\u2019s website, there have so far been 3,101 deaths across the continent from Covid-19, while 39,416 people have recovered. Unlike other regions, particularly Europe to the north, the coronavirus has been slow to spread across Africa. After the first confirmed case was reported in mid-February in Egypt, many countries responded with strict lockdowns. The figures show the burden of the pandemic is mainly being felt in north Africa, followed by the western then southern nations. East and central Africa have far fewer cases. As Canada\u2019s most populous province moves forward with its reopening plans, concerns are growing that coronavirus cases in Ontario are not yet under control, writes Leyland Cecco in Toronto. For a brief period in May, new cases showed a steady decrease, leading to optimism that an easing of the province\u2019s lockdown was on the horizon \u2013 and justified. In response, Ontario has given the green light to having given the green light to retailers, golf courses and pet groomers to resume operations. Lawmakers in the governing Progressive Conservative party have also pushed for restaurant and bar patios to reopen, with modifications. But in recent days, the province\u2019s infection numbers have trended upwards, averaging more than 400 new cases per day this week \u2013 a figure the province\u2019s chief medial officer called \u201cdisappointing\u201d. The province had also aimed for 20,000 tests per day. But this past week, an average of less than 10,000 were conducted daily \u2013 including only 5,813 on Monday. \u201cI will be like an 800-pound gorilla on their backs every single day if I have to until I see these numbers go up,\u201d said the Ontario premier, Doug Ford. At the same time, there is growing concern among health experts that the province is unable to account for the source of nearly two-thirds of infections, leading to concern that the reopening of the province is premature. Ontario\u2019s ministry of health said determining the source of infection was \u201congoing work\u201d, citing incomplete information from local health authorities. \u201cAs we try to get our economy back on its feet, we are very, very likely to experience surges in disease,\u201d Dr David Fisman, an infectious diseases expert, told CBC News. \u201cCovid\u2019s proven itself to be a very slippery foe and you can\u2019t fight an enemy that you can\u2019t see.\u201d There are 24,187 comfirmed coronavirus cases in the province and almost 2,000 deaths. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, may meet Donald Trump face to face at the G7 summit in the US next month, after Downing Street said it was still exploring the arrangements for the event. The meeting of global leaders is scheduled for 10 June, with Trump saying he would like it to be held at Camp David, the rural estate of US presidents. He tweeted that hosting it face to face would be a signal to the world of \u201cnormalisation\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic and that other countries involved in the summit were starting to make their own \u201ccomeback\u201d. Johnson\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cWe are in close contact with the White House about the summit and we will look at the details of what they are proposing.\u201d A physical summit was cancelled in March with the intention of it being transferred to video conferencing. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said he would consider the summit proposals but discussions were ongoing. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he was open to attending. It might have lost 90% of its hotel bookings but Amsterdam shouldn\u2019t rush to welcome back international tourists, according to its mayor. Femke Halsema has sparked anger in the hotel industry by warning the city should be \u201cextremely cautious\u201d about restarting tourism, saying there is not enough space for its 800,000 inhabitants, plus the normal 9 million overnight visitors, and for physical distancing to be respected. \u201cI hear you talking about international tourism, and I know that there are 55,000 hotel beds waiting for guests, too,\u201d she told a digital council meeting on Tuesday. \u201cBut in the coming time we need to be extremely cautious about stimulating regional, national and international traffic. If we do this excessively, we run the risk that Amsterdam becomes the fireplace for a second wave.\u201d Few residents of the world\u2019s great metropolises would have thought much about plagues before this year. Outside China and east Asia \u2013 made vigilant by swine flu and Sars \u2013 the trauma of the 1918 flu pandemic or typhoid epidemics has largely faded from popular memory. But our cities remember. An outbreak of yellow fever in Philadelphia in 1793 prompted administrators to take over the task of cleaning streets, clearing gutters and collecting rubbish. It worked, and governments across the US adopted the responsibility over the next decades. A misconception that the odour emanating from wastewater was responsible for diseases such as cholera prompted one of the world\u2019s first modern underground sewer systems in London, and the development of wider, straighter and paved roads \u2013 which helped prevent water from stagnating. The legacy Covid-19 may leave on the world\u2019s great cities is being hotly debated, although most specialists admit it is too early to know for sure. \u201cIt will depend in the end on how we analyse this virus: how is it spreading? How is it making people sick?\u201d says Roger Keil, a professor of environmental studies at Toronto\u2019s York University. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the full answers, but once they become clearer, urban planners and other professionals will start to think as their predecessors did 100 years ago, as they laid sewer pipes and cleaned out parts of the city that were considered insalubrious.\u201d The Madrid region and the Barcelona metropolitan area will be able to move into the next phase of lockdown de-escalation from Monday, the Spanish government has announced. The two regions have been the areas hardest hit by Covid-19, which has so far killed 27,940 people in the country and infected 233,037. The loosening of the restrictions in both areas \u2013 and in parts of Castilla y Le\u00f3n \u2013 means that all of Spain is now in at least the second phase of the lockdown exit plan. From Monday, people in the three areas will be able to meet in groups of up to 10 individuals, and restaurant and cafe terraces will reopen at 50% capacity. Places of worship will also be able to operate at 30% capacity. The health minister, Salvador Illa, said 47% of the country will move to the third and penultimate stage of the de-escalation on Monday. People in the Balearic Islands, the Canaries, and some parts of the mainland will then be able to visit shopping centres and eat inside restaurants \u2013 both of which will operate at 40% capacity. The government\u2019s latest two-week extension of the state of emergency originally declared on 14 March was hard-won, and protests against the lockdown have spread from Madrid to other regions. The far-right Vox party has called on people to take to their cars to demonstrate across Spain on Saturday. Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero, the finance minister who serves as the government\u2019s spokeswoman, said that people had a right to protest, as long as their demonstrations did not risk spreading the coronavirus: The only things that the state of emergency limits its people\u2019s freedom of movement and reunion. Very often, some of the shouts you hear during these demonstrations are contradictory because people are out protesting. Some people shout, \u2018Freedom!\u2019, when they\u2019re actually exercising the right to criticise things and protest. But you can\u2019t mix up freedom with the freedom to infect people. Here are the headlines in our coronavirus coverage so far today: Fighting has forced 660,000 people to flee their homes since the UN secretary general called for a global ceasefire to focus on handling the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council. Tax revenues in Germany fell by a quarter last month, compared with a year earlier, as Europe\u2019s largest economy faced its most severe recession since the second world war. The central government and the 16 federal states pulled in about \u20ac39bn in April, 25.3% less than the same month in 2019. A senior official in South Africa told MPs that it is time to reopen the country\u2019s economy. Lionel October, director-general of the department of trade, said the government was finalising consultations on how to reopen industries. Pictures have emerged of Donald Trump wearing a face mask during a visit in Michigan. The US president had previously been called a \u201cpetulant child\u201d by a state attorney general for allegedly refusing to wear the covering during a tour of a Ford plant. India has reported 6,000 new cases in its biggest one-day rise since the outbreak started. The country has also reported over 118,000 confirmed cases \u2013 around a 5% increase from yesterday. Coronavirus cases in war-torn Yemen are believed to be \u201cwidespread\u201d, while its health system has \u201cin effect collapsed\u201d. A UN spokesman said on Friday that the reported total of 184 cases in the country is also \u201calmost certainly much higher\u201d. Indonesia has reported 973 new infections \u2013 its highest daily figure \u2013 bringing the country\u2019s total cases to 20,162. The figures come as millions of people in the world\u2019s fourth most populous country mark the festival of Eid al-Fitr without the usual celebrations. The leader of New Zealand\u2019s main opposition party has been ousted after opinion polls showed Jacinda Ardern\u2019s soaring popularity. Around 84% of New Zealanders approve of the prime minister\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, which has helped to boost her ratings ahead of a general election in September. Good news for ravers, many of whom have been wondering if they\u2019ll ever get to throw shapes and hug strangers ever again. One of Europe\u2019s biggest music events, Exit festival in Serbia, has been given a new date in August, Agence France-Presse reports. Originally scheduled for mid-July in the northern city of Novi Sad, the fate of the festival had been uncertain since the coronavirus pandemic spread. But after Serbia emerged from its lockdown without a major outbreak, the prime minister, Ana Brnabi\u0107, recommended the event could take place after all. \u201cWe expect the (health) situation to be completely calm by August,\u201d she said Thursday. Organisers of the festival, which drew 200,000 people last year, welcomed the \u201cexcellent news\u201d and said there could be changes to the format of the event, whose exact dates are still not confirmed. \u201cIf necessary, we are ready to substantially reduce the number of visitors and limit ourselves to the local and regional public,\u201d they said in a statement. Exit, now in its 20th year, was born out of the student movement that opposed the former leader Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, who was overthrown in 2000 by mass protests. This year, headliners were expected to include David Guetta, Tyga and Fatboy Slim. The UK has reported 351 more deaths from Covid-19, taking the total number of deaths in Europe\u2019s worst-affected country to 36,393. According to the health department, out of 80,297 people tested on 21 May, 3,287 were diagnosed with the coronavirus. So far the UK has recorded 254,195 confirmed cases. Read more about the coronavirus situation in the UK on our dedicated live blog. A little over a month ago, health experts were saying Japan risked becoming one of the world\u2019s coronavirus \u201cdisaster zones\u201d, writes Justin McCurry, the Guardian\u2019s Tokyo correspondent. Its government was already facing criticism over its decision to quarantine passengers and crew onboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner, and had been accused of underplaying the Covid-19 threat while it clung to the increasingly faint hope of hosting the Olympics this summer. Japan was testing too few people, critics said, opting instead to focus on clusters of cases rather than overburden its healthcare system with patients displaying no or only mild symptoms who, by law, had to be admitted to hospital. One of the world\u2019s richest countries was bungling its response, critics said. But today, Japan can make a strong case for being another coronavirus success story, albeit one that has failed to resonate globally in the same way as those in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Fifty-two more people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Kenya, out of a total of 2,567 samples analysed over the past 24 hours, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. Kenya has so far reported 1,161 confirmed cases of coronavirus, of which 50 patients have died and 380 have recovered. Saudi Arabia has reported 2,642 new cases of coronavirus, taking the total number of confirmed cases in the kingdom to 67,719. However, in the same update the country reported that even more people had recovered from their infections, with 2,963 more given the all clear taking its total number of recoveries to 39,003. So far 364 Saudis have died from Covid-19. White flags first began to appear on the streets of Guatemala City in early April, writes Jeff Abbott from the Guatemalan capital. Since then, flags have become common across the country, with an entire lexicon of need reflected in their colours: white means hunger; red means medicine is needed; black, yellow, or blue means that a woman, child or elderly person is in danger of violence. Guatemala has reported 45 coronavirus deaths and 2,265 infections. But the economic fallout of the pandemic has affected millions. Measures imposed by the government of President Alejandro Giammattei to slow the spread of the virus \u2013 including suspension of public transportation and daily curfews \u2013 have hit those living in poverty the hardest. \u201cIt is another sign of a society that lacks social services and that does not have a labour market that permits people to have savings to confront the crisis,\u201d said Jonathan Menkos, the executive director of the Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies. \u201c[The white flags] are the most clear evidence that the social and economic model leaves most people behind. They cannot go one month without resources to eat.\u201d A senior official in the South African government has told MPs that it is time to reopen the country\u2019s economy, in spite of dire predictions of the potential scale of the coronavirus outbreak. Lionel October, the director-general of the department of trade, told a parliamentary committee that the government was finalising consultations on how to reopen industries and get the country back to work, China\u2019s official news agency Xinhua reported. Xinhua quoted October as saying that a large part of the economy was expected to reopen next month, as South Africa moves to level three of the lockdown, which was first imposed on 27 March and was eased slightly at the beginning of May. His comments came despite dire warnings by statisticians hired by the government that in a worst case scenario 50,000 South Africans could die from Covid-19. Unions in Italy have accused a US multinational of breaking the law after it sacked 190 workers in Naples during the coronavirus crisis, writes Lorenzo Tondo in Palermo. On Friday, unions and workers protested against the decision of Jabil, a company which spans numerous industries, including healthcare, life sciences, clean technology and has 100 plants in 28 countries, and 170,000 employees worldwide. Media in Italy reported that the company has announced that, from Monday, 190 workers at a plant in Marcianise would be laid off because of \u201cfalling production volumes and under-utilised resources\u201d. \u201cLeaving all those workers in the middle of the street during a pandemic is an intolerable and illegal decision,\u201d Rocco Palombella of the Uil union told the Italian newspaper la Repubblica. \u201cIt is an irresponsible attitude from the American company.\u201d Michele Madonna of the Fiom union said: \u201cCompanies do not stop even in the face of the pandemic drama. We are desperate.\u201d Italian unions allege that Jabil breached a government-imposed decree to deal that prohibits the layoffs until mid-August. The aim of the decree is to prevent the household finances of Italian families worsening during the coronavirus emergency. However, in a note reported by Corriere della Sera and Repubblica, Jabil said the decree had been respected because the layoffs in Marcianise were already planned in June 2019, more than eight months before 23 February cut-off point for layoff procedures to be suspended under the new law. The company also said it had done everything possible to help its workers and that it had \u201calso made available significant economic resources both for employees, as incentives to leave, and for the companies that will hire Jabil\u2019s employees, in support of their business plans\u201d. An editor has been jailed for two years in Myanmar after his news agency reported a coronavirus death that turned out to be incorrect, Agence France-Presse reports. Zaw Ye Htet, the chief editor of the Dae Pyaw news agency, was arrested on 13 April, the day he published an article that wrongly reported there had been a death due to the Covid-19 in eastern Karen state. He stood trial on 20 May. On Friday, his lawyer, Myint Thuzar Maw, told AFP: \u201cHe was sentenced under section 505(b) to two years in jail.\u201d Section 505(b) is a vaguely worded law, and often used against journalists and activists for making any statement that cause fear or alarm. \u201cWe\u2019ll appeal this unfair decision,\u201d Zaw Ye Htet\u2019s wife, Phyu Phyu Win, told AFP by phone. Myanmar has only 199 confirmed cases of coronavirus and six deaths, although the low numbers tested mean experts say the true figures are far higher. Children and young people could be half as likely to catch coronavirus than adults, a review of studies from around the world has suggested, PA Media reports. Researchers found the under-20s appeared to be 56% less likely of catching the virus. But the review of global test and tracing and population screening studies led University College London said evidence remained \u201cweak\u201d on how likely children were to transmit the virus to others. Researchers also concluded they did not have sufficient data to examine whether children under 12 differed to teenagers in terms of susceptibility to the virus. The research\u2019s lead author, Prof Russell Viner of the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, said it was the \u201cfirst comprehensive study\u201d to review what was and was not known about \u201csusceptibility and transmission\u201d among children. He said: Our findings show children and young people appear 56% less likely to contract Covid-19 from infected others. Susceptibility is a key part of the chain of infection, and this supports the view that children are likely to play a smaller role in transmitting the virus and proliferating the pandemic, although considerable uncertainty remains. This new data provides essential evidence to governments around the world to inform their decision-making on whether to reopen schools and reduce or end lockdown measures. Tanzania has defeated the coronavirus through the power of prayer, its president has said. John Magafuli made the claim after his country after his country\u2019s number of confirmed cases stayed the same for three weeks. Just over 500 cases have been reported in a country of nearly 60 million people. Meanwhile, Magafuli has led a crackdown on anyone who dares raise concerns about the virus\u2019s spread in Tanzania, or the government\u2019s response to it, the Associated Press reports. Critics have been arrested, and opposition politicians and rights activists say their phones are being tapped. However, on just one day this month, 50 Tanzanian truck drivers tested positive for the coronavirus after crossing into neighbouring Kenya. As many as 50,000 people in South Africa could die from Covid-19 by the end of the year, with up to 3 million infected, according to a worst-case scenario suggested by scientists and statisticians working for the health ministry. Despite a national lockdown slowing the spread of the virus, South Africa has already has the highest number of infections on the continent, with more than 18,000 identified cases and 339 deaths. Taking into account the southern hemisphere winter, the modelling by scientists suggests there could be between 35,000 and 50,000 Covid-19 deaths by November. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really crushed the curve,\u201d said one of the experts, Harry Moultrie, during a presentation shown on television, according to a Reuters report. \u201cWe also have some significant concerns that because of the focus on Covid-19, this may compromise other areas like HIV and TB.\u201d The models, which consider best and worst scenarios, suggest as many as 3 million coronavirus cases by November and demand for hospital beds peaking at 45,000, about 10 times the country\u2019s intensive care bed availability. Fighting has forced 660,000 people to flee their homes since the UN secretary general called for a global ceasefire to focus on handling the coronavirus pandemic, an NGO says. On Thursday, Antonio Guterres reiterated his call for an end to fighting, which he first issued on 23 March. But the Norwegian Refugee Council said that the UN\u2019s security council had failed to provide leadership for ceasefires, peace talks or protection of civilians during the pandemic. Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the NRC, said: While people are being displaced and killed, powerful members of the UN security council squabble like children in a sandbox. World leaders must rise to the occasion and jointly push parties to cease their fire and unite in protecting all communities from Covid-19. Now is not the time for kindergarten politics. According to NRC, the worst affected country was the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where 480,000 people have been forced to escape fighting between armed groups and the country\u2019s army. NRC also pointed to Yemen, where despite the Saudi-led coalition announcing it would implement a unilateral ceasefire, airstrikes have continued. Those attacks and other armed operations have resulted in the displacement of 24,000 people. Fifty more people have died from Covid-19 in Pakistan, the government reports, its third highest official daily death toll since the pandemic began. This brings the total number of coronavirus deaths in the country to 1,067. According to the latest update, out of 16,387 tests carried out in the past 24 hours, 2,603 people tested positive, taking the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 47,429. So far, 15,201 people have recovered. Sindh is the country\u2019s worst affected province, with 19,924 cases, followed by Punjab, with 18,455. The coronavirus is tearing through Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander communities in California, fanning longstanding health disparities and killing community members at a higher rate than any other racial group in the state, Mario Koran reports for the Guardian US from Oakland. Data from California\u2019s department of public health reveals that Pacific Islanders have contracted coronavirus at nearly twice the state\u2019s overall rate. As of 17 May, they have died from the virus at a rate 2.6 times higher than the state average \u2013 the highest death rate of any racial or ethnic group. The pattern extends beyond California. Oregon, Utah, Washington and Arkansas \u2013 where many Marshallese work in meatpacking plants \u2013 have all seen similar trends. Public health experts have often said the group\u2019s relatively small size can skew the numbers, making percentages appear outsized. But to community members and advocates, that argument obfuscates a long history of overlooked needs and health disparities. Fifty-one people in Iran died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, as 2,311 more tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the health ministry. In his daily update, Kianoush Jahanpour, the health ministry\u2019s spokesman, said the total number of confirmed cases across the Islamic republic, scene of one of the earliest outbreaks outside China, had now reached 131,652, of whom 102,276 patients had subsequently been given the all-clear. The death toll now stands at 7,300 and 2,659 remain in a critical condition in hospital, Jahanpour said, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency. Iranian health authorities have so far carried out 763,913 tests for the virus. It would be hard to overstate the importance of developing a vaccine to Sars-CoV-2 \u2013 it\u2019s seen as the fast track to a return to normal life, writes Ian Sample, the Guardian\u2019s science editor. That\u2019s why the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the UK was \u201cthrowing everything at it\u201d. But while trials have been launched and manufacturing deals already signed \u2013 Oxford University is now recruiting 10,000 volunteers for the next phase of its research \u2013 ministers and their advisers have become noticeably more cautious in recent days. This is why. Africa is approaching 100,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the continent. In its daily update on Twitter, the WHO African region office reported that there were over 99,400 cases across the continent, about 4,500 more than on Thursday. The discrepancy over the number of recoveries - where the WHO reported 1,000 fewer recoveries on Thursday than on Wednesday - seems to have been cleared up. It is now saying that about 39,000 people infected with the virus have now been given the all clear. Just over 3,000 people in Africa have died. Tax revenues in Germany fell by a quarter last month, compared with a year earlier, as Europe\u2019s largest economy faced its most severe recession since the second world war. According to the finance ministry\u2019s monthly report, published on Friday, the central government and the 16 federal states pulled in about 39bn euros in April, 25.3% less than the same month in 2019, Reuters reported. The revenue decline was most severe for income, corporate and air traffic taxes, the report showed. The pandemic\u2019s impact on tax revenues were first visible in March but has now accelerated. Germany authorities imposed a strict lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus, closing most businesses and limiting people\u2019s movement outside their homes. The finance minister, Olaf Scholz, said earlier this month that the plunge in tax revenues will not stop the government from presenting a stimulus package next month to help companies recover from the coronavirus crisis. Meanwhile, the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus increased by 460 to 177,212, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Friday. The reported death toll rose by 27 to 8174, the tally showed. Hi, this is Damien Gayle taking over the blog now, bringing you the latest in coronavirus-related news from around the world.

Summary Here\u2019s an outline of some of the key global coronavirus updates so far this morning. Pictures have emerged of Donald Trump wearing a face mask during a visit in Michigan. The US president had previously been called a \u201cpetulant child\u201d by a state attorney general for allegedly refusing to wear the covering during a tour of the Ford plant. India has reported 6,000 new cases in its biggest one-day rise since the outbreak started. The country has also reported over 118,000 confirmed cases \u2013 around a 5% increase from yesterday. Coronavirus cases in war-torn Yemen are believed to be \u201cwidespread\u201d, while its health system has \u201cin effect collapsed\u201d. A UN spokesman said on Friday that the reported total of 184 cases in the country is also \u201calmost certainly much higher\u201d. Hong Kong activists have called for citizens to rise up against Bejing\u2019s plans to impose national security legislation in the financial hub. Many believe the plans have reignited the anti-government movement that had lost its focus and dwindled amid the coronavirus pandemic. Indonesia has reported 973 new infections \u2013 its highest number of daily coronavirus cases \u2013 bringing the country\u2019s total cases to 20,162. The figures come as millions of people in the world\u2019s fourth most populous country mark the festival of Eid al-Fitr without the usual celebrations. The leader of New Zealand\u2019s main opposition party has been ousted after opinion polls showed Jacinda Ardern\u2019s soaring popularity. Around 84% of New Zealanders approve of the prime minister\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, which has helped to boost her ratings ahead of a general election in September. The transmission of coronavirus is believed to be \u201calready widespread\u201d in Yemen, the UN has said. Aid agencies have said the country is \u201creally on the brink right now\u201d and that its health system \u201chas in effect collapsed\u201d according to a spokesman. During a Geneva briefing, Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said: \u201cThey are talking about having to turn people away because they do not have enough (medical) oxygen, they do not have enough personal protective equipment.\u201d \u201cThe actual incidence is almost certainly much higher,\u201d Laerke said. Authorities in Yemen have reported just 184 cases including 30 deaths from the virus to the World Health Organisation. The UN has estimated that it will need to seek $2bn to maintain aid programmes in the country until the end of the year. Amazon is to hire 50,000 temporary workers in India to meet a surge in online shopping in the country amid a national coronavirus lockdown. Although online outlets faced a massive disruption to operations in the first days of lockdown, an easing of restrictions has allowed many to resume business as usual. \u201cWe want to continue helping customers all over India get everything they need so they can continue to practice social distancing,\u201d Amazon senior executive Akhil Saxena said in a statement on the company\u2019s blog. \u201c[The move] will also keep as many people as possible working during this pandemic while providing a safe work environment for them.\u201d Amazon said the temporary workers will be recruited to its \u201cfulfillment centres\u201d and as part of its delivery network. The announcement comes at a time when many companies in India have cut jobs as they try to tide over the financial impact of the health crisis. The Afghan health minister asked the waring sides to don\u2019t shelter inside medical centres as number of confirmed coronavirus cases has passed 9,000 and Kabul recorded its third worst day of the crisis straight. Ferozuddin Feroz, the country\u2019s health minister has asked the militant groups, Afghan government and international forces to don\u2019t use medical centres as shelter. \u201cOur medical centres are servicing all sides, so I ask to don\u2019t use medical centres as shelter\u201d Feroz said on Friday. War has been intensified across the country as the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, in response to an attack on a maternity hospital last week, ordered a resumption of a full offensive against the Taliban and other militant groups, ending a period of reduced military activity ahead of US-brokered peace talks that had been expected to start this year. Feroz also ask the nation to avoid Eid gatherings. He warned that if people continue to break lockdown rules, the number of transmission will continue to surge across the country as despite governmen authorised lockdown in several provinces, streets are still crowded. On Thursday the ministry said it has run out of hospital beds for Covid-19 patients. \u201cThe hospitals which had empty beds until 10 days ago and we were sending patients to, are paked, with no more beds. We should launch more hospital immediately\u201d Wahid Majroh, deputy health minister said. Meanwhile, number of confirmed cases has passed 9,000 as more than half of tests done in a 24-hour period come back positive across the country and Kabul recorded its third worst day of the crisis straight. Health ministry tested 1,060 suspected patients of which 542 came back positive in last 24 hours, 12 deaths of Covid-19 have also been recorded, pushing the total number of infections to 9,216 and death toll to 205. There have so far been 993 recoveries. Capital Kabul recorded 316 new cases out of 609 tests, four patients also died of Covid-19 in Kabul in last 24 hours. Total number of confirmed cases in Afghanistan\u2019s worst affected area stands at 3,083 with 29 deaths. Concerns are high in Afghanistan as Eid Al-Fitr is scheduled for end of this. \u201cDo stay at home during Eid and don\u2019t make the happiness of Eid to grief\u201d Majroh told the nation Thursday. \u201cIf you have doubt about the virus, just go and stay an hour in front a coronavirus hospital and look at the number of patients entering the hospital and deads bodies coming out of that\u201d In case you missed this earlier, here\u2019s a video of Donald Trump telling reporters at a Michigan Ford plant on Thursday that he had worn a mask during part of a tour. The US president\u2019s decision to appear without a protective mask during part of the visit drew the ire of the state attorney general, Dana Nessel, who told CNN: \u201cThe president is like a petulant child\u201d. Nessel had previously written to the White House to insist it is the \u201claw that everyone in the state\u201d should wear a mask. A photograph posted by NBC to social media appears to show the president wearing a face covering during his tour of the plant in Ypsilanti, which has been producing ventilators and PPE during the coronavirus outbreak, but he was not wearing a mask when he spoke to reporters. Trump said: \u201cI had one on before. I wore one in the back area. I didn\u2019t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.\u201d Cases of coronavirus in Singapore have surpassed 30,000 as the city-state continues to report hundreds of new infections in cramped migrant worker dormitories. On Friday, the lowly-paid workers represented the vast majority of the 612 new cases. Total cases in Singapore, which has one of the highest daily infection rates in Asia, now stand at 30,426. Pictures of Donald Trump wearing a face mask while on a visit in Michigan have emerged. In a photo since published by both Sky News and NBC, the US president can be seen wearing a navy blue mask. The images emerged after Trump was called a \u201cpetulant child\u201d by a state attorney general for allegedly refusing to wear the covering during a tour of a plant belonging to the Ford car company. Surrounded by Ford executives who were wearing masks, Trump told reporters he had put one on earlier in the visit. \u201cI had one on before. I wore one in the back area. I didn\u2019t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,\u201d he said. Russia has reported a record daily rise in coronavirus fatalities of 150 in the past 24 hours, taking the country\u2019s nationwide death toll to 3,249. The country\u2019s coronavirus response centre also reported 8,894 new infections, bringing the total number of cases to 326,448. The leader of New Zealand\u2019s main opposition party has been ousted after opinion polls showed prime minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s soaring popularity over her handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Simon Bridges was replaced by Todd Muller in an emergency caucus meeting of his centre-right National Party following a week of disastrous poll results. A general election is set to take place in the country in September. According to Thursday\u2019s poll, just 5% of New Zealanders supported Bridges, 43, as the country\u2019s leader, while support for his party simultaneously fell to the lowest in decades. The same poll revealed Ardern, 39, had the support of 63% of the electorate. Her popularity has risen substantially in recent weeks, with around 84% of people in New Zealand approving of the government\u2019s handling of the crisis. More on China\u2019s plans to impose national security legislation in Hong Kong. The chief executive of the global financial hub, Carrie Lam, has said the legislation would not affect its judicial independence or that of its legal entities. Reuters has reported that Lam said Beijing\u2019s intention was to tackle illegal activities that the government believed had damaged national security. The Hong Kong correspondent for the AFP news agency has posted a statement from Lam on Twitter. India has reported 6,000 new cases of the coronavirus, the country\u2019s biggest 24-hour rise since the pandemic began. Figures on the new infections come as New Delhi eases the nationwide lockdown and some domestic flights resume. On Friday, India reported over 118,000 confirmed cases \u2013 roughly a 5% increase from Thursday. A total of 3,853 people have died after contracting the virus. Although the current lockdown, which began on March 25, has been extended to May 31 by prime minister Narendra Modi, rules have been relaxed in areas with lower case numbers. State governments are also allowed to issue their own guidance on some matters. Thailand is to maintain its state of emergency over the coronavirus until the end of June. The country\u2019s Covid-19 taskforce said on Friday that the measure would be kept in place to keep infections under control as the government prepares to ease restrictions further in early June. Last weekend, shopping malls and department stores reopened after almost two months of closure. But despite the slowing of cases, bars, nightclubs, cinemas, playgrounds and some sports are still off-limits. \u201cThe reason for extending the emergency decree for one more month is health security, enabling a unified and continued operation by officials in a pandemic situation that has not been resolved,\u201d said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the government\u2019s Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA). The extension is subject to Cabinet approval on Tuesday. Australia has almost halved the number of people it will support with its wage subsidy scheme during the pandemic. The revision, which will save the government around $60bn (Australian dollars), comes as the Treasury said successful efforts to control the outbreak and errors on subsidy applications meant only 3.5 million people will need to be covered. In May, the government said it would spend $130bn to subsidise the wages of around 6 million people until September as social distancing restrictions forced hundreds of thousands out of work. The impact on the public purse from the programme will not be as great as initially estimated,\u201d Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a statement. The revision to the scheme, which is now expected to cost $70bn, comes hours after Fitch Ratings downgraded its outlook on Australia\u2019s coveted \u2018AAA\u2019 rating to \u201cnegative\u201d from \u201cstable\u201d, citing the hit to the country\u2019s economy and public finances from the COVID-19 pandemic. Hong Kong activists have called for people to rise up against Beijing\u2019s plans to impose national security legislation in the city, saying that the new laws could erode its freedoms through \u201cforce and fear\u201d. A proposed march at noon on Friday in the central financial district did not materialise after the online calls drew the attention of only a handful of activists and as riot police made their presence visible on the streets. But new calls have emerged for flash mobs at night across the territory, with activists planning to meet the press to announce \u201cstreet action\u201d later today. \u201cThis is a great moment to reboot the protest,\u201d university student Kay, 24, told Reuters. She participated in last year\u2019s often violent anti-government and anti-Beijing protests which have since entered a lull due to the coronavirus. I\u2019m Amy Walker.

Bulgaria, which has started to ease its lockdown, has scrapped a ban on the entry of visitors from the European Union and Schengen visa zone countries, the health ministry said in a statement late on Thursday. In mid-March European Union member Bulgaria banned entry to its territory to travellers from many countries in an attempt to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. The health ministry said that the lifting of the ban also covers San Marino, Andorra, Monaco and Vatican City. The ministry said that people arriving in Bulgaria would continue to spend 14 days in quarantine. But the 14-day period will no longer apply to Bulgarian citizens and citizens of other EU countries who are travelling for humanitarian reasons and those who are \u201crepresentatives of the trade, economic and investment activities\u201d. The quarantine will also not apply to people directly related to construction, maintenance, operations, and ensuring the safety of the strategic and critical infrastructure of Bulgaria, the ministry said. Here\u2019s a brief look at some of the UK newspaper front pages. The Guardian splashes on No 10\u2019s u-turn on the surcharge on foreign National Health Service workers. The Times splash is: \u201cImmunity forms planned for coronavirus survivors\u201d. And the Telegraph splashes on police spot checks to enforce quarantine. The Mail asks if the 10 million antibody tests from next week and a swab test with results in 20 minutes could be the \u201cbiggest virus hope we\u2019ve had?\u201d And the FT says China risks reigniting Hong Kong protests by imposing security laws. In case you missed this earlier, China has abandoned a GDP target for first time in decades the amid \u201cgreat uncertainty\u201d of virus. Chinese premier Li Keqiang told the opening of the National People\u2019s Congress in Beijing on Friday: \u201cWe have not set a specific target for economic growth this year. This is because our country will face some factors that are difficult to predict in its development due to the great uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 pandemic and the world economic and trade environment.\u201d You can see our full report from Helen Davidson and Lily Kuo below. Our global report today looks at the growing number of cases in the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation, Indonesia. Rebecca Ratcliffe writes: Indonesia has reported its highest number of daily coronavirus cases as millions of people in the world\u2019s fourth most populous country prepared to mark the festival of Eid al-Fitr without the usual celebrations and gatherings. This year\u2019s festivities will be dampened by the economic hardship for many as Indonesian migrant workers, who usually send money back home to their families, have been left stranded and with no income. Indonesian president Joko Widodo has banned people travelling home to their families for the holiday, though thousands have reportedly made the journey this week, despite fears that this could prompt further rises in transmission. Officials said the virus has been spreading at its fastest rate over the past nine days, due in part to a worsening outbreak in East Java. On Thursday, the country reported 973 new infections, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 20,162. The authorities have asked the military and the police to prevent arrivals in Jakarta until a full reopening of the capital is permitted. You can see the full story on the link below: If you are just joining the blog, here\u2019s a summary of the key events so far: Global infections have passed 5.1 million, deaths pass 332,000: Global cases stand at 5,102,573, with deaths reported at 332,924, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. Deaths in the US, stand at 94,702. The UK\u2019s death toll is 36,124, with 252,246 infections China has not set a GDP target in due to \u201cgreat uncertainty\u201d: Beijing has taken the rate step of not setting a GDP target for the first time since it began publishing such goals in 1990. Instead, given \u201cgreat uncertainty\u201d caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, China will \u201cgive priority to stabilising employment and ensuring living standards\u201d, Premier Li Keqiang told the opening of the National People\u2019s Congress. He also said governments at all levels should \u201ctighten their belts\u201d, and that all types of surplus, idle and carryover funds will be withdrawn and re-allocated, to be put to better use. China reported four new cases of Covid-19 on Friday. Trump didn\u2019t wear mask at factory visit and has pushed for churches to open: The president toured a Ford plant in the battleground state of Michigan, without wearing a face mask in front of TV cameras. The plant had been recast to produce ventilators and personal protective equipment. On Tuesday Ford said its policy was that all visitors must wear face masks. Trump told reporters he had put one on out of the view of cameras: \u201cI had one on before. I wore one in the back area. I didn\u2019t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,\u201d he said. Earlier Trump said there would be an announcement \u201cvery soon\u201d on reopening churches to the public. Brazil has passed 20,000 deaths: Latin America\u2019s biggest country passed the grim milestone with a record one-day death toll of 1,188, taking the confirmed total to 20,047. The country has 310,087 infections, third behind the US (1,577,287) and Russia (317,554). President Bolsonaro, a long-running advocate of malaria drug chloroquine to treat Covid-19, said on Thursday he knew there was no proof it works, but said there are cases in which it appears to have been successful. Russia\u2019s industrial output dropped 6.5% in April: The country\u2019s economic performance was hit by the coronavirus lockdown. The state statistics agency said \u201cconsumer demand fell for a range of goods and services\u201d. Russia\u2019s commodities sector only decreased by 3.2% year-on-year, and oil production actually grew by 0.2%. Pharmaceutical industries grew by 13.5%, year-on-year. Indonesia has had its biggest one day jump in cases: The world\u2019s fourth most populous country reported 973 new infections on Thursday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 20,162. The authorities have asked the military and the police to prevent arrivals in Jakarta. South Korea has reported 20 new cases: The new coronavirus cases came as health authorities worked to contain the cluster connected to Seoul nightclubs. South Korea has had a total of 11,142 infections and 264 deaths. Australian\u2019s most populous state eased restrictions further: New South Wales has announced cafes and restaurants will be allowed to have up to 50 patrons from 1 June, up from 10 currently allowed. Australia has had remarkable success in flattening the curve of infections from the coronavirus. The country of 25m has recorded 101 deaths and just over 7,000 cases. The country is consistently recording fewer than 20 new cases a day. Tributes have flowed for the former White House butler who died from Covid-19: Wilson Jerman, who has died from Covid-19, aged 91, was a fixture in the White House under 11 presidents. Jerman started working as a cleaner under Dwight Eisenhower and retired as an elevator operator during the presidency of Barack Obama. Michelle Obama said: \u201cWith his kindness and care, Wilson Jerman helped make the White House a home for decades of first families, including ours.\u201d South Korea reported has 20 more cases of the new coronavirus, as health authorities work to contain the cluster connected to Seoul nightclubs. South Korea has had a total of 11,142 infections and 264 deaths. The war of words between China and the US has continued, with Chinese State media telling US senators who are pushing for sanctions in response to Beijing\u2019s new national security laws for Hong Kong. The Global Times says the Chinese public is \u201coutraged\u201d by the senator\u2019s calls, and will continue to \u201cdefend its sovereignty as HK has always been part of China\u201d. It\u2019s hard to escape the escalating rhetoric between these two world superpowers on several fronts. While the Hong Kong story dominates China coverage, the country reported four newly diagnosed cases of Covid-19 on Friday, including two imported cases (both in Sichuan) and two local cases (both in Jilin). Australian state of New South Wales announces easing of restrictions The leader of Australia\u2019s most populous state has announced that restrictions imposed to slow the spread of coronavirus will be eased to allow cafes and restaurants to have up to 50 patrons from 1 June. The premier of the state of New South Wales (NSW), Gladys Berejiklian, said the easing of restrictions, which currently limit restaurants and cafes to 10 patrons, was needed to revive the local economy. \u201cLosing 221,000 jobs in April was a disaster. We don\u2019t want to see that continue,\u201d Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney. Australia\u2019s hospitality industry has been one of the hardest hit by social distancing restrictions imposed in March to slow the spread of coronavirus. Nationally, nearly 600,000 people were in April forced out of work by the restrictions. Berejiklian said that restrictions would still be in place, including limits of 10 people for single bookings, enforced social distancing between tables, no mingling of patrons, and customers at pubs required to sit at tables. Australia has had remarkable success in flattening the curve of infections from the coronavirus. The country of 25m has recorded 101 deaths and just over 7,000 cases. The country is consistently recording fewer than 20 new cases a day. We need geeks, not James Bonds, for post-Covid world, says French spy chief Among those imagining a new world post-coronavirus is the technical director of the French secret service, who has said the DGSE wants to recruit geeks rather than budding young James Bonds. In rare public comments, Patrick Pailloux said there was a danger that many young tech-savvy French people did not consider themselves suitable for the stereotypes of France\u2019s directorate-general for external security (DGSE), but that needed to change as France adapts to new demands in the post-coronavirus world. \u201cWe need people who are very connected to new technologies \u2013 thus young people,\u201d Pailloux told Agence France-Presse. \u201cWe have to bring them into the DGSE, it\u2019s essential.\u201d After weeks of insisting the Washington DC area is not ready to end restrictions, the mayor, Muriel Bowser, has said the numbers are pointing to the start of a gradual reopening process at the end of the month. Bowser has set Friday, 29 May, as a potential start date for phase 1 of the District of Columbia\u2019s proposed three-phase reopening plan. That includes restaurants allowing outdoor seating, non-essential businesses offering curb-side pickup and hair salons and barbers operating by appointment at limited capacity. Bowser emphasised the gradual nature of the process and warned residents not to expect the lives they had in February to return in full any time soon. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear on what this is and what this isn\u2019t,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cThis is not an on-off switch.\u201d Bowser had previously set the nations capital on a timeline that would have it beginning to reopen on June 8 at the earliest. That\u2019s later than most jurisdictions around the country and a stark contrast to the sense of urgency to reopen coming from the White House. While we\u2019re on China, there have also been some significant announcements coming out of the Congress about Hong Kong. China\u2019s proposed new legislation for Hong Kong requires the territory to quickly finish enacting national security regulations under its mini-constitution, the Basic law, according to a draft of the legislation seen by Reuters. China\u2019s parliamentary vice chairman, Wang Chen, was scheduled to give a speech explaining the new law later on Friday. According to the legislation, China\u2019s parliament empowers itself to set up the legal framework and implementation mechanism to prevent and punish subversion, terrorism, separatism and foreign interference, \u201cor any acts that severely endanger national security\u201d. Reuters China Breaking News Editor, Vincent Lee, gives his view on the day\u2019s events so far. More on the announcements coming out of China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress. Ahead of the meeting, which is largely rubber-stamp parliament, China\u2019s top leaders promised to step up stimulus to bolster the virus-ravaged economy amid rising worries that job losses could threaten social stability. In addition to targeting a 2020 budget deficit of at least 3.6% of GDP, above last year\u2019s 2.8%, and fixed the quota on local-government special bond issuance at 3.75 trillion yuan ($527 billion), up from 2.15 trillion yuan, China will also issue 1 trillion yuan in special treasury bonds for the first time this year. Local government bonds could be mainly used to fund infrastructure projects, while special treasury bonds could be used to support firms and regions hit by the coronavirus outbreak, for subsidies to spur consumption or for boosting the capital structure of small banks, analysts say. China has taken the rare move of not setting an annual GDP target this year after the coronavirus battered the world\u2019s second-largest economy and ravaged global growth, Premier Li Keqiang said on Friday. It is the first time that China has not set target since the government began publishing such goals in 1990. Instead, given \u201cgreat uncertainty\u201d caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, Beijing will \u201cgive priority to stabilising employment and ensuring living standards\u201d, Li told the opening of the National People\u2019s Congress. He also announced that China\u2019s fiscal deficit was expected to be over 3.6% of gross domestic product this year, with a deficit increase of one trillion yuan ($140bn) over last year. Another one trillion yuan of government bonds will be issued for Covid-19 control, he added, calling these \u201cextraordinary measures for an unusual time\u201d. He also said governments at all levels should \u201ctighten their belts\u201d, and that all types of surplus, idle and carryover funds will be withdrawn and re-allocated, to be put to better use. It is the first time since 1990 officials have decided not to issue a numerical growth target, which is typically seen as a signal of the resources leaders are willing to spend to shore up the economy. China\u2019s economy contracted 6.8% in the first quarter, compared to a year earlier. At the annual meeting, Li said China would work with the US to implement phase one of the trade deal, which was struck before the pandemic was declared. He said China would safeguard multilateral trade and advance free-trade agreement talks with Japan and South Korea. Li also reiterated China\u2019s policy on Taiwan, which has been the subject of discussion this week due to Taiwan being excluded from the World Health Assembly. Li said Beijing will firmly safeguard China\u2019s sovereignty, security and development interests, and would encourage Taiwan\u2019s people to oppose independence for Taiwan. Tributes from former first families have rolled in after the death from Covid-19 of Wilson Jerman, a former White House butler who was a fixture in Washington under 11 presidents. Jerman, who was 91, started working as a cleaner under Dwight Eisenhower and retired as an elevator operator during the presidency of Barack Obama. \u201cWith his kindness and care, Wilson Jerman helped make the White House a home for decades of first families, including ours,\u201d said Michelle Obama. \u201cHis service to others his willingness to go above and beyond for the country he loved and all those whose lives he touched is a legacy worthy of his generous spirit.\u201d Jerman became a White House butler under John Kennedy, a role that JFK\u2019s wife, Jackie, was instrumental in landing for him, his oldest granddaughter, Jamila Garrett, told the local Fox news channel in Washington. \u201cJerman served as a White House butler across 11 presidencies and made generations of first families feel at home, including ours,\u201d wrote Hillary Clinton. \u201cOur warmest condolences to his loved ones.\u201d Consumer prices in Japan fell for the first time in more than three years last month, official data shows, dragged down by the coronavirus pandemic and collapsing oil prices. Core prices in April, excluding volatile fresh food, slipped 0.2%t from a year earlier, reversing a rise of 0.4 % in March, according to the internal affairs ministry. It was the first drop in 40 months, the ministry said, and larger than a 0.1% drop predicted by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Month-on-month, prices fell 0.5 % following a drop of 0.1% in March. Government data on Monday showed Japan had dived into its first recession since 2015 in the first quarter of the year and some economists warned the worst was yet to come. Australia is seeking an exemption from a requirement that travellers arriving in the UK quarantine for 14 days to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The British government is planning a 14-day quarantine for most people arriving in the country in the coming weeks to try to prevent a second peak of the pandemic, with details to be finalised next month. Heathrow Airport has proposed Britain should set up \u201ctravel bubbles\u201d with low-risk countries exempt from the requirement. \u201cAustralia has led the world in the successful containment of Covid-19, which clearly means that travellers coming from Australia would pose a low risk to the rest of the world,\u201d the trade minister, Simon Birmingham said in a statement. Birmingham said Australia has no plans to open its borders to non-citizens, while all returning locals will still have to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival. Australia has recorded just over 7,000 cases, with 101 deaths. The country hopes to reopen the economy fully by July. And on a serious note on President Trump, he has just tweeted that he has asked for all flags on federal buildings and national monuments to fly at half mast for the next three days, honouring victims of the virus. And here he is explaining that he did wear a mask for some of the time at his visit to a Ford plant in Michigan, but he didn\u2019t wear it all the time because he didn\u2019t want to \u201cgive the press the pleasure of seeing it\u201d. President Trump\u2019s confusing statement today on his latest coronavirus test, has made it to Tiktok. The president said he had tested positively, in that he had tested negative. First the President\u2019s version...and then Sarah Cooper on Tiktok, whose videos lip-syncing Trump have been widely viewed. British PM, Boris Johnson, has instructed civil servants to make plans to end UK\u2019s reliance on China for vital medical supplies and other strategic imports in light of the coronavirus outbreak, The Times newspaper reported on Friday. The plans, which have been code named \u201cProject Defend\u201d, include identifying Britain\u2019s main economic vulnerabilities to potentially hostile foreign governments as part of a broader new approach to national security, the newspaper reported, adding that the efforts are being led by the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab. Italy\u2019s death toll from Covid-19 in March and April could be nearly 19,000 higher than the official figure of 32,000, the national social security agency said Thursday. The Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale (INPS), the largest social security and welfare institute in Italy, said in a new study that the official death figures were not \u201creliable\u201d. Its study showed that 156,429 total deaths were recorded in Italy in March and April, which is 46,909 higher than the average number of fatalities in those months recorded between 2015 and 2019. But only 27,938 deaths linked to coronavirus were reported during that period by the Civil Protection Agency, whose toll forms the basis of national statistics. That meant there were 18,971 more deaths than normal during this period, with the vast majority of 18,412 recorded in the coronavirus-ravaged north of the country. Still in Russia and the Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, was on Thursday reportedly being treated for coronavirus in Moscow according to Russian news agencies. The 43-year-old calls himself the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cfoot soldier\u201d but is widely thought to enjoy carte blanche from Moscow, which turns a blind eye to heavy-handed tactics in his North Caucasus fiefdom in exchange for loyalty. Russia\u2019s industrial output fell by 6.6% in April compared to the previous year, dampened by the country\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, the state statistics agency said Thursday. Russia imposed a \u201cnon-working\u201d period across the country at the end of April which \u201cserved as the decisive factor in lowering industrial output,\u201d Rosstat said in a statement. Industries were delivered a double blow as President Vladimir Putin ordered companies to stop work activities but continue paying salaries. At the same time, \u201cconsumer demand fell for a range of goods and services,\u201d the agency said. However it reported a surge in demand for some products, including food, household products and laptops, sought as people began telecommuting. Russia\u2019s commodities sector only decreased by 3.2% year-on-year, and oil production actually grew by 0.2%, the agency said, noting that for many of those companies ceasing activity was not possible. The Russian economy has already been battered by low prices of oil, a key export shaken by a price war with Saudi Arabia in March which sent the Russian ruble tumbling. Pharmaceutical industries showed growth of 13.5% year on year, while the automotive sector was the worst-hit, plummeting by 79.2%. Still on Brazil, and President Jair Bolsonaro, a long-running advocate of malaria drug chloroquine to treat Covid-19, said on Thursday he knew there was no proof it works, but said there are cases in which it appears to have been successful, Reuters reports. On Wednesday, Brazil\u2019s health ministry issued new guidelines for the wider use of anti-malarial drugs in mild coronavirus cases, in defiance of public health experts warning of possible health risks. The interim health minister, Eduardo Pazuello, an army general, authorised the use after two doctors left the ministry\u2019s top job under pressure to promote early use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The new guidelines suggested dosage for the anti-malarials along with the antibiotic azithromycin at the onset of symptoms. Patients or family members would have to sign a waiver recognising potential side effects. Brazil has had another terrible day with coronavirus figures passing the 20,000 Covid-19 deaths, as the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent, Tom Philips, reports: Brazil has just passed another grim coronavirus milestone, with more than 20,000 deaths from Covid-19 now officially confirmed here. On Thursday evening Brazil\u2019s health ministry announced a daily record of 1,188 deaths confirmed in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of officially recorded deaths to 20,047. Brazil also confirmed another 18,508 infections, taking the total number to 310,087. That is the third highest number in the world, after the US and Russia. Despite Brazil\u2019s rising death toll the country\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, continues to downplay the dangers of the coronavirus, which he has repeatedly dismissed as \u201ca bit of a cold\u201d and \u201ca little flu\u201d. On Thursday, just hours before the new death toll was announced, Bolsonaro claimed the pandemic\u2019s threat had been exaggerated with \u201ca great deal of propaganda\u201d. \u201cThis has brought dread to the heart of the Brazilian family,\u201d Bolsonaro complained. Sub-notification and low rates of testing mean the real number of infections and deaths are likely to be s It\u2019s been another controversial day in the US for President Trump, who visited a Ford plant in the crucial battle state of Michigan. Trump toured the Ford plant, which has been recast to produce ventilators and personal protective equipment, without wearing a face mask in front of TV cameras. This was despite Ford on Tuesday reiterating its policy that all visitors must wear them. Surrounded by Ford executives who were wearing masks, Trump told reporters he had put one on out of the view of cameras, \u201cI had one on before. I wore one in the back area. I didn\u2019t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,\u201d Trump said. When asked if Trump was told it was acceptable not to wear a mask in the plant, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford said, \u201cIt\u2019s up to him.\u201d \u201cHonestly I think I look better in a mask,\u201d Trump added jokingly. Trump has been highly critical of the state\u2019s Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer, who is seen as a potential vice presidential running mate for Joe Biden. On Thursday the president called for churches to reopen and said guidelines on that should be issued soon. Guardian US\u2019s Joanna Walters says it looks like the president is putting pressure on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue guidelines of some kind that will indicate it\u2019s okay to restart in-person services. Walters says Trump made an eyebrow-raising statement a little earlier when he told a gathering of African American leaders: \u201cWe are opening our churches again. I think the CDC is going to put something out very soon, spoke to them today. I think they are going to put something out very soon. We got to open our churches.\u201d The president said the guidance was expected today or tomorrow. \u201cI said you better put it out and they\u2019re doing it and they\u2019re going to be issuing something today or tomorrow and churches are going to get our churches open,\u201d Trump said. Leading federal public health officials have repeatedly urged caution about easing social distancing restrictions, warning it could cause a surge in coronavirus infections. You can read all of our US coverage on our US blog here. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s ongoing live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Donald Trump has promised that he is working on plans to allow churches to hold Sunday services again, and \u201cyou\u2019re going to see something come out very soon\u201d. He made his remarks at a Ford factory in Michigan, where he did not wear a mask, despite, the state\u2019s attorney general writing an open letter to him yesterday saying the president had \u201cnot only a legal responsibility, but also a social and moral responsibility\u201d to wear a mask during his tour. Trump has locked horns with Michigan\u2019s Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer, over the states lockdown rules and restrictions. In other coronavirus developments. Brazil\u2019s death toll from Covid-19 has passed 20,000, after a daily record of 1,188 deaths announced on Thursday. The country\u2019s surge in cases and fatalities comes despite President Bolsonaro\u2019s assertion that the virus was nothing more than \u201ca little flu\u201d. Russia\u2019s industrial output fell by 6.6% in April compared to the previous year, dampened by the country\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, according to the state statistics agency Rosstat. Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll in March and April could be nearly 19,000 higher than the official figure of 32,000, the national social security agency said on Thursday. Indonesia recorded its biggest one-day jump in cases with 973 new infections. It now has the highest death toll in Asia outside China, at 1,278. Austria\u2019s hotels will reopen as planned on 29 May, chancellor Sebastian Kurz announced on Thursday. Puerto Rico will cautiously reopen beaches, restaurants, churches, malls and hair salons next week under strict new rules as the US territory emerges from a two-month lockdown that stifled business activity on an island already beset with economic woes. Half of Facebook\u2019s workforce could shift to permanent home working by the end of the decade, founder Mark Zuckerberg has revealed Let\u2019s get started.",

      "bodyText": "The head of the Morrison government commission tasked with coming up with plans to revitalise the economy after the coronavirus crisis, Nev Power, is to step aside from his position as deputy chairman of a gas company over conflict of interest concerns. \u201cBecause of the perceptions of conflict of interest he has stepped back from participating in board meetings and will not participate in the decisions of the board\u201d of Strike Energy, a spokesman for the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission said on Friday evening. The move came after Guardian Australia on Friday asked the NCCC how Power was managing his apparent conflict of interest as chairman of the commission and deputy chairman of Strike Energy, a West Australian company that is developing a gas field in the south-west of the state. Late on Friday evening Strike Energy, which is listed on the ASX, had yet to inform the market that Power had \u201cstepped back\u201d from his position. The leadership position of Power, a former chief executive of mining group Fortescue Metals, on the NCCC has raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest because the commission has heavily promoted gas development as a key way to boost economic growth after the coronavirus crisis. On Thursday, Guardian Australia revealed a leaked draft report by a taskforce advising the NCCC recommended Australian taxpayers underwrite a massive expansion of the domestic gas industry. The report, by a manufacturing taskforce headed by the former Dow Chemicals executive Andrew Liveris, suggested taxpayers should underwrite an increased national gas supply from multiple new fields and help build multibillion-dollar interstate gas pipelines, and the states should introduce \u201creverse auction\u201d subsidy schemes for gas-fired power. In addition to his position as deputy chairman of Strike Energy, Power also holds shares in the company worth more than $2.4m and holds options over shares that will become worth an additional $2.1m if the company\u2019s share price rises to 35c. Strike\u2019s share price rocketed more than 8% on Thursday after it announced it had struck a deal with another company enabling it to sell gas from its West Erregulla field. Australian Gas Infrastructure Group is to build a gas plant and a short pipeline connecting the field to the WA gas transmission network. Guardian Australia does not suggest that Power has acted inappropriately in his position. The Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick said the NCCC was a public body and had an obligation to be open and transparent, including about the connections of committee members and how they dealt with conflicts of interest. He said he had concerns about its decision-making process. \u201cWhen you ask a lawyer a question you get a legal answer, when you ask a doctor a question you get a medical answer and when you ask a gas executive a question you tend to get a gas answer,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a fear that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in this case.\u201d Patrick said just as it was important in legal matters that justice was not just done, but seen to be done, it was important that the NCCC was both independent and seen to be independent. \u201cThere is a perception of a conflict and that is problematic. One of the ways to address those concerns would be for the NCCC to open up its books to show alternatives [to gas] that were considered and enable people to see the cost-benefit analysis that\u2019s been done to test the ideas that are coming forward,\u201d he said. \u201cTransparency is a disinfectant.\u201d Richie Merzian, from the Australia Institute, said a growing perception of a conflict of interest was cause for concern. He called on the government to ask Power to give evidence at a Senate inquiry into the management of the coronavirus crisis. \u201cYou have gas executives handpicked by the prime minister\u2019s office charged with shaping the economic future of this country and talking about a gas-fired recovery,\u201d he said. \u201cA question that should be asked is whether the prime minister and cabinet should be stepping in before this becomes a serious political liability.\u201d Merzian said the lack of a transparent accountability framework meant the public could not tell if work had been done showing support for the gas industry was the best way to create jobs. He said an analysis by the institute had found the gas sector was the worst option you could choose for mass job creation. \u201cYou can invest in any other sector and create more jobs,\u201d he said. The NCCC\u2019s spokesman said the government deliberately chose as commission members \u201cactive business people \u2026 to bring a business perspective to the post Covid-19 recovery\u201d. He said the NCCC followed all governance protocols, including conflict of interest management, set down by the department it sits within, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. \u201cEach of the commissioners has made declarations to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet about their interests and those of their family members,\u201d he said. The spokesman said members declare conflicts at the beginning of every meeting and can \u201calso declare any potential conflicts, if and when they arise, to the chair or the CEO\u201d. \u201cWhere a potential conflict might arise, appropriate arrangements are in place, such as recusal of that member from specific deliberations.\u201d He said that while the commission gave advice, all final decisions would be made by the government.",

Preparations are under way for Eid al-Fitr on Sunday, a celebration marking the end of the fasting month of Ramadan, to be held under the shadow of the virus, with millions confined to their homes and others gripped by economic concerns during what is usually a festive time. The weekend marks a \u201ccritical moment\u201d for Indonesia, the world\u2019s biggest Muslim majority nation, said Doni Monardo, the head of the country\u2019s Covid-19 mitigation taskforce, after reports thousands were trying to evade the travel ban to reach their home towns for the festival.

Most restrictions have been lifted in Jerusalem, but the al-Aqsa mosque compound \u2013 the third-holiest site in Islam \u2013 will remain closed until after the three-day holiday. In Egypt, authorities have extended the nighttime curfew, which will now begin at 5pm instead of 9pm, and halted public transportation until 29 May. India\u2019s 172 million Muslims are also preparing for a subdued holiday, with large gatherings banned.

In some states, Indian Muslims have launched campaigns urging people to refrain from buying new clothes for the holiday and instead give to the needy. In Iran, which has endured the deadliest outbreak in the Middle East, authorities have imposed few restrictions ahead of the holiday aside from cancelling mass prayers in Tehran traditionally led by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iran has faced criticism for not imposing the kind of lockdown seen elsewhere in the region It has reported nearly 130,000 cases and more than 7,000 deaths, but the rate of new infections has declined in recent weeks. In Iraq, the government has allowed most businesses to reopen in the last few weeks but plans to reinstate a 24-hour curfew over the holiday.

Halfords\u2019 sales of hybrid bikes have doubled and demand for bikes via the government\u2019s Cycle to Work discount scheme has soared. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/17/i-can-just-glide-through-traffic-how-e-bikes-could-answer-our-commuting-problems\">Electric bike sales</a> have also accelerated as older people look for an alternative to public transport or a car.</p> <p>Stapleton said Halfords still had bikes available and stocks were improving, but as a result of \u201cunprecedented demand, which has been difficult to forecast\u201d the chain had sold out of some under-\u00a31,000 adult models, which meant \u201cthere is going to be short-term challenge with availability\u201d.</p> <p>He said Halfords had considered bringing in bikes by air, but this had proved too expensive, and the company was bringing in new stock from Turkey and Europe that could arrive faster than from its usual south-east Asian sources.</p> <p>Several cycle retailers said stocks of cheaper adult bikes from key brands, including Trek, Specialized and Raleigh, had virtually run out across the country.</p> <p>Kirsty Woodcock, head of UK marketing at Specialized, said there was no shortage of bikes, just delivery delaysas a result of the increased demand, and the company was working extra shifts at its UK warehouse to get more bikes out on the road.</p> <p>There are also concerns about supplies of some cycle parts as a result of the demand to repair older bikes.</p> <p>\u201cThere is most definitely a problem facing the trade at the moment and that\u2019s supply issues,\u201d said Paul Walker, owner of cycle parts and accessories distributor Hykeham Wholesale based in Lincoln.</p> <p>Walker said he was struggling to source enough inner tubes after sales of some types soared 600% last month, while sales of bike helmets were up more than fivefold and cycle repair kits up 400% as families prepared to get out on the road.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s gone absolutely crazy.

Cycling is being promoted worldwide as a way to get around with less risk of catching coronavirus.</p> <p>But cycle retailers are unsure if the frenzy of interest will be a blip that could be wiped out as supplies of bikes dwindle over the summer and drivers return to their cars.</p> <p>Hopes for lasting change in the UK got a boost when the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, unveiled a \u00a32bn package \u201cto put cycling and walking at the heart of our transport policy\u201d. Transport for London has also unveiled plans for cycle-only roads and bridges in the capital to help Londoners avoid public transport. </p> <p>The government has also said it will issue vouchers for hundreds of thousands of cycle repairs to help get an estimated 7m unused bicycles in the UK out of the shed. The Bicycle Association is hoping the UK will follow France\u2019s example with vouchers worth \u00a350 per person launching next month.</p> <p>Stapleton said he thought the cycle boom would not trickle away: \u201cI think some of this will continue.

Employees who sign up are given a voucher which they take down to their local bike shop and use it to buy their chosen bicycle, plus other items such as lights or clothing.</p> <p>The savings come through the fact that staff do not pay income tax or national insurance on the purchase price. In reality, your employer actually buys a bike for you, and you \u201chire\u201d it back making a monthly payments from your gross (pre-tax) salary \u2013 typically over four years. Basic rate taxpayers \u2013 earning less than \u00a350,000 a year \u2013 save a quarter on the bike and accessories\u2019 cost. Higher rate taxpayers save even more.</p> <p>Someone opting to buy a \u00a3500 commuting bike, a lock, a helmet and a waterproof jacket \u2013 spending \u00a3600 in total, would see their wages fall by around \u00a334 a month for a year. That assumes they earn \u00a330,000 a year. In total, they would save \u00a3150 over a normal purchase. A higher rate taxpayer would save \u00a3210 over the upfront \u00a3600 purchase.</p> <p>Originally, there was a \u00a31,000 limit on bike-scheme purchases, but this was scrapped to allow users to buy more expensive models.</p>",

In the past month, shares in Halfords, the UK\u2019s biggest cycle retailer, have shot up nearly 80%after the retail group said sales of bikes were double normal levels. Wiggle, the online cycling and running retailer that has become a big player in the UK market, said its bikes sales in the UK had increased by 192% since the start of lockdown. One independent retailer said his wholesale supplier had cleared its entire annual stock in four weeks. Graham Stapleton, the chief executive of Halfords, said the buyers were not the usual \u201cmamils\u201d \u2013 middle-aged men in lycra. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a big growth in the number of female customers,\u201d he said, \u201cand younger, under-35s buying bikes.\u201d For years most of the growth in the market has come from expensive road bikes favoured by those \u201cmamils\u201d, while sales of commuter and family bikes have been pedestrian. But in the past few weeks family and commuter-friendly hybrid bikes costing less than \u00a31,000 have been racing out of stores. Halfords\u2019 sales of hybrid bikes have doubled and demand for bikes via the government\u2019s Cycle to Work discount scheme has soared. Electric bike sales have also accelerated as older people look for an alternative to public transport or a car. Stapleton said Halfords still had bikes available and stocks were improving, but as a result of \u201cunprecedented demand, which has been difficult to forecast\u201d the chain had sold out of some under-\u00a31,000 adult models, which meant \u201cthere is going to be short-term challenge with availability\u201d. He said Halfords had considered bringing in bikes by air, but this had proved too expensive, and the company was bringing in new stock from Turkey and Europe that could arrive faster than from its usual south-east Asian sources. Several cycle retailers said stocks of cheaper adult bikes from key brands, including Trek, Specialized and Raleigh, had virtually run out across the country. Kirsty Woodcock, head of UK marketing at Specialized, said there was no shortage of bikes, just delivery delaysas a result of the increased demand, and the company was working extra shifts at its UK warehouse to get more bikes out on the road. There are also concerns about supplies of some cycle parts as a result of the demand to repair older bikes. \u201cThere is most definitely a problem facing the trade at the moment and that\u2019s supply issues,\u201d said Paul Walker, owner of cycle parts and accessories distributor Hykeham Wholesale based in Lincoln. Walker said he was struggling to source enough inner tubes after sales of some types soared 600% last month, while sales of bike helmets were up more than fivefold and cycle repair kits up 400% as families prepared to get out on the road. \u201cIt\u2019s gone absolutely crazy. I have done three months of sales in a month. It was really unexpected. It looks like this month will be similar \u2013 or it would be if I still had stocks to sell,\u201d said Walker. Weldtite, the Lincolnshire-based maker of cycle repair kits, is taking on 30% more staff and has set up temporary buildings to expand production as it struggles to cope with global demand. Cycling is being promoted worldwide as a way to get around with less risk of catching coronavirus. But cycle retailers are unsure if the frenzy of interest will be a blip that could be wiped out as supplies of bikes dwindle over the summer and drivers return to their cars. Hopes for lasting change in the UK got a boost when the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, unveiled a \u00a32bn package \u201cto put cycling and walking at the heart of our transport policy\u201d. Transport for London has also unveiled plans for cycle-only roads and bridges in the capital to help Londoners avoid public transport. The government has also said it will issue vouchers for hundreds of thousands of cycle repairs to help get an estimated 7m unused bicycles in the UK out of the shed. The Bicycle Association is hoping the UK will follow France\u2019s example with vouchers worth \u00a350 per person launching next month. Stapleton said he thought the cycle boom would not trickle away: \u201cI think some of this will continue. People need bikes to get to work because there isn\u2019t any other option.\u201d Cycle to work schemes Bike-to-work schemes are a popular way to buy a new bike, helmet and other accessories because they offer a saving of between 25% and 39%, with the cost simply deducted from an employee\u2019s monthly pay. Most companies of any size now offer this as a staff benefit. Employees who sign up are given a voucher which they take down to their local bike shop and use it to buy their chosen bicycle, plus other items such as lights or clothing. The savings come through the fact that staff do not pay income tax or national insurance on the purchase price. In reality, your employer actually buys a bike for you, and you \u201chire\u201d it back making a monthly payments from your gross (pre-tax) salary \u2013 typically over four years. Basic rate taxpayers \u2013 earning less than \u00a350,000 a year \u2013 save a quarter on the bike and accessories\u2019 cost. Higher rate taxpayers save even more. Someone opting to buy a \u00a3500 commuting bike, a lock, a helmet and a waterproof jacket \u2013 spending \u00a3600 in total, would see their wages fall by around \u00a334 a month for a year. That assumes they earn \u00a330,000 a year. In total, they would save \u00a3150 over a normal purchase. A higher rate taxpayer would save \u00a3210 over the upfront \u00a3600 purchase. Originally, there was a \u00a31,000 limit on bike-scheme purchases, but this was scrapped to allow users to buy more expensive models.",

This is my personal mission. That is why I went into politics.\u201d</p> <p>Winning her seat in a landslide, she is now part of a ruling coalition with a huge majority to push through any measures it chooses.</p> <p>The government\u2019s priority is to boost the economy after the Covid-19 crisis. South Korea has won praise around the world for its handling of the health pandemic, but its powerful industrial conglomerates have taken a big hit from the downturn in global trade.</p> <p>Many business leaders and veteran ministers want recovery to focus purely on digital technology. But civil society and lawmakers like Lee have persuaded the president that it is possible to create jobs and raise climate ambitions.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear the green new deal is the way for us to go,\u201d Moon <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2020/05/113_289851.html\">announced this week</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to lay out a grand plan for the green new deal to harmonise with the establishment of digital infrastructure.\u201d</p> <p>For the president, the priority is job creation and demonstrating to the world that South Korea is a responsible member of the international community.</p> <p>Recent history gives cause for scepticism. This high-tech nation has a low-grade energy supply. After the 2008-09 financial crisis, the government promised a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/21/south-korea-enviroment-carbon-emissions\">\u201cgreen growth\u201d strategy,</a> but the plans for more river protection and bike lanes were an excuse for construction companies to pour more concrete than ever.</p> <p>In the years since, coal use and carbon emissions have surged. The country is calculated to have $106bn of fossil fuel assets incompatible with the Paris climate agreement \u2013 more than any other nation. In 2016, activists described South Korea as the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://climateanalytics.org/latest/south-korea-leads-list-of-2016-climate-villains/\">biggest carbon villain</a>.</p> <p>Analysts say this time is different because the president has already set a goal of raising the share of electricity coming from renewables from 3% to 20% by the end of the decade. That will require an investment of about 100tn Korean won (\u00a366bn).</p> <p>Byunghwa Han, a senior analyst at Eugene Investment and Securities and a longtime advocate of renewables, said the political stars were now finally aligned.</p> <p>\u201cI am very optimistic. This is the best opportunity in Korea since I have been involved in this field since 2008,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government is very ambitious about the green new deal and, with a strong majority in the national assembly, the president can enact policies with no roadblocks.\u201d</p> <p>Lee vowed to prevent a repeat of the last greenwashing project. \u201cToday is totally different. In our green new deal, the starting point is the reduction of emissions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to legislate measures for a 2050 net zero goal, phase out coal earlier and enhance our ambitions for renewable energy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11a088fbca1c665add810011991fba0fca7887d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11a088fbca1c665add810011991fba0fca7887d9/0_85_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soyoung Lee announcing the Green New Deal manifesto at the press conference during the general election\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soyoung Lee announcing the Green New Deal manifesto at the press conference during the general election.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Office of Lee Soyoung</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The central test of the government\u2019s convictions will be cuts to domestic coal consumption and overseas financing of coal projects. South Korea plans to generate 30% of its electricity from this dirtiest of fossil fuels by 2030. Lee says this would make it impossible to reach the net zero goal by 2050.</p> <p>South Korea could make a still greater contribution to global climate efforts if it halted support for coal plants in south-east Asia. It is one of only three nations \u2013 along with China and Japan \u2013 that still provide loans for such projects, which are blackballed by most nations and a growing number of international financial institutions.</p> <p>\u201cIf we stop this funding, it will show the transition in our country and across the global community,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe need to give up on sectors that make short-term profit.\u201d</p> <p>The companies that have the most to lose, including the power utility Kepco and the heavy engineering conglomerate Doosan, are already pushing back. Local media report heated disputes among ministers, who say coal is important for developing nations.</p> <p>Lee argues South Korea will have more stranded assets the longer it delays transition away from fossil fuels. \u201cIt makes economic sense to change. These kinds of businesses will not be viable in the future.\u201d</p> <p>In the coming weeks, the green new deal will dominate discussions of the new session of the national assembly, another sign of how far the climate has moved up the political agenda.</p> <p>Lee credits the school strike movement for raising awareness. She has campaigned for decarbonisation for many years and worked as a lawyer on climate litigation suits, but she says there was little public support until recently.</p> <p>\u201cI was a minority in civil society, but the global school strikes sparked a lot of activism in Korea,\u201d she said. \u201cGreta [Thunberg] inspired Korean youth. Last October we had a climate emergency demonstration with 5,000 people. That was the biggest so far. There was also a big one in May. I join them them all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Her journey from the streets and the courtroom to the corridors of power is a sign of how Generation Greta is coming of age. Lee says there is still a long way to go.</p> <p>She estimates that just 10 of the 300 legislators are seriously committed to climate issues. \u201cIt is definitely still not mainstream,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the green new deal is now at the centre of political discussion for the first time. We need to see whether this means a sudden revolutionary change or the start of something incremental.</p> <p>\u201cI am not going to be over optimistic about securing a tremendous budget with huge goals. But it is important that the government is setting targets and moving in the right direction.There is a lot of value in that. We will do our best to make South Korea a model in this, as it has been in its handling of Covid.\u201d</p>",

She proposed a green new deal in the campaign manifesto as a way to appeal to young voters. \u201cI was the first to suggest that,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to decarbonise Korean society. This is my personal mission. That is why I went into politics.\u201d Winning her seat in a landslide, she is now part of a ruling coalition with a huge majority to push through any measures it chooses. The government\u2019s priority is to boost the economy after the Covid-19 crisis. South Korea has won praise around the world for its handling of the health pandemic, but its powerful industrial conglomerates have taken a big hit from the downturn in global trade. Many business leaders and veteran ministers want recovery to focus purely on digital technology. But civil society and lawmakers like Lee have persuaded the president that it is possible to create jobs and raise climate ambitions. \u201cIt\u2019s clear the green new deal is the way for us to go,\u201d Moon announced this week. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to lay out a grand plan for the green new deal to harmonise with the establishment of digital infrastructure.\u201d For the president, the priority is job creation and demonstrating to the world that South Korea is a responsible member of the international community. Recent history gives cause for scepticism. This high-tech nation has a low-grade energy supply. After the 2008-09 financial crisis, the government promised a \u201cgreen growth\u201d strategy, but the plans for more river protection and bike lanes were an excuse for construction companies to pour more concrete than ever. In the years since, coal use and carbon emissions have surged. The country is calculated to have $106bn of fossil fuel assets incompatible with the Paris climate agreement \u2013 more than any other nation. In 2016, activists described South Korea as the world\u2019s biggest carbon villain. Analysts say this time is different because the president has already set a goal of raising the share of electricity coming from renewables from 3% to 20% by the end of the decade. That will require an investment of about 100tn Korean won (\u00a366bn). Byunghwa Han, a senior analyst at Eugene Investment and Securities and a longtime advocate of renewables, said the political stars were now finally aligned. \u201cI am very optimistic. This is the best opportunity in Korea since I have been involved in this field since 2008,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government is very ambitious about the green new deal and, with a strong majority in the national assembly, the president can enact policies with no roadblocks.\u201d Lee vowed to prevent a repeat of the last greenwashing project. \u201cToday is totally different. In our green new deal, the starting point is the reduction of emissions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to legislate measures for a 2050 net zero goal, phase out coal earlier and enhance our ambitions for renewable energy.\u201d The central test of the government\u2019s convictions will be cuts to domestic coal consumption and overseas financing of coal projects. South Korea plans to generate 30% of its electricity from this dirtiest of fossil fuels by 2030. Lee says this would make it impossible to reach the net zero goal by 2050. South Korea could make a still greater contribution to global climate efforts if it halted support for coal plants in south-east Asia. It is one of only three nations \u2013 along with China and Japan \u2013 that still provide loans for such projects, which are blackballed by most nations and a growing number of international financial institutions. \u201cIf we stop this funding, it will show the transition in our country and across the global community,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe need to give up on sectors that make short-term profit.\u201d The companies that have the most to lose, including the power utility Kepco and the heavy engineering conglomerate Doosan, are already pushing back. Local media report heated disputes among ministers, who say coal is important for developing nations. Lee argues South Korea will have more stranded assets the longer it delays transition away from fossil fuels. \u201cIt makes economic sense to change. These kinds of businesses will not be viable in the future.\u201d In the coming weeks, the green new deal will dominate discussions of the new session of the national assembly, another sign of how far the climate has moved up the political agenda. Lee credits the school strike movement for raising awareness. She has campaigned for decarbonisation for many years and worked as a lawyer on climate litigation suits, but she says there was little public support until recently. \u201cI was a minority in civil society, but the global school strikes sparked a lot of activism in Korea,\u201d she said. \u201cGreta [Thunberg] inspired Korean youth. Last October we had a climate emergency demonstration with 5,000 people. That was the biggest so far. There was also a big one in May. I join them them all the time.\u201d Her journey from the streets and the courtroom to the corridors of power is a sign of how Generation Greta is coming of age. Lee says there is still a long way to go. She estimates that just 10 of the 300 legislators are seriously committed to climate issues. \u201cIt is definitely still not mainstream,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the green new deal is now at the centre of political discussion for the first time. We need to see whether this means a sudden revolutionary change or the start of something incremental. \u201cI am not going to be over optimistic about securing a tremendous budget with huge goals. But it is important that the government is setting targets and moving in the right direction.There is a lot of value in that. We will do our best to make South Korea a model in this, as it has been in its handling of Covid.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>After weeks stuck indoors, many of us have a very good idea of which bits of our home we would like to improve. Some have already been moving through their DIY to-do lists but with the bank holiday weekend here and restrictions on lockdown easing in parts of the UK, it is the perfect time to get going on a new project \u2013 big or small.</p> <p>Medina Grillo, an award-winning DIY and home improvement blogger at <a href=\"http://www.grillo-designs.com/\">grillo-designs.com</a>, says now is an opportunity to tackle projects you may have previously put off. \u201cDIY helps to structure your day a bit more and it keeps you from feeling too bored,\u201d she says. She has painted a small wall in her entrance hall, hung up a few pictures and waxed a coat rail over the past few weeks.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019ve DIYed something, it\u2019s sort of the same feeling you get after a good workout session. A sense of pride and achievement that you did that,\u201d she says. \u201cIn most cases it does save money as you won\u2019t need to hire a tradesperson or splash out on expensive furniture. You can upcycle or build your own homeware that is one-of-a-kind and customised to suit your style.\u201d</p> <p>DIY shops and hardware stores have been allowed to stay open throughout the lockdown \u2013 and they have been busy. Recently, Draper Tools, one of the large hand and power tool distributors, said it was experiencing strong demand in areas such as its painting and decorating products, where there had been a 20% increase.</p> <p>With spare cash at a premium, many of us will be looking for ways to do DIY on a budget. In normal times, borrowing tools, either from friends and family, or a local <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/24/library-of-things-borrowing-scheme-conquer-world\">library of things</a>, is a good way to cut costs. Some of these are still an option, if you are willing to clean and quarantine items before you use them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69aa430d9792ede5b693d1bad8c3aeb437a688c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69aa430d9792ede5b693d1bad8c3aeb437a688c6/22_262_7118_4271/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blogger Medina Grillo says DIY helps to structure your day a bit more.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blogger Medina Grillo says DIY helps to structure your day a bit more.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam Clarke/Kasia Fiszer Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Crystal Palace in London, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.libraryofthings.co.uk/\">library of </a><a href=\"https://www.libraryofthings.co.uk/\">things</a> this week started offering a contactless delivery service. DIYers can borrow a range of items including sanders, drills and pressure washers, which will be delivered to their door in a bag. Borrowing a <a href=\"https://www.libraryofthings.co.uk/catalogue/borrow-hedge-trimmer-cordless\">hedge trimmer</a>, for example, costs \u00a38 a day, with a minimum hire time of two days, and there is a \u00a31 membership fee when you make your first booking.</p> <p>Secondhand specialists such as eBay and Gumtree are another place to look for tools and materials. So, too, are neighbourhood forums and local WhatsApp groups \u2013 often people advertise things they are trying to get rid of and want nothing or very little for them. It is also worth posting in these groups if there is anything specific you want to borrow, as people often have tools sitting unused. Again, you will need to consider how to receive the items safely. The coronavirus can survive on surfaces, so ensure you are wearing protective gloves when touching products or leave them for 72 hours before you begin your DIY.</p> <p>If you are buying kit new, check the retailer\u2019s websites or give them a call before turning up at a store because demand has been high and lots of items have been out of stock. Most retailers are delivering \u2013 although the consumer group <a href=\"https://www.which.co.uk/news/2020/05/diy-shopping-during-lockdown-online-problems-and-new-diy-store-opening-times/\">Which? says it has heard from many shoppers</a> who have been hanging on for their purchases.</p> <p>There are plenty of jobs you can do that do not require a big outlay on specialist equipment. Kate Watson-Smyth, the founder of the blog Mad About The House and the author of 101 Interior Design Answers, says her top tip for those who do not want to pick up a power tool would be to paint. \u201cIt\u2019s transformative and affordable,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if you get it wrong, it\u2019s easy to redo.\u201d She suggests going for calming colours for rooms \u201cwhen there are likely to be more people at home and pressure on space than before. You can always come back to the bright, energising colours later when this ends\u201d.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t feel like tackling the walls, or don\u2019t need to, you can still make a difference to your environment. \u201cConsider painting the woodwork such as skirting boards, doors, architraves and window frames and radiators to match [the walls]. This will make the space feel bigger, the walls look taller \u2013 and therefore the ceilings higher \u2013 so it will all feel more spacious.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For paint, often the best prices can be found at non-specialist shops</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For paint, often the best prices can be found at non-specialist shops. You will not get the same range of colours to choose from but the homeware discounters often have brand-name paints at a lower price. Currently, for example, The Range is selling 2.5 litres of <a href=\"https://www.therange.co.uk/decorating/paint-and-painting-accessories/interior-paint/silk-emulsion/silk-emulsion-testers/dulux-low-sheen-quick-dry-eggshell-paint/\">Dulux low sheen quick dry eggshell paint in white</a> for \u00a321.99 \u2013 \u00a32 less than it costs in B&amp;Q. Crown <a href=\"https://www.therange.co.uk/decorating/paint-and-painting-accessories/interior-paint/feature-wall/feature-wall-paint/crown-breatheasy%C2%AE-feature-wall-matt-paint/#176695\">feature wall paints</a> are \u00a311 for 1.25 litres at The Range, \u00a33 cheaper than in Homebase. Wilko and B&amp;M are also worth checking before you buy. And for items such as sugar soap and white spirit, pound shops are often a good bet.</p> <p>Pound shops are also a good source of random cans of paint, which can be used to paint accessories and add a splash of colour to your home \u2013 you can paint plain picture frames, revamp a wooden chair or paint a shelf, or all three, for a couple of quid. Popping in on the off-chance there is something you like is not an option at the moment but if you are there for other items, it is worth visiting the DIY section.</p> <p>Friends, family and neighbourhood groups are also good places to pick up half tins of paint that others may have left from their projects. Again, you will have to think about how to quarantine things.</p> <p>As well as indoors, you may have a garden to think about. Old pallets can be used to create your own furniture \u2013 there are lots of videos on YouTube showing you how to make tables and chairs. You will need some sandpaper, as the wood is usually unfinished and could give you nasty splinters.</p> <p>Old garden furniture can get a new lease of life with a bit of paint, although sadly indoor paint won\u2019t work. For future years, look out for garden paints in the sale at the end of the summer \u2013 shops such as Wilko often heavily discount these in September to start to make room for Christmas goods. In the meantime, shop around for paint. For Cuprinol Garden Shades Seagrass, for example, <a href=\"https://www.bmstores.co.uk/products/cuprinol-garden-shades-seagrass-2-5l-305675\">B&amp;M is charging \u00a315 for 2.5 litres</a>, while most retailers are charging \u00a320. Or a scruffy table could be covered with a tablecloth \u2013 you can buy brightly patterned oilcloth online for less than \u00a310 a metre.</p> <p>Helen Esposito, a copywriter who runs the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/espo_inspo/?hl=en\">Instagram account \u201cespo_inspo\u201d</a>, where she posts about her interiors, lifestyle and DIY, says she and her husband, a roofer who has not been able to work because of the virus, have been tackling DIY jobs in between homeschooling their three children: an 11-year-old and twins aged 6.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ce7bf6990ad3dec30d8eddcd5ef2aec89274c5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ce7bf6990ad3dec30d8eddcd5ef2aec89274c5b/113_7_3751_2251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Esposito painted her piano from turquoise to pale pink.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen Esposito painted her piano from turquoise to pale pink.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Esposito</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the first jobs the couple started on was revamping the disregarded playhouse in the garden. \u201cIt\u2019s gone from a pirate playhouse to a surf beach shack.

DIY doesn\u2019t always have to mean power tools or large renovation projects. Sometimes it\u2019s as simple as having an idea and following through with it \u2026 by yourself. And that could be as basic as screwing a loose door back so it doesn\u2019t creak or adding a coat of varnish to a new table.</p></li> <li><p>Spray paint a home item that may not be the colour you want. I\u2019ve recently spray-painted a utensil rail from silver to brass and it was super-easy and quick to do.</p></li> <li><p>Hang a gallery wall with nails or self adhesive strips. You can use old tea cloths inside your frames or even add baskets/hats to add texture to your wall. Be creative!</p></li> <li><p>Reapply the sealant around your bathroom or kitchen counter tops if they are looking a little grubby or mouldy. There are some brilliant YouTube videos to show you how.</p></li> <li><p>Jet wash your garden decking or tiles.</p></li> <li><p>Recover an old lampshade. Grab some fabric or wallpaper scraps and give a worn, dated lamp a makeover with a bit of glue/self-adhesive spray.</p></li> <li><p>Have you got any jars or glass bottles lying around? Upcycle them into vases or storage with a little paint and/or glue.</p></li> <li><p>Do you have furniture in need of some loving?

      "bodyText": "After weeks stuck indoors, many of us have a very good idea of which bits of our home we would like to improve. Some have already been moving through their DIY to-do lists but with the bank holiday weekend here and restrictions on lockdown easing in parts of the UK, it is the perfect time to get going on a new project \u2013 big or small. Medina Grillo, an award-winning DIY and home improvement blogger at grillo-designs.com, says now is an opportunity to tackle projects you may have previously put off. \u201cDIY helps to structure your day a bit more and it keeps you from feeling too bored,\u201d she says. She has painted a small wall in her entrance hall, hung up a few pictures and waxed a coat rail over the past few weeks. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve DIYed something, it\u2019s sort of the same feeling you get after a good workout session. A sense of pride and achievement that you did that,\u201d she says. \u201cIn most cases it does save money as you won\u2019t need to hire a tradesperson or splash out on expensive furniture. You can upcycle or build your own homeware that is one-of-a-kind and customised to suit your style.\u201d DIY shops and hardware stores have been allowed to stay open throughout the lockdown \u2013 and they have been busy. Recently, Draper Tools, one of the large hand and power tool distributors, said it was experiencing strong demand in areas such as its painting and decorating products, where there had been a 20% increase. With spare cash at a premium, many of us will be looking for ways to do DIY on a budget. In normal times, borrowing tools, either from friends and family, or a local library of things, is a good way to cut costs. Some of these are still an option, if you are willing to clean and quarantine items before you use them. In Crystal Palace in London, for example, the library of things this week started offering a contactless delivery service. DIYers can borrow a range of items including sanders, drills and pressure washers, which will be delivered to their door in a bag. Borrowing a hedge trimmer, for example, costs \u00a38 a day, with a minimum hire time of two days, and there is a \u00a31 membership fee when you make your first booking. Secondhand specialists such as eBay and Gumtree are another place to look for tools and materials. So, too, are neighbourhood forums and local WhatsApp groups \u2013 often people advertise things they are trying to get rid of and want nothing or very little for them. It is also worth posting in these groups if there is anything specific you want to borrow, as people often have tools sitting unused. Again, you will need to consider how to receive the items safely. The coronavirus can survive on surfaces, so ensure you are wearing protective gloves when touching products or leave them for 72 hours before you begin your DIY. If you are buying kit new, check the retailer\u2019s websites or give them a call before turning up at a store because demand has been high and lots of items have been out of stock. Most retailers are delivering \u2013 although the consumer group Which? says it has heard from many shoppers who have been hanging on for their purchases. There are plenty of jobs you can do that do not require a big outlay on specialist equipment. Kate Watson-Smyth, the founder of the blog Mad About The House and the author of 101 Interior Design Answers, says her top tip for those who do not want to pick up a power tool would be to paint. \u201cIt\u2019s transformative and affordable,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if you get it wrong, it\u2019s easy to redo.\u201d She suggests going for calming colours for rooms \u201cwhen there are likely to be more people at home and pressure on space than before. You can always come back to the bright, energising colours later when this ends\u201d. If you don\u2019t feel like tackling the walls, or don\u2019t need to, you can still make a difference to your environment. \u201cConsider painting the woodwork such as skirting boards, doors, architraves and window frames and radiators to match [the walls]. This will make the space feel bigger, the walls look taller \u2013 and therefore the ceilings higher \u2013 so it will all feel more spacious.\u201d For paint, often the best prices can be found at non-specialist shops. You will not get the same range of colours to choose from but the homeware discounters often have brand-name paints at a lower price. Currently, for example, The Range is selling 2.5 litres of Dulux low sheen quick dry eggshell paint in white for \u00a321.99 \u2013 \u00a32 less than it costs in B&amp;Q. Crown feature wall paints are \u00a311 for 1.25 litres at The Range, \u00a33 cheaper than in Homebase. Wilko and B&amp;M are also worth checking before you buy. And for items such as sugar soap and white spirit, pound shops are often a good bet. Pound shops are also a good source of random cans of paint, which can be used to paint accessories and add a splash of colour to your home \u2013 you can paint plain picture frames, revamp a wooden chair or paint a shelf, or all three, for a couple of quid. Popping in on the off-chance there is something you like is not an option at the moment but if you are there for other items, it is worth visiting the DIY section. Friends, family and neighbourhood groups are also good places to pick up half tins of paint that others may have left from their projects. Again, you will have to think about how to quarantine things. As well as indoors, you may have a garden to think about. Old pallets can be used to create your own furniture \u2013 there are lots of videos on YouTube showing you how to make tables and chairs. You will need some sandpaper, as the wood is usually unfinished and could give you nasty splinters. Old garden furniture can get a new lease of life with a bit of paint, although sadly indoor paint won\u2019t work. For future years, look out for garden paints in the sale at the end of the summer \u2013 shops such as Wilko often heavily discount these in September to start to make room for Christmas goods. In the meantime, shop around for paint. For Cuprinol Garden Shades Seagrass, for example, B&amp;M is charging \u00a315 for 2.5 litres, while most retailers are charging \u00a320. Or a scruffy table could be covered with a tablecloth \u2013 you can buy brightly patterned oilcloth online for less than \u00a310 a metre. Helen Esposito, a copywriter who runs the Instagram account \u201cespo_inspo\u201d, where she posts about her interiors, lifestyle and DIY, says she and her husband, a roofer who has not been able to work because of the virus, have been tackling DIY jobs in between homeschooling their three children: an 11-year-old and twins aged 6. One of the first jobs the couple started on was revamping the disregarded playhouse in the garden. \u201cIt\u2019s gone from a pirate playhouse to a surf beach shack. I\u2019ve put some cushions inside and now we\u2019re reading in there and it\u2019s become a completely new play area for them to hang out in.\u201d The couple have also painted the floorboards upstairs, painted the piano from turquoise to pale pink and given the masonry at the front of the house a fresh lick of paint. Additional reporting by Hilary Osborne Quick fixes: tips to get you started The home improvement blogger Medina Grillo has these tips for cheap and effective home improvements Keep DIY small to start with until your confidence builds. DIY doesn\u2019t always have to mean power tools or large renovation projects. Sometimes it\u2019s as simple as having an idea and following through with it \u2026 by yourself. And that could be as basic as screwing a loose door back so it doesn\u2019t creak or adding a coat of varnish to a new table. Spray paint a home item that may not be the colour you want. I\u2019ve recently spray-painted a utensil rail from silver to brass and it was super-easy and quick to do. Hang a gallery wall with nails or self adhesive strips. You can use old tea cloths inside your frames or even add baskets/hats to add texture to your wall. Be creative! Reapply the sealant around your bathroom or kitchen counter tops if they are looking a little grubby or mouldy. There are some brilliant YouTube videos to show you how. Jet wash your garden decking or tiles. Recover an old lampshade. Grab some fabric or wallpaper scraps and give a worn, dated lamp a makeover with a bit of glue/self-adhesive spray. Have you got any jars or glass bottles lying around? Upcycle them into vases or storage with a little paint and/or glue. Do you have furniture in need of some loving? You can upcycle items by changing the handles, painting, staining or covering with sticky-back vinyl. Add wallpaper to the backing of an old bookcase. Use things such as grout pens to refresh kitchen or bathroom tiles. If you are using things such as paint, always make sure the room is well ventilated. When using power tools such as saws or sanders, always ensure you are wearing the right protective equipment such as an eye mask. Case study: poultry outlay In Hitchin, Hertfordshire, Jon Harwood, 65, has been busy knocking up a wendy house he found on the freecycling website FreelyWheely and converting it into a chicken pen. Harwood, a TV cameraman and a partner at the education specialist Harwood Education, has been unable to work as a result of the lockdown. He says: \u201cMy wife and I decided that because of the virus at the moment, and as we have a 12-year old daughter who wanted it, we thought it would be a good enough reason to get chickens.\u201d Harwood says it has taken him two days to build the pen and he is working on making nesting boxes and wiring up the chicken run. \u201cI\u2019d rather be outside and busy building bits than stuck indoors now that I\u2019m not working.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Has there been a month in my life before when I\u2019ve not met a single new person? In the last couple of months the only folk I\u2019ve seen have been people I know: my husband, our neighbours. In pre-virus days I\u2019d have met new people in the pub (this is Glasgow; we talk to one another here), at work events or at friends\u2019 parties. I\u2019d have chatted to the newsagent, the bus driver or the person at the checkout.</p> <p>These more removed contacts are called weak ties, in sociology speak, and they are the people social distancing has removed from our lives. There is no socialising. Time in shops is under pressure and you have to be as quick as possible, with the humanity removed by masks and distance. Many of us might think that\u2019s not much of a loss: but the truth couldn\u2019t be starker. Because weak ties, it turns out, are essential in good times \u2013 and in the coronavirus era, they are more crucial than ever.</p> <p>How so? Well, the theory has its origins in a paper called The Strength of Weak Ties published in 1973 by Stanford professor Mark Granovetter, who argued that while strong ties (family, friends, colleagues) are fundamental to our lives, it\u2019s the more distant connections (acquaintances, people you strike up a conversation with at a party, friends of friends) that are fundamental to our career and holistic development. These connections, Granovetter suggested, provide us with huge opportunities: they are the route in our lives to new projects, new jobs and new ideas.</p> <p>And that, argues Professor Stephanie Morgan of Kent Business School, is precisely why they are so important right now: because they bring the new thoughts, different ideas and new ways of thinking that you probably won\u2019t get from your inner circle, but may need to move on from the seismic changes of the pandemic. Weak links, she says, \u201care the fertile ground in all our lives\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d7d22b1f58f29155f86eb4374dafef61a17c03d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d7d22b1f58f29155f86eb4374dafef61a17c03d/0_265_3554_2133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walkers in Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow, 5 April 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Social distancing has removed many of these weak ties from our lives, at a time when we most need them.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McNulty/Alamy Live News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So the irony is that the very thing we\u2019re missing right now is something we\u2019re more in need of than ever, or soon will be. \u201cSo many people are jobless, or facing joblessness, and it\u2019s weak ties who say: \u2018have you considered this? Or, someone I know might need you to do that \u2026\u2019\u201d</p> <p>On the face of it, social media could fill the gap. But don\u2019t be fooled. \u201cWhat most people do online is stick with people they know, or whose views and outlook they agree with,\u201d says Morgan. In other words, we don\u2019t get the most valuable benefit of weak links, which is that a random or distant connection brings the possibility of a mental shake-up, an unseen challenge or an opportunity to see the world in a different way.</p> <p>Organisational psychologist Alan Redman agrees. \u201cWith social media you\u2019re in a filter bubble: you only see stuff you agree with. So although, for example, Twitter is all about weak ties, they\u2019re weak ties you\u2019ve curated yourself \u2013 and those don\u2019t bring the same benefits to your life.\u201d</p> <p>The original weak ties research focused on their value to our professional lives but, says Redman, it certainly doesn\u2019t end there. \u201cThere are many benefits at an individual psychological level: being in contact with weak links boosts your sense of life happiness, and a more diverse social network gives you more exposure to diverse ideas and will benefit your own flexibility of thinking.</p> <p>Nathan Heflick, senior psychology lecturer at Lincoln University, agrees. In addition, he says, weak ties are also important \u201cbecause they provide a sense of routine, that life is proceeding as expected. People like stability.

      "bodyText": "Has there been a month in my life before when I\u2019ve not met a single new person? In the last couple of months the only folk I\u2019ve seen have been people I know: my husband, our neighbours. In pre-virus days I\u2019d have met new people in the pub (this is Glasgow; we talk to one another here), at work events or at friends\u2019 parties. I\u2019d have chatted to the newsagent, the bus driver or the person at the checkout. These more removed contacts are called weak ties, in sociology speak, and they are the people social distancing has removed from our lives. There is no socialising. Time in shops is under pressure and you have to be as quick as possible, with the humanity removed by masks and distance. Many of us might think that\u2019s not much of a loss: but the truth couldn\u2019t be starker. Because weak ties, it turns out, are essential in good times \u2013 and in the coronavirus era, they are more crucial than ever. How so? Well, the theory has its origins in a paper called The Strength of Weak Ties published in 1973 by Stanford professor Mark Granovetter, who argued that while strong ties (family, friends, colleagues) are fundamental to our lives, it\u2019s the more distant connections (acquaintances, people you strike up a conversation with at a party, friends of friends) that are fundamental to our career and holistic development. These connections, Granovetter suggested, provide us with huge opportunities: they are the route in our lives to new projects, new jobs and new ideas. And that, argues Professor Stephanie Morgan of Kent Business School, is precisely why they are so important right now: because they bring the new thoughts, different ideas and new ways of thinking that you probably won\u2019t get from your inner circle, but may need to move on from the seismic changes of the pandemic. Weak links, she says, \u201care the fertile ground in all our lives\u201d. So the irony is that the very thing we\u2019re missing right now is something we\u2019re more in need of than ever, or soon will be. \u201cSo many people are jobless, or facing joblessness, and it\u2019s weak ties who say: \u2018have you considered this? Or, someone I know might need you to do that \u2026\u2019\u201d On the face of it, social media could fill the gap. But don\u2019t be fooled. \u201cWhat most people do online is stick with people they know, or whose views and outlook they agree with,\u201d says Morgan. In other words, we don\u2019t get the most valuable benefit of weak links, which is that a random or distant connection brings the possibility of a mental shake-up, an unseen challenge or an opportunity to see the world in a different way. Organisational psychologist Alan Redman agrees. \u201cWith social media you\u2019re in a filter bubble: you only see stuff you agree with. So although, for example, Twitter is all about weak ties, they\u2019re weak ties you\u2019ve curated yourself \u2013 and those don\u2019t bring the same benefits to your life.\u201d The original weak ties research focused on their value to our professional lives but, says Redman, it certainly doesn\u2019t end there. \u201cThere are many benefits at an individual psychological level: being in contact with weak links boosts your sense of life happiness, and a more diverse social network gives you more exposure to diverse ideas and will benefit your own flexibility of thinking. Nathan Heflick, senior psychology lecturer at Lincoln University, agrees. In addition, he says, weak ties are also important \u201cbecause they provide a sense of routine, that life is proceeding as expected. People like stability. [And] they also provide a sense of connection in themselves. Weak ties, in my view, are like foods we eat all the time which we enjoy. Those crisps and chips and bread maybe aren\u2019t juicy steak or delicious salmon, but they are still essential \u2013 we\u2019d be alarmed if bread wasn\u2019t there, even if all the other food in the world was widely available.\u201d Psychologist Lucy Atcheson, who specialises in working with clients with anxiety and depression, cautions that while lockdown is making our lives smaller, we have to be careful not to become too comfortable.

What we need to be doing now is precisely what isn\u2019t happening, which is reaching out to weak links [while observing social distancing, of course].

      "body": "<p>For the last few years, every time my mum called me out of the blue I would brace myself for the news that my gran had died. A few weeks ago, after misfiring so many times, that premonition was finally proved correct.</p> <p>Because the country was under lockdown, and I was hundreds of miles from where she lived in Melrose in the Scottish Borders, there was never any question that I would attend the funeral. Immediately, I seized upon this as being \u201cthe hardest part\u201d. It seemed like the only aspect of someone dying at 97 years old that could be thought of as unfair or tragic.</p> <p>After some consideration, we decided not to have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/13/remote-rituals-in-a-time-of-coronavirus-mourners-find-comfort-where-they-can\">virtual funeral</a>, on the basis that having to mess around with the necessary technology might detract from the solemnity of the occasion; it wouldn\u2019t be very dignified if half the mourners were kicked off the Zoom call after 40 minutes. This decision made sense, I think; the last time I spoke to my family online we were accidentally Zoom-bombed by a bewildered stranger, something which would have been less funny in the context of a memorial service.</p> <p>In the end, five people were allowed to attend. I\u2019m told that it was a beautiful service; it was a bright, clear day and, from the crematorium, you could see the Eildon hills that my gran had loved so much.</p> <p>But not being able to be there felt profoundly wrong, an insult to her memory that even the context didn\u2019t quite excuse. I was also sad that we couldn\u2019t have a wake, that we didn\u2019t get the chance to get drunk as a family, tell sentimental stories and cry. Over the next week, my mum dug out old photos of her and sent them over WhatsApp: as a young woman in her nurse\u2019s uniform, then, later in life, cradling my younger brother or smiling from a hilltop.</p> <p>As nice as this was, it wasn\u2019t quite the same as being able to pore over them together. Like so many other people this year, we missed out on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/22/eddies-last-farewell-a-funeral-in-the-time-of-coronavirus-photo-essay\">rituals of grief</a>. I think that this, along with the death toll itself, is one of the cruellest aspects of the pandemic.</p> <p>Having been in the unusually fortunate position of getting to the age of 27 without experiencing a major bereavement, it\u2019s possible that I have an inflated and naive sense of what attending a funeral can achieve. Elsewhere in my personal life, I\u2019ve realised that the concept of closure never quite plays out as you\u2019d like it to. If you feel bad about something, there\u2019s never a silver bullet that will make that go away.</p> <p>And yet still I imagine that mourning after a funeral would be something more pure and direct than what I feel now, which is not much of anything, that it would allow me to rise to a summit of grief and then descend.

      "bodyText": "For the last few years, every time my mum called me out of the blue I would brace myself for the news that my gran had died. A few weeks ago, after misfiring so many times, that premonition was finally proved correct. Because the country was under lockdown, and I was hundreds of miles from where she lived in Melrose in the Scottish Borders, there was never any question that I would attend the funeral. Immediately, I seized upon this as being \u201cthe hardest part\u201d. It seemed like the only aspect of someone dying at 97 years old that could be thought of as unfair or tragic. After some consideration, we decided not to have a virtual funeral, on the basis that having to mess around with the necessary technology might detract from the solemnity of the occasion; it wouldn\u2019t be very dignified if half the mourners were kicked off the Zoom call after 40 minutes. This decision made sense, I think; the last time I spoke to my family online we were accidentally Zoom-bombed by a bewildered stranger, something which would have been less funny in the context of a memorial service. In the end, five people were allowed to attend. I\u2019m told that it was a beautiful service; it was a bright, clear day and, from the crematorium, you could see the Eildon hills that my gran had loved so much. But not being able to be there felt profoundly wrong, an insult to her memory that even the context didn\u2019t quite excuse. I was also sad that we couldn\u2019t have a wake, that we didn\u2019t get the chance to get drunk as a family, tell sentimental stories and cry. Over the next week, my mum dug out old photos of her and sent them over WhatsApp: as a young woman in her nurse\u2019s uniform, then, later in life, cradling my younger brother or smiling from a hilltop. As nice as this was, it wasn\u2019t quite the same as being able to pore over them together. Like so many other people this year, we missed out on the rituals of grief. I think that this, along with the death toll itself, is one of the cruellest aspects of the pandemic. Having been in the unusually fortunate position of getting to the age of 27 without experiencing a major bereavement, it\u2019s possible that I have an inflated and naive sense of what attending a funeral can achieve. Elsewhere in my personal life, I\u2019ve realised that the concept of closure never quite plays out as you\u2019d like it to. If you feel bad about something, there\u2019s never a silver bullet that will make that go away. And yet still I imagine that mourning after a funeral would be something more pure and direct than what I feel now, which is not much of anything, that it would allow me to rise to a summit of grief and then descend. Maybe there\u2019s an element of self-flagellation at play. Maybe I\u2019m worried that I just don\u2019t feel sad enough about the death of someone I loved. At least a funeral would have allowed me to weep in public and confirm it. In some ways, though, there could be worse times to be bereaved. At the time of the funeral, streets across the country were quiet, the headlines were grave, the world at large was imbued with a sense of loss. As far as we know she didn\u2019t die of Covid-19, nor was she in a care home, which meant I felt a kind of imposter syndrome thinking of her death in this context. But still, grief felt like something that clicked into a larger narrative. Now, just a few weeks later, that sense of national mourning has all but disappeared.

Keep FaceTiming Dad\u2019</h2> <p><strong>James Graham, playwright</strong></p> <p>Dear Future Me,</p> <p>Say thank you to your hairdresser and mean it. I\u2019m serious. You always do, I know, but use this opportunity to celebrate how the world is full of people with underappreciated skills doing a thousand lovely things, quietly, every day. That\u2019s the first thing.</p> <p>I\u2019m aware that my expectations of you are too high, and I know your opinion of me, ie you, a year ago, is that you were naive. You weren\u2019t, you were just scared. One of the things that got us through were misplaced dreams that Something Good May Come From It; that society had stalled and required a reset \u2013 and boy, did it get one \u2013 so allow us that please, without too much cynicism.</p> <p>It was like that time your computer turned off \u2013 do you remember? \u2013 and you hadn\u2019t saved your script for hours. You didn\u2019t turn it back on immediately to see what was left. You went downstairs, made tea, paced, nearly cried, and waited, your world frozen in aspic, not knowing, once you rebooted the machine, what would have survived and what was gone for ever. If any of the things that you loved survived, be happy.</p> <p>If theatre has survived, then go, and every now and again look around you, at those hundreds of people sitting so close, sitting in the dark as a collective and listening to stories, and marvel at how mad and brilliant that is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"241bb2c26c18f58500281d7f163e79762380d0c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/241bb2c26c18f58500281d7f163e79762380d0c8/0_0_1098_914/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of bird on tree outside window with someone holding a phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"832\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Don\u2019t ever dare say something as stupid as, \u201cOh wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have one day of that again, the world on pause\u201d? If there are things you miss \u2013 peace, privacy, it being OK to leave your phone upstairs \u2013 then find ways to replicate them, you coward. There were some incredible accidental qualities, yes, but they weren\u2019t remotely worth the cost, so don\u2019t miss them; just remember them. Some examples:</p> <p>Keep downloading new music, not just the same old songs.</p> <p>One morning, you realised you didn\u2019t know the name of any of the birds singing outside. You downloaded an app to record and identify them. Blue tits and blackbirds and wrens. I wonder how many you have collected by now.</p> <p>Stay connected to your friends, as much as you did. Call your mum for no reason. Keeping FaceTiming Dad. Not just a call. Look at his face.</p> <p>And enjoy variety. Life was bland, like a bowl of rice with no seasoning. Populate your life, not with stuff you can order to the door but with people, and experiences, that are all different tastes and flavours. Identity them, appreciate, remember them.</p> <p>And keep listening to the birds.</p> <p><em>James Graham is a playwright (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/30/this-house-five-star-review-james-graham-national-theatre-garrick\" title=\"\">This House</a></em><em>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jun/28/ink-review-when-idea-of-a-mission-to-inform-was-burned-by-the-sun\" title=\"\">Ink</a>) and screenwriter (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/13/quiz-review-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-charles-ingram-diana-drama\" title=\"\">Quiz</a></em><em>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/07/brexit-the-uncivil-war-review-superficial-irresponsible-tv-cumberbatch\" title=\"\">Brexit: The Uncivil War</a>).

Spending a day at Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge was a humbling experience, and I won\u2019t ever forget the time a London hospital ran out of critical care beds for coronavirus patients, or when a senior NHS official told me they were \u201cscared\u201d. There were fears the NHS would be overwhelmed. But, thanks to extraordinary efforts, it coped when it was needed most. </p> <p>My big hope is that, by the time you read this, there will be a vaccine, and drugs and therapies available.

We will need a big rethink of social care and how it is funded, and a full appraisal of what funding the NHS needs to continue delivering the outstanding care we have all applauded every week. There is a backlog of work postponed that has to be addressed, and things will no doubt be done differently.</p> <p>Much of the work of GPs has been carried out remotely, by phone or video; many doctors say this has allowed them to talk to more patients and freed up time for face-to-face consultations with the sickest. More virtual hospital outpatient appointments should also be possible. This should be one of the positives to come from the crisis. </p> <p>I have cherished time spent with my family during lockdown, rediscovering the joys of backgammon, jigsaw puzzles and proper workouts in the garden. I hope we never live through another period when we cannot see older relatives. They deserve better than being left to cope alone. They have at least begun to get to grips with Zoom, including a virtual Scrabble game organised by my brother. I hope the spirit of quizzes and chats with extended family and friends continues, and that we will live our lives more simply, making more time for others and worrying less about the immediate pressures of daily life.

I hoped this one would sweep lightly over my country, leaving zero fatalities, but feared otherwise, and have been proved right. I\u2019m shocked at the incompetence and arrogance of my country\u2019s government from the start to the end, and how people were misled to their deaths. I\u2019m shocked at how my country reclaimed the dubious position as a world leader with our disproportionately high number of deaths. How can this small and prosperous island corner over 10% of <a href=\"https://covid19.who.int/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgdbnkqzH6QIVzbTtCh2UiwCgEAAYASAAEgKosvD_BwE\">the world\u2019s virus-deceased</a>?

I\u2019ve been writing a lot of small commissions as well as self-filming for online festivals and events. The plague and quarantine have forced me to pause and reflect, but I won\u2019t be writing about it in my next book. We\u2019re in the middle of it right now and it will take time to process. In a year\u2019s time I will have started a new novel and it will be Covid-19-free. I\u2019m pretty sure readers will soon tire of the pandemic fiction that will be hitting the shelves around now.</p> <p>I imagine that I will be relieved to have survived, and grateful for the vaccine that will be inoculating the human race. Hallelujah. I will be grateful that climate change has shot up the agenda, because reduced gas emissions during lockdown proved the science of global warming to non-believers. I will be grateful we are once more able to congregate and enjoy social communion with others. I will be grateful that people will be safely back at work, and earning, and that students and school pupils will be back in their classes, sitting side by side, and learning. I will be grateful that the feeling of community spirit that emerged when we were at war with an invisible enemy, survives. I will be grateful that those who showed their unsuitability for leadership are no longer in power.</p> <p>But I will miss the quiet of the city, which sounded more like the countryside. I will remember watching a crow pecking at a rubbish bag, before strutting down the empty road outside my window, like an alpha male without a care in the world. I remember thinking how quickly London could become a jungle overrun by feral pigeons, cats, foxes and rats, strolling around in the middle of the day like they own the joint.</p> <p>I will remember missing going into cafes, seeing theatre, meeting up with family and friends. And I will miss the cleaner air of the city from this time, and the slower pace, and I will be deeply grateful that my own life did not come to a full stop. This is what I will have learned, to take nothing for granted - to count my blessings every day.</p> <p><em>Bernardine Evaristo is author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/girl-woman-other-9780241984994.html\" title=\"\">Girl, Woman, Other</a>, which won the Booker </em><em>prize in 2019 and is published by Penguin at \u00a38.99</em></p>",

You always do, I know, but use this opportunity to celebrate how the world is full of people with underappreciated skills doing a thousand lovely things, quietly, every day. That\u2019s the first thing. I\u2019m aware that my expectations of you are too high, and I know your opinion of me, ie you, a year ago, is that you were naive. You weren\u2019t, you were just scared. One of the things that got us through were misplaced dreams that Something Good May Come From It; that society had stalled and required a reset \u2013 and boy, did it get one \u2013 so allow us that please, without too much cynicism. It was like that time your computer turned off \u2013 do you remember? \u2013 and you hadn\u2019t saved your script for hours. You didn\u2019t turn it back on immediately to see what was left. You went downstairs, made tea, paced, nearly cried, and waited, your world frozen in aspic, not knowing, once you rebooted the machine, what would have survived and what was gone for ever. If any of the things that you loved survived, be happy. If theatre has survived, then go, and every now and again look around you, at those hundreds of people sitting so close, sitting in the dark as a collective and listening to stories, and marvel at how mad and brilliant that is. Don\u2019t ever dare say something as stupid as, \u201cOh wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have one day of that again, the world on pause\u201d? If there are things you miss \u2013 peace, privacy, it being OK to leave your phone upstairs \u2013 then find ways to replicate them, you coward. There were some incredible accidental qualities, yes, but they weren\u2019t remotely worth the cost, so don\u2019t miss them; just remember them. Some examples: Keep downloading new music, not just the same old songs. One morning, you realised you didn\u2019t know the name of any of the birds singing outside. You downloaded an app to record and identify them. Blue tits and blackbirds and wrens. I wonder how many you have collected by now. Stay connected to your friends, as much as you did. Call your mum for no reason. Keeping FaceTiming Dad. Not just a call. Look at his face. And enjoy variety. Life was bland, like a bowl of rice with no seasoning. Populate your life, not with stuff you can order to the door but with people, and experiences, that are all different tastes and flavours. Identity them, appreciate, remember them. And keep listening to the birds. James Graham is a playwright (This House; Ink) and screenwriter (Quiz; Brexit: The Uncivil War). This House is streaming as part of National Theatre At Home from 7pm on 28 May to 4 June \u2018I hope you will tell me you are still speaking out\u2019 Prof Helen Ward, scientist Dear Helen, If you are reading this, that is good news. It means the biggest public health disaster in my lifetime has spared you, though I fear it will have claimed the lives of many tens of thousands of others. I fear it will also have had a lasting impact on the standing of our speciality \u2013 public health. I wish you could tell me whether there is protective immunity after people recover from infection, and how long it lasts. Do you know what role children play in transmission? And how exactly does this virus spread? Have you found an effective vaccine and treatment, and if so, are they widely available in low-income countries as well? I hope you can look back with some pride and say, yes, people like me made a difference. I hope our public health leadership was embraced by government, and we were able to minimise deaths and the long-term consequences of both the disease and the control measures. My research career has focused on HIV, another devastating infection that spread rapidly across the globe.

We will need a big rethink of social care and how it is funded, and a full appraisal of what funding the NHS needs to continue delivering the outstanding care we have all applauded every week. There is a backlog of work postponed that has to be addressed, and things will no doubt be done differently. Much of the work of GPs has been carried out remotely, by phone or video; many doctors say this has allowed them to talk to more patients and freed up time for face-to-face consultations with the sickest. More virtual hospital outpatient appointments should also be possible. This should be one of the positives to come from the crisis. I have cherished time spent with my family during lockdown, rediscovering the joys of backgammon, jigsaw puzzles and proper workouts in the garden. I hope we never live through another period when we cannot see older relatives. They deserve better than being left to cope alone. They have at least begun to get to grips with Zoom, including a virtual Scrabble game organised by my brother. I hope the spirit of quizzes and chats with extended family and friends continues, and that we will live our lives more simply, making more time for others and worrying less about the immediate pressures of daily life. We should ensure that those who felt isolated are looked after and that the burden of loneliness felt by many is lifted. Hugh Pym is BBC News health editor \u2018I hoped this plague would sweep lightly over my country, but feared otherwise\u2019 Bernardine Evaristo, author Dear Bernardine, I thought plagues were a thing of the past until history proved otherwise. I hoped this one would sweep lightly over my country, leaving zero fatalities, but feared otherwise, and have been proved right. I\u2019m shocked at the incompetence and arrogance of my country\u2019s government from the start to the end, and how people were misled to their deaths. I\u2019m shocked at how my country reclaimed the dubious position as a world leader with our disproportionately high number of deaths. How can this small and prosperous island corner over 10% of the world\u2019s virus-deceased? A chart-topper. A super-spreader. The United Kingdom of Bad Government Decisions. As a writer I\u2019m used to working at home, sitting in front of my screen, so in this regard it\u2019s business as usual. I\u2019ve been writing a lot of small commissions as well as self-filming for online festivals and events. The plague and quarantine have forced me to pause and reflect, but I won\u2019t be writing about it in my next book. We\u2019re in the middle of it right now and it will take time to process. In a year\u2019s time I will have started a new novel and it will be Covid-19-free. I\u2019m pretty sure readers will soon tire of the pandemic fiction that will be hitting the shelves around now. I imagine that I will be relieved to have survived, and grateful for the vaccine that will be inoculating the human race. Hallelujah. I will be grateful that climate change has shot up the agenda, because reduced gas emissions during lockdown proved the science of global warming to non-believers. I will be grateful we are once more able to congregate and enjoy social communion with others. I will be grateful that people will be safely back at work, and earning, and that students and school pupils will be back in their classes, sitting side by side, and learning. I will be grateful that the feeling of community spirit that emerged when we were at war with an invisible enemy, survives. I will be grateful that those who showed their unsuitability for leadership are no longer in power. But I will miss the quiet of the city, which sounded more like the countryside. I will remember watching a crow pecking at a rubbish bag, before strutting down the empty road outside my window, like an alpha male without a care in the world. I remember thinking how quickly London could become a jungle overrun by feral pigeons, cats, foxes and rats, strolling around in the middle of the day like they own the joint. I will remember missing going into cafes, seeing theatre, meeting up with family and friends. And I will miss the cleaner air of the city from this time, and the slower pace, and I will be deeply grateful that my own life did not come to a full stop. This is what I will have learned, to take nothing for granted - to count my blessings every day.

That for British Muslims it\u2019s taking place in lockdown, through a global pandemic, is painful and heartbreaking.</p> <p>Eid al-Fitr follows weeks of fasting and marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. It is full of rituals and traditions that involve the entire family: we put on new clothes and attend prayers, followed by a rich breakfast of roasted vermicelli (<em>sawaiyan</em>), sweet halwa and channa curry. The feast continues with an elaborate lunch, at least it does in our household: my mother is not happy until there is chicken biryani, haleem, fried fish, lamb chops and kebabs.</p> <p>But, I reminisce: this is the experience I\u2019ve had until now, where parents, siblings, in-laws, nieces and nephews all meet, kiss, hug and wish each other eid mubarak. So far it has never crossed my mind to celebrate Eid without immediate family.</p> <p>Despite having left home more than two decades ago and living in a different city, I always make it home for Eid. I was once based abroad, more than 4,000 miles away, but I took a seven-hour flight to Heathrow, spent two hours on the train and a short ferry trip so I could be home. The shock and delight on my family\u2019s faces as I arrived unannounced is something I still remember over a decade later. </p> <p>Having to celebrate Eid on my own this year? I guess there is a first time for everything.</p> <p>The current situation demands that we protect our loved ones by staying away. In England, people of black Caribbean background are most at risk, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\">7</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\">8 deaths per 100,000</a>, while those of Indian or Pakistani origin have between 30-35 deaths per 100,000. It\u2019s a frightening number but we should take comfort in the fact that these are extenuating circumstance that perhaps will not be repeated again in our lifetime. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/ramadan-during-coronavirus-may-seem-disheartening-but-its-the-ideal-time-for-reflection\">Ramadan during coronavirus may seem disheartening but it's the ideal time for reflection | Heba Shaheed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the best way to accept the situation is to look to the past. I recall my grandmother saying how hard it was for her and the family not to see her son \u2013 my dad \u2013 for more than nine years after he left Pakistan to come and study in England in the late 1960s. It now feels sad to think that he was all alone, spending all those Eids so far from his family. I have never before understood the true hardship and loneliness of his time, when it took nearly a month to send and receive letters.</p> <p>Many ethnic minorities have lost loved ones to the pandemic or are in isolation due to health issues, and for Muslims, being unable to come together as a family will be painful and hard. Not being able to console each other, hold hands, hug or simply sit next to each other seems cruel. We must adapt and support our families and communities in new ways. For this one year we will have to make do with Eid gatherings on Zoom and House Party. But let us be grateful for the technology that makes it possible to see and talk to our loved ones at the touch of a button.</p> <ul> <li><p>Aisha Riaz is assistant production editor at the Guardian Guide<br></p></li> </ul>",

It is full of rituals and traditions that involve the entire family: we put on new clothes and attend prayers, followed by a rich breakfast of roasted vermicelli (sawaiyan), sweet halwa and channa curry. The feast continues with an elaborate lunch, at least it does in our household: my mother is not happy until there is chicken biryani, haleem, fried fish, lamb chops and kebabs. But, I reminisce: this is the experience I\u2019ve had until now, where parents, siblings, in-laws, nieces and nephews all meet, kiss, hug and wish each other eid mubarak. So far it has never crossed my mind to celebrate Eid without immediate family. Despite having left home more than two decades ago and living in a different city, I always make it home for Eid. I was once based abroad, more than 4,000 miles away, but I took a seven-hour flight to Heathrow, spent two hours on the train and a short ferry trip so I could be home. The shock and delight on my family\u2019s faces as I arrived unannounced is something I still remember over a decade later. Having to celebrate Eid on my own this year? I guess there is a first time for everything. The current situation demands that we protect our loved ones by staying away. In England, people of black Caribbean background are most at risk, with 78 deaths per 100,000, while those of Indian or Pakistani origin have between 30-35 deaths per 100,000. It\u2019s a frightening number but we should take comfort in the fact that these are extenuating circumstance that perhaps will not be repeated again in our lifetime. Perhaps the best way to accept the situation is to look to the past. I recall my grandmother saying how hard it was for her and the family not to see her son \u2013 my dad \u2013 for more than nine years after he left Pakistan to come and study in England in the late 1960s. It now feels sad to think that he was all alone, spending all those Eids so far from his family. I have never before understood the true hardship and loneliness of his time, when it took nearly a month to send and receive letters. Many ethnic minorities have lost loved ones to the pandemic or are in isolation due to health issues, and for Muslims, being unable to come together as a family will be painful and hard. Not being able to console each other, hold hands, hug or simply sit next to each other seems cruel. We must adapt and support our families and communities in new ways. For this one year we will have to make do with Eid gatherings on Zoom and House Party. But let us be grateful for the technology that makes it possible to see and talk to our loved ones at the touch of a button. Aisha Riaz is assistant production editor at the Guardian Guide",

Many owners buy their land to help promote biodiversity and reverse the effects of poor woodland management. The Daveys are no different.</p> <p>Six years before they purchased <a href=\"https://www.woodlandwildlife.co.uk/\">their plot </a>in 2018, the woodland was clear-felled and replaced with more than 2,000 non-native Sitka spruce, which are commonly grown in commercial plantations in the UK and are poor for biodiversity. Tamara and Steve have begun the daunting task of replacing the fast-growing conifer with sweet chestnuts, birches, oaks and native hedging to support wildlife, adding the occasional pool and clearing for bats and amphibians.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"17495c5249761d234c574815b398d83adec7f69c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17495c5249761d234c574815b398d83adec7f69c/0_0_720_960/375.jpg\" alt=\"Introducing ponds to woodland areas can help bring new wildlife to the area.\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Introducing ponds to woodland areas can help bring new wildlife to the area.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Woodland Wildlife</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn providing new habitats and new species, I think that\u2019s achievable. The insects, the invertebrates, they\u2019ve got to be catered for. If you haven\u2019t got those, then the whole ecosystem is not so healthy. Having the grass areas, the ponds, they\u2019ll create a huge amount of wildlife,\u201d says Steve.</p> <p>After the second world war, agriculture became more intensive and the widespread availability of plastic meant that less wood was needed to make furniture and tools. Many woodlands that were previously looked after were left to their own devices and now it is estimated that <a href=\"https://www.rfs.org.uk/media/552717/woodland-management-missed-opportunities-in-england-and-wales.pdf\">just over 40% of UK woodland</a> is either unmanaged or undermanaged.</p> <p>Management often mimics natural processes such as storm damage, which creates areas of wildlife-rich dead wood. Coppicing \u2013 cutting back trees to ground level on a five- to 20-year cycle \u2013 allows light to reach the forest floor. Before humans, large grazing animals such as bison would have browsed forests to maintain areas of low growth. This mix of dead wood, healthy trees, saplings and open spaces creates a rich mosaic of habitats.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re not owners, we\u2019re custodians of this bit of ground and these trees</p> <footer> <cite>Tony Upson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cA well-managed woodland is more likely to have greater biodiversity than an unmanaged woodland. The basic principle is that allowing light in attracts all sorts of tiers of biodiversity,\u201d says author <a href=\"https://robpenn.net/books/the-man-who-made-things-out-of-wood/\">Robert Penn</a>, who bought a cottage enclosed by trees on the edge of the Black Mountains in Wales 17 years ago.</p> <p>The 2.5-acre wood was previously owned by a couple who had little interest in woodland management and it had grown dark and unwieldy. Unlike the Daveys\u2019 wood, Penn\u2019s plot was mainly native trees that had been left to run wild.</p> <p>He opened up his tiny woodland by coppicing and thinning out weaker trees to let in the light.

I\u2019ve had a keen interest in wildlife all my life but, yeah, it\u2019s enriching.\u201d The couple bought their piece of land through Woodlands.co.uk, which sells all kinds of plots \u2013 from one acre to more than 20 \u2013 at about \u00a310,000 an acre, from the Highlands to rural Cornwall. Many owners buy their land to help promote biodiversity and reverse the effects of poor woodland management. The Daveys are no different. Six years before they purchased their plot in 2018, the woodland was clear-felled and replaced with more than 2,000 non-native Sitka spruce, which are commonly grown in commercial plantations in the UK and are poor for biodiversity. Tamara and Steve have begun the daunting task of replacing the fast-growing conifer with sweet chestnuts, birches, oaks and native hedging to support wildlife, adding the occasional pool and clearing for bats and amphibians. \u201cIn providing new habitats and new species, I think that\u2019s achievable. The insects, the invertebrates, they\u2019ve got to be catered for. If you haven\u2019t got those, then the whole ecosystem is not so healthy. Having the grass areas, the ponds, they\u2019ll create a huge amount of wildlife,\u201d says Steve. After the second world war, agriculture became more intensive and the widespread availability of plastic meant that less wood was needed to make furniture and tools. Many woodlands that were previously looked after were left to their own devices and now it is estimated that just over 40% of UK woodland is either unmanaged or undermanaged. Management often mimics natural processes such as storm damage, which creates areas of wildlife-rich dead wood. Coppicing \u2013 cutting back trees to ground level on a five- to 20-year cycle \u2013 allows light to reach the forest floor. Before humans, large grazing animals such as bison would have browsed forests to maintain areas of low growth. This mix of dead wood, healthy trees, saplings and open spaces creates a rich mosaic of habitats. \u201cA well-managed woodland is more likely to have greater biodiversity than an unmanaged woodland. The basic principle is that allowing light in attracts all sorts of tiers of biodiversity,\u201d says author Robert Penn, who bought a cottage enclosed by trees on the edge of the Black Mountains in Wales 17 years ago. The 2.5-acre wood was previously owned by a couple who had little interest in woodland management and it had grown dark and unwieldy. Unlike the Daveys\u2019 wood, Penn\u2019s plot was mainly native trees that had been left to run wild. He opened up his tiny woodland by coppicing and thinning out weaker trees to let in the light. Woodland flowers \u2013 which can lie dormant for decades \u2013 started to flourish and the plot is now peppered with wood anemones, stitchwort, celandine, primroses and wild garlic. These spaces also provide sanctuary from the modern world. \u201cThe woodland is absolutely fundamental to my existence,\u201d says Penn, who is patron of the Small Woods Association. \u201cThis morning, for instance, I was in my woodland and it was incredibly beautiful \u2013 wildflowers are just starting to come up, trees are about to bud, the wood is absolutely packed with birds. It\u2019s splendid.\u201d Several wildlife trusts in the UK have reported increased interest in people wanting to buy land for tree planting, landowners wanting advice on carbon offsetting and communities starting tree-planting schemes. Aside from the wildlife benefits, small woods provide important ecosystem services such as reducing air pollution, locking carbon into the soil and temperature regulation. These benefits are worth hundreds of millions of pounds, according to analysis by the Office for National Statistics. Penn\u2019s one tip to fellow forest owners is to be patient, because managing woodland is a long-term project. \u201cIt was five years before I felt the wood was genuinely my own \u2026 and a decade later I\u2019m absolutely confident I\u2019m doing the right thing and I take immeasurable pleasure out of the whole thing.\u201d In Tortington, West Sussex, Julie and Tony Upson manage 4.5 acres of ancient semi-natural woodland. Hazel trees dominate but a majestic veteran yew stands proudly and the former palliative care nurse and city law firm facilities manager are trying to encourage the heather back on a former heath. The couple adore the dormice that live in their woodland and credit their small forest with giving them a vibrant retirement where they spend lots of time together and bond with a community of other foresters. \u201cWe do wish we\u2019d done this earlier but we didn\u2019t have the money,\u201d Julie says, adding that the forest helped her cope with cancer treatment. \u201cIt does give you the opportunity for unusual birthday presents. I bought Julie an axe one year and her friend thought it was a really bizarre present!\u201d says Tony. To others who might want to turn their hands to managing woodland for biodiversity, the couple have one message: \u201cGo for it.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not owners, we\u2019re custodians of this bit of ground and these trees. Everything we do is not for us, it\u2019s for future generations and for the planet,\u201d says Tony.",

      "bodyText": "Monday is Memorial Day \u2013 the traditional start of the American summer. Shutters are going up, doors are being unlocked, barriers removed. Every state is relaxing quarantine rules to some extent, betting that the country finally has Covid-19 under control. There are signs that for some Americans quarantine fatigue is overcoming fear of infection. With the economy reeling, others have dismissed the pandemic as a political plot \u2013 for them relaxing quarantine rules can\u2019t come soon enough. But people on the front line are worried, and experts warn the outbreak has proved a \u201ctrust-destroying disaster\u201d that could have devastating consequences. On Friday, White House coronavirus taskforce member Dr Anthony Fauci said new localized outbreaks were \u201cinevitable\u201d as mitigation measures are relaxed. He said a full-blown second wave could be avoided if the holy grail of containment measures \u2013 testing, quarantine and contact tracing \u2013 continued to be adhered to. Fauci said he was hopeful that the US would be ready, though a recent study by Harvard University found that only nine states were conducting, or near to conducting, the minimum recommended testing. Hours after Fauci spoke, Donald Trump ignored health guidance and ordered houses of worship to open for in-person services at the weekend. These disparate responses to the pandemic are not just happening in the White House, but across America. After 51 days on lockdown, Minnesota ended its statewide stay-at-home order on Monday. A new order, dubbed Stay Safe MN, will allow more flexibility and social interaction amid the pandemic. For nurses in Minneapolis, it\u2019s too soon. In emotional testimony at the state capitol last week, they told lawmakers they feared that a surge in cases would cost more lives, including those of health workers. A surge of Covid-19 infections would exhaust the state\u2019s personal protection equipment (PPE) supplies, warned Mary Turner, a critical care nurse at North Memorial Health hospital and president of the Minnesota Nurses Association. \u201cWe are approaching the surge point very fast,\u201d Turner said. About 17,700 cases have been reported in the state, and 777 deaths. It is far from the worst outbreak in the US \u2013 but numbers are still rising. In the meantime, hospitals have been reusing N95 masks that technically expired in 2001 and 2002. Supplies of gowns ran so short last month that some local hospitals ordered rain ponchos as a backup. Even Minnesota\u2019s governor, Tim Walz, believes worse is to come. \u201cIt is going to get worse here before it gets better. That is an absolute guarantee,\u201d Walz, a Democrat, told reporters as he outlined his cautious reopening plan. Social scientists at Northwestern University have surveyed 200 people a day since mid-March, and have found that unlike in other disasters, the US is not unifying in response to this crisis. \u201cIt has been a solidarity- and trust-destroying disaster,\u201d said Beth Redbird, the primary researcher. \u201cWe usually see disasters as unifying. They bring us together, they unite us, they increase support for our neighbors, to help each other out. But while we see anecdotal stories of that in the press, we haven\u2019t actually seen a lot of data supporting that that\u2019s what\u2019s going on.\u201d The majority of Americans still seem to oppose Trump\u2019s attempts to downplay the crisis. Northwestern\u2019s surveys last week showed 64% of people are still in support of stay-at-home orders, and they are mostly avoiding seeing friends and eating out at restaurants. But while Northwestern\u2019s survey found 86% said they trusted scientists to tell them what to eat for a healthy diet, those who said they trust a scientist to tell them how Covid-19 works was only at 55%. \u2018Like adding kindling to embers\u2019 We have been here before. The threats of a second wave were borne out in the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which a third of the world\u2019s population were infected with the virus.

      "bodyText": "The BeltLine is a former railway turned nature trail that loops 22 miles through Atlanta, and it\u2019s been crowded with walkers and cyclists since Georgia relaxed its short lived shelter-in-place on 1 May. But the masses have largely stayed away from the BeltLine\u2019s shopping crown jewel, Ponce City Market, as many of its stores chose to remain closed, despite the crippling economic hardship caused by the shutdown. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as much as like turning on and off the light switch, as much as it\u2019s \u2018What\u2019s going to ensure the sustained viability and success of our tenants long term?\u2019\u201d says Michael Phillips, president of Jamestown Properties, the Market\u2019s developer. Georgia, helmed by Republican governor Brian Kemp, has been at the forefront of the reopening movement in the US, to the cheers of anti-lockdown protesters and the horror of many public health experts. As America watched, Georgia\u2019s gyms, churches, hair and nail salons, and tattoo parlors were allowed to reopen in late April, with mandates of social distancing. A week later, all other gathering spots \u2013 except bars, nightclubs and live performance venues \u2013 were allowed to open too. But far from reopening in full, Georgians\u2019 embrace of their freedom from lockdown has been a patchy affair, with business owners and their customers only tentatively emerging from their homes, as the pandemic still rages in much of America. Fears of a second coronavirus wave remain, amid reports of erroneous data releases by the state and a lag in the reporting itself. The result is that some Georgia residents venture out and businesses tentatively open, while many others remain closed. The pattern of reopening seems to mirror the political divides of the state. Many businesses in predominantly liberal-leaning communities, similar to the one where Ponce City Market is based, have resisted the easing of restrictions. In downtown Decatur, one of the most liberal-leaning towns in the state, a number of storefronts are still shuttered in its idyllic square. \u201cThe White Bull will be temporarily closed due to social distancing. We look forward to opening again soon,\u201d the White Bull restaurant announces on its site in late May. \u201cStay safe, stay healthy.\u201d Another staple, Sweet Melissa\u2019s, has been closed since March. But other neighborhoods are flinging their doors wide open, ready to return to life before the coronavirus. Atlantans are seeing a rift: uneven re-openings across the city, at times based on the faultlines of their communities as Georgians wait to see if their lives can return to normal. \u201cI live in suburbia in north Atlanta, and the attitude up there about this whole thing is completely different,\u201d says Brian Maloof, the owner of Atlanta restaurant Manuel\u2019s Tavern, as he watches a regular eat a hamburger under an outdoor tent near his restaurant on CCTV. \u201cIt is completely dependent upon your political philosophy, on whether or not you\u2019re going to open and throw the doors open and everything is fine, or if you\u2019re going to be more cautious about it.\u201d But the economy is flickering back to life. Around Mother\u2019s Day, as restaurants welcomed people to celebrate, Holeman and Finch, one of Georgia\u2019s largest bakeries, saw an increase in sales, reaching a pandemic high of 10% of normal business. The wholesale bakery\u2019s goods, found in approximately 300 restaurants statewide, are delivered to only half of its partners nearly a month after the governor lifted the state\u2019s short lived shelter-in-place, and at a small fraction of its usual profit, says the company\u2019s director of business operations Brittany Brown. But the damage is done, and the road back looks hard as fears of the virus \u2013 or its return \u2013 remain.

But even as employees have the go-ahead to return to work, it doesn\u2019t mean they or their employers are open for business. The Georgia department of labor announced Thursday that more than 2m regular initial unemployment claims have been processed in the past 10 weeks \u2013 more than the 1.7m claims filed over the last five years combined. More than 40,000 Georgians have tested positive for coronavirus since 1 February, with no downward trend of cases that the governor projected while announcing his plans to revive the economy at the end of April.

Rosen, 74, the author of children\u2019s books including We\u2019re Going on a Bear Hunt and Little Rabbit Foo Foo, charted the initial stages of his illness on Twitter. He has not tweeted since late March but his wife, Emma-Louise Williams, updated wellwishers periodically while he was \u201cvery poorly\u201d. After more than a fortnight without updates about his health, Williams tweeted on her own account: \u201cToday Michael has been in hospital for 8 weeks &amp; I\u2019m v happy to say he left ICU yesterday after a long &amp; difficult 47 days. His recovery is continuing on the ward &amp; will take time.

Williams last tweeted on Rosen\u2019s account on 7 May, saying: \u201cThanks very much for all your continuing love and support on here.\u201d She has not confirmed whether Rosen contracted coronavirus.

      "body": "<h2>John Harris</h2> <p>The day after the 2019 general election we were on an early-morning train from Stoke-on-Trent to London, feeling as if a long and messy chapter of recent British history had at last come to some kind of full stop. Brexit was a certainty, the Conservatives had won a big parliamentary majority, and the Labour party was more estranged than ever from its old heartlands. Having covered a country in mounting political ferment since 2010, we thought we could at least put Anywhere but Westminster on pause.</p> <p>But in March, everything changed once again. As the Covid-19 crisis reached the decisive point of lockdown, we decided the series had to be reawakened. But if we were as subject to the new restrictions as anyone else, and just as scared of the virus, how could we do it?</p> <p>The answer has defined our experience of the past two months. Instead of travelling to places, we have issued call-outs for information about what people are living through, and footage of their lives, usually shot on their phones. In addition, often using contacts we have acquired over the past 10 years, we have approached old and new sources, and asked them to participate. A mountain of video has arrived, which we and our team have spent long days and nights combining with our own material and turning into finished films. The result, by a mixture of accident and design, has been an ongoing series of videos that tells the story of this crisis from the core of people\u2019s actual experience.</p> <p>We\u2019ve chronicled the lives of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2020/apr/24/life-in-lockdown-from-birth-to-death-in-a-time-of-danger-video\">26-year-old man whose arthritis medication suppresses his immune system</a>, meaning he has to live in complete isolation, and an intensive care nurse who facilitates people saying their last goodbyes via Zoom. We\u2019ve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2020/apr/10/life-in-coronavirus-lockdown-families-on-the-brink-video\">spoken to families</a> whose experience of lockdown is light years away from any \u201cbake cakes and learn Spanish\u201d cliches, and people who have spoken movingly about losing loved ones. Crucially, we have also gone out of our way to explore how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2020/mar/25/anywhere-but-westminster-coronavirus-diaries-alone-together-video\">communities have come together</a>, and provided new kinds of support to friends and neighbours.</p> <p>Unintentionally, it feels like what we\u2019re doing is true to most people\u2019s experience of the crisis \u2013 and, in particular, the mixture of an often lonely world suddenly mediated via the internet, and an unexpected sense of common purpose and togetherness. It sometimes feels as if encouraging people to document their own experiences is sparking a change in the way we feel about our journalism, and presenting us with a new challenge we will have to face when the crisis recedes: how to push even further beyond the standard approaches of the media, and give an even more authentic sense of where the country is going.</p> <p>For now, one thing seems particularly clear. The convulsive political events of the past 10 years were at least partly about rising inequality and insecurity, and people\u2019s sense that power was too distant. Covid-19 has highlighted those things to the point that they are even more inescapable than before \u2013 which, for us, means that the work has to go on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I have found moments of emotion in the footage that it would be hard to match in anything I shot myself</p> <footer> <cite>John Domokos</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><br>John Domokos</h2> <p>Stay at home, keep your distance from people and don\u2019t mix with anyone outside of your circle: the rules of lockdown are almost the polar opposite of the rules of Anywhere but Westminster.</p> <p>Our process has been to get out there to places the media doesn\u2019t normally visit, get close to people, and talk to those outside our bubble. Seeing a political media that was too socially distant, we wanted to counteract it with a kind of journalistic gap-closing.</p> <p>Through the ruptures of Corbynism, Brexit, and the rise of populism, the idea that there was a gap between the way politics was presented in the news and lived in the world became accepted, and even a cliche. After 10 years, I sometimes felt like one of an ageing pair of small-time bank robbers, always coming back for one last job.</p> <p>But coronavirus and the resulting lockdown brought us new purpose \u2013 or a new version of our old purpose. Once again, the news was dominated by images from government briefings from Westminster and political journalists trying to hold them to account \u2013 this time over Zoom. There was also a blizzard of figures: infection rates, deaths, jobs lost, workers in furlough. We wanted to give more space to ordinary people to speak \u2013 putting human stories to those numbers and policies, but also capturing the ways in which communities were coming together to help each other.</p> <p>Same old problem, then: the difference is that we are working from our bedrooms and putting the films together using footage sent to us by people around Britain. Like everything else about this moment, it\u2019s been a journey of discovery, with highs and lows. I will not miss wrestling with hundreds of clips shot in different formats, sent to me along with a constant stream of messages, questions, and pinging alerts. But I have also found moments of emotion in the footage that it would be hard to match in anything I shot myself.</p> <p>A paradox has become clear: while the issues we cover have always been bottom-up, the process of making a film that has a narrative viewers will watch and engage with is a very top-down process, requiring lots of control in the hands of the person filming and editing. Normally we videographers film with great attention to detail, trying to get each shot just right, and capturing every aspect of a scene in sequences of shots. Now I\u2019m in collaboration with people who don\u2019t even hold the camera the right way round (hint: it\u2019s not vertical). But what they lack in technical skills they have made up for in authenticity.</p> <p>So, in many ways, this has been a process of letting go \u2013 of the old standards that we thought were so important, and of the visual \u201cgrammar\u201d we have taken for granted. Instead we have found value in a new kind of intimacy and sincerity that comes from people having filmed their own stories, and the greater sense of control they have in the process. And we have tried to lay open the process to the viewers. In some ways this version of Anywhere but Westminster is the most true to its original vision. Hopefully it will open up new ways of thinking about how we do our video journalism and share power with the people we report on, and at the same time encourage people to see the power in capturing and documenting these times in video for themselves.</p> <p><br><br></p>",

      "body": "<p>Described as the prime minister\u2019s \u201cRasputin\u201d, Dominic Cummings is no stranger to the spotlight. In fact he has made a career out of eschewing the rules and courting notoriety.</p> <p>He came to the fore as a special adviser to Michael Gove between 2007 and 2013, and attracted further attention as the chief administrative mastermind behind the successful leave campaign in the 2016 referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-coronavirus-and-lockdown-a-timeline\">Dominic Cummings, coronavirus and lockdown \u2013 a timeline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After being appointed as the prime minister\u2019s de facto chief of staff in the summer of 2019, he became one of the most powerful unelected political figures in the country.</p> <p>The appointment of the abrasive former campaign director was controversial, given he had been found to be in contempt of parliament earlier in the year for refusing to give evidence to MPs investigating misinformation.</p> <p>A longstanding Eurosceptic, Cummings has built a reputation as someone who does not play by the rules of conventional politics, and he was once called a \u201ccareer psychopath\u201d by the former prime minister David Cameron.</p> <p>His appointment as head of the Vote Leave campaign was dramatised in the Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War, which played up his role in covering a bus with the disputed \u00a3350m-a-week figure, arguing that the cash could be used to fund the NHS.</p> <p>He was in the headlines again after he posted an advert on his personal blog for \u201cweirdos and misfits with odd skills\u201d to work for the government.</p> <p>In the post he said career civil servants and \u201cpublic school bluffers\u201d in Whitehall were ill-equipped to take decisions about complex issues. Instead, he issued a recruitment call for mathematicians and data scientists to be given more prominence in the corridors of power, shaking up the civil service.</p> <p>In April it was revealed that Cummings had been present at meetings coordinating the response to the coronavirus pandemic as part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). This raised concerns over a lack of breadth of expertise in the meetings and political interference in science-based advice.</p> <p>Cummings, from Durham, in the north-east of England, has been known to play up his northern roots. His father, Robert, was an oil rig engineer and his mother, Morag, a teacher and behavioural specialist.</p> <p>He went to a state primary school and was then privately educated at the \u00a316,000-a-year Durham School.

      "bodyText": "Described as the prime minister\u2019s \u201cRasputin\u201d, Dominic Cummings is no stranger to the spotlight. In fact he has made a career out of eschewing the rules and courting notoriety. He came to the fore as a special adviser to Michael Gove between 2007 and 2013, and attracted further attention as the chief administrative mastermind behind the successful leave campaign in the 2016 referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU. After being appointed as the prime minister\u2019s de facto chief of staff in the summer of 2019, he became one of the most powerful unelected political figures in the country. The appointment of the abrasive former campaign director was controversial, given he had been found to be in contempt of parliament earlier in the year for refusing to give evidence to MPs investigating misinformation. A longstanding Eurosceptic, Cummings has built a reputation as someone who does not play by the rules of conventional politics, and he was once called a \u201ccareer psychopath\u201d by the former prime minister David Cameron. His appointment as head of the Vote Leave campaign was dramatised in the Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War, which played up his role in covering a bus with the disputed \u00a3350m-a-week figure, arguing that the cash could be used to fund the NHS. He was in the headlines again after he posted an advert on his personal blog for \u201cweirdos and misfits with odd skills\u201d to work for the government. In the post he said career civil servants and \u201cpublic school bluffers\u201d in Whitehall were ill-equipped to take decisions about complex issues. Instead, he issued a recruitment call for mathematicians and data scientists to be given more prominence in the corridors of power, shaking up the civil service. In April it was revealed that Cummings had been present at meetings coordinating the response to the coronavirus pandemic as part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). This raised concerns over a lack of breadth of expertise in the meetings and political interference in science-based advice. Cummings, from Durham, in the north-east of England, has been known to play up his northern roots. His father, Robert, was an oil rig engineer and his mother, Morag, a teacher and behavioural specialist. He went to a state primary school and was then privately educated at the \u00a316,000-a-year Durham School. He graduated from Oxford University with a first-class degree in modern history and spent some time in Russia, where he was involved with a failed attempt to launch an airline, among other projects. After a stint as campaign director for Business for Sterling, he spent eight months as chief strategy adviser to the then Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith. He played a key role in the 2004 campaign against an elected regional assembly in his native north-east. This turned out to be precursor to the Brexit campaign, with the North East Says No team winning the referendum by latching on to the anti-establishment mood that was beginning to spread among the public. Following this success he reportedly retreated to his father\u2019s farm in County Durham to spend some time reading. He would re-emerge in 2007 as a special adviser to Gove, who became education secretary from 2010. Cummings is married to Mary Wakefield, a senior editor at the Spectator and the daughter of Sir Humphrey Wakefield. Cummings had previously been observed failing to follow the two-metre social distancing rules as he walked along Downing Street flanked by his fellow aide Cleo Watson on 14 April.",

      "body": "<p>No, I don\u2019t have any illusions about what I\u2019ve become since the start of this year. Like so many other slightly uncomfortable things in my life, this occupation started as an ill-defined joke. Wouldn\u2019t it be funny, I thought to myself, if I bought a games console for the first time in a decade. If nothing else, wouldn\u2019t it just be a small, deserved protest against the stresses of adulthood?</p> <p>When I tried to explain this decision to my loved ones, it was greeted with<strong> </strong>tolerant concern. In the nothing days between Christmas and new year my partner asked if this was a distraction I really needed in a busy life. \u201cJust wait a bit,\u201d she said, as if speaking to a slightly unruly child, \u201cuntil you\u2019re really sure it\u2019s what you want.\u201d And in what felt like seconds later, there I was, in a Peckham computer exchange shop, queuing furtively for a secondhand Xbox One with a couple of reliably blockbuster games to go with it.</p> <p>The first weeks were a blend of ironic detachment and oppressive nostalgia. It felt acceptable to limit myself to a few hours of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/apr/10/fifa-how-to-set-up-your-own-video-game-sports-tournament\">F</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/apr/10/fifa-how-to-set-up-your-own-video-game-sports-tournament\">ifa</a> or GTA 5 each week, with their veneer of mainstream conformity. This was a habit that could easily be checked and kept under strict control. The world was still what it used to be \u2013 we had social lives, went to work on packed public transport; the great outdoors was still accessible beyond our front doors. Back then, the idea of admitting that I\u2019d become a part-time gamer was something shameful enough to be concealed from all but my closest friends.</p> <p>It took the world being put on hold for the stance of myself and others to soften. Now, my aimless nighttime drives through the pretty chaos of Los Santos has gathered an undeserved dignity. They\u2019re no longer symptoms of an undiagnosed regression into adolescence, but a form of escapism to be envied.

Like so many other slightly uncomfortable things in my life, this occupation started as an ill-defined joke. Wouldn\u2019t it be funny, I thought to myself, if I bought a games console for the first time in a decade. If nothing else, wouldn\u2019t it just be a small, deserved protest against the stresses of adulthood? When I tried to explain this decision to my loved ones, it was greeted with tolerant concern. In the nothing days between Christmas and new year my partner asked if this was a distraction I really needed in a busy life. \u201cJust wait a bit,\u201d she said, as if speaking to a slightly unruly child, \u201cuntil you\u2019re really sure it\u2019s what you want.\u201d And in what felt like seconds later, there I was, in a Peckham computer exchange shop, queuing furtively for a secondhand Xbox One with a couple of reliably blockbuster games to go with it. The first weeks were a blend of ironic detachment and oppressive nostalgia. It felt acceptable to limit myself to a few hours of Fifa or GTA 5 each week, with their veneer of mainstream conformity. This was a habit that could easily be checked and kept under strict control. The world was still what it used to be \u2013 we had social lives, went to work on packed public transport; the great outdoors was still accessible beyond our front doors. Back then, the idea of admitting that I\u2019d become a part-time gamer was something shameful enough to be concealed from all but my closest friends. It took the world being put on hold for the stance of myself and others to soften. Now, my aimless nighttime drives through the pretty chaos of Los Santos has gathered an undeserved dignity. They\u2019re no longer symptoms of an undiagnosed regression into adolescence, but a form of escapism to be envied. In mid-March, a friend I\u2019d confided in about my initial purchase was tapping me for advice. How much, where from, what games to buy? He and I certainly weren\u2019t alone in those early days of panic: game sales experienced a global surge as people across the world sheltered at home.

      "body": "<p>At 2.30pm Rufus Norris, director of the National Theatre and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/07/maria-balshaw-fresh-slate-tate-modern-african-american-new-director-exhibitions-society\"> Maria Balshaw,</a> director of Tate art museums and galleries, convene on screen \u2013 the new abnormal \u2013 for a conversation about the Covid-19 crisis and how they plan to help their institutions survive it. Norris is first to admit our get-together is not ideal as his blurred silhouette appears: \u201cI\u2019m at home, in the bedroom, because it\u2019s the best internet spot. If things get really bad, I\u2019ll have to speak to you on the phone.\u201d Balshaw, at home in Kent, is similarly quick to identify the idiosyncrasies in her new working life: \u201cI\u2019ve got my museum director husband [Nick Merriman, chief executive of Horniman Museum] with me \u2013 we rotate in and out of this room.\u201d</p> \n<p>Erratic bandwidth is the least of the problems Norris and Balshaw face. Before lockdown, there was a \u00a3110bn creative industries sector, the fastest-growing in the UK. Now, the challenge is to keep cultural institutions out of intensive care. For although Arts Council England has launched a \u00a3160m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/arts-council-england-promises-160m-to-buoy-public-during-lockdown\">emergency package across the cultural sector</a>, the longer our museums and theatres remain closed, the more perilous their future becomes. But beyond the immediate question of when the Tate and National might reopen, this is, more positively, a moment of potential change: there are questions of how cultural appetites are altering as art in lockdown becomes more democratic. And questions about whether the Covid-19 crisis will make a good subject for theatre. What sort of art might develop post-lockdown?</p> \n<p>But before looking ahead, it is necessary to look back \u2013 not least because of the way time seems to be behaving in our new world (moving so fast in one sense, so slowly in another). I begin by asking Norris and Balshaw to remember how they felt as they locked down their institutions. Did they have any idea what was to come?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=Arts&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F10d2ecbb86b88b9c952abc700dc2e3038daa3954%3Fcrop%3D727_183_2269_1362&amp;left-caption=Rufus%20Norris.%20Photograph%20by%20Ellie%20Kurttz&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F9f3248ca010a2e55ba710c1852e70db7f180c213%3Fcrop%3D0_223_2616_1570&amp;right-caption=Maria%20Balshaw.%20Photograph%20by%20Jeff%20Spicer%2FGetty&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Rufus Norris and Maria Balshaw\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=Arts&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F10d2ecbb86b88b9c952abc700dc2e3038daa3954%3Fcrop%3D727_183_2269_1362&amp;left-caption=Rufus%20Norris.%20Photograph%20by%20Ellie%20Kurttz&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F9f3248ca010a2e55ba710c1852e70db7f180c213%3Fcrop%3D0_223_2616_1570&amp;right-caption=Maria%20Balshaw.%20Photograph%20by%20Jeff%20Spicer%2FGetty&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\">Rufus Norris and Maria Balshaw</a> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Rufus Norris</strong>: It was very odd because we were told in the most blunt, ill-considered way that people were not to go to theatres before we were given any warning or told to shut. Boris\u2019s announcement came just before a meeting with the cast of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/14/the-visit-review-tony-kushner-olivier-london\">The Visit</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/14/the-visit-review-tony-kushner-olivier-london\">. </a>We decided mutually the actors could not go on. Afterwards, I walked into the Olivier at 7.30 \u2013 the show should already have been running \u2013 and sat in the empty theatre. I remember thinking: how long will it be before I\u2019m back in this theatre again? My overriding thought was about safety. This had all come up very quickly. I felt a bit naive, felt that collectively perhaps we should not have relied on government and made our own call earlier.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ad8e9bcd-00be-4ddd-b106-35b36d6ff39f\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p><strong>Maria Balshaw</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Maria Balshaw is director of the UK\u2019s four Tate art galleries in London, Liverpool and St Ives, a role she has held since 2017.&nbsp; Previously, she was director of the Whitworth, University of Manchester and Manchester City Galleries.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Rufus Norris</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After an illustrious 15 year directing career in the West End and theatres such as the Almeida and the Young Vic, Rufus Norris became artistic director of the National Theatre in 2015.

Free entry is more important than ever.</p> \n<p><strong>RN</strong>: We\u2019re also looking into everything. We\u2019ve a whole team working on creative ideas about social distancing. Can you get people masks? Can you build extra toilets? Can you only pre-order drinks? Can you put plastic screens between people on seats? What happens if you just do every other seat? We\u2019ve cut production budgets in half. We\u2019ve had wage cuts that our brilliant staff have had to take and it\u2019s much worse for freelancers \u2013 they\u2019re in a desperate position.</p> \n<p><strong>The playwright James Graham suggests an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52268447\">\u201caggressive government bailout\u201d</a> is needed\u2026<br>RN</strong>: \u201cAggressive government bailout\u201d feels blunt but we\u2019ll need government support.

People coming back is what we need. I agree with Rufus the job retention scheme has been a godsend but we\u2019ll also need further financial backing from the government. And any challenge for the Tate will be even more threatening for smaller institutions. This is going to be a period of the most acute challenge the arts ecology has ever faced.</p> \n<p><strong>And will smaller theatres survive?<br>RN</strong>: Without support \u2013 no. If this goes on much longer, it\u2019s very hard to imagine any theatre surviving. Whatever it means for the National, you can multiply several times for regional theatres. A lot of our work now is about advocacy to make sure the government, under huge pressure as it is, understands what our sector contributes and how urgent it is that a nuanced, informed view of helping us survive is taken on by them.</p> \n<p><strong>How worried are you by surveys reporting that many people are frightened by the relaxation of lockdown? Does your role include a need to reassure the public?<br>MB</strong>: Our world has changed beyond recognition. It\u2019s understandable people feel fearful. Museums, galleries and the arts have a huge role to play in rebuilding social confidence. People may have to come differently \u2013 book a time slot, come in one way, leave another way. We\u2019ll need to reassure the public the numbers will not put them at risk. And this is urgent because of another challenge our country now faces: people\u2019s emotional wellbeing, social connections and mental health.</p> \n<p><strong>RN</strong>: The worst thing would be if we opened too early because of financial need. If we rushed back and audiences came to our spaces and we hadn\u2019t looked after them properly and they got sick \u2013 that must not be allowed to happen. It would be a disaster if we opened up and had to close down again. Reassurance will only be possible when the time is right.</p> \n<p><strong>I gather you\u2019ve been ill with the virus yourself, Rufus?<br>RN:</strong> I was very ill for a couple of weeks but thankful it didn\u2019t take me to hospital.

You can see the hunger for it and people\u2019s desire to create themselves. The silver lining of what we\u2019re going through is that people have been given time back and are using it to make paintings, throw pots, watch theatre, dance and sing.</p> \n<p><strong>RN</strong>: Or they\u2019re also going back to their photographs or getting creative in the kitchen or garden \u2013 the surge of creativity is really encouraging. There\u2019ll be a generation, won\u2019t there? The lockdown generation \u2013 who really got on with stuff while they had the space.</p> \n<p><strong>MB</strong>: I was particularly moved by the singing on balconies in Italy. It\u2019s people saying: I\u2019ll not be silent in the face of fear. It gets to the heart of why we make art. And then there was Sacha Lord\u2019s livestream Hacienda-style Manchester club night that went on the <em>whole </em>night, attracted millions and raised funds for that bit of the creative sector. What a brilliant idea \u2013 people raving in their own homes! That\u2019s an image I want to hold on to\u2026.</p> \n<p><strong>Meanwhile NT at Home is hugely popular and has received more than \u00a3100,000 in donations\u2026</strong><strong><br>RN:</strong> It\u2019s had 8 million views in the last five weeks. We weren\u2019t expecting the donations but are now able to pay the actors. We\u2019re introducing a broader range of titles. Our initial thinking was: people are going through a tough time, so what do they want? They want a comedy, so <em><a href=\"http://ntlive.nationaltheatre.org.uk/productions/17222-one-man-two-guvnors\">One Man, Two Guvnors</a></em>\u2026 Sometimes, theatre can be a way of saying: \u201cJust relax\u2026\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Will there be a new appetite for live art post-lockdown?<br>MB</strong>: Just as people need to be back out in the world, they need to be seeing and thinking about art \u2013 it\u2019s not a luxury. People have discovered so many new things digitally. It\u2019s the hook that\u2019s going to give them confidence to step out of their front doors again. I\u2019ve made some wonderful discoveries during lockdown such as the live stream of <em><a href=\"https://www.ballet.org.uk/onscreen/watch-party-broken-wings/\">Broken Wings</a></em><a href=\"https://www.ballet.org.uk/onscreen/watch-party-broken-wings/\"> by ENB </a>\u2013 a ballet about Frida Kahlo.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b36e5edc7fa8f783ecd8ad086582811dd2d720b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b36e5edc7fa8f783ecd8ad086582811dd2d720b/0_146_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"English National Ballet has been live-streaming the Frida Kahlo-inspired Broken Wings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">English National Ballet has been live-streaming the Frida Kahlo-inspired Broken Wings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: English National Ballet</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>RN</strong>: I\u2019ve found a variety of things \u2013 I especially enjoyed <em>The Fireman\u2019s Ball</em> by Milo\u0161 Forman. I watched it with my partner and our two sons \u2013 a simple film, a satire. It appealed to our particular, weird, family taste. It\u2019s hilarious. We have, obviously, been spending a lot more time together as a family \u2013 the one unadulterated, wonderful upside of lockdown.</p> \n<p><strong>Are you in touch with colleagues in Europe and the US?<br>MB</strong>: We\u2019re actively in conversation in Europe, North America and beyond \u2013 we\u2019re having Zoom meetings with colleagues in Italy and China because they\u2019re at a different phase \u2013 there\u2019s a huge amount to learn from them. We\u2019re having brilliant creative conversations about how to reschedule touring exhibitions, make sure nobody loses out and let things happen over a longer time frame.</p> \n<p><strong>RN: </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/09/on-my-radar-david-lans-madonna-nuri-bilge-ceylan-golborne-road-message-in-a-bottle-black-jeans\">David Lan</a> [playwright and director] recently organised a call with European, American and British artistic directors. In normal times, theatre can be a competitive environment but we all believe in what this sector brings to society and we\u2019re working together.</p> \n<p><strong>Will lockdown/coronavirus make a good subject for art/theatre?<br>RN</strong>: Yes \u2013 although it is difficult when you\u2019re in the middle of something to understand what impact it will have. But new writing is sure to emerge\u2026 If we reopen in September, what will people want to watch? They\u2019re going to be nervous. We\u2019ll have to give them a good reason to come and make it a real event\u2026</p> \n<p><strong>MB:</strong> Early in lockdown, one of my staff \u2013 an artist \u2013 sent a lovely message saying: \u201cThe artists among us have been practising lockdown for some time.\u201d Unlike theatre-makers, artists depend on time apart. But it is possible lockdown might make artists focus in a new way. The deep emotional issues raised by this virus will infiltrate their minds as they have ours.</p> \n<p><strong>What specifically are the emotional issues?<br>MB:</strong> We\u2019ve been going through a period of collective mourning because we took everyday social contact for granted \u2013 that sense of ourselves as human beings as part of a larger social whole. That\u2019s been fundamentally challenged. We operated societally and individually as though we could overcome anything. We could fix things, cure things or pay to get ourselves out of difficult situations. None of those options has been open to us. Living with a sense of uncertainty is what people have been having to get used to. You can see they\u2019re desperate for resolution: <em>please tell us the answers.</em> The truth is we don\u2019t know how we are going to recover. Yet once we know we can reopen, I think we\u2019ll definitely be ready.</p> \n<p><strong>RN</strong>: Having been starved of live art, it\u2019ll be like coming back to food you have been denied, there\u2019ll be a great appetite for it. The crucial thing is to make sure we are there for audiences when that happens.</p> \n<p><em>The National Theatre is streaming productions for free on YouTube as part of National Theatre at Home (<a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/nt-at-home\">nationaltheatre.org.uk/nt-at-home</a>)</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "At 2.30pm Rufus Norris, director of the National Theatre and Maria Balshaw, director of Tate art museums and galleries, convene on screen \u2013 the new abnormal \u2013 for a conversation about the Covid-19 crisis and how they plan to help their institutions survive it. Norris is first to admit our get-together is not ideal as his blurred silhouette appears: \u201cI\u2019m at home, in the bedroom, because it\u2019s the best internet spot. If things get really bad, I\u2019ll have to speak to you on the phone.\u201d Balshaw, at home in Kent, is similarly quick to identify the idiosyncrasies in her new working life: \u201cI\u2019ve got my museum director husband [Nick Merriman, chief executive of Horniman Museum] with me \u2013 we rotate in and out of this room.\u201d Erratic bandwidth is the least of the problems Norris and Balshaw face. Before lockdown, there was a \u00a3110bn creative industries sector, the fastest-growing in the UK. Now, the challenge is to keep cultural institutions out of intensive care. For although Arts Council England has launched a \u00a3160m emergency package across the cultural sector, the longer our museums and theatres remain closed, the more perilous their future becomes. But beyond the immediate question of when the Tate and National might reopen, this is, more positively, a moment of potential change: there are questions of how cultural appetites are altering as art in lockdown becomes more democratic. And questions about whether the Covid-19 crisis will make a good subject for theatre. What sort of art might develop post-lockdown? But before looking ahead, it is necessary to look back \u2013 not least because of the way time seems to be behaving in our new world (moving so fast in one sense, so slowly in another). I begin by asking Norris and Balshaw to remember how they felt as they locked down their institutions. Did they have any idea what was to come? Rufus Norris: It was very odd because we were told in the most blunt, ill-considered way that people were not to go to theatres before we were given any warning or told to shut. Boris\u2019s announcement came just before a meeting with the cast of The Visit. We decided mutually the actors could not go on. Afterwards, I walked into the Olivier at 7.30 \u2013 the show should already have been running \u2013 and sat in the empty theatre. I remember thinking: how long will it be before I\u2019m back in this theatre again? My overriding thought was about safety. This had all come up very quickly. I felt a bit naive, felt that collectively perhaps we should not have relied on government and made our own call earlier. Maria Balshaw: Like Rufus, looking back, I wonder why I didn\u2019t realise sooner that what happened needed to happen. The truth is we were all living in real time and society as a whole didn\u2019t realise. I remember the acute strangeness of opening the Andy Warhol show at Tate Modern on 10 March. Our donors did not want to be there \u2013 already worried about the virus. The president of the Andy Warhol Foundation had flown over from New York and was saying: \u201cEveryone thinks I\u2019m crazy but I wanted to be here and witness this.\u201d The opening felt incredibly celebratory yet presaging of disaster to come. How have your feelings changed over the ensuing weeks? RN: It\u2019s been so fast-moving. The problem with closing down an organisation on the scale of the National is it takes a huge amount of effort, furloughing \u2013 nobody even knew how to spell that word a few weeks ago \u2013 and emergency planning. It\u2019s like scrabbling in a swimming pool, trying to find the steps. When you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on for a long period, it\u2019s incredibly wearing. As the leader of an organisation, you\u2019re not doing the job unless you look at the worst so you can start trying to plan ahead. MB: At the beginning, it was shocking but people thought the crisis would last three weeks. Possibly six. Now we\u2019re at a moment where we have to think about more than the recovery of individual institutions and our sectors. We\u2019ve got to start thinking: how do we shape the world for the new normal? The pressures we\u2019re under \u2013 financial, practical and emotional \u2013 mean we\u2019ll not be the same on the other side. When do you expect to open? RN: That\u2019s the million-dollar question. Maria and I are in different sectors from that point of view \u2013 our business is about bringing large groups of people together. About 60 to 70% of the National\u2019s income comes from people visiting and buying tickets. We\u2019re very supportive of the government\u2019s policy on social distancing. But the reality, in blunt terms, is that if we have two metres social distancing we can only sell one ticket in six or seven \u2013 which is not viable. Teatro Franco Parenti in Milan is reducing seating from 500 to 65\u2026 RN: With the levels of subsidy in some European houses, that might be worth it but it\u2019s out of the question for a commercial theatre. Cameron Mackintosh says theatres are unlikely to reopen until 2021 \u2013 is this unduly pessimistic? RN: He\u2019s possibly right: he\u2019s talking about his theatres getting back to a place where audiences are comfortable to come back in large numbers. That\u2019s going to require audience confidence which may only return when there\u2019s a vaccine.

I wouldn\u2019t want to put a barrier in the way of anyone coming. Free entry is more important than ever. RN: We\u2019re also looking into everything. We\u2019ve a whole team working on creative ideas about social distancing. Can you get people masks? Can you build extra toilets? Can you only pre-order drinks? Can you put plastic screens between people on seats? What happens if you just do every other seat? We\u2019ve cut production budgets in half. We\u2019ve had wage cuts that our brilliant staff have had to take and it\u2019s much worse for freelancers \u2013 they\u2019re in a desperate position. The playwright James Graham suggests an \u201caggressive government bailout\u201d is needed\u2026 RN: \u201cAggressive government bailout\u201d feels blunt but we\u2019ll need government support. The Arts Council does not expect us to fulfil our duties during lockdown \u2013 it\u2019s not as if we have zero money coming in. MB: We too have a grant in aid but, like the National, Tate earns 70% of its income through visitors. People coming back is what we need. I agree with Rufus the job retention scheme has been a godsend but we\u2019ll also need further financial backing from the government. And any challenge for the Tate will be even more threatening for smaller institutions. This is going to be a period of the most acute challenge the arts ecology has ever faced. And will smaller theatres survive? RN: Without support \u2013 no. If this goes on much longer, it\u2019s very hard to imagine any theatre surviving. Whatever it means for the National, you can multiply several times for regional theatres. A lot of our work now is about advocacy to make sure the government, under huge pressure as it is, understands what our sector contributes and how urgent it is that a nuanced, informed view of helping us survive is taken on by them. How worried are you by surveys reporting that many people are frightened by the relaxation of lockdown? Does your role include a need to reassure the public? MB: Our world has changed beyond recognition. It\u2019s understandable people feel fearful. Museums, galleries and the arts have a huge role to play in rebuilding social confidence. People may have to come differently \u2013 book a time slot, come in one way, leave another way. We\u2019ll need to reassure the public the numbers will not put them at risk. And this is urgent because of another challenge our country now faces: people\u2019s emotional wellbeing, social connections and mental health. RN: The worst thing would be if we opened too early because of financial need. If we rushed back and audiences came to our spaces and we hadn\u2019t looked after them properly and they got sick \u2013 that must not be allowed to happen. It would be a disaster if we opened up and had to close down again. Reassurance will only be possible when the time is right. I gather you\u2019ve been ill with the virus yourself, Rufus? RN: I was very ill for a couple of weeks but thankful it didn\u2019t take me to hospital. I know a lot of people who have been very ill. Has this period made you reflect on what your jobs are for now that getting bums on seats/people through doors is out of the equation? MB: We\u2019re dealing with large-scale disaster management yet, in a more profound way, this crisis reminds us why human beings need art. You can see the hunger for it and people\u2019s desire to create themselves. The silver lining of what we\u2019re going through is that people have been given time back and are using it to make paintings, throw pots, watch theatre, dance and sing. RN: Or they\u2019re also going back to their photographs or getting creative in the kitchen or garden \u2013 the surge of creativity is really encouraging. There\u2019ll be a generation, won\u2019t there? The lockdown generation \u2013 who really got on with stuff while they had the space. MB: I was particularly moved by the singing on balconies in Italy. It\u2019s people saying: I\u2019ll not be silent in the face of fear. It gets to the heart of why we make art. And then there was Sacha Lord\u2019s livestream Hacienda-style Manchester club night that went on the whole night, attracted millions and raised funds for that bit of the creative sector. What a brilliant idea \u2013 people raving in their own homes! That\u2019s an image I want to hold on to\u2026. Meanwhile NT at Home is hugely popular and has received more than \u00a3100,000 in donations\u2026 RN: It\u2019s had 8 million views in the last five weeks. We weren\u2019t expecting the donations but are now able to pay the actors. We\u2019re introducing a broader range of titles. Our initial thinking was: people are going through a tough time, so what do they want? They want a comedy, so One Man, Two Guvnors\u2026 Sometimes, theatre can be a way of saying: \u201cJust relax\u2026\u201d Will there be a new appetite for live art post-lockdown? MB: Just as people need to be back out in the world, they need to be seeing and thinking about art \u2013 it\u2019s not a luxury. People have discovered so many new things digitally. It\u2019s the hook that\u2019s going to give them confidence to step out of their front doors again. I\u2019ve made some wonderful discoveries during lockdown such as the live stream of Broken Wings by ENB \u2013 a ballet about Frida Kahlo. RN: I\u2019ve found a variety of things \u2013 I especially enjoyed The Fireman\u2019s Ball by Milo\u0161 Forman. I watched it with my partner and our two sons \u2013 a simple film, a satire. It appealed to our particular, weird, family taste. It\u2019s hilarious. We have, obviously, been spending a lot more time together as a family \u2013 the one unadulterated, wonderful upside of lockdown. Are you in touch with colleagues in Europe and the US? MB: We\u2019re actively in conversation in Europe, North America and beyond \u2013 we\u2019re having Zoom meetings with colleagues in Italy and China because they\u2019re at a different phase \u2013 there\u2019s a huge amount to learn from them. We\u2019re having brilliant creative conversations about how to reschedule touring exhibitions, make sure nobody loses out and let things happen over a longer time frame. RN: David Lan [playwright and director] recently organised a call with European, American and British artistic directors. In normal times, theatre can be a competitive environment but we all believe in what this sector brings to society and we\u2019re working together. Will lockdown/coronavirus make a good subject for art/theatre? RN: Yes \u2013 although it is difficult when you\u2019re in the middle of something to understand what impact it will have. But new writing is sure to emerge\u2026 If we reopen in September, what will people want to watch? They\u2019re going to be nervous. We\u2019ll have to give them a good reason to come and make it a real event\u2026 MB: Early in lockdown, one of my staff \u2013 an artist \u2013 sent a lovely message saying: \u201cThe artists among us have been practising lockdown for some time.\u201d Unlike theatre-makers, artists depend on time apart. But it is possible lockdown might make artists focus in a new way. The deep emotional issues raised by this virus will infiltrate their minds as they have ours. What specifically are the emotional issues? MB: We\u2019ve been going through a period of collective mourning because we took everyday social contact for granted \u2013 that sense of ourselves as human beings as part of a larger social whole. That\u2019s been fundamentally challenged. We operated societally and individually as though we could overcome anything. We could fix things, cure things or pay to get ourselves out of difficult situations. None of those options has been open to us. Living with a sense of uncertainty is what people have been having to get used to. You can see they\u2019re desperate for resolution: please tell us the answers. The truth is we don\u2019t know how we are going to recover. Yet once we know we can reopen, I think we\u2019ll definitely be ready. RN: Having been starved of live art, it\u2019ll be like coming back to food you have been denied, there\u2019ll be a great appetite for it. The crucial thing is to make sure we are there for audiences when that happens.

The IfG\u2019s stark warning comes after Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister, said last week that checks on goods heading from great Britain to Northern Ireland would be needed to maintain \u201cdisease-free status\u201d on the island of Ireland, with border inspection posts for agrifood. It contradicted Johnson\u2019s repeated vow that there would be no checks. The IfG, however, suggests that more sweeping changes will be needed than those admitted by Gove. \u201cThe protocol creates a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea, which the UK will be legally obliged to administer under supervision from EU institutions,\u201d it states. \u201cNorthern Ireland will remain part of the UK customs territory but will be required to align with EU rules on customs and regulations. \u201cThe UK government must recognise the scale of the implementation task and make it a government priority even in these difficult times. The UK needs to scale up existing systems for customs administration, design and implement new systems for tariff administration and compensation and develop new capacity for regulatory checks. \u201cWith UK ministers only recently publicly stating what additional processes may be needed, progress so far has been slow. With 64 departments, public bodies and agencies across the UK with scope for involvement in the implementation of the protocol, clarity on what is required is key.\u201d Its analysis also warns that the protocol arrangements will be voted on by the Northern Ireland assembly every four to eight years, making it a \u201cpotentially destabilising issue\u201d for years to come.",

In this economy?!</h2> <p>In news that should surprise absolutely nobody, Americans are having fewer kids. US birthrates have fallen to a 35-year low, according to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr-8-508.pdf\">new federal data</a>. Around 3.75m babies were born in America in 2019, down 1% from the previous year. Birthrates dropped among women of basically every age and race group, but <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/498724-us-birth-rate-hits-35-year-low\">rose slightly among women in their early 40s</a>.</p> <p>The total fertility rate (which estimates the number of births that a hypothetical group of 1,000 women would have over their lifetime) is also at a record low. American women are now projected to have about 1.71 children over their lifetimes, which is below the rate of 2.1 needed to completely replace a generation.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out why Americans are having fewer kids. The government makes a big song and dance about how much it loves fetuses, but it is actively hostile to parents. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/27/maternity-leave-us-policy-worst-worlds-richest-countries\">US is the only OECD country</a> without national statutory paid maternity, paternity or parental leave, for one thing. Then there\u2019s the financial cost of simply delivering the kid. America is the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/16/why-does-it-cost-32093-just-to-give-birth-in-america\">expensive place in the world to have a baby</a> \u2013 and it may be one of the only places in the world where hospitals charge you <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-37555048\">just for holding your child</a>. One couple found a $39.35 charge on their hospital bill for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-37555048\">skin-to-skin\u201d contact</a> after their baby was born.</p> <p>Because of the Kafkaesque nature of America\u2019s healthcare system, it\u2019s hard to pin down how much the cost of an average birth is, but one 2013 estimate put it at around <a href=\"http://transform.childbirthconnection.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Cost-of-Having-a-Baby-Executive-Summary.pdf\">$32,093</a>. That\u2019s just for an uncomplicated vaginal birth, by the way. If you have a complicated pregnancy and bad (or no) insurance you can very easily find yourself getting bankrupted by the medical bills.</p> <p>Once you have the child, you have to deal with astronomical childcare costs. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/why-child-care-so-expensive/602599/\">The Atlantic</a> notes that, since the 1990s, childcare costs have grown <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/7/17/5909651/5-charts-that-show-child-care-in-the-us-is-brokenBut\">twice as fast</a> as overall inflation. The average cost of a full-time childcare program is now <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/THP_The51__Cascio_0419.pdf\">$16,000 a year</a> \u2013 which, in some states, is more than university tuition. Meanwhile, many millennial parents are <a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/millennial-life-how-young-adulthood-today-compares-with-prior-generations/\">still paying off their own student debt</a>.</p> <p>While there have been a lot of jokes about a coronavirus baby boom, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/covid-19-fertility-birth-rate-baby-boom-pregnancy-1003104/\">experts think it is likely</a> that the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic will cause birth rates to drop further. Now, more than ever, kids are becoming a luxury only a few can afford.</p> <h2><strong>Lana Del Rey engages in some \u2018misogynoir\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In a rather <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/11/chrissy-teigen-alison-roman-food-fight\">Alison Roman-esque move</a> the singer recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/21/lana-del-rey-criticising-peers-undermines-feminist-argument\">lashed out at a group of female artists</a>, most of whom were black women.

The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is expected to announce next week that employers will have to begin contributing as the lockdown is eased further, according to the Times. Employers will be permitted to take furloughed workers back part-time, and all employers using the coronavirus job retention scheme will be required to make the payments, even if they remain closed, according to the paper. The Treasury said it was \u201cnot steering away\u201d from the story, which is understood to have been briefed by officials, and it did not deny its accuracy. A Treasury source told the Times: \u201cWe\u2019ve got two full months of support left and afterwards the government will help to pay people\u2019s wages, but it\u2019s fair to everyone that businesses contribute as they get back to work.\u201d Sunak has said the furlough scheme will be in place until at least October. Companies are to be asked to start sharing the cost from the start of August, which could in effect force many employers to assess whether certain jobs remain viable. The Financial Times quoted a business leader this month as saying: \u201cIf the furlough scheme is paying for jobs that don\u2019t really exist, it\u2019s better to release people into the job market to start looking for other work.\u201d The Treasury will reportedly direct employers to cover between 20% and 30% of an employee\u2019s wage, and firms will also pay their national insurance contributions, which to about 5% of wages. The furlough scheme pays 80% of a worker\u2019s salary up to \u00a32,500 a month, and is supporting about 7.5m jobs, representing about a third of the private-sector workforce. The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the scheme could cost up to \u00a380bn. The Treasury was criticised this month after an anonymous official briefed that the nation was becoming \u201caddicted\u201d to the programme.

      "body": "<p>From garden barbecue beers to Friday night Zoom drinks, we Britons haven\u2019t let the lockdown stop us from boozing. As pubs and bars remain closed, sales of alcohol have soared \u2013 but one tipple has proved surprisingly popular: tequila. According to Waitrose, sales of tequila increased by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52561241\">more than 175% between 24 March and the end of April</a>. In the US, too, the market researcher Nielsen found that tequila <a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2020/05/tequila-sales-soar-in-us-during-lockdown/\">sales were up 55%</a> during those two months.</p> <p>So why have we all been reaching for the salt and lemon? Actually, we probably haven\u2019t. The (<a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2015/03/how-to-drink-tequila-like-a-mexican/5/\">not particularly traditional</a>) <em>tequila cruda</em> ritual has gradually fallen out of favour, with the spirit gaining popularity as a cocktail ingredient instead. In the US, the sales spike may be attributed to Cinco de Mayo celebrations \u2013 commemorating the Mexican army\u2019s 1862 victory over France \u2013 which took place at the beginning of this month. But the increase in demand could also be down to the fact that production of tequila, which can be made only in Mexico, has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fdfa6ea-62fa-4eeb-8971-f0025809401a\">allowed to continue during the coronavirus crisis</a>. The spirit is deemed an agricultural product, while breweries, for example, have been forced to close.</p> <p>\u201cTequila is associated with holidays and being at the beach, and while people are in lockdown they want to replicate that feeling a little bit,\u201d says Eduardo Gomez, the owner of Mex Grocer and the founder of London\u2019s Tequila &amp; Mezcal festival.

Put 50ml of 100% blanco tequila, 25ml of fresh squeezed lime juice and 15ml of agave syrup in a shaker \u2013 or any container with a lid \u2013 and shake vigorously. Serve straight up in a martini glass or on the rocks in a tumbler glass, no salt rim needed. A tommy\u2019s margarita is great paired with foods that use corn and chillies: tacos, guacamole \u2026 You can also add a spoon of chilli sauce or fresh jalape\u00f1o and coriander to this drink to make a <a href=\"https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/4723/picante-de-la-casa-soho-house-tonic\">picante de la casa</a> cocktail.</p> <h2><strong>The macario</strong></h2> <p><em>Victor Tutuianu, bar manager at <a href=\"https://www.lostalpaca.com/\">the Lost Alpaca</a> bar at Lima Floral, London</em></p> <p>Take 30ml of tequila (we recommend Patr\u00f3n Anejo), 15ml of bourbon (any decent one will do), 50ml fresh pineapple juice, 20ml sugar syrup (easy to make at home \u2013 just mix one part water and two parts sugar), 25ml fresh lime juice, a vanilla pod (or dash of vanilla syrup/essence) and two drops of orange bitters.

An espresso martini is a good introduction because the tequila is surrounded by familiar flavours. Ordinarily, an espresso martini contains vodka, but our version is a bit richer, with more caramel flavours.</p> <p>Add 40ml of espresso (the fresher the better) to 30ml of reposado tequila (reposado means it is aged for two to 12 months in barrels, so it has more sweetness and more vanilla or butterscotch flavours); we use Vivir. Blend with 20ml of coffee liqueur (we use Kahlua, but Patr\u00f3n Cafe is just as good), 15ml of agave syrup, a pinch of kosher salt and a couple of ice cubes. You want to get some texture into the drink and this can be done using a Nutribullet or hand blender. Alternatively, half-fill a sports bottle with ice and give it a really good shake.

Then add to a tall glass with 50ml blanco tequila and 25ml freshly squeezed lime and lemon juice (equal measures of each). Top up with soda water or bitter lemon and ice cubes, and stir.

The government\u2019s slogan at the time was \u201cstay at home, protect the NHS, save lives\u201d. A Labour spokesperson said: \u201cThe lockdown rules were very clear: if you or anyone in your household was suspected of having Covid-19 you must immediately self-isolate and not leave the house. However, the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser appears to believe that it is one rule for him and another for the British people. \u201cThis will cause understandable anger for the millions of people who have sacrificed so much during this crisis.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A Missouri hairstylist may have exposed 91 customers and coworkers to coronavirus, public health officials said, after the state\u2019s governor allowed businesses including salons to reopen on 4 May. The stylist who tested positive for Covid-19 worked at a salon in Springfield on eight different days while experiencing coronavirus symptoms. Because the stylist and the customers wore face coverings, health officials said on Friday, they hoped the interactions would lead to \u201cno additional cases\u201d. Those potentially exposed would be contacted and offered testing, officials said. The potential exposures started little more than a week after Missouri allowed salons to reopen. The push by Donald Trump and some state governors to reopen most businesses with some public health modifications, such as social distancing and masks, comes as public health officials warn that relaxing restrictions will certainly lead to new outbreaks. Dr Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House\u2019s coronavirus taskforce, said on Friday that new local outbreaks were \u201cinevitable\u201d as prevention measures are loosened. But on Thursday, at a visit to a Ford automobile plant in Michigan, the president once again emphasized his focus on getting the economy moving, and the stock market recovered, as soon as possible. \u201cA permanent lockdown is not a strategy for a health state or a healthy country,\u201d Trump said on Thursday. \u201cOur country wasn\u2019t meant to be shut down. \u201cThis country is poised for an epic comeback,\u201d he said. \u201cJust watch. It\u2019s already happening.\u201d As of Saturday morning, according to figures collected by Johns Hopkins University, more than 1.6m cases of Covid-19 had been confirmed in the US, with more than 96,000 deaths. In debates over how quickly to reopen different businesses across the country, barbershops and hair salons have become a political flashpoint among conservative Americans, with some owners reopening in defiance of public health measures. In Michigan, a barber who refused to close his shop despite shelter-at-home orders staged a hair-cutting protest at the state capitol which he dubbed \u201cOperation Haircut\u201d, the Lansing State Journal reported. In Texas, a hair salon owner who was briefly jailed after keeping her business open in defiance of public health orders, and who then refused to apologize in court for what she had done, has been championed by Republican leaders. The Texas senator Ted Cruz visited her salon for a haircut. In Missouri, county health officials said local residents who had been in the same location as the hairstylist with coronavirus but who had not had direct contact were \u201cbelieved to be at very low risk\u201d. While infectious, the same individual also visited a Walmart and a Dairy Queen and made three visits to a local gym, they said. Missouri\u2019s governor, Michael Parson, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the potential exposures of 91 people at a hair salon would alter the state\u2019s thinking on whether salons and barbershops should remain open during the pandemic. Missouri\u2019s current public health guidance will expire on 31 May. The state has said it will re-evaluate the plan and may tighten some restrictions or loosen others.",

At the same time, I realise that, realistically, for many people, the situation is impossible and issuing vaguely gung-ho advice is unhelpful, bordering on offensive.</p> <p>What a mess \u2013 one that predates coronavirus and is yet another pressure on an already beleaguered age group who have every right to feel cursed.

Trump has been widely criticised for not wearing a mask, such as during a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/21/trump-ford-factory-mask-michigan\">recent visit</a> to the Ford car plant in Michigan. The state\u2019s attorney general pointed out that it was law to wear a mask in that setting, calling Trump a \u201cpetulant child\u201d.</p> <p>At the time, I thought Trump was in campaigning mode, trying to put across a \u201cstrongman of Covid-19\u201d image. Vladimir Putin also tried to be ultra-masculinist at the start of the pandemic, and of course there\u2019s our own hand-shaking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-with-coronavirus\">Boris Johnson</a> (you know, before he ended up in hospital). I could even imagine Trump\u2019s macho stance being worked into his campaign. It still looks likely that Trump fears being \u201cunmanned\u201d by a mask. However, there may be an additional explanation.</p> <p>A photo has surfaced of Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/pictures-show-donald-trump-wearing-mask-after-ford-factory-row\">wearing a mask</a> earlier in the day of the Ford plant visit. There\u2019s also his clarification: \u201cI had [a mask] on before. I wore one in the back area. I didn\u2019t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.\u201d</p> <p>Let\u2019s get this straight: the world is getting to grips with a pandemic, people are dying, and the US president\u2019s prime concern is not to give the press \u201cthe pleasure\u201d of seeing him in a mask? Psst, Donald, you\u2019re the president now, not still hosting <em>The Apprentice</em>. This is reality, not reality television. It\u2019s about lives, not ratings. Which is a long way of saying \u2013 dude, quit your embarrassing bitch-fight with the media, and put on the damn mask.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t about Trump being thin-skinned and immature (that ship sailed); it\u2019s about how thin-skinned and immature he clearly doesn\u2019t mind being seen to be. Good luck to America during the coronavirus crisis. It needs it.</p> <h2>A great beauty and a big pain.

Let\u2019s celebrate her being a giant pain in the backside. I mean it. Campbell is one of the great beauties of her era \u2013 but I also like her attitude. Well, generally. There was that vile business when she <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/17/nyregion/17naomi.html\">threw her phone</a> at her maid. Another incident involving <a href=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/naomi-campbell-in-air-rage-row-973267\">air rage</a>. (No excuses). Campbell also <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/tyra-banks-naomi-campbell-model-conflict-feud-paris-black-a9015211.html\">bullied fellow model</a> Tyra Banks (out of insecurity because there wasn\u2019t \u201croom\u201d for two big black models, but it\u2019s still awful).</p> <p>However, some of us felt that Campbell was unfairly <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1029322/Mandela-personally-bans-air-rage-Naomi-Campbell-stage-90th-birthday-concert.html\">publicly shamed</a> when she was excluded from the big Nelson Mandela 90th birthday tribute concert in 2008. Mandela called Campbell his \u201chonorary daughter\u201d, she\u2019d visited South Africa to support him numerous times, and she was an inspiration to black girls the world over. Meanwhile, Queen were playing at the concert. That\u2019s Queen, who infamously (and lucratively) played Sun City in South Africa during the apartheid era when Mandela was jailed. </p> <p>All that aside, throughout her career Campbell has been deliciously unapologetic about knowing her worth, and tirelessly outspoken about the racism infesting the fashion, advertising and magazine industries. Campbell isn\u2019t perfect (she\u2019s just spent a lot of time looking perfect), but few could deny that she\u2019s stood up to be counted. Happy birthday, Naomi.</p> <p>\u2022Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist</p>",

At the same time, I realise that, realistically, for many people, the situation is impossible and issuing vaguely gung-ho advice is unhelpful, bordering on offensive. What a mess \u2013 one that predates coronavirus and is yet another pressure on an already beleaguered age group who have every right to feel cursed. In a fully functioning society, younger people wouldn\u2019t be afraid to have babies. Trump\u2019s games with masks betray the victims Over to America, where the Trump mask drama (\u201cOn or off, Mr President?\u201d) continues. Trump has been widely criticised for not wearing a mask, such as during a recent visit to the Ford car plant in Michigan. The state\u2019s attorney general pointed out that it was law to wear a mask in that setting, calling Trump a \u201cpetulant child\u201d. At the time, I thought Trump was in campaigning mode, trying to put across a \u201cstrongman of Covid-19\u201d image. Vladimir Putin also tried to be ultra-masculinist at the start of the pandemic, and of course there\u2019s our own hand-shaking Boris Johnson (you know, before he ended up in hospital). I could even imagine Trump\u2019s macho stance being worked into his campaign. It still looks likely that Trump fears being \u201cunmanned\u201d by a mask. However, there may be an additional explanation. A photo has surfaced of Trump wearing a mask earlier in the day of the Ford plant visit. There\u2019s also his clarification: \u201cI had [a mask] on before. I wore one in the back area. I didn\u2019t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.\u201d Let\u2019s get this straight: the world is getting to grips with a pandemic, people are dying, and the US president\u2019s prime concern is not to give the press \u201cthe pleasure\u201d of seeing him in a mask? Psst, Donald, you\u2019re the president now, not still hosting The Apprentice. This is reality, not reality television. It\u2019s about lives, not ratings. Which is a long way of saying \u2013 dude, quit your embarrassing bitch-fight with the media, and put on the damn mask. This isn\u2019t about Trump being thin-skinned and immature (that ship sailed); it\u2019s about how thin-skinned and immature he clearly doesn\u2019t mind being seen to be. Good luck to America during the coronavirus crisis. It needs it. A great beauty and a big pain. Happy 50th, Naomi Model Naomi Campbell has turned 50. Let\u2019s celebrate her being a giant pain in the backside. I mean it. Campbell is one of the great beauties of her era \u2013 but I also like her attitude. Well, generally. There was that vile business when she threw her phone at her maid. Another incident involving air rage. (No excuses). Campbell also bullied fellow model Tyra Banks (out of insecurity because there wasn\u2019t \u201croom\u201d for two big black models, but it\u2019s still awful). However, some of us felt that Campbell was unfairly publicly shamed when she was excluded from the big Nelson Mandela 90th birthday tribute concert in 2008. Mandela called Campbell his \u201chonorary daughter\u201d, she\u2019d visited South Africa to support him numerous times, and she was an inspiration to black girls the world over. Meanwhile, Queen were playing at the concert. That\u2019s Queen, who infamously (and lucratively) played Sun City in South Africa during the apartheid era when Mandela was jailed. All that aside, throughout her career Campbell has been deliciously unapologetic about knowing her worth, and tirelessly outspoken about the racism infesting the fashion, advertising and magazine industries. Campbell isn\u2019t perfect (she\u2019s just spent a lot of time looking perfect), but few could deny that she\u2019s stood up to be counted. Happy birthday, Naomi. \u2022Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

What a day.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dominic Cummings has the \u201cfull support\u201d of the prime minister, despite travelling 250 miles to County Durham during the lockdown.</strong> Boris Johnson faced rising pressure to sack his key adviser after the Guardian and Mirror revealed he drove from London with his wife and child to his parents\u2019 property in Durham after his wife developed coronavirus symptoms after lockdown was introduced in March. It remains unclear what the prime minister knew about Cummings\u2019 whereabouts while he was self-isolating with the illness and \u201cstaying put\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/23/grant-shapps-defends-dominic-cummings-over-lockdown-breach\">Pressed on the issue at the daily press briefing, Grant Shapps</a> said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can tell you the PM provides Mr Cummings with his full support.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Senior cabinet ministers publicly backed the PM\u2019s top aide, suggesting the issue was simply one of good parenting and had been politicised.</strong> This contradicted an earlier statement from Durham police which said it acted in line with national policing guidance when officers reiterated the advice around essential travel to the owner of the property in Durham. Cummings justified the journey by saying his four-year-old son would have been left without care and so they were \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d, even though his wife was symptomatic at the time and the public had been advised against all but essential travel, not to let children be around their grandparents, and for anyone with symptoms (and their households) to self-isolate immediately for 14 days. </li> \n   <li><strong>Labour and the SNP have each written to the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, asking for an urgent inquiry into what the prime minister knew about the incident and what role the government played in keeping it under wraps.</strong> The SNP have called on the head of the civil service to investigate \u201cthe rule-breaking and the Tory government\u2019s cover-up\u201d of Cummings\u2019 lockdown journey \u201cas a matter of serious public concern\u201d. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have written to Sir Mark Sedwill seeking an immediate investigation into the rule-breaking and the Tory government\u2019s cover-up - and to call for Dominic Cummings to resign or be sacked.</p> \n   <p>Boris Johnson must answer serious questions about his role in this incident and the cover-up - including when he found out, when he heard about the police action, why Mr Cummings wasn\u2019t sacked immediately, and why he kept the public in the dark for eight weeks until a newspaper broke the story.</p> \n   <p>Dominic Cummings\u2019 position is completely untenable.</p> \n   <p>This is a matter of leadership and judgment for the prime minister who must prevent lasting damage to his government and his own reputation.</p> \n   <p>Millions of us have made huge sacrifices over the months to obey the rules, while Boris Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser was breaking them.</p> \n   <p>There cannot be one rule for the Tory government and another for the rest of us.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The government seemed to suggest it is now up to individuals to ensure they are safeguarding themselves or people within their household.</strong> This has left many people wondering why, if there was always room for interpretation, people were instructed clearly to stay at home and observe social distancing since 23 March. It has left many parents across the country angry that they have struggled during lockdown with childcare, made sacrifices and not accepted help from relatives in order to adhere to the rules and protect loved ones.</li> \n   <li><strong>However, the guidance remains that anyone showing symptoms should take themselves out of society immediately and the whole household should self-isolate, Dr Jenny Harries reiterated.</strong> The deputy chief medical officer for England added that there was an element of \u201ccommon sense\u201d when it came to safeguarding if there was an individual at extreme risk, eg a sick child, elderly person or clinically vulnerable individual.</li> \n   <li><strong>And the government released new funding to restore public transport back to a full timetable.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>And that brings us to the end of a long, tumultuous day for Boris Johnson\u2019s government. A huge thank you to everybody who got in touch with thoughts and comments throughout the day, and to all of you for reading along.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from us on the UK side.

Duell said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Had we accepted her help, we would have felt too guilty for breaking the rules of \u2018stay at home\u2019.</p> \n   <p>Whilst Dominic Cummings was heading to Durham to receive support for childcare whilst suffering from coronavirus symptoms, myself and my wife found ourself in the same position.</p> \n   <p>Cummings said he did the right thing, we all want the best for our families, but we have been forced to do this in light of the government advice. </p> \n   <p>Once again the general public have been let down, the sacrifices we all make mean nothing to this government if they so blatantly break the rules then fail to accept any responsibility.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Another couple who fell ill with symptoms in mid-March, said they did not travel the half mile to take their primary-aged children to their grandparents or the 50 miles to take them to an aunt and uncle, because they, too, were mindful of the \u201cstay at home\u201d message. They said it never occurred to them that they could or should do differently.</p> \n  <p>The government\u2019s guidelines at the time stated:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Can I leave my home while self-isolating?</p> \n   <p> If you or someone you live with has symptoms of coronavirus: <br></p> \n   <ul> \n    <li><strong>Do not leave the house for any reason</strong> \u2013 if you need food, or medicine, order it online or by phone, or ask someone to deliver it to your home.</li> \n    <li><strong>Do not have visitors in your home</strong> \u2013 including friends and family</li> \n    <li><strong>Do any exercise at home</strong> \u2013 you can use your garden, if you have one</li> \n   </ul> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T14:15:00.659Z\">at 3.15pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec9227a8f0886ce4f5d910d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T13:18:44.079Z\">2.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is the moment <strong>Dominic Cummings</strong> told reporters he did the \u201cright thing\u201d by travelling 260 miles from London to Durham to be near relatives during the lockdown. </p> \n  <p>Cummings is facing calls to quit over the journey, which he made when his wife had Covid-19 symptoms.

I had not thought so, but the government\u2019s defence of<strong> Dominic Cummings</strong> \u2013 who is claimed to have respected the guidelines despite driving 260 miles with suspected coronavirus \u2013 raises questions that millions of people will want clarifying. Were we all mistaken? What did \u201cstay home, save lives, protect the NHS\u201d actually mean?</p> \n  <p>When <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> introduced the UK lockdown he gave \u201ca very simple instruction - you must stay at home\u201d. <br></p> \n  <p>The rules, announced in a speech on 23 March, stated that people would only be allowed to leave the house for limited purposes. </p> \n  <p>These were shopping for basics, one form of exercise a day, travelling to and from work, but only where absolutely necessary, and medical needs. </p> \n  <p>The government\u2019s guidance on circumstances in which a person may leave their home stated: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>For work, where you cannot work at home. </li> \n   <li>Going to shops that are permitted to be open - to get things like food and medicine. </li> \n   <li>To exercise or spend time outdoors. </li> \n   <li>Any medical need, including to donate blood, avoid illness or injury, escape risk of harm, or to provide care or help to a vulnerable person. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>No mention was made of childcare in the published guidance. Reinforcing the message, Johnson said people should not meet family members who do not live with them. </p> \n  <p>The rule on meeting family was unequivocal: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>You should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home. You should keep in touch with them using phone or video calls.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Only in exceptional circumstances were people allowed to attend relatives\u2019 addresses; for example, to drop off food or medicine to their door. </p> \n  <p>However, Dr <strong>Jenny Harries</strong> said at the daily Downing Street press briefing on 24 March that a small child could be considered \u201cvulnerable\u201d. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>Clearly if you have adults who are unable to look after a small child, that is an exceptional circumstance. And if the individuals do not have access to care support - formal care support - or to family, they will be able to work through their local authority hubs.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Even now the lockdown rules have been relaxed slightly, visiting friends or family in their own homes is still off limits. The current guidance states: \u201cAs with before, you cannot visit friends and family in their homes.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The government guidance also said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>We are advising those who are at increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus (Covid-19) to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures. This group includes those who are aged 70 or older (regardless of medical conditions).</em></p> \n   <p><em>If you are showing coronavirus symptoms, or if you or any of your household are self-isolating, you should stay at home - this is critical to staying safe and saving lives.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The government\u2019s guidance on self-isolation stated: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>If you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus (Covid-19), then you must stay at home for at least seven days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/dominic-cummings-row-what-ministers-have-said-about-lockdown-rules\">Dominic Cummings row: what ministers have said about lockdown rules</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T12:50:01.032Z\">at 1.50pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec9149a8f08a1782fa80363\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T12:24:03.678Z\">1.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Boris Johnson is facing calls, led vociferously by former Mirror editor Piers Morgan, to front the daily coronavirus briefing later today. </p> \n  <p>Whoever gives the press conference will undoubtedly face some awkward questions and it will be interesting to see whether they stick to the suggestion Cummings and his family travelling north was essential.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/1264133884402454534\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Don't you dare hide again today <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BorisJohnson</a> - front the daily briefing &amp; tell the British public why it was one rule for them &amp; another for your chief adviser. <br>Or be damned by your cowardice.</p>\u2014 Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/1264133884402454534?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 23, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T12:34:54.885Z\">at 1.34pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec910e18f0864e579f16665\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T12:05:09.122Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The health secretary <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, who himself contracted Covid-19 and isolated for a week, is the latest cabinet minister to come out in support of parents stricken with coronavirus seeking childcare for their children.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1264162359733555202\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I know how ill coronavirus makes you.

      "bodyText": "Well. What a day. Dominic Cummings has the \u201cfull support\u201d of the prime minister, despite travelling 250 miles to County Durham during the lockdown. Boris Johnson faced rising pressure to sack his key adviser after the Guardian and Mirror revealed he drove from London with his wife and child to his parents\u2019 property in Durham after his wife developed coronavirus symptoms after lockdown was introduced in March. It remains unclear what the prime minister knew about Cummings\u2019 whereabouts while he was self-isolating with the illness and \u201cstaying put\u201d. Pressed on the issue at the daily press briefing, Grant Shapps said: I can tell you the PM provides Mr Cummings with his full support. Senior cabinet ministers publicly backed the PM\u2019s top aide, suggesting the issue was simply one of good parenting and had been politicised. This contradicted an earlier statement from Durham police which said it acted in line with national policing guidance when officers reiterated the advice around essential travel to the owner of the property in Durham. Cummings justified the journey by saying his four-year-old son would have been left without care and so they were \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d, even though his wife was symptomatic at the time and the public had been advised against all but essential travel, not to let children be around their grandparents, and for anyone with symptoms (and their households) to self-isolate immediately for 14 days. Labour and the SNP have each written to the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, asking for an urgent inquiry into what the prime minister knew about the incident and what role the government played in keeping it under wraps. The SNP have called on the head of the civil service to investigate \u201cthe rule-breaking and the Tory government\u2019s cover-up\u201d of Cummings\u2019 lockdown journey \u201cas a matter of serious public concern\u201d. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, said: I have written to Sir Mark Sedwill seeking an immediate investigation into the rule-breaking and the Tory government\u2019s cover-up - and to call for Dominic Cummings to resign or be sacked. Boris Johnson must answer serious questions about his role in this incident and the cover-up - including when he found out, when he heard about the police action, why Mr Cummings wasn\u2019t sacked immediately, and why he kept the public in the dark for eight weeks until a newspaper broke the story. Dominic Cummings\u2019 position is completely untenable. This is a matter of leadership and judgment for the prime minister who must prevent lasting damage to his government and his own reputation. Millions of us have made huge sacrifices over the months to obey the rules, while Boris Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser was breaking them. There cannot be one rule for the Tory government and another for the rest of us. The government seemed to suggest it is now up to individuals to ensure they are safeguarding themselves or people within their household. This has left many people wondering why, if there was always room for interpretation, people were instructed clearly to stay at home and observe social distancing since 23 March. It has left many parents across the country angry that they have struggled during lockdown with childcare, made sacrifices and not accepted help from relatives in order to adhere to the rules and protect loved ones. However, the guidance remains that anyone showing symptoms should take themselves out of society immediately and the whole household should self-isolate, Dr Jenny Harries reiterated. The deputy chief medical officer for England added that there was an element of \u201ccommon sense\u201d when it came to safeguarding if there was an individual at extreme risk, eg a sick child, elderly person or clinically vulnerable individual. And the government released new funding to restore public transport back to a full timetable. And that brings us to the end of a long, tumultuous day for Boris Johnson\u2019s government. A huge thank you to everybody who got in touch with thoughts and comments throughout the day, and to all of you for reading along. That\u2019s all from us on the UK side. If you\u2019d like to continue following the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. Shapps reminds people to avoid travelling at peak times, and to walk, cycle or drive if possible. And that concludes this afternoon\u2019s very turbulent press conference. Q. Is the government going to introduce compensation for the families of transport workers who have died? Shapps says he is concerned that many of the people on the frontline who have died have come from ethnic minorities. He doesn\u2019t answer the question of compensation being extended. Q. What measures are being taken to protect BAME workers when the transport system opens up further? Shapps says he has written to the transport operators to make sure they\u2019re aware of what equipment, procedures and processes should be in place to protect workers. It\u2019s of great concern that 53 transport workers have died during the pandemic, he says. Prof Kevin Fenton\u2019s report should be available at the end of this month, he says. Q. We\u2019ve already had two resignations from senior aides who have broken the rules [Neil Ferguson and Catherine Calderwood]. Is there one rule for certain aides and one rule for the Downing Street aides? What\u2019s different about Dominic Cummings to other aides in senior positions? Shapps says most people would be thinking what would they do in that situation. This wasn\u2019t visiting a holiday home or to visit someone; this was to stay put for 14 days and to remain in isolation and to get over a significant bout of illness with coronavirus and return to London only when well to do a job that couldn\u2019t be done elsewhere, he says. So I think there\u2019s every difference, he adds. Q. Did the prime minister know about this? The public have a right to know what he knew about the visit and what he was told about it. Shapps says Boris Johnson knew he was staying in one place with his family, and gives Cummings his full support. Q. Can you clarify whether anyone from Durham Constabulary spoke to any member of Cummings\u2019 family? Shapps says Cummings\u2019 statement says at no stage was any member of the family spoken to by the police. Q. Does that mean the police are not speaking straightforwardly? Shapps says he\u2019s unsure where that confusion comes in but the statement is black and white. Q. When did the prime minister know Dominic Cummings had gone to Durham and does this undermine the \u2018stay at home\u2019 message? Shapps says he doesn\u2019t know the answer to this. The PM provides Cummings with his full support and an explanation has been provided, he says. Harries says as a doctor she cannot comment on a clinical position of an individual, which she does not have on this case. If you\u2019re symptomatic, you stay at home, you take yourself out of society with your household as quickly as you can and stay there, unless there is an extreme risk to life, she reiterates. Q. Are you saying that anyone who becomes ill with the virus, they can go closer to relatives \u2013 no matter how far away that is? Shapps says the rules have subsequently changed anyway. People can now travel, if you\u2019re not symptomatic, any distance to exercise. If you\u2019re symptomatic, you have to get yourself locked down in the most practical way, he says. This will be different depending on different family circumstances, he adds. Q. What are the risks of travelling if you have the virus and would you recommend it? Harries says if people have symptoms, they should self-isolate immediately and stay in their homes. The only exception around this is around risk, ie the issue of safeguarding for children or adults, she adds. In relation to travel, if you\u2019re in a private car, transmission within the vehicle is a higher risk but if you\u2019re in a household group your exposure risk is usually the same, as long as you\u2019re not meeting anyone else, she says. Q. People have had to make very difficult choices throughout this lockdown. Should they have been using their own interpretation of the \u2018stay at home\u2019 message? Shapps says you should of course follow the guidance to the best of your ability. It\u2019s for an individual to decide if they have enough support around the family, he says. The decision here [with Cummings] was to go to that location [Durham] and stay in that location, they didn\u2019t move around, he says. Q. How can you personally be sure that by driving across England, Dominic Cummings didn\u2019t infect anyone else on the way or while he was there? Q. What do you say to those people who are unable to say goodbye to their loved ones or go to their funerals because they were observing the rules? Shapps says everyone has tried to do the right thing and has been affected by the virus. In this case, a four-year-old needed support so a decision was taken, he says. The child\u2019s welfare was the important thing here, he adds. He says Cummings\u2019 niece and sister brought food to the property he and his family were staying in. He stayed in the same place and prevented the possibility of the child not having support, he adds. Q. If the family was just bringing food to the doorstep, why couldn\u2019t he get that in London? Shapps says Cummings went to where the family was, which was in Durham, and stayed there. Q. When have you said it was all right to resort to other family members if parents are unable to look after small children because one of them has symptoms? Harries says the public health advice is to take yourself out of society if you have symptoms. If two adults are ill and unable to cope for a small dependent, the guidance has a common-sense element which accounts for such safeguarding issues like this, she says. They are taking questions from the media now. *deep breaths* Q. Is the advice to parents now that if you don\u2019t have extended family nearby, even when you\u2019re ill with Covid symptoms, you\u2019re allowed to leave your home, travel many miles across the country and isolate closer to your extended family. Harries says the scientific and medical advice is to take symptomatic people out of the public domain. The advice is very clear: you self-isolate at home and your household self-isolates with you, she says. If there is a safeguarding issue, eg with an elderly or clinically vulnerable individual or a sick child, there needs to be some sort of safeguard in place, she says. Shapps says if younger members of the family can assist then that might be the best place for you to settle and stay while you\u2019re ill. Harries adds people need to come out of circulation and self-isolate the minute they have symptoms, and stay out of circulation. Q. Did the prime minister know that Dominic Cummings had travelled more than 250 miles during lockdown and did he approve this? Shapps says the important thing is that everyone remains in the same place while they\u2019re locked down, which is what Cummings did \u2013 he stayed put and didn\u2019t come out again until he was feeling better. Sarah from Newbury asks if under-fives will be able to get tested once early years settings are reopened, to reassure staff and parents it is safe. Harries says we\u2019re still learning about the disease in children but it is known that children rarely become ill with Covid-19 and there are signals that the transmission from children is reduced. Testing for under-fives will be progressed going forward, she says. They are taking questions from the public now. They don\u2019t know the questions in advance, Shapps notes. Gordon from Gosport asks how the government is going to prevent travellers from staying a few days in Ireland at the end of a foreign holiday to bypass the government\u2019s 14-day quarantine. Shapps says Ireland has a form of quarantine in place as well, so it would still apply. The only positive note on the number of deaths is that it is starting to come down on average, Harries says. Across the UK\u2019s countries and regions, there is a downward trend in all areas in the number of people in hospial with Covid-19, Harries says. The \u201csteady, slow\u201d downward trend in hospital admissions in England continues, Harries says. Across the four nations, the percentage of mechanical ventilator beds occupied by patients with Covid-19 is also falling, she says. Harries says there is a trend upwards in daily testing, varying over weekends, but it\u2019s encouraging as there is a downward trend in new cases. Dr Jenny Harries is going through the slides now. Use of parks has gone up, in line with national guidance, she says. Using parks is good for mental and physical health but please observe social distancing \u2013 stay two metres away from people from outside your household and only meet one person at a time \u2013 she says. She adds that 86% of adults have left their home in accordance with national guidance, ie for essentials or exercise. The Covid outbreak must be the catalyst for \u201clevelling up\u201d the country, Shapps says. Journeys should be staggered and people should avoid rush hour, Shapps says. Shapps announces \u00a3283m to start moving public transport back to a full timetable. However, those who can should still work from home, and those who can should still avoid all forms of public transport, he says. Even a fully restored service will only be capable of carrying, at best, one fifth of normal capacity, to allow for social distancing, he adds. The transport secretary is speaking now. He is going through the daily numbers on testing, positive cases, hospitalisations and deaths. He says 36,675 people have died across all settings, an increase of 282 fatalities since yesterday. Amid continued calls for the prime minister\u2019s top aide to resign, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, appears to have drawn the short straw \u2013 he will be fronting this afternoon\u2019s press conference, which is due to begin shortly. All eyes, however, will be on the deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries, and what she will make of the government\u2019s insistence that Dominic Cummings\u2019 travelling 260 miles across country during lockdown to stay with his parents, while symptomatic, for childcare was the right thing to do. This is from Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Angela Rayner: The attorney general, Suella Braverman, is the latest senior politician to support Dominic Cummings\u2019 actions. The most senior law officer in the government, Braverman has effectively gone against what Durham police have said on the matter (see 11.14am.). She suggested the matter should have been considered closed with No 10\u2019s statement (see 10.25am.) and the issue was being \u201cpoliticised\u201d. Her language echoes that of her senior cabinet colleagues, including Michael Gove and Dominic Raab (see 11.08am.), who have said Cummings was only taking care of his family. If reactions on social media are anything to go by, the government\u2019s defence of Cummings has left a sour taste in the mouths of parents across the country who are now asking, is No 10 saying I am a bad parent for following the rules? One Twitter user, David Penney, wrote: So when I had symptoms and my wife and kids self isolated with me, rather than going to stay with my parents who are over 70, we were being bad parents? Really? Another user, Cat Wallis, tweeted: So you\u2019re saying that those of us who both had Covid but followed the rules and stayed home to look after our children even though we could barely stand up are not good parents? And Sean Brady, also wrote on Twitter: So anyone who self-isolated at home instead of breaking quarantine to get someone else to look after their child is now a bad parent. Is that the government\u2019s official position now? As the row over Dominic Cummings continues to unfold, calls for his resignation continue to mount, and government ministers defend his actions, members of the public have many questions. Among them, why is Cummings being excused for reportedly breaching lockdown rules due to needing help with childcare, when for the last nine weeks parents up and down the country have struggled without help while they suffered symptoms because they didn\u2019t feel they could seek or accept help because it was against the rules? And if it was indeed fine all along, why wasn\u2019t clear guidance on this subject given to the broader population? The government has insisted that Cummings was well within the rules when he travelled 260 miles from London to Durham during lockdown. Cummings said he wanted help from his family caring for his young son if he and his wife became too ill to do so alone. When Alex Duell and his wife began experiencing coronavirus symptoms, they turned down the offer of help from her mother, who lives 30 minutes away and was desperate to help looking after their two young children, because it went against government advice. Duell said: Had we accepted her help, we would have felt too guilty for breaking the rules of \u2018stay at home\u2019. Whilst Dominic Cummings was heading to Durham to receive support for childcare whilst suffering from coronavirus symptoms, myself and my wife found ourself in the same position. Cummings said he did the right thing, we all want the best for our families, but we have been forced to do this in light of the government advice. Once again the general public have been let down, the sacrifices we all make mean nothing to this government if they so blatantly break the rules then fail to accept any responsibility. Another couple who fell ill with symptoms in mid-March, said they did not travel the half mile to take their primary-aged children to their grandparents or the 50 miles to take them to an aunt and uncle, because they, too, were mindful of the \u201cstay at home\u201d message. They said it never occurred to them that they could or should do differently. The government\u2019s guidelines at the time stated: Can I leave my home while self-isolating? If you or someone you live with has symptoms of coronavirus: Do not leave the house for any reason \u2013 if you need food, or medicine, order it online or by phone, or ask someone to deliver it to your home. Do not have visitors in your home \u2013 including friends and family Do any exercise at home \u2013 you can use your garden, if you have one Here is the moment Dominic Cummings told reporters he did the \u201cright thing\u201d by travelling 260 miles from London to Durham to be near relatives during the lockdown. Cummings is facing calls to quit over the journey, which he made when his wife had Covid-19 symptoms. Downing Street has defended Cummings\u2019 actions (see 10.25am.). NHS England has announced 157 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 25,544. Of the 157 new deaths announced on Saturday: - 30 occurred on 22 May - 81 occurred on 21 May - 19 occurred on 20 May The number of deaths of patients with Covid-19 by region are as follows: East of England 17 London 19 Midlands 30 North East &amp; Yorkshire 36 North West 23 South East 22 South West 10 Total 157 The figures also show 24 of the new deaths took place between 1 and 19 May, and the remaining three deaths took place in April with the earliest new death on 22 April. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for postmortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated. The figures published today by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day, with a current total of 891. The Scottish National party has written to the prime minister and the head of the civil service calling for an investigation into Dominic Cummings\u2019 \u201crule-breaking and the Tory government\u2019s cover-up\u201d. In the letter to Mark Sedwill and Boris Johnson, the party\u2019s leader in Westminster Ian Blackford said he was calling for Cummings to be sacked. He asked for the following questions to be answered: When did Johnson first find out about Cummings\u2019 trip to Durham and the police investigation into the rule-breaking incident? Did anyone in the UK government sanction the rule-breaking incident? Why was Cummings not sacked or asked to resign at the time? What role did Johnson play in the decision to cover up the incident by keeping the public in the dark for eight weeks until the story was broken by a newspaper? In a statement, Blackford said: Dominic Cummings\u2019 position is completely untenable. This is a matter of leadership and judgment for the prime minister who must prevent lasting damage to his government and his own reputation. Millions of us have made huge sacrifices over the months to obey the rules, while Boris Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser was breaking them. There cannot be one rule for the Tory government and another for the rest of us. The excuses are not credible. There was absolutely nothing in the list of reasons under the law for leaving the house that allowed someone to travel the length of the country to stay with their parents, particularly not someone who was known to have the virus. Here is video of Cummings emerging from his house earlier today (see 12.44pm). It will be for others to characterise his demeanour, but he seems fairly unrepentant and even appears to be making light of his own transgressions. Dominic Cummings did not follow the advice which the Conservative party just posted on their Facebook account, according to the BBC\u2019s Lewis Goodall. And there are serious questions over whether the prime minister\u2019s top aide sought to prevent the virus spreading from household to household, as the Guardian\u2019s former deputy editor Paul Johnson highlights. With demands growing for Boris Johnson to sack his chief aide, Downing Street finally went public to defend Dominic Cummings on Saturday \u2013 after seven weeks of failing to provide on-the-record explanations about his whereabouts \u2013 but the explanation provided appears to leave fundamental questions unanswered, as my colleagues report: So, erm, was it permissible to travel for help with childcare under the lockdown rules? I had not thought so, but the government\u2019s defence of Dominic Cummings \u2013 who is claimed to have respected the guidelines despite driving 260 miles with suspected coronavirus \u2013 raises questions that millions of people will want clarifying. Were we all mistaken? What did \u201cstay home, save lives, protect the NHS\u201d actually mean? When Boris Johnson introduced the UK lockdown he gave \u201ca very simple instruction - you must stay at home\u201d. The rules, announced in a speech on 23 March, stated that people would only be allowed to leave the house for limited purposes. These were shopping for basics, one form of exercise a day, travelling to and from work, but only where absolutely necessary, and medical needs. The government\u2019s guidance on circumstances in which a person may leave their home stated: For work, where you cannot work at home. Going to shops that are permitted to be open - to get things like food and medicine. To exercise or spend time outdoors. Any medical need, including to donate blood, avoid illness or injury, escape risk of harm, or to provide care or help to a vulnerable person. No mention was made of childcare in the published guidance. Reinforcing the message, Johnson said people should not meet family members who do not live with them. The rule on meeting family was unequivocal: You should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home. You should keep in touch with them using phone or video calls. Only in exceptional circumstances were people allowed to attend relatives\u2019 addresses; for example, to drop off food or medicine to their door. However, Dr Jenny Harries said at the daily Downing Street press briefing on 24 March that a small child could be considered \u201cvulnerable\u201d. Clearly if you have adults who are unable to look after a small child, that is an exceptional circumstance. And if the individuals do not have access to care support - formal care support - or to family, they will be able to work through their local authority hubs. Even now the lockdown rules have been relaxed slightly, visiting friends or family in their own homes is still off limits. The current guidance states: \u201cAs with before, you cannot visit friends and family in their homes.\u201d The government guidance also said: We are advising those who are at increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus (Covid-19) to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures. This group includes those who are aged 70 or older (regardless of medical conditions). If you are showing coronavirus symptoms, or if you or any of your household are self-isolating, you should stay at home - this is critical to staying safe and saving lives. The government\u2019s guidance on self-isolation stated: If you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus (Covid-19), then you must stay at home for at least seven days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill. Boris Johnson is facing calls, led vociferously by former Mirror editor Piers Morgan, to front the daily coronavirus briefing later today. Whoever gives the press conference will undoubtedly face some awkward questions and it will be interesting to see whether they stick to the suggestion Cummings and his family travelling north was essential. The health secretary Matt Hancock, who himself contracted Covid-19 and isolated for a week, is the latest cabinet minister to come out in support of parents stricken with coronavirus seeking childcare for their children. Hancock\u2019s intervention comes after he said earlier this month he would back the police in any action they wish to take over Prof Neil Ferguson breaking social distancing rules by having a woman visit him at his home. Unsurprisingly, the government\u2019s attempts to defend Cummings \u2013 and the apparent hypocrisy exhibited in doing so \u2013 are causing growing anger among cross-party politicians. Amid calls for his resignation after he was found to have travelled 264 miles across the country days after lockdown was imposed with his wife and child while symptomatic, Dominic Cummings has been snapped outside his home gesturing to members of the media to observe social distancing guidelines. Yes, really. Cummings has insisted, \u201cI behaved reasonably and legally\u201d and when asked by reporters if his trip to Durham during lockdown looked good, said: Who cares about good looks. It\u2019s a question of doing the right thing. It\u2019s not about what you guys think. The suggestion that Cummings was \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d echoed the defences issued on Twitter from senior cabinet ministers including Michael Gove and Dominic Raab (see 11.08am.). The justification that breaching the lockdown rules was legitimate as it was done out of care for his wife and child has infuriated members of the public. So many people, as is pointed out by the i\u2019s Jane Merrick, the Indy\u2019s Ashley Cowburn and others, abided by the rules \u201cwith great inconvenience, difficulty and sadness\u201d and are now being told that if they cared for their loved ones they would have done the same. Here is a timeline of the key events around Boris Johnson\u2019s key adviser displaying coronavirus symptoms and journeying to County Durham during lockdown. Downing Street\u2019s statement on Dominic Cummings\u2019 journey to Durham \u201craises more questions than it answers\u201d, Labour has said. In a statement, a Labour spokesman said: The lockdown rules were very clear: if you or anyone in your household was suspected of having Covid-19 you must immediately self-isolate and not leave the house. However, the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser appears to believe that it is one rule for him and another for the British people. This will cause understandable anger for the millions of people who have sacrificed so much during this crisis. Number 10\u2019s statement also raises more questions than it answers. We are still unclear who knew about this decision and when, whether this was sanctioned by the prime minister and whether Number 10 is now questioning the validity of the statement from Durham police. At this afternoon\u2019s press conference, we will be expecting answers to these questions. Despite senior cabinet ministers publicly backing Dominic Cummings\u2019 reasoning for supposedly breaching lockdown rules (see 11.08am.), there are suggestions that Cummings will find few defenders in the parliamentary Conservative party. One Tory MP told the Guardian\u2019s north of England editor, Helen Pidd, that Cummings \u201cisn\u2019t popular with most Tory MPs\u201d, adding: This is from the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard Pickard also tweeted on Friday: Downing Street is facing accusations of a cover-up over Dominic Cummings\u2019 trip to Durham at the height of the national lockdown, amid reports that No 10 knew he made the 264-mile journey after developing symptoms of coronavirus, Matthew Weaver writes. Opposition parties have called for the prime minister to sack his chief adviser over the apparent lockdown breach, which was revealed in an investigation by the Guardian and the Mirror. Downing Street repeatedly refused to answer questions from the Guardian over a number of weeks, before breaking its silence on Saturday to offer the following explanation for Cummings\u2019 movements: Durham police said on Friday that officers had \u201cexplained to the family the [lockdown] guidelines\u201d. The BBC reported that an anonymous source close to Cummings had claimed that a \u201csmall number of people in No 10 knew that Cummings had gone to Durham\u201d, prompting opposition MPs to accuse Downing Street of trying to suppress the story. Full report here: The acting Durham police and crime commissioner, Steve White has issued an official statement in which he said Dominic Cummings\u2019 travelling to Durham when known to be infected was \u201cmost unwise\u201d. The statement reads: In relation to the incident where Dominic Cummings visited Durham during lockdown Durham Constabulary acted appropriately. Given the whole ethos of the guidance and regulations issued from the Government was to reduce the spread, regardless of reason, by travelling to County Durham when known to be infected was most unwise. To beat this crisis we need to be selfless as millions have been. The response by the people of County Durham and Darlington have been exemplary, which makes this most frustrating and concerning. Incidents such as this do not help, and I can appreciate that the longer this goes on the harder it gets, but I encourage the people of County Durham and Darlington to keep up the outstanding effort seen so far by using common sense when following the guidance to stay alert and continue to social distance. No 10 earlier put out a statement backing Cummings (see 10.25am), which said: At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter, as is being reported. My colleague Matthew Weaver wrote on Friday, \u201cWhen asked if Cummings had been warned [by police] about breaching the lockdown, a spokesman for Durham Constabulary said: On Tuesday, March 31, our officers were made aware of reports that an individual had travelled from London to Durham and was present at an address in the city. Officers made contact with the owners of that address who confirmed that the individual in question was present and was self-isolating in part of the house. In line with national policing guidance, officers explained to the family the guidelines around self-isolation and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel. A number of Conservative politicians, including senior cabinet ministers, have defended Dominic Cummings\u2019 actions on Twitter this morning. Downing Street has said Cummings believes he \u201cbehaved reasonably and legally\u201d when travelling from his London home to Country Durham during the lockdown (see 10.25am.). Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said it was \u201cnot a crime\u201d to care for your wife and child. The first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, said an explanation had been provided and that the issue of a sick couple needing help with childcare was being \u201cpoliticised\u201d. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, tweeted that \u201ctrying to score political points\u201d against somebody \u201ctaking care of your wife and young child\u201d was not reasonable: And the chair of the Commons education committee, Robert Halfon, wrote: Britons abiding by the government\u2019s lockdown measures have slammed the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser following reports he travelled to his parents\u2019 home despite coronavirus travel restrictions. Police have confirmed they attended a property in County Durham after it emerged that Dominic Cummings travelled more than 260 miles from his London home during the lockdown Boris Johnson had just announced with his wife and child, while the former was suspected to have contracted the virus. Members of the public are piling pressure on Downing Street to sack him. Some Twitter users said they had not left their home to see their family since February, while others said the reports were making their \u201cblood boil\u201d. One user, who gave his name as Tony, tweeted that he was unable to hug his father at his mother\u2019s funeral, saying he was \u201cfrankly appalled\u201d. He said: The lack of care or thought for other people in not following the necessary guidelines to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 by someone who was self-proclaiming their infection with the virus. The hypocrisy is unbelievable. Another user, Katie Hall from Yorkshire, said: I\u2019m 5 miles from my shielding parents ... we\u2019ve only seen them at a distance to drop off food ... my children haven\u2019t seen them at all apart from digitally ... the \u2018he was with his parents\u2019 stuff is making my blood boil. The public has been asked to follow restrictions since they were brought in on 23 March, which has kept many people apart from loved ones for months. User Rachel Kerry, tweeted: My Dad died at Easter. I couldn\u2019t go to see him to say goodbye, couldn\u2019t go to comfort my Mum and there were four of us, socially distancing, at his funeral so couldn\u2019t even hold my Mum\u2019s hand. Why is DC so f****** special?! Another user, Johanna Saunders, wrote: Others hit out at the fact that Cummings displayed coronavirus symptoms \u201cover the weekend\u201d of 28 March, and questioned why the public should continue following restrictions. User Nat Reed tweeted: My parents, in their late 70\u2019s, have been tested in the last week, as have I. All were negative and they live less than an hour away. I haven\u2019t seen them since February and am still fighting all my instincts that say to jump in the car but beginning to wonder why! In more upbeat news, the children\u2019s author Michael Rosen has left intensive care after eight weeks in hospital, and continues his recovery on the ward. His wife, Emma-Louise Williams, has been updating fans on the former children\u2019s laureate\u2019s condition on Twitter, though she has not confirmed if his condition is related to Covid-19. Amid accusations from Opposition MPs of a cover-up about what was known by whom about Dominic Cummings\u2019 lockdown travels and calls for the top aide to resign, No 10 has issued its first official response, maintaining that \u201chis actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines\u201d and Cummings \u201cbelieves he acted legally and responsibly\u201d. This is from the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar, who broke the story with the Guardian\u2019s Matthew Weaver Police have confirmed they attended a property in County Durham after it emerged that Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, travelled more than 260 miles from his London home during the lockdown. And this is from the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson Here is some reaction from Twitter about the Dominic Cummings story From the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard A thread from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston A thread from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh From Business Insider\u2019s Adam Bienkov Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, said the prime minister had \u201cserious questions\u201d to answer regarding what he knew about Dominic Cummings\u2019 lockdown trip to Country Durham. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Blackford said: I think what should have happened by now is that Dominic Cummings should have gone. What I find interesting ... is that (according to some reports) members of Downing Street knew about this so, first and foremost, Boris Johnson has serious questions to answer over what now appears to be a cover-up. The prime minister must explain exactly when he knew about the breaking of the rules, whether he sanctioned it, why Cummings wasn\u2019t sacked immediately and why it appears that he tried to cover it up, not telling the public until the newspaper(s) broke the story eight weeks later last night. He branded the alleged actions the \u201cheight of irresponsibility for someone to think this is a reasonable course of action\u201d, and added: Here we have the highest official in government, the closest confidant of the prime minister prepared to break the rules that the rest of us are being asked to obey. You cannot have a situation where there appears to be one rule for the powerful and the millions of the rest of the public are being told we must follow government advice. Demonstrably, this is an individual who has broken the advice he has been, in many cases, the architect of delivering. Blackford said Cummings\u2019 alleged actions were \u201cmore serious breaches\u201d than rule-breaking carried out by UK government adviser Prof Neil Ferguson and Scotland\u2019s former chief medical officer Catherine Calderwood, both of whom resigned for their breaches. Good morning. Boris Johnson is facing mounting pressure to sack his closest aide following reports he breached lockdown rules in March. A joint investigation by the Guardian and Mirror newspapers revealed that police spoke to Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s key adviser, after he visited his parents\u2019 home in Durham, 264 miles from his London home while he had coronavirus symptoms in late March. Cummings and his wife, who was also experiencing symptoms, stayed with his parents while self-isolating. A source close to Cummings denied a breach of the coronavirus rules to the BBC, saying the couple needed childcare help. They added that the couple had stayed in a separate building at the property. Only days earlier, the government had told the public to avoid all non-essential travel, to not meet family members who do not live with them, and to stay at home \u2013 with fines in places for those who broke the rules \u2013 and both Boris Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had tested positive for Covid-19. Anyone with coronavirus symptoms was also instructed to self-isolate at home and not to leave the house for seven days - even for essential supplies. The prime minister had also said clearly that children should not be left with grandparents or older relatives \u201cwho may be particularly vulnerable or fall into some of the vulnerable groups\u201d. Labour demanded No 10 \u201cto provide a very swift explanation for his actions\u201d. The party\u2019s vice chair, Tulip Sadiq, said: If accurate, the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser appears to have breached the lockdown rules. The government\u2019s guidance was very clear: stay at home and no non-essential travel. The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings. Number 10 needs to provide a very swift explanation for his actions. The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, tweeted: If Dominic Cummings has broken the lockdown guidelines he will have to resign. It\u2019s as simple as that. And Ian Blackford, the Scottish National party\u2019s Westminster leader, said: Dominic Cummings\u2019 position is completely untenable \u2013 he must resign or be sacked. But a source close to Cummings said there is \u201czero chance\u201d he will resign. Cummings is the latest high-profile figure to have broken the government\u2019s lockdown rules. Prof Neil Ferguson, whose epidemiological modelling helped shape the lockdown policy, resigned in early May when it was revealed that he flouted the rules to receive visits from his lover at his home. And Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, had to go after it emerged in early April that she visited her second home twice despite her own advice to the public to avoid all non-essential travel.

Sweden\u2019s loss belongs to the world. If and when the virus returns, no one, not even the Brexit right, will be able to say that Sweden has proved we don\u2019t need to wreck the economy and risk mass employment because it has shown a better way. We will just have to endure it. Again. \u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "Devastating new claims have emerged that Dominic Cummings further breached the lockdown rules, as Downing Street came under sustained pressure to fire the prime minister\u2019s most senior adviser. The new testimony suggests Cummings left the home where he was staying in Durham to visit a town 30 miles away on 12 April. He was allegedly spotted back in Durham on 19 April, days after he was photographed in London having recovered from the virus, suggesting that following his first trip across the country at the end of March he had made a second journey from the capital to north-east England. At the time, with the UK at the peak of the pandemic, the government was insisting that people should be staying at home. As Cummings faced calls to resign from across the political spectrum, the government was forced to defend his actions. Ministers insisted he had stayed put once arriving at a property in Durham, where he had travelled after contracting the symptoms of coronavirus to seek the support from his extended family. But the new claims would appear to demolish this defence and intensify questions over his claim that going there was permitted because he needed childcare while he was sick. The new accounts raise fresh questions about his insistence that the initial 264-mile trip to Durham was justified, and led to a new round of calls for the spin doctor to quit. The two new witnesses were revealed in a joint investigation by the Guardian/Observer and the Sunday Mirror. One saw him in Durham on 19 April, days after Cummings was photographed in London having recovered from the virus. A week earlier Cummings was seen by another witness in Barnard Castle on Easter Day, 30 miles away from Durham, the investigation found. The town, which takes its name from the English Heritage site at its centre, is a popular destination for days out. Robin Lees, 70, a retired chemistry teacher from the town, says he saw Cummings and his family walking by the Tees before getting into a car around lunchtime on 12 April.

You don\u2019t take the virus from one part of the country to another. It just beggars belief to think you could actually drive when the advice was stay home, save lives. It couldn\u2019t have been clearer.\u201d When Cummings was apparently recognised a second time on 19 April, he was wearing his trademark beanie hat, and was heard commenting on how \u201clovely\u201d the bluebells were during an early morning Sunday stroll with his wife Mary Wakefield. The second eyewitness, who declined to be named, said: \u201cWe were shocked and surprised to see him because the last time we did was earlier in the week in Downing Street.\u201d Cummings had been photographed on 14 April in Downing Street, the first time he had been seen back at work since recovering from the virus. \u201cWe thought: \u2018He\u2019s not supposed to be here during the lockdown,\u2019\u201d the source said. \u201cWe thought: \u2018What double standards, one rule for him as a senior adviser to the prime minister and another for the rest of us.\u2019\u201d At Saturday\u2019s daily Downing Street press conference, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said Cummings\u2019s actions, first revealed by the Guardian and Daily Mirror, were acceptable because he and his family had remained in isolation after arriving at the property in Durham, rather than travelling away from the property. \u201cThe decision here was to go to that location and stay in that location,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t then move around from there.\u201d The deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, said the aim of the advice on self-isolation was to remain \u201cout of circulation\u201d. Shapps said that the prime minister gave Cummings his full support. He added that he did not know when Boris Johnson became aware of the circumstances of Cummings\u2019s decision to go to Durham. Asked whether Cummings\u2019s claim that the police had not spoken to his family, despite an official statement to the contrary, meant that Durham constabulary were lying, he said that he was \u201cnot sure where the confusion in that comes in\u201d. Durham police are standing by their statement issued on Friday that the Cummings family was reminded of the lockdown rules on 31 March, after he was seen in the area. After Downing Street contradicted the official police statement and said that \u201cat no stage was [Cummings] or his family spoken to by the police\u201d, Durham police provided details of a conversation with Cummings\u2019s father, saying that \u201cat the request of Mr Cummings\u2019s father, an officer made contact\u201d and that Cummings\u2019s father confirmed his son had travelled to the property. Downing Street has also been accused of a cover-up after initial reports that some in No 10 knew Cummings had made the journey. Labour, the Scottish National party and the Liberal Democrats have written to the head of the civil service, Sir Mark Sedwill, demanding an inquiry into what happened. The latest claims led to fresh calls on Saturday night for Cummings to resign. The SNP\u2019s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, called on the cabinet secretary to investigate the \u201crule-breaking and the Tory government\u2019s cover-up\u201d of Cummings\u2019s journey to Durham. Acting Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: \u201cIf Dominic Cummings is now allowed to remain in place a moment longer, it will increasingly be the prime minister\u2019s judgment that is in the spotlight.\u201d Meanwhile, the cabinet\u2019s most senior ministers were accused of placing political loyalty over public health, after they launched an orchestrated battle to defend Cummings. Michael Gove, Matt Hancock, Dominic Raab and Rishi Sunak were among those to defend the spin doctor. A Labour source, commenting to the PA Media news agency about the new allegations, said: \u201cIf these latest revelations are true, why on earth were cabinet ministers sent out this [Saturday] afternoon to defend Dominic Cummings? \u201cWe need an urgent investigation by the cabinet secretary to get to the bottom of this matter.

Lockdown was a national sacrifice that had to be made \u2013 by everyone.</p> <p>Yet some time the following weekend \u2013 28/29 March \u2013 Johnson\u2019s closest adviser Dominic Cummings, his wife Mary Wakefield, a journalist who was already suffering from Covid-19 symptoms, and their young child, drove more than 250 miles from their London home to the farm where Cummings\u2019s parents live near Durham.

Durham police said they were made aware that Cummings had travelled from London and was in the area on 31 March. In a statement last night they said: \u201cAt the request of Mr Cummings\u2019s father, an officer made contact the following morning by telephone.</p> <p>\u201cDuring that conversation, Mr Cummings\u2019s father confirmed that his son had travelled with his family from London to the North-East and was self-isolating in part of the property.</p> <p>\u201cDurham Constabulary deemed that no further action was required.

I recognised Dominic Cummings \u2013 he\u2019s a very distinctive figure.\u201d</p> <p>Similar examples of public officials flouting lockdown guidelines have led to swift resignations with senior Conservatives leading choruses of condemnation. When Professor Neil Ferguson, the leading epidemiologist, quit as a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) after admitting he had been visited by his girlfriend, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was \u201cspeechless\u201d and made much of his willingness to help the police with any inquiries they might make.</p> <p>But this time if Conservative ministers, MPs and No 10 staff were shocked they tried their damnedest not to show it.

No, he would not resign under any circumstances. In fact the message was more that what Cummings had done deserved respect, and was well within the rules. Officials highlighted a part of government lockdown advice which said people could leave home in exceptional circumstances including to \u201cprovide care or help for a vulnerable person\u201d \u2013 while failing to mention all the other parts which suggested they should have stayed put with their child. The evolving defensive argument was that Cummings\u2019s child had needed to be cared for as the parents were suffering or about to suffer from Covid-19.</p> <p>With Labour demanding an urgent statement and clarity, the cabinet suddenly began to sing with one voice and rallied round Johnson\u2019s man. Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove, who used to employ Cummings and defends him at every turn, spoke out suggesting those who questioned the controversial adviser were the unthoughtful ones: \u201cCaring for your wife and child is not a crime,\u201d he said. Fellow senior cabinet colleagues, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, also weighed in in harmony. \u201cTaking care of your wife and young child is justifiable and reasonable, trying to score political points over it isn\u2019t,\u201d Sunak tweeted.</p> <p>The script was now decided and No 10 issued a statement saying: \u201cOwing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for.</p> <p>\u201cHis sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed.</p> <p>\u201cHis sister shopped for the family and left everything outside.</p> <p>\u201cAt no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter, as is being reported.</p> <p>\u201cHis actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines. Mr Cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally.\u201d</p> <p>But privately many Tory MPs and ministers were dismayed. The police, while cautious in public, were in private clearly furious. Scientists were incredulous and civil servants confided fears that Cummings was completely out of control. One senior mandarin said the cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill should investigate whether Cummings had breached the civil service code by so clearly going against the spirit of government policy, at a time of and on a matter of, national emergency. \u201cSomeone should be asking if Cummings\u2019s behaviour was consistent with the civil service code, and if not what are they going to do about it?\u201d said the civil servant.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ministers have clearly been told to tweet support for Cummings.

One is leaving the house when you\u2019re symptomatic, another is travelling far distances and staying overnight elsewhere, and the third is having a person \u2013 in this case a child \u2013 go from one household to another household. The problem about having different rules for different people is that it breaks the trust of the people in those who are issuing the guidelines.\u201d</p> <p>Dean Burnett of Cardiff University took a similar view. \u201cWhat Dominic Cummings did was utterly reckless. He knew he could have been infected with Covid-19, yet he drove more than 200 miles to his parents\u2019 house. They are in their 70s, the most vulnerable group. It is utterly bewildering.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a man who is on the Sage committee and who is influencing government policy on Covid-19 and he behaves like this. It is unacceptable. He should resign.\u201d</p> <p>Burnett added that his own father had died of Covid-19 but he had still respected the rules of lockdown. \u201cI could not comfort my father as he died and have had to grieve for him on my own. Like the rest of my family, I respected the rules of lockdown. Yet the man who has had key influence in setting up those rules seems to be quite happy to ignore them when it suits him. It is infuriating.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902Y3Jhj7psKEe3/\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902Y3Jhj7psKEe3/\">.</a> </figure>  <p>In an attempt to turn the heat on to Johnson himself Labour also demanded to know who in Downing Street had known about Cummings\u2019s progress to the north, after officials said several people in No 10 had been aware he had left London, though none had said so before yesterday.</p> <p>Last night as new claims emerged in the <em>Observer</em> about further sightings of Cummings in different locations near Durham, it is clear the prime minister and Tory ministers are united in trying to defend him and keep him in post come what may.</p> <p>But while it would be a humiliation and a severe embarrassment for Johnson to lose Cummings, there are big dangers in keeping him too.

      "body": "<p>It is one of the most heartbreaking stories of this pandemic. On 31 March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/boy-13-die-london-after-testing-positive-for-coronavirus\">Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab</a>, 13, from Brixton, south London, died in the early hours of the morning at King\u2019s College Hospital after testing positive for coronavirus. According to a family friend, his mother and siblings could not be <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-04-01/coronavirus-13-year-old-victim-died-alone-friend-says-ismail-mohamed-abdulwahab-kings-college-hospital/\">at his bedside</a> and, after some of his siblings also developed symptoms, his immediate family had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/siblings-of-13-year-old-uk-coronavirus-victim-ismail-mohamed-abdulwahab-develop-symptoms\">miss his funeral</a> as they were required to self-isolate. It is impossible to comprehend the scale of their pain.</p> <p>On the same day that Ismail died, officers from Durham constabulary made contact with a member of Dominic Cummings\u2019s family in Durham about reports that the prime minister\u2019s most senior adviser had been seen by a witness on their property, despite being in London a few days previously. We now know from revelations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/dominic-cummings-no-10-accused-of-covering-up-lockdown-breach\">in the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/dominic-cummings-no-10-accused-of-covering-up-lockdown-breach\">Guardian</a></em> that Cummings and his family travelled 260 miles to Durham after his partner developed coronavirus symptoms. Yesterday, Downing Street issued an official statement that Cummings and his family went there after his partner developed Covid-19 symptoms, in case he also fell ill and needed help with childcare, but that they maintained social distancing with his extended family. Sources close to him said on Friday night that he and his immediate family stayed in a separate building on his parents\u2019 property. Downing Street also denied that police officers had contacted anyone in his family as stated by Durham constabulary, and said that his actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines.</p> <p>This is not just Westminster tittle-tattle; it is far more serious than that. It goes to the heart of the credibility of the government\u2019s pandemic response. Ministers have set out clear guidelines that it has asked all citizens to abide by in order to protect the NHS and limit the number of deaths. Those guidelines include instructions that anyone in a household where someone has symptoms of Covid-19 should not leave their house for 14 days.</p> <p>Millions of people have complied with this guidance at huge personal cost. A boy died without his mother by his side; people have been unable to spend time with relatives who have terminal illnesses. There have been missed funerals; babies born who are yet to meet their grandparents; single parents with Covid-19 who have struggled to care for their children while sick; medical and care staff who have moved out of their homes to avoid putting their children at risk. These are sacrifices people have willingly made in order to protect healthcare workers and save lives.</p> <p>Of course this lockdown has involved unbearably difficult decisions; of course parents have fretted what will happen to their children were they to become seriously ill. But many will have decided that they must comply with the government guidelines. How does it look when it turns out that a senior government adviser decided he was above the rules, and that the possibility he might need childcare help was worth the risk of two adults, infected with coronavirus, travelling hundreds of miles? It reeks of breathtaking arrogance and a callous disregard for the welfare of NHS and care staff.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In shielding Cummings, ministers reveal ... they are willing to undermine a pandemic strategy to save a colleague\u2019s job</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Worse still has been the response of the cabinet. Instead of insisting that Cummings resign, in the same way they did with other, less prominent government advisers who broke guidelines, senior ministers have rallied to Cummings\u2019s defence. Michael Gove tweeted that caring for your wife and child is not a crime, as though those who obeyed government guidelines despite the implications for their families somehow cared less about them. Rishi Sunak appeared to accuse those asking the question about Cummings\u2019s conduct as being motivated by political point-scoring. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, defended Cummings\u2019s actions as \u201centirely right\u201d. At yesterday\u2019s press conference, Grant Shapps and the deputy chief medical officer gave conflicting messages about under what circumstances it might be permissible for someone to leave home if they live in a household where one or more members have symptoms. In shielding Cummings, ministers are revealing an ugly truth: they are willing to undermine the government\u2019s public health messaging and its entire pandemic strategy \u2013 to risk people\u2019s lives \u2013 in order to save their colleague\u2019s job. It is a disgrace.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> gave the government the benefit of the doubt when this crisis broke: these are the most difficult governing circumstances a prime minister has faced for decades.

He was responsible for a notorious decree called AI-5 that gave him wide ranging dictatorial powers and kicked off the so-called \u201canos de chumbo\u201d (years of lead), a bleak period of tyranny and violence which would last until 1974.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happened during the dictatorship?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Supporters of Brazil\u2019s 1964-1985 military regime - including Jair Bolsonaro - credit it with bringing security and stability to the South American country and masterminding a decade-long economic \u201cmiracle\u201d.</p>\n    <p>It also pushed ahead with several pharaonic infrastructure projects including the still unfinished Trans-Amazonian highway and the eight-mile bridge across Rio\u2019s Guanabara bay.</p>\n    <p>But the regime, while less notoriously violent than those in Argentina and Chile, was also responsible for murdering or killing hundreds of its opponents and imprisoning thousands more. Among those jailed and tortured were Brazil\u2019s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, then a leftwing rebel.</p>\n    <p>It was also a period of severe censorship. Some of Brazil\u2019s best-loved musicians - including Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso - went into exile in Europe, writing songs about their enforced departures.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did it end?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Political exiles began returning to Brazil in 1979 after an amnesty law was passed that began to pave the way for the return of democracy.</p>\n    <p>But the pro-democracy \u201cDiretas J\u00e1\u201d (Direct elections now!) movement only hit its stride in 1984 with a series of vast and historic street rallies in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and Belo Horizonte.</p>\n    <p>Civilian rule returned the following year and a new constitution was introduced in 1988.

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson is facing a growing revolt by MPs of all parties this weekend against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/20/mps-fear-two-tier-commons-if-lockdown-lifted-in-uk-parliament\">plans to force them back</a> to Westminster on 2 June and vote in person in the House of Commons.</p> <p>More than 70 MPs, including most chairs of select committees, have signed a letter complaining that the plans to ditch all remote voting \u2013 announced by the Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg \u2013 would also lead to queues of more than 650 MPs stretching for over a kilometre around the Palace of Westminster. They say that MPs who are shielding will be unable to vote and will therefore be excluded from the democratic process.</p> <p>The rebel MPs have won support from the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, who has written to colleagues saying that he would prefer to retain the system of hybrid voting, in which MPs can choose whether they vote in person or remotely, and hopes that the government can be persuaded to change its mind.</p> <p>Another concern being raised by MPs who live far from London is that they will have to move back to second homes they share with other MPs, breaking lockdown rules.</p> <p>In the protest letter, written and co-ordinated by the chairman of the standards and privileges committee, Chris Bryant, to the chair of the procedure committee, Karen Bradley, the group of Labour, Tory, Liberal Democrat, SNP and Plaid Cymru MPs state: \u201cVoting must not increase the risk of infection. Yet if members are to queue at two metres\u2019 distance, they will be passing in the slipstream of hundreds of colleagues in a queue that will extend for 1,300 metres, throughout most of the parliamentary estate.</p> <p>\u201cAll members should be treated equally and should have an equal right to participate and represent their constituents in both debates and divisions. Yet many members are shielding or have partners and family members who are shielding, or have childcare responsibilities, which would make it irresponsible for them to vote in person. Pairing means they are not participating and their constituents\u2019 voice is not heard or recorded.\u201d</p> <p>Tory MP and GP Dr Dan Poulter said: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy. There are a large number of MPs in high-risk categories \u2013 the obese, those over 70 or those with serious underlying health conditions \u2013 who will have to choose to either put themselves at risk or not participate in parliament, which is not acceptable nor sustainable for them or for their constituents.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is facing a growing revolt by MPs of all parties this weekend against plans to force them back to Westminster on 2 June and vote in person in the House of Commons. More than 70 MPs, including most chairs of select committees, have signed a letter complaining that the plans to ditch all remote voting \u2013 announced by the Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg \u2013 would also lead to queues of more than 650 MPs stretching for over a kilometre around the Palace of Westminster. They say that MPs who are shielding will be unable to vote and will therefore be excluded from the democratic process. The rebel MPs have won support from the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, who has written to colleagues saying that he would prefer to retain the system of hybrid voting, in which MPs can choose whether they vote in person or remotely, and hopes that the government can be persuaded to change its mind. Another concern being raised by MPs who live far from London is that they will have to move back to second homes they share with other MPs, breaking lockdown rules. In the protest letter, written and co-ordinated by the chairman of the standards and privileges committee, Chris Bryant, to the chair of the procedure committee, Karen Bradley, the group of Labour, Tory, Liberal Democrat, SNP and Plaid Cymru MPs state: \u201cVoting must not increase the risk of infection. Yet if members are to queue at two metres\u2019 distance, they will be passing in the slipstream of hundreds of colleagues in a queue that will extend for 1,300 metres, throughout most of the parliamentary estate. \u201cAll members should be treated equally and should have an equal right to participate and represent their constituents in both debates and divisions. Yet many members are shielding or have partners and family members who are shielding, or have childcare responsibilities, which would make it irresponsible for them to vote in person. Pairing means they are not participating and their constituents\u2019 voice is not heard or recorded.\u201d Tory MP and GP Dr Dan Poulter said: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy. There are a large number of MPs in high-risk categories \u2013 the obese, those over 70 or those with serious underlying health conditions \u2013 who will have to choose to either put themselves at risk or not participate in parliament, which is not acceptable nor sustainable for them or for their constituents. It is probably through being squashed on to the green benches in parliament that both the PM and [the health secretary] became infected in the first place. MPs should be setting an example on the importance of social distancing and shielding vulnerable colleagues.\u201d Labour MP Stella Creasy said that the proposals were unworkable and would harm democracy. \u201cThere are MPs shielding as they have longterm health conditions or their family members do, others won\u2019t be able to get childcare and the new restrictions mean we risk a two-tier parliament where only the chosen get heard.\u201d In an article for the Observer Bryant writes: \u201cI would gently suggest to traditionalists in the Conservative ranks that this will bring the whole system into such disrepute that by the summer everyone will be clamouring for electronic voting to become permanent.\u201d On 20 May Rees-Mogg announced the plan for MPs to return on 2 June, arguing that it would allow the government to pass badly needed legislation. He said that hybrid parliamentary proceedings \u2013 which involve most MPs contributing via video-link \u2013 did not allow sufficient scrutiny of policy matters.

      "bodyText": "We may be dealing with a health crisis, but the climate change crisis has not gone away, nor become any less urgent. In fact, the opposite. A few conservative commentators have suggested Covid-19 shows what a real crisis looks like compared with, in their opinion, the hyperventilating over climate change. What bollocks. Nasa estimates that last month was the hottest April on record and the first four months of this year are the second hottest start to a year. The past seven months have all been 1C or higher than the 1951-1980 average (roughly around 1.3C above the pre-industrial average) \u2013 tied with the longest streak set from October 2015 to April 2016. But unlike in 2015 and 2016 the Bureau of Meteorology records we are currently not in El Ni\u00f1o. That very much suggests the pace of warming is speeding up. The linear trend of temperatures over the past 60 years suggests we will hit 2C above pre-industrial levels in 50 years; the trend of the past 20 years has it happening in around 30 years, but the trend of the past decade would see us hit that level in 2038 \u2013just 18 years\u2019 time. In 2018, the IPCC warned we had little time to keep temperatures below 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. If the trend of the past decade continues, we\u2019ll hit that temperature in 2025. And no, the virus has not bought us more time. A study published this week in Nature Climate Change estimates the annual global drop in emissions due to virus shutdowns will be \u201ccomparable to the rates of decrease needed year-on-year over the next decades to limit climate change to a 1.5\u00b0C warming\u201d. That it took forcing people to stop their lives to achieve such cuts highlights just how big the job ahead of us is and how it cannot be done through individual action alone. Cutting emissions without crippling the economy requires not everyone self-isolating, but changing industries and the very foundations of our economy. We need to move away from oil, coal and gas to renewable energy. And so it should be of great concern that the government is using the coronavirus as cover to push fossil fuels. This week Adam Morton revealed that a manufacturing taskforce, headed by Dow Chemical executive and Saudi Aramco board member Andrew Liveris, is recommending to the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission (itself headed by the current deputy chairman of Strike Energy, Neville Power) that \u201cthe Morrison government make sweeping changes to \u2018create the market\u2019 for gas and build fossil fuel infrastructure that would operate for decades\u201d. It comes off the back of Angus Taylor suggesting it is not government policy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and the government giving in-principle support to recommendations made by a panel headed by a former CEO of Origin Energy, Grant King, to allow the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation fund projects involving carbon capture and storage. Taylor also this week released a discussion paper for a \u201cframework to accelerate low emissions technologies\u201d. While suggesting renewables are vital, it essentially pushes for the same energy mixes that were being advocated a decade ago \u2013 more gas, the discredited carbon capture, as well as nuclear power. The government is like a smoker who still thinks switching to low-tar cigarettes is a healthy approach. It\u2019s the wrong policy at precisely the wrong time. As Morton has reported, organisations and governments around the world are advocating using economic stimulus measures to push towards a greener economy. A report released this week by the Australian Conservation Foundation echoed the Grattan Institute\u2019s recent \u201cStart with steel: A practical plan to support carbon workers and cut emissions\u201d report, arguing that we should see the virus as an opportunity to transform our economy and invest in renewable energy. But no. It is clear the government remains wedded to a fossil-fuel based economy in which its climate change policy is merely a sop rather being designed to deal with a major crisis that is only becoming more urgent.

In truth it has never been more than an addition to manual contact tracing methods, designed to catch infections from random contacts, such as people on the bus or in a queue.</p> <p>But the government has been selling it as much more than that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/covidsafe-app-is-not-working-properly-on-iphones-authorities-admit\">Covidsafe app is not working properly on iPhones, authorities admit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It set a target of 40% of the Australian population using the app for it to be effective. While close to six million Australians now have the app, the number of new downloads has declined in the past few weeks.</p> <p>No actual number was tied to the 40% figure, but based on estimations of the number of Australians with smartphones, it is now about 1.5m under that target.</p> <p>The problem with expressing the target as a percentage of the population is not every Australian has a smartphone, not every person with a smartphone will be able to download the app, and not everyone with a smartphone will want to download the app or will be energised enough.</p> <p>The government\u2019s task was to convince as many people who fall into the last category as possible to sign up.</p> <p>It started with a directive from Hunt setting out what can and cannot be done with the data. Only health officials in the states can access the data, and you can\u2019t be forced to download it.</p> <p>Legislation soon followed, and the government set out protections for the data far beyond many of the protections for other personal data held by the government.</p> <p>An advertising blitz across TV, radio and billboards has encouraged people to download the app. McDonald\u2019s, Hungry Jacks and other retailers sent notifications through their own apps to encourage people to download it.</p> <p>Australians\u2019 attitudes to the app have been mixed at best. Essential polling <a href=\"https://essentialvision.com.au/category/essentialreport/page/2\">earlier this month</a> revealed just over half the population (55%) believed the app would limit the spread of coronavirus, and just under half (48%) believed it would speed up easing of restrictions.</p> <p>A series of Dynata online surveys conducted on behalf of researchers at the University of Melbourne reported Australians were <a href=\"https://psychologicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/research/hubs/chdh/preliminary-results-covid-19-tracking-social-licence\">more supportive</a> of using telecommunications metadata to track close contacts (79%) than they were of downloading an app (69.8%).</p> <p>By the second survey, the support for downloading had dropped to 64%.</p> <p>Prof Simon Dennis, director of the complex human data hub in the Melbourne school of psychological sciences, said the drop was probably influenced by the public debate over the app in April.</p> <p>The other factor, he said, was that lower case numbers meant people felt less at risk of infection and less interested in downloading the app.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/20/apple-google-phone-app-trace-coronavirus\">Apple and Google release phone technology to notify users of coronavirus exposure</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPeople\u2019s perception of risk is definitely dropping,\u201d he said.</p> <p>This week Victoria became the first state to report using the data after a person who tested positive was using the app and consented to upload their data. The contact tracer found one other person not already deemed a close contact, and called them to get tested and to quarantine until the results came back.</p> <p>In part, the app\u2019s lack of utility thus far is a good thing. The chief health officer for New South Wales, Dr Kerry Chant, said this week that despite the state experiencing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/19/nsw-and-victoria-are-unable-to-use-covidsafe-apps-data-for-contact-tracing\">\u201cteething problems\u201d</a> with accessing data from the app, there had been no need to because all the new cases had generally been from returned travellers or people who were already isolating and had no unidentified close contacts.</p> <p>And the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheTodayShow/status/1262866704687943685\">downplayed issues</a> with the app saying manual contact tracing was key.</p> <p>\u201cTwo of the reasons NSW has been able to reduce the number of cases so much is firstly the number of tests we\u2019ve done \u2026 but also the contact tracing we\u2019ve done,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cYes the app is important in speeding up the process, but please know that process happens regardless.\u201d</p> <h2>Plagued by technical issues</h2> <p>Where the app has faltered has been in transparency. Developers have reported difficulty communicating with the Digital Transformation Agency about problems.</p> <p>Early on developers noted the iPhone version would not be able to exchange Bluetooth handshakes with other devices unless it was running on the screen \u2013 incredibly impractical for users.</p> <p>The government initially denied this, refused to answer questions about it, and only once, before the Covid-19 senate committee, did the agencys chief executive, Randall Brugeaud, admit the Bluetooth function suffered when the app wasn\u2019t on screen.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we can say is the quality of the Bluetooth connectivity for phones that have the app installed running in the foreground is very good,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it progressively deteriorates and the quality of the connection is not as good as you get to a point where the phone is locked and the app is running in the background.\u201d</p> <p>That, in part, has been addressed by updates quietly released in the past week, but issues still persist, and will never truly be resolved unless the federal government implements functions released by Apple and Google this week.</p> <p>They move the Bluetooth beacon process to the operating system layer where it is easier to coordinate with other apps. Until then, the iPhone version will not function as effectively as the Android version.</p> <p>The Apple-Google API is being evaluated by the government but according to a Melbourne cryptographer, Vanessa Teague, it would require a major overhaul to the app.</p> <p>When a user tests positive for coronavirus and agrees to upload their data for contact tracing, the contact tracer is sent a long list of everyone that person has been in contact with for the past 21 days to call and tell them to get tested.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/19/nsw-and-victoria-are-unable-to-use-covidsafe-apps-data-for-contact-tracing\">NSW is unable to use Covidsafe app\u2019s data for contact tracing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under the Apple and Google version, the data being uploaded is just a set of keys that user has had for the past 21 days. Other users\u2019 phones play a digital game of bingo, checking in with the national server to see if they have a match for a contact in the past 21 days.</p> <p>If they get an alert they can then get in touch with a health official and go through the same process once testing positive.</p> <p>Health experts are less in favour of this model because it makes it harder to spot outbreaks and is harder to follow up for close contacts, but privacy advocates insist it is the most secure.</p> <p>Teague said in order to get the Bluetooth improvements the government could, in effect, change the engine of the app to move to the Apple-Google API, but it would be a lot of work.</p> <p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t look that much different to the users \u2013 it would still keep the cute, you know, Anzac Day-themed interface, but they would have to completely rearrange the underlying cryptographic notification mechanism in order to use the API,\u201d Teague said.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just improve the Bluetooth of this underlying centralised mechanism they\u2019ve got.\u201d</p> <p>That update, and the 21-day timeframe for recording contacts would mean there would be a period where the app would have to run both the old and new version.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an unsolvable mess, but basically you have to have both versions of the app running,\u201d Teague said.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t interoperate at all.

      "bodyText": "It was sold as the key to unlocking restrictions \u2013 like sunscreen to protect Australians from Covid-19 \u2013 but as the country begins to open up, the role of the Covidsafe app in the recovery seems to have dropped to marginal at best. \u201cThis is an important protection for a Covid-safe Australia,\u201d the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said in late April. \u201cI would liken it to the fact that if you want to go outside when the sun is shining, you have got to put sunscreen on.\u201d \u201cThis is the same thing \u2026 If you want to return to a more liberated economy and society, it is important that we get increased numbers of downloads when it comes to the Covidsafe app \u2026 This is the ticket to ensuring that we can have eased restrictions.\u201d The health minister, Greg Hunt, tweeted that it was the key to being allowed to go back to watching football. Yet nearly a month since launch, the contact tracing app has barely been used \u2013 just one person has been reported to have been identified using data from it. And the language from public officials has been toned down. No longer is it the key to freedoms, but an add-on to existing contact tracing methods, to work in concert with social distancing rules and continued testing to keep a lid on outbreaks. So how did it go from being the key to allowing Australians to get back to the footy to being barely relevant? The big sell The Covidsafe app keeps a record of everyone a user has been in contact with in the past 21 days, using bluetooth technology. In truth it has never been more than an addition to manual contact tracing methods, designed to catch infections from random contacts, such as people on the bus or in a queue. But the government has been selling it as much more than that. It set a target of 40% of the Australian population using the app for it to be effective. While close to six million Australians now have the app, the number of new downloads has declined in the past few weeks. No actual number was tied to the 40% figure, but based on estimations of the number of Australians with smartphones, it is now about 1.5m under that target. The problem with expressing the target as a percentage of the population is not every Australian has a smartphone, not every person with a smartphone will be able to download the app, and not everyone with a smartphone will want to download the app or will be energised enough. The government\u2019s task was to convince as many people who fall into the last category as possible to sign up. It started with a directive from Hunt setting out what can and cannot be done with the data. Only health officials in the states can access the data, and you can\u2019t be forced to download it. Legislation soon followed, and the government set out protections for the data far beyond many of the protections for other personal data held by the government. An advertising blitz across TV, radio and billboards has encouraged people to download the app. McDonald\u2019s, Hungry Jacks and other retailers sent notifications through their own apps to encourage people to download it. Australians\u2019 attitudes to the app have been mixed at best. Essential polling earlier this month revealed just over half the population (55%) believed the app would limit the spread of coronavirus, and just under half (48%) believed it would speed up easing of restrictions. A series of Dynata online surveys conducted on behalf of researchers at the University of Melbourne reported Australians were more supportive of using telecommunications metadata to track close contacts (79%) than they were of downloading an app (69.8%). By the second survey, the support for downloading had dropped to 64%. Prof Simon Dennis, director of the complex human data hub in the Melbourne school of psychological sciences, said the drop was probably influenced by the public debate over the app in April. The other factor, he said, was that lower case numbers meant people felt less at risk of infection and less interested in downloading the app. \u201cPeople\u2019s perception of risk is definitely dropping,\u201d he said. This week Victoria became the first state to report using the data after a person who tested positive was using the app and consented to upload their data. The contact tracer found one other person not already deemed a close contact, and called them to get tested and to quarantine until the results came back. In part, the app\u2019s lack of utility thus far is a good thing. The chief health officer for New South Wales, Dr Kerry Chant, said this week that despite the state experiencing \u201cteething problems\u201d with accessing data from the app, there had been no need to because all the new cases had generally been from returned travellers or people who were already isolating and had no unidentified close contacts. And the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, downplayed issues with the app saying manual contact tracing was key. \u201cTwo of the reasons NSW has been able to reduce the number of cases so much is firstly the number of tests we\u2019ve done \u2026 but also the contact tracing we\u2019ve done,\u201d she said. \u201cYes the app is important in speeding up the process, but please know that process happens regardless.\u201d Plagued by technical issues Where the app has faltered has been in transparency. Developers have reported difficulty communicating with the Digital Transformation Agency about problems. Early on developers noted the iPhone version would not be able to exchange Bluetooth handshakes with other devices unless it was running on the screen \u2013 incredibly impractical for users. The government initially denied this, refused to answer questions about it, and only once, before the Covid-19 senate committee, did the agencys chief executive, Randall Brugeaud, admit the Bluetooth function suffered when the app wasn\u2019t on screen. \u201cWhat we can say is the quality of the Bluetooth connectivity for phones that have the app installed running in the foreground is very good,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it progressively deteriorates and the quality of the connection is not as good as you get to a point where the phone is locked and the app is running in the background.\u201d That, in part, has been addressed by updates quietly released in the past week, but issues still persist, and will never truly be resolved unless the federal government implements functions released by Apple and Google this week. They move the Bluetooth beacon process to the operating system layer where it is easier to coordinate with other apps. Until then, the iPhone version will not function as effectively as the Android version. The Apple-Google API is being evaluated by the government but according to a Melbourne cryptographer, Vanessa Teague, it would require a major overhaul to the app. When a user tests positive for coronavirus and agrees to upload their data for contact tracing, the contact tracer is sent a long list of everyone that person has been in contact with for the past 21 days to call and tell them to get tested. Under the Apple and Google version, the data being uploaded is just a set of keys that user has had for the past 21 days. Other users\u2019 phones play a digital game of bingo, checking in with the national server to see if they have a match for a contact in the past 21 days. If they get an alert they can then get in touch with a health official and go through the same process once testing positive. Health experts are less in favour of this model because it makes it harder to spot outbreaks and is harder to follow up for close contacts, but privacy advocates insist it is the most secure. Teague said in order to get the Bluetooth improvements the government could, in effect, change the engine of the app to move to the Apple-Google API, but it would be a lot of work. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t look that much different to the users \u2013 it would still keep the cute, you know, Anzac Day-themed interface, but they would have to completely rearrange the underlying cryptographic notification mechanism in order to use the API,\u201d Teague said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just improve the Bluetooth of this underlying centralised mechanism they\u2019ve got.\u201d That update, and the 21-day timeframe for recording contacts would mean there would be a period where the app would have to run both the old and new version. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an unsolvable mess, but basically you have to have both versions of the app running,\u201d Teague said. \u201cThey don\u2019t interoperate at all. Everyone running it would have to run both versions for a few weeks.\u201d",

One is acting as a de facto prosecutor in the disciplinary case. The other threatened the student with contempt of court proceedings this week for attempting to cite documents in his defence that had been obtained under subpoena in a separate legal matter.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Pavlou stormed out of a disciplinary hearing decrying it as a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d. No verdict has been handed down but the student told Guardian Australia he is already preparing a supreme court of Queensland appeal, with the high-profile free speech advocate, barrister Tony Morris QC, in tow.</p> <h2><strong>Death threats and \u2018separatist activities\u2019</strong></h2> <p>On 24 June last year, a Hong Kong democracy protest at the university was crashed by a pro-Beijing group, many of whom could not be identified as enrolled students.</p> <p>Video of the incident shows Pavlou involved in an altercation, after first being set upon by the counter-protesters. He is knocked to the ground. The police are called.</p> <p>The aftermath of that event largely set in motion what followed: an increased focus on the university\u2019s relationship with China, and Pavlou escalating his activism.</p> <p>Emails released by the university this week show on the evening of the brawl, a deputy vice-chancellor sent a message to the Chinese consulate in Brisbane to explain how it had handled the situation.</p> <p>Two days later the Chinese consul-general in Brisbane, Xu Jie, released his own statement praising the \u201cspontaneous patriotic behaviour\u201d of the pro-China members of the crowd, and effectively, Pavlou claims, accusing him of \u201canti-China separatist activities \u2013 a capital crime in China\u201d.</p> <p>Recently prior to the incident, the university had made Xu an adjunct professor, but issued no public announcement.</p> <p>\u201cHave a think about the contrast,\u201d Pavlou says. \u201c[The vice-chancellor] has allowed this guy to remain at the university, after applauding violence on campus.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s apparently me who has put their reputation at risk.\u201d</p> <p>Pavlou subsequently sought a court order, similar to a restraining order, against Xu, who he claims endangered him. That case is ongoing.</p> <h2><strong>Ties to China in the spotlight</strong></h2> <p>The University of Queensland, one of the prestigious \u201cgroup of eight\u201d institutions, has arguably the strongest ties to China of any in Australia. Before the coronavirus pandemic about 40% of its international cohort \u2013 about 7,000 students in total \u2013 were from mainland China.</p> <p>H\u00f8j was, until recently, a consultant to Beijing\u2019s global Confucius Institute headquarters \u2013 known as Hanban \u2013 and a member of its governing council, which is responsible for more than 500 institutes operating in universities and schools across the world.</p> <p>UQ\u2019s Confucius Institute was one of several to <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/universities-rewrite-confucius-institute-contracts-amid-foreign-influence-scrutiny-20200310-p548my.html\">renegotiate its contract with Hanban</a>, amid foreign influence concerns. The ABC has revealed the Chinese government has <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-15/chinese-government-cofunded-four-university-of-queensland-course/11601946\">co-funded at least four courses at UQ</a>.</p> <p>Last month under parliamentary privilege, the Liberal senator James Paterson revealed H\u00f8j had <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/liberal-senator-hits-out-at-university-china-reliance-reveals-whistleblower-documents-20200513-p54sf9.html\">received a $200,000 bonus</a> based partly on success in growing the university\u2019s relationship with China.</p> <p>The university\u2019s chancellor, Peter Varghese, told Guardian Australia the university had always been open about its links to China.</p> <p>\u201c[The university\u2019s relationship with China] is completely above board,\u201d Varghese says. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything the university is doing vis-a-vis China that in any way conflicts with the core values of universities.</p> <p>\u201cThis sort of shock and horror that there are a large number of Chinese students in Australia I find rather curious.</p> <p>\u201cThe important thing for Australian universities is that they remain true to their foundational values as a university; those include academic freedom, freedom of speech, rights to peaceful protest.</p> <p>\u201cAt the end of the day, students who come to Australia to study are coming to a liberal democracy to study in. I don\u2019t see any evidence that discussion of human rights issues vis-a-vis China is somehow silenced or sort of muted in Australian campuses.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the university says disciplinary matters were initiated in response to complaints, and were guided by the UQ\u2019s processes and values.</p> <p>\u201cThe claim that an ongoing student disciplinary matter is politically or financially motivated is simply not true.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a responsibility to ensure that all students and staff feel that they are able to express their opinions \u2013 not just those with the loudest voices. Holding different opinions is part of everyday life at university \u2013 that\u2019s what we must continue to protect and stand for.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is important to recognise is that \u2018free speech\u2019 does not absolve us from our responsibilities to ensure other members of our community, including vulnerable people, are not intimidated or vilified.</p> <p>\u201cThe university takes our duty of care to students and staff seriously.

      "bodyText": "On Thursday morning Drew Pavlou, a 20-year-old activist from Brisbane, sent an \u201curgent\u201d email to the vice-chancellor of the University of Queensland, Peter H\u00f8j. Attached was a two-second video of Pavlou, a student representative on the UQ senate, blowing the VC a raspberry. The inflammatory bit of theatre explains a lot about Pavlou, who was last week described as \u201cthe most famous undergraduate student in the world\u201d. Pavlou faces expulsion from the university in relation to his provocative activism, which is focused on the Chinese government, its human rights record and the suppression of democracy in Hong Kong. The sandstone institution\u2019s reaction to his undergraduate stunts has only served to intensify scrutiny \u2013 and bring international attention \u2013 to the university\u2019s links in China. Pavlou has been labelled a \u201cseparatist\u201d by a Chinese diplomat and an \u201canti-China rioter\u201d by state media outlet the Global Times; lauded by free speech advocates and written about by the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post and Foreign Affairs. \u201cMy friends often say \u2018you\u2019ve shitposted your way to international incidents\u2019,\u201d Pavlou says. \u201cI love satire. I had a sort of satirical thing going on. It\u2019s like they can\u2019t handle it or don\u2019t recognise it. \u201cI\u2019m a 20-year-old. Why does Peter H\u00f8j even care about me? Why does the university even care about me? I don\u2019t understand why they are scared of someone like me.\u201d In April, the university tabled a 186-page brief of allegations against Pavlou, including that he \u201cprejudiced the reputation of the university\u201d by criticising and mocking its relationship with China. Guardian Australia has reviewed a summary of the \u201cmisconduct\u201d charges, which include claims his conduct was discriminatory, bullying and abusive. Most of the allegations relate to clearly satirical stunts and his anti-Beijing activism: posing outside the vice-chancellor\u2019s office wearing a Hazmat suit, or promoting a fake Confucius Institute panel discussion about \u201cwhy Uyghurs must be exterminated\u201d. UQ has now hired two separate top-tier law firms to engage with Pavlou. One is acting as a de facto prosecutor in the disciplinary case. The other threatened the student with contempt of court proceedings this week for attempting to cite documents in his defence that had been obtained under subpoena in a separate legal matter. On Wednesday, Pavlou stormed out of a disciplinary hearing decrying it as a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d. No verdict has been handed down but the student told Guardian Australia he is already preparing a supreme court of Queensland appeal, with the high-profile free speech advocate, barrister Tony Morris QC, in tow. Death threats and \u2018separatist activities\u2019 On 24 June last year, a Hong Kong democracy protest at the university was crashed by a pro-Beijing group, many of whom could not be identified as enrolled students. Video of the incident shows Pavlou involved in an altercation, after first being set upon by the counter-protesters. He is knocked to the ground. The police are called. The aftermath of that event largely set in motion what followed: an increased focus on the university\u2019s relationship with China, and Pavlou escalating his activism. Emails released by the university this week show on the evening of the brawl, a deputy vice-chancellor sent a message to the Chinese consulate in Brisbane to explain how it had handled the situation. Two days later the Chinese consul-general in Brisbane, Xu Jie, released his own statement praising the \u201cspontaneous patriotic behaviour\u201d of the pro-China members of the crowd, and effectively, Pavlou claims, accusing him of \u201canti-China separatist activities \u2013 a capital crime in China\u201d. Recently prior to the incident, the university had made Xu an adjunct professor, but issued no public announcement. \u201cHave a think about the contrast,\u201d Pavlou says. \u201c[The vice-chancellor] has allowed this guy to remain at the university, after applauding violence on campus. \u201cBut it\u2019s apparently me who has put their reputation at risk.\u201d Pavlou subsequently sought a court order, similar to a restraining order, against Xu, who he claims endangered him. That case is ongoing. Ties to China in the spotlight The University of Queensland, one of the prestigious \u201cgroup of eight\u201d institutions, has arguably the strongest ties to China of any in Australia. Before the coronavirus pandemic about 40% of its international cohort \u2013 about 7,000 students in total \u2013 were from mainland China. H\u00f8j was, until recently, a consultant to Beijing\u2019s global Confucius Institute headquarters \u2013 known as Hanban \u2013 and a member of its governing council, which is responsible for more than 500 institutes operating in universities and schools across the world. UQ\u2019s Confucius Institute was one of several to renegotiate its contract with Hanban, amid foreign influence concerns. The ABC has revealed the Chinese government has co-funded at least four courses at UQ. Last month under parliamentary privilege, the Liberal senator James Paterson revealed H\u00f8j had received a $200,000 bonus based partly on success in growing the university\u2019s relationship with China. The university\u2019s chancellor, Peter Varghese, told Guardian Australia the university had always been open about its links to China. \u201c[The university\u2019s relationship with China] is completely above board,\u201d Varghese says. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything the university is doing vis-a-vis China that in any way conflicts with the core values of universities. \u201cThis sort of shock and horror that there are a large number of Chinese students in Australia I find rather curious. \u201cThe important thing for Australian universities is that they remain true to their foundational values as a university; those include academic freedom, freedom of speech, rights to peaceful protest. \u201cAt the end of the day, students who come to Australia to study are coming to a liberal democracy to study in. I don\u2019t see any evidence that discussion of human rights issues vis-a-vis China is somehow silenced or sort of muted in Australian campuses.\u201d A spokeswoman for the university says disciplinary matters were initiated in response to complaints, and were guided by the UQ\u2019s processes and values. \u201cThe claim that an ongoing student disciplinary matter is politically or financially motivated is simply not true. \u201cWe have a responsibility to ensure that all students and staff feel that they are able to express their opinions \u2013 not just those with the loudest voices. Holding different opinions is part of everyday life at university \u2013 that\u2019s what we must continue to protect and stand for. \u201cWhat is important to recognise is that \u2018free speech\u2019 does not absolve us from our responsibilities to ensure other members of our community, including vulnerable people, are not intimidated or vilified. \u201cThe university takes our duty of care to students and staff seriously. Our values are not \u2018sport\u2019, they are not \u2018satire\u2019 and we can\u2019t ignore them if that is more convenient. They define who we are and what we stand for.\u201d \u2018Trying to do them slowly\u2019 Pavlou identifies with the political left, though many of his growing band of supporters are libertarian and conservative. When praised by Pauline Hanson, Pavlou welcomed her support and suggested the One Nation senator back it up by \u201cfighting to protect the human rights of all Muslim refugees imprisoned and tortured by our government in Australia\u201d. He didn\u2019t get a response. \u201cI\u2019m not easy with people using me and my activism as a stick to beat China with,\u201d Pavlou says. \u201cI am uneasy when people refer to me as \u2018anti-China\u2019, I fundamentally reject anti-Chinese racism.\u201d He is almost shy, polite and soft-spoken in person; a contrast to some of his more inflammatory social media posts and other stunts. In October 2019 he posted a shirtless photo of himself challenging H\u00f8j to wrestle naked in the great court. When the university announced at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic it would sell cheap care packages to students in need, Pavlou began a competing fundraiser to donate essential supplies for free. He gives his $50,000 stipend as a university senator to charity. Pavlou says the complaints against him have long moved beyond a matter of whether he will be expelled; what remains at stake is how much damage will be done to the university\u2019s reputation in the process. On Thursday, after sending H\u00f8j the raspberry, Pavlou followed up with another email. In it he explained the \u201cStreisand effect\u201d, where the attempt to suppress information only serves to garner further publicity. \u201cIt\u2019s a suicidal path,\u201d Pavlou says. \u201cThey\u2019ve tried to expel me but in the process completely drawn attention to the extent of the university\u2019s relationship with China.\u201d Does he want to be expelled now, to drag the process out? \u201cThe way I would word it is I\u2019m trying to do them slowly, like Paul Keating said. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a bit of sport in this for everyone.\u201d",

They\u2019re the ones saying \u2018I\u2019ll cut back my hours, or I\u2019ve lost my job and I won\u2019t bother looking for one right now because I need to focus on my family\u2019,\u201d Dawson says.</p> <p>As the economic crisis evolves, it is expected it will begin to follow a more traditional route, with reduced population and consumption particularly impacting the construction industry and other male-dominated sectors. Men now account for 47% of jobs lost. This however does not necessarily mean that the impacts of the crisis will be ultimately gender neutral.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Not only have women lost their jobs, they have lost the low level of income they did have</p> <footer> <cite>Marian Baird</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe know that in any economic and health crisis women are impacted more than men, even though past economic crises have focused on men\u2019s loss of jobs,\u201d says Marian Baird, professor of gender and employment relations at the University of Sydney. \u201cWe know that things like equality programs tend to go backwards after recessions and crises.\u201d</p> <p>In more immediate terms, it is the unique nature of this crisis \u2013 hitting women\u2019s sectors first and bringing with it unique and enhanced care and unpaid labour loads \u2013 that has many concerned that the Covid-19 downturn could impact this generation of working women for decades to come.</p> <p>The disproportionate rate of job losses for women at this stage of the downturn is a simple result of occupational gender segregation. Women make up the majority of the workforce in sectors which have been slain by the coronavirus lock down: retail and food services and accommodation. Those sectors have a highly casualised workforce, and are low paid. In Australia the three sectors with the average lowest median wage are all female dominated.</p> <p>\u201cNot only have women lost their jobs, they have lost the low level of income they did have,\u201d Baird says. </p> <p>Given their average low wages, jobkeeper could represent an increase in income for more women than men. However, analysis by Bankwest Curtain Economics Centre found that more women than men were ineligible for this safety net. Even so, Prof Roger Wilkins of the Melbourne Institute expects women would make up the majority of those currently receiving jobkeeper. \u201cSo they\u2019re much more vulnerable to the removal of jobkeeper, in my estimation,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women are much more vulnerable as a group because they are disproportionately employed in industries that will face ongoing challenges</p> <footer> <cite>Roger Wilkins</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Across the country it was part-time women who lost their jobs in the largest number, but the single biggest group which lost jobs were full-time working women in New South Wales, 86,000 of whom lost employment according to Bankwest Curtain Economics Centre. Baird expects that of women impacted, it will be low-income and lower-skilled women who hurt most, but Dawson says figures on reduced working hours suggest that the hit will be generally widespread across different kinds of female workers.</p> <h2>Locked-in losses</h2> <p>Prior to the crisis, women earned on average 13.9% less than men and participated at lower rates, but those gaps had been narrowing as women\u2019s salaries and participation increased at a faster rate than men.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a real concern that we will see that [participation] gap broaden again,\u201d says Assoc Prof Rebecca Cassells of the Bankwest Curtain Economics Centre.</p> <p>Early signs are that gains women have been making are being \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 eroded, she says. \u201cThe bigger concern is whether these losses become locked in.\u201d</p> <p>With women <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2020/may/17/despite-the-horror-of-australias-unemployment-numbers-we-havent-reached-the-bottom-yet\">dropping out of the labour market in disproportionately high numbers</a>, there is a danger that some of them will be locked out of work for good. Experience in past downturns suggest that for some workers who lose their jobs during recession, historically particularly older men, they become unable to return to work at all.</p> <p>Over the past 20 years there has been a 30% increase in older women in the workforce, and previous recessions do not offer a guide to what might happen to them during the recovery. Dawson, however, says that in a highly competitive job market such as the one likely to accompany the recovery it is women with limited flexibility due to care responsibilities that find it hardest to gain work.</p> <p>\u201cLooking forward, I think women are much more vulnerable as a group because they are disproportionately employed in industries that will face ongoing challenges,\u201d Wilkins says. Store-based retail and even food services and accommodation may not return to pre-crisis levels, and during an extended period out of the workforce skill atrophy, losing habits and networks become a problem, he says.</p> <p>\u201cThey certainly are a much more vulnerable labour cohort.\u201d</p> <p>For women in the middle of their working lives, the looming end of \u201cfree\u201d childcare could mean that yet more households decide it is too expensive or cumbersome for the mother to continue to work, particularly if work is difficult to find or wages and hours suppressed.</p> <p>\u201cI do expect to see more women basically detaching themselves, or stopping participation in the workforce entirely [as free child care comes to an end], if they make that calculation that the cost of child care isn\u2019t worth it,\u201d says Dawson.</p> <p>Curtain\u2019s Cassells expects the impact the crisis has had on the aged care sector will likely reduce the propensity of families to place relatives in aged care, and that the care of those older relatives will disproportionately fall on women.</p> <p>\u201cI think there are going to be enhanced pressures on women in terms of their caring responsibilities,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we don\u2019t see a pick-up in the sectors in which women did tend to dominate before this crisis \u2026 then we are going to see participation for women fall more than men.\u201d</p> <p>This has consequences for the financial security and safety of women as they grow older. Already older single women are the fastest-growing group of homeless Australians. Research released this week from YWCA National Housing found that one in eight low-to-moderate income women in regional areas had experienced homelessness within the past five years.</p> <p>Women in Australia retire with a fifth less super than men, and this gap is predominantly a consequence of reducing their working hours or years to provide care. Women of all ages have lower super balances than men, so the government\u2019s decision to allow people to withdraw from their super to enable them to manage through the crisis could harm women more than men in the long term.</p> <p>Nevertheless, many are doing it. To make sure she could get through and provide for her daughters, flight attendant Wilkie has withdrawn from her superannuation.</p> <p>\u201cIt was no question for me.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to live like a queen when I\u2019m 80. I need to provide for my kids and make them comfortable now,\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to have everything. My kids don\u2019t have everything. I do want them to be comfortable as kids and live a life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac17c4b67ba62d10013aa75118aa171de34e0c81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac17c4b67ba62d10013aa75118aa171de34e0c81/0_0_519_355/500.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Wilkie with daughters Caytlyn, 14, and Emily, 8.\" width=\"500\" height=\"342\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca Wilkie with daughters Caytlyn, 14, and Emily, 8. \u2018I don\u2019t need to live like a queen when I\u2019m 80.

Now, however, reform of these areas is more urgent.</p> <p>\u201cIf we\u2019re not careful, and we don\u2019t think really carefully about the policy interventions that we put in place as we try to restore the economy, then women could very, very easily suffer significant effects and economic scarring for decades,\u201d says Dawson. \u201cWe need to think differently about how we value what is known as women\u2019s work \u2013 service work, care work. We undervalue it significantly, yet the whole economy relies on it.\u201d</p> <p>Some hope that the crisis may have shifted attitudes to flexible work, and the value of both paid and unpaid labour provided by women, which could positively and structurally change workplaces and homes for good.</p> <p>\u201cWomen\u2019s work has historically been viewed as less valuable and more expendable than men\u2019s,\u201d Cassells says. \u201cIf there is a positive to this crisis, I hope that it has shown that women\u2019s work is at least as valuable, and that value has increased.\u201d</p>",

Dawson, however, says that in a highly competitive job market such as the one likely to accompany the recovery it is women with limited flexibility due to care responsibilities that find it hardest to gain work. \u201cLooking forward, I think women are much more vulnerable as a group because they are disproportionately employed in industries that will face ongoing challenges,\u201d Wilkins says. Store-based retail and even food services and accommodation may not return to pre-crisis levels, and during an extended period out of the workforce skill atrophy, losing habits and networks become a problem, he says. \u201cThey certainly are a much more vulnerable labour cohort.\u201d For women in the middle of their working lives, the looming end of \u201cfree\u201d childcare could mean that yet more households decide it is too expensive or cumbersome for the mother to continue to work, particularly if work is difficult to find or wages and hours suppressed. \u201cI do expect to see more women basically detaching themselves, or stopping participation in the workforce entirely [as free child care comes to an end], if they make that calculation that the cost of child care isn\u2019t worth it,\u201d says Dawson. Curtain\u2019s Cassells expects the impact the crisis has had on the aged care sector will likely reduce the propensity of families to place relatives in aged care, and that the care of those older relatives will disproportionately fall on women. \u201cI think there are going to be enhanced pressures on women in terms of their caring responsibilities,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we don\u2019t see a pick-up in the sectors in which women did tend to dominate before this crisis \u2026 then we are going to see participation for women fall more than men.\u201d This has consequences for the financial security and safety of women as they grow older. Already older single women are the fastest-growing group of homeless Australians. Research released this week from YWCA National Housing found that one in eight low-to-moderate income women in regional areas had experienced homelessness within the past five years. Women in Australia retire with a fifth less super than men, and this gap is predominantly a consequence of reducing their working hours or years to provide care. Women of all ages have lower super balances than men, so the government\u2019s decision to allow people to withdraw from their super to enable them to manage through the crisis could harm women more than men in the long term. Nevertheless, many are doing it. To make sure she could get through and provide for her daughters, flight attendant Wilkie has withdrawn from her superannuation. \u201cIt was no question for me. \u201cI don\u2019t need to live like a queen when I\u2019m 80. I need to provide for my kids and make them comfortable now,\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to have everything. My kids don\u2019t have everything. I do want them to be comfortable as kids and live a life.\u201d What the crisis reveals \u201cThere\u2019s that cliche: crises don\u2019t change us, they reveal us,\u201d Dawson says. \u201cWhat this crisis is exposing is things that had been becoming problematic in our society and economy for some time.\u201d Problems in the early education and childcare system, the tax and transfer system which structurally favours a household split in which there is a single breadwinner and a part-time worker, and a superannuation system which penalises women for taking time out for unpaid labour all needed review before the Covid-19 crisis, say some speaking with Guardian Australia. Now, however, reform of these areas is more urgent. \u201cIf we\u2019re not careful, and we don\u2019t think really carefully about the policy interventions that we put in place as we try to restore the economy, then women could very, very easily suffer significant effects and economic scarring for decades,\u201d says Dawson. \u201cWe need to think differently about how we value what is known as women\u2019s work \u2013 service work, care work. We undervalue it significantly, yet the whole economy relies on it.\u201d Some hope that the crisis may have shifted attitudes to flexible work, and the value of both paid and unpaid labour provided by women, which could positively and structurally change workplaces and homes for good. \u201cWomen\u2019s work has historically been viewed as less valuable and more expendable than men\u2019s,\u201d Cassells says. \u201cIf there is a positive to this crisis, I hope that it has shown that women\u2019s work is at least as valuable, and that value has increased.\u201d",

Those who believe the damage wrought to their share portfolios means they now qualify for a part-pension have been having trouble dealing with a Centrelink system already struggling with waves of the freshly unemployed, the Association of Independent Retirees says. Dividends have historically been responsible for about 60% of the income reaped from investing in the Australian sharemarket, according to research by Realindex, a division of First Sentier Investors. But, under pressure from the prudential regulator, three of the big four banks have deferred or slashed their previously lucrative dividends, and investors expect Australia\u2019s biggest bank, the Commonwealth, will follow suit after cutting the value of its assets by $1.5bn last week due to the pandemic. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has also called on insurers and other institutions it regulates to cut or defer dividends. And Realindex\u2019s research also shows that analysts expect companies in sectors including energy, transport and consumer services will also cut their payouts to shareholders as the economic effects of shutting down whole industries to crimp the spread of the virus become clear. Wayne Strandquist, the president of Air, said retirees who invested in commercial or residential property were also taking a hit due to tumbling rents. \u201cThey\u2019re struggling to find a reliable source of income,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might have a lot of assets on paper but they\u2019re not making anything.\u201d He said that before the crisis self-funded retirees were attracted to bank stocks because they paid high dividends that were fully franked, meaning tax had already been paid at the corporate rate of 30%. Because of this tax benefit bank stocks paid effective returns of 10% to 11%, rates that were \u201cimpossible to get elsewhere\u201d, Strandquist said. He said bank stocks seemed particularly attractive at a time when term deposit rates were at record lows. \u201cThere were a number of commentators saying, \u2018Don\u2019t put your money in the bank, buy shares in the bank,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey treated it almost as an annuity.\u201d He said retirees now feared for the returns from other high-yield stocks, especially in the infrastructure sector, that they had treated as an alternative to buying bonds. \u201cA lot of the bond proxies, Sydney Airport, Transurban, they\u2019ve been smashed,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>Muslims worldwide prepared to celebrate Eid under lockdown, with the strictest governments bringing in 24-hour curfews for the holiday \u2013 but across the world the slow march is continuing out of coronavirus quarantine.</p> <p>For the first time since the beginning of the outbreak, China said it had recorded no new cases of the virus; <strong>Spain</strong> joined <strong>Greece</strong> in saying it would be reopening to foreign tourists from July, and also said its football league would start again next month.</p> <p>There was positive news from <strong>Africa</strong>, with World Health Organization\u2019s office for the continent <a href=\"https://www.afro.who.int/news/africa-covid-19-cases-top-100-000\">saying that the pandemic</a> \u201cappears to be taking a different pathway in Africa\u201d. It has taken 14 weeks for the continent to reach 100,000 cases, and mortality rates have been lower than in Europe and the US.</p> <p>Swift action to close borders and bring in lockdowns, as well as the continent\u2019s relatively youthful demography \u2013 with more than 60% of the population under 25 \u2013 may have helped slow the spread of the virus and limited its impact.</p> <p>\u201cFor now Covid-19 has made a soft landfall in Africa, and the continent has been spared the high numbers of deaths which have devastated other regions of the world,\u201d said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa.</p> <p>\u201cIt is possible our youth dividend is paying off and leading to fewer deaths. But we must not be lulled into complacency as our health systems are fragile and are less able to cope with a sudden increase in cases.\u201d</p> <p>The global toll now stands at more than 5.2m cases and 339,000 deaths. Over a quarter of all confirmed infections and fatalities are in the <strong>United States</strong>; the <strong>UK</strong> has the second highest death toll; while <strong>Russia</strong> has the second highest number of cases.</p> <p>In <strong>India</strong>, where case numbers are still rising two months into a lockdown, the government has pledged to organise special trains to get at least 3.6 million stranded migrant workers back to their homes. Many have walked hundreds of miles to escape cities where work abruptly dried up.</p> <p>Muslims this weekend will celebrate Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan, but the coronavirus has cast a long shadow over one of year\u2019s most important holidays. Normally a time to gather with friends and family, this year millions will be confined to their homes, worried about work, or without it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902ubvescrjEiDI/\" data-alt=\"Covid deaths in selected countries\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902ubvescrjEiDI/\">Covid deaths in selected countries</a> <figcaption>Covid deaths in selected countries ahead of Eid al-Fitr.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are round-the-clock curfews in countries including <strong>Turkey</strong>, <strong>Iraq</strong> and <strong>Jordan</strong> for the duration of Eid, to prevent any kind of gatherings. <strong>Egypt</strong> has extended a nighttime curfew. In Saudi Arabia,<strong> </strong>home to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, people will be allowed to leave their homes only to buy food and medicine.</p> <p>In <strong>Jerusalem</strong> the al-Aqsa mosque compound \u2013 the third-holiest site in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/islam\">Islam</a> \u2013 will close for the three-day holiday, even though most lockdown restrictions have ended.</p> <p>In <strong>Indonesia</strong>, the world\u2019s biggest Muslim majority nation, authorities have brought in a travel ban, preventing people heading home to celebrate, in an annual migration that normally matches Christmas in the west, or China\u2019s lunar new year.</p> <p>Doni Monardo, the head of the country\u2019s Covid-19 mitigation task force, said thousands were trying to slip home, with some even turning to smugglers and fake travel documents. \u201cI\u2019m afraid people who go to other regions will come back infected and all of our efforts will be wasted,\u201d Monardo said.</p> <p>The country\u2019s death toll at 1,326 is the highest outside Asia, but low rates of testing means officials fear the reality may be much higher.</p> <p>In <strong>Iran</strong>, which has endured the deadliest outbreak in the Middle East, authorities have imposed few restrictions ahead of the holiday aside from cancelling mass prayers in Tehran traditionally led by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p> <p>The Taliban in <strong>Afghanistan</strong> have declared a three-day Eid ceasefire starting on Sunday, a spokesman for the group has tweeted. It comes after fighting intensified between the warring sides despite the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cDo not carry out any offensive operations against the enemy anywhere, if any action is taken against you by the enemy, defend yourself,\u201d wrote spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, adding that the ceasefire was declared solely for Eid festivities. The Afghan government has just welcomed the move.</p> <p>Many religious groups have been pushing for places of worship to reopen, with Donald Trump on Friday adding his voice of support by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/donald-trump-churches-mosques-synagogues-reopen\">ordering churches, mosques and synagogues open</a>, even though he has no authority to do so.</p> <p>But religious gatherings have repeatedly proved sources of mass infection, across faiths and continents. Most recently a cluster of more than 40 cases in <strong>Germany</strong> was traced back to a mass held in Frankfurt on 10 May, a few days after the church reopened for services. Six people were admitted.</p> <p>In the US, the virus claimed another major corporate casualty. Car-hire firm Hertz, which is 102 years old, filed for bankruptcy protection, after revenue particularly from airport car hire dried up. But New York began a gradual opening up, where small groups of up to 10 people will be allowed to gather, if they stay six feet apart or wear face masks.</p> <p>In <strong>China</strong>, despite a recent flare up of cases in the north, the virus still appears to be under control. The country has sealed its borders to all non-citizens for several weeks, to help prevent it resurfacing.</p> <p>Beijing\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday there were only two suspected cases in mainland China: in Shanghai and in the north-eastern Jilin province and no confirmed new cases. New asymptomatic cases fell to 28, from 35 a day earlier, it said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Muslims worldwide prepared to celebrate Eid under lockdown, with the strictest governments bringing in 24-hour curfews for the holiday \u2013 but across the world the slow march is continuing out of coronavirus quarantine. For the first time since the beginning of the outbreak, China said it had recorded no new cases of the virus; Spain joined Greece in saying it would be reopening to foreign tourists from July, and also said its football league would start again next month. There was positive news from Africa, with World Health Organization\u2019s office for the continent saying that the pandemic \u201cappears to be taking a different pathway in Africa\u201d. It has taken 14 weeks for the continent to reach 100,000 cases, and mortality rates have been lower than in Europe and the US. Swift action to close borders and bring in lockdowns, as well as the continent\u2019s relatively youthful demography \u2013 with more than 60% of the population under 25 \u2013 may have helped slow the spread of the virus and limited its impact. \u201cFor now Covid-19 has made a soft landfall in Africa, and the continent has been spared the high numbers of deaths which have devastated other regions of the world,\u201d said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa. \u201cIt is possible our youth dividend is paying off and leading to fewer deaths. But we must not be lulled into complacency as our health systems are fragile and are less able to cope with a sudden increase in cases.\u201d The global toll now stands at more than 5.2m cases and 339,000 deaths. Over a quarter of all confirmed infections and fatalities are in the United States; the UK has the second highest death toll; while Russia has the second highest number of cases. In India, where case numbers are still rising two months into a lockdown, the government has pledged to organise special trains to get at least 3.6 million stranded migrant workers back to their homes. Many have walked hundreds of miles to escape cities where work abruptly dried up. Muslims this weekend will celebrate Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan, but the coronavirus has cast a long shadow over one of year\u2019s most important holidays. Normally a time to gather with friends and family, this year millions will be confined to their homes, worried about work, or without it. There are round-the-clock curfews in countries including Turkey, Iraq and Jordan for the duration of Eid, to prevent any kind of gatherings. Egypt has extended a nighttime curfew. In Saudi Arabia, home to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, people will be allowed to leave their homes only to buy food and medicine. In Jerusalem the al-Aqsa mosque compound \u2013 the third-holiest site in Islam \u2013 will close for the three-day holiday, even though most lockdown restrictions have ended. In Indonesia, the world\u2019s biggest Muslim majority nation, authorities have brought in a travel ban, preventing people heading home to celebrate, in an annual migration that normally matches Christmas in the west, or China\u2019s lunar new year. Doni Monardo, the head of the country\u2019s Covid-19 mitigation task force, said thousands were trying to slip home, with some even turning to smugglers and fake travel documents. \u201cI\u2019m afraid people who go to other regions will come back infected and all of our efforts will be wasted,\u201d Monardo said. The country\u2019s death toll at 1,326 is the highest outside Asia, but low rates of testing means officials fear the reality may be much higher. In Iran, which has endured the deadliest outbreak in the Middle East, authorities have imposed few restrictions ahead of the holiday aside from cancelling mass prayers in Tehran traditionally led by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The Taliban in Afghanistan have declared a three-day Eid ceasefire starting on Sunday, a spokesman for the group has tweeted. It comes after fighting intensified between the warring sides despite the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cDo not carry out any offensive operations against the enemy anywhere, if any action is taken against you by the enemy, defend yourself,\u201d wrote spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, adding that the ceasefire was declared solely for Eid festivities. The Afghan government has just welcomed the move. Many religious groups have been pushing for places of worship to reopen, with Donald Trump on Friday adding his voice of support by ordering churches, mosques and synagogues open, even though he has no authority to do so. But religious gatherings have repeatedly proved sources of mass infection, across faiths and continents. Most recently a cluster of more than 40 cases in Germany was traced back to a mass held in Frankfurt on 10 May, a few days after the church reopened for services. Six people were admitted. In the US, the virus claimed another major corporate casualty. Car-hire firm Hertz, which is 102 years old, filed for bankruptcy protection, after revenue particularly from airport car hire dried up. But New York began a gradual opening up, where small groups of up to 10 people will be allowed to gather, if they stay six feet apart or wear face masks. In China, despite a recent flare up of cases in the north, the virus still appears to be under control. The country has sealed its borders to all non-citizens for several weeks, to help prevent it resurfacing. Beijing\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday there were only two suspected cases in mainland China: in Shanghai and in the north-eastern Jilin province and no confirmed new cases. New asymptomatic cases fell to 28, from 35 a day earlier, it said.",

But a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/one-final-viral-infusion-trumps-move-to-block-travel-from-europe-triggered-chaos-and-a-surge-of-passengers-from-the-outbreaks-center/2020/05/23/64836a00-962b-11ea-82b4-c8db161ff6e5_story.html\">new Washington Post story</a> reveals how that decision and the muddled messaging surrounding it may well have sealed the country\u2019s coronavirus fate.</p> \n  <p>While Trump points to his travel ban of China as evidence of his proactive response, mounting evidence indicates the outbreak was \u201cdriven overwhelmingly\u201d by Europe:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The images [of airport chaos] showed how a policy intended to block the pathogen\u2019s entry into the United States instead delivered one final viral infusion. As those exposed travelers fanned out into U.S. cities and suburbs, they became part of an influx from Europe that went unchecked for weeks and helped to seal the country\u2019s coronavirus fate.</p> \n   <p>Epidemiologists contend the U.S. outbreak was driven overwhelmingly by viral strains from Europe rather than China. More than 1.8 million travelers entered the United States from Europe in February alone as that continent became the center of the pandemic. Infections reached critical mass in New York and other cities well before the White House took action, according to studies mapping the virus\u2019s spread. The crush of travelers triggered by Trump\u2019s announcement only added to that viral load.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And <em>about</em> that China ban, which has become the bulwark of Trump\u2019s defense of his administration\u2019s response:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When Trump moved to block travel from China in January, there were few indications of disruption at affected airports. But while the president has depicted that decision as one he made before anyone else recognized it was necessary, in reality major airlines were forcing his hand.</p> \n   <p>Delta and American had announced on Jan. 31 they were suspending routes to China before Trump announced the restrictions. United informed the White House it had already decided to do the same but was willing to hold off on announcing it publicly if Trump was prepared to act swiftly in issuing an order, officials said.

Bryan Armen Graham will be here to take you through the day later, but for now, I\u2019m your guide. </p> \n  <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/may/15/coronavirus-map-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland</a>, <strong>the US has now recorded 1,601,260 cases and 96,002 deaths</strong>. </p> \n  <p>Rates are slowing in some states hard-hit in the first part of the outbreak, New York notably among them, and increasing elsewhere. Nonetheless, most states are attempting some form of economic reopening \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/us-unemployment-figures-jobs-lost-coronavirus\">nearly 40m Americans have filed for unemployment under lockdown</a>, after all \u2013 and debate is raging over whether those states moving fastest are moving too fast for safety.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s Memorial Day weekend, the traditional start of the American summer, and the title of this piece by Amanda Holpuch, Nina Lakhani and Khushbu Shah rather sums up the question: <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/23/america-coronavirus-covid-19-second-wave\">America begins to unlock for summer \u2013 but is it inviting a disastrous second wave?</a></strong></p> \n  <p>Donald Trump doesn\u2019t think so, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/donald-trump-churches-mosques-synagogues-reopen\">on Friday at the White House</a> he invoked powers he doesn\u2019t have to say governors<strong> should reopen all places of worship</strong> and if they didn\u2019t, he would. Once again, he can\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t if it came to it, do that. <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/can-federal-government-override-state-government-rules-social-distancing-promote-economy\">Tenth amendment, etc</a>. As for the motivation behind Trump\u2019s curt announcement, there are reports that his <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/22/trump-churches-evaneglicals-coronavirus-274842\">support among evangelicals is slipping</a>.</p> \n  <p>That would be intensely worrying for Trump in <strong>a re-election year already marked by economic meltdown</strong>. On the upside for the president, on Friday a gaffe by his notoriously gaffe-prone opponent, Joe Biden (if he were a British football manager, he would\u2019ve earned the standard honorific \u201cthe Gaffer\u201d many years ago), showed how swiftly and ferociously the Trump campaign machine still runs.</p> \n  <p>Some say Biden needs only to stay in his Delaware basement to beat Trump. But on Friday, from his basement, the former vice-president told an African American radio host if you \u201c<strong>have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black</strong>\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/joe-biden-draws-criticism-americans-who-back-trump-aint-black\">Biden apologised as the Trump campaign pounced</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/black-americans-joe-biden-democratic-party-relationship\">liberals too</a>.</p> \n  <p>So there\u2019s that, and any resultant fallout, to consider along with all things coronavirus-related.</p> \n  <p>In the meantime, some further reading.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a look at today\u2019s main stories: Trump tees up controversy as he plays golf in a pandemic. The president visited his own golf club in Virginia as the US coronavirus death toll approaches 100,000 Missouri hairstylist may have exposed 91 people to Covid-19, officials say. The stylist worked at a salon on eight different days while experiencing symptoms after the state\u2019s governor allowed businesses to reopen North Dakota governor on brink of tears as he decries \u2018mask shaming\u2019. Republican Doug Burgum called out \u2018senseless dividing line\u2019 between Americans over whether masks should be worn in public After Donald Trump said on Friday that he believes places of worship should be deemed as essential services, Minnesota\u2019s Democratic governor, Tim Walz, issued an executive order addressing the issue. Places of worship in the state will now be able to open at 25% of capacity. Individuals or households in the buildings must maintain six feet distance. Walz said he still encouraged citizens to worship remotely. \u201cI am under no illusion whatsoever: Every move we make that loosens up increases the risk,\u201d Walz said. President Trump\u2019s slapdash order to temporarily suspend most travel from Europe to the US in an effort to contain the spread of Covid-19 in March was widely criticized for the mayhem it prompted at airports and border entry points. But a new Washington Post story reveals how that decision and the muddled messaging surrounding it may well have sealed the country\u2019s coronavirus fate. While Trump points to his travel ban of China as evidence of his proactive response, mounting evidence indicates the outbreak was \u201cdriven overwhelmingly\u201d by Europe: The images [of airport chaos] showed how a policy intended to block the pathogen\u2019s entry into the United States instead delivered one final viral infusion. As those exposed travelers fanned out into U.S. cities and suburbs, they became part of an influx from Europe that went unchecked for weeks and helped to seal the country\u2019s coronavirus fate. Epidemiologists contend the U.S. outbreak was driven overwhelmingly by viral strains from Europe rather than China. More than 1.8 million travelers entered the United States from Europe in February alone as that continent became the center of the pandemic. Infections reached critical mass in New York and other cities well before the White House took action, according to studies mapping the virus\u2019s spread. The crush of travelers triggered by Trump\u2019s announcement only added to that viral load. And about that China ban, which has become the bulwark of Trump\u2019s defense of his administration\u2019s response: When Trump moved to block travel from China in January, there were few indications of disruption at affected airports. But while the president has depicted that decision as one he made before anyone else recognized it was necessary, in reality major airlines were forcing his hand. Delta and American had announced on Jan. 31 they were suspending routes to China before Trump announced the restrictions. United informed the White House it had already decided to do the same but was willing to hold off on announcing it publicly if Trump was prepared to act swiftly in issuing an order, officials said. Eager to claim credit for acting to contain the virus, Trump\u2019s announcement came within hours. Trump arrived back at the White House following this morning\u2019s golf outing at 2.41pm, according to a pool report. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported 1,595,885 cases of coronavirus, an increase of 24,268. The number of deaths had risen by 1,852 to 96,002. The figures, which have just been announced, were correct as of 4pm ET on Friday, and compared with the same count a day earlier. If you\u2019re wondering about any discrepancies, it\u2019s possible that the CDC figures do not reflect cases reported by individual states. Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson has warned of a second peak of Covid-19 in the southern state nearly 30 days after the first during his coronavirus response media briefing on Saturday in Little Rock. The state\u2019s health department reported 163 new coronavirus cases with two more lives lost in the last 24 hours, he said. That\u2019s the third straight single-day increase of 150 or more, which includes a single-day high of 455 new cases on Thursday. The Republican governor has come under criticism in recent weeks from critics who claim the state is rushing to reopen, though on Saturday he stressed the second peak can be attributed to record levels of testing across the state. Much has been made of armed protesters descending on state capitols in the US, demanding the easing of lockdown restrictions. But there is unrest in Europe too, with protests against the prospect of mass vaccinations against Covid-19 (should one be developed) and the tightening of civil liberties. The Guardian\u2019s Philip Oltermann has more details: For the ninth week running, thousands gathered in European cities to vent their anger at social distancing restrictions they believe to be a draconian ploy to suspend basic civil rights and pave the way for \u201cenforced vaccinations\u201d that will do more harm than the Covid-19 virus itself. Walking towards the focal point of the protests down the Stra\u00dfe des 17. Juni boulevard, one woman said she believed the Covid-19 pandemic to be a hoax thought up by the pharmaceutical industry. \u201cI\u2019d never let myself be vaccinated,\u201d said the woman, who would give her name only as Riot Granny. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a jab for the flu either, and I am still alive.\u201d The alliance of anti-vaxxers, neo-Nazi rabble-rousers and esoteric hippies, which has in recent weeks been filling town squares in cities such as Berlin, Vienna and Zurich is starting to trouble governments as they map out scenarios for re-booting their economies and tackling the coronavirus long term. Even before an effective vaccine against Covid-19 has been developed, national leaders face a dilemma: should they aim to immunise as large a part of the population as possible as quickly as possible, or does compulsory vaccination risk boosting a street movement already prone to conspiracy theories about \u201cbig pharma\u201d and its government\u2019s authoritarian tendencies? You can read the full article below: The Trump administration has repeatedly criticized China\u2019s handling of the pandemic and the vice-president, Mike Pence, continued with that line today during an interview with Breitbart News. \u201cChina let the world down and the World Health Organization was their willing partner in withholding from the United States and the wider world vital information about the coronavirus that would have made it possible to stand up a national response sooner,\u201d Pence said. \u201c... Make no mistake about it that China will be held accountable for what the world has gone through because of their lack of transparency.\u201d Trump has already threatened to withhold funding for the WHO unless it makes unspecified reforms. Most countries have pushed back against Trump\u2019s criticisms, many of which were later proved to be incorrect. \u201cThis is the time for solidarity,\u201d said the European commission\u2019s spokeswoman Virginie Battu-Henriksson. \u201cIt is not the time for finger-pointing or undermining multilateral cooperation. In normal times, basketball fans would be fearing up for the start of the NBA finals. However, the season has been on hiatus since March as the sports world has shut down during the pandemic. The latest plan to restart involves the NBA playing at Disney\u2019s ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando, Florida in late July. The complex has three arenas as well as several hotels that could house players, coaches and support staff, enabling them to isolate from the general population. \u201cThe NBA, in conjunction with the National Basketball Players Association, is engaged in exploratory conversations with The Walt Disney Company about restarting the 2019-20 NBA season in late July at Disney\u2019s ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Florida as a single site for an NBA campus for games, practices and housing,\u201d Bass said. \u201cOur priority continues to be the health and safety of all involved, and we are working with public health experts and government officials on a comprehensive set of guidelines to ensure that appropriate medical protocols and protections are in place.\u201d Players and other staff would be subject to regular testing to ensure Covid-19 did not spread through the league. A few sports in the US have started to resume already: Nascar and UFC have held events without live audiences, while Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson will team up with NFL legends Tom Brady and Peyton Manning in a charity golf tournament tomorrow. Elsewhere, Hall of Fame player and current Georgetown coach Patrick Ewing confirmed he is being treated in hospital after contracting Covid-19. \u201cI want to share that I have tested positive for Covid-19. This virus is serious and should not be taken lightly,\u201d the 57-year-old Ewing said in a statement. \u201cI want to encourage everyone to stay safe and take care of yourselves and your loved ones. Now more than ever, I want to thank the health care workers and everyone on the front lines. I\u2019ll be fine, and we will all get through this.\u201d Ewing was one of the most dominant players of his generation, and played for the New York Knicks from 1985 to 2000. He also won two Olympic gold medals for the US, including as a member of the famed 1992 Dream Team. Hertz is the latest high-profile company to file for bankruptcy during the pandemic. The car-rental company\u2019s business has been hit by the downturn in travel during the pandemic, particularly at airports, where it does much of its trade. Hertz said it hoped that by declaring bankruptcy it can continue to operate. \u201cThe impact of Covid-19 on travel demand was sudden and dramatic, causing an abrupt decline in the company\u2019s revenue and future bookings,\u201d said the company in a statement. Hertz added that it did not know when activity would return to normal. Hertz has been in the car rental business since 1918, when it began offering Model Ts to customers. Other well known business that have declared bankruptcy during the pandemic and subsequent economic problems include JC Penney and clothing company J Crew. Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security, has issued an exemption for some foreign athletes who compete in professional sporting events in the United States from entry bans imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIn today\u2019s environment, Americans need their sports,\u201d Wolf said in a statement issued by the department announcing the exemption. \u201cIt\u2019s time to reopen the economy and it\u2019s time we get our professional athletes back to work.\u201d Reopening the economy in a safe manner is a critical part of the United States\u2019 response to the COVID19 pandemic. United States professional sports leagues and associations either suspended their seasons or postponed the start of their seasons in response to the spread of COVID-19, but now certain professional sporting groups organizing the United States\u2019 largest sporting events, including Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Professional Golfers\u2019 Association Tour (PGA Tour), the National Hockey League (NHL), the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and the Women\u2019s Tennis Association (WTA), are prepared to resume sporting events with limited attendance and other public safety measures. Professional sporting events provide powerful first- and second-order benefits to the national economy, even if attendance is curtailed, due to advertising and broadcasting revenue, hospitality and food service requirements, and commercial cleaning needs. In addition, the sporting organizations that manage the professional leagues are situated to do so in a controlled manner, as they act as a single point of contact to manage player movement and the scheduling of events, and can take other measures to ensure player, staff, and fan safety is appropriately addressed. Professional live sporting events also provide intangible benefits to the national interest, including civic pride and national unity. Based on the benefit live sporting events provide to the national economy, and the need for these sporting events to have full access to their athletes, support staff, and team and league leadership, I hereby determine that it is in the national interest to except from Proclamations 9984, 9992, 9993, and 9996, aliens who compete in professional sporting events organized by certain professional sporting groups, including their professional staff, team and league leadership, spouses, and dependents. I will work with the professional sporting groups, including MLB, the NBA, the PGA Tour, the NHL, the ATP and the WTA, to identify the specific athletes, essential staff, team and league leadership, spouses, and dependents covered by this exemption. This exemption does not exempt those identified individuals from inspection by Customs and Border Protection or any other agency requirements, to include flight funneling enhanced medical screening if applicable as outlined in previously issued Federal Register Notices, when applying for entry into the United States. I may add or remove athletes, essential staff, team and league leadership, spouses, and dependents from the list to which this exemption applies based on my assessment of whether an exemption for such individuals is in the national interest, including the plans of the relevant professional sporting groups to support sporting events in the United States that do not cause an unnecessary risk to the public health. Video has emerged of Trump\u2019s long-awaited return to the links on Saturday at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia. Our Martin Pengelly has more on the president\u2019s first time back at one of his private golf courses in 75 days, which even critics would admit projects a sense of normalcy with more than 1.6m confirmed coronavirus cases in the US and the death toll approaching six figures. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things to think through,\u201d coronavirus taskforce member Dr Deborah Birx said on Friday. \u201cI know you can do this. I know the American people can do it. Please, as you go out this weekend, understand you can go out. \u201cYou can be outside, you can play golf, you can play tennis with marked balls, you can go to the beaches if you stay 6ft apart. But remember that that is your space, and that\u2019s a space that you need to protect and ensure that you social distance for others.\u201d Earlier, I mentioned North Dakota governor Doug Burgum\u2019s tearful plea for unity over the need to wear a mask in public, in which he lamented \u201c a ... senseless dividing line\u201d in US society. Here\u2019s the video: \u2026and here, again, is Poppy Noor\u2019s report on the subject: The Navajo Nation, which spans parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, reported 95 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, bringing the total number of positive cases to 4,529 with 149 deaths, CNN reports. On Monday this week, the Nation surpassed New York state for the highest Covid-19 infection rate per 100,000 people in the whole US. The Nation is now in another 57-hour weekend lockdown, with all residents required to stay home, except essential workers, first responders and healthcare workers. This week, Poppy Noor spoke to Larry Jackson, 16, who is doing much to raise national awareness of the situation in his community: Thirty per cent of people in the Navajo Nation still don\u2019t have clean running water or electricity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are being told to regularly wash our hands but for a lot of people that\u2019s a 40 miles-plus trip. Plus our resources are really low on the Navajo Nation \u2013 there are only six hospitals.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s own reporting revealed the Navajo Nation received its relief package six weeks after it was promised \u2013 only receiving it after suing the federal government. Meanwhile, Indian Country reports that the $8bn relief package set aside for almost 600 Native American Tribes is \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d. Here\u2019s the full piece: New York governor Andrew Cuomo says the number of hospitalizations, intubations and new coronavirus cases are down over the past 24-hour period in his daily briefing from the executive mansion in Albany. Crucially, a total of 84 people have died of Covid-19 \u2013 62 in hospitals and 22 in nursing homes \u2013 down from 109 yesterday. This marks the first time the daily death toll in New York state has fallen under 100 since 24 March. \u201cIn my head, I was always looking to get under 100,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just a sign that we\u2019re making real progress.\u201d Cuomo says the seven-county Mid-Hudson region will open on Tuesday after satisfying the state\u2019s measurements for controlling the coronavirus outbreak and being able to resume business. Long Island could follow on Wednesday if the deaths continue to decline, which would leave only New York City on lockdown. A Missouri hair stylist may have exposed 91 customers and coworkers to coronavirus, public health officials said, after the governor allowed businesses, including salons, to reopen on 4 May. The hair stylist who later tested positive for Covid-19 had been working at a hair salon in Springfield on eight different days,while experiencing coronavirus symptoms. Because the stylist and the customers had worn face coverings, health officials said on Friday, they hoped the interactions would lead to \u201cno additional cases\u201d. The people potentially exposed would be contacted and offered testing, officials said. The potential exposures started a little more than a week after Missouri allowed salons to reopen. As some states across the US begin to loosen public health restrictions, barbershops and hair salons have become a political flashpoint among conservative Americans, with some owners reopening in defiance of public health measures. In Michigan, one barber who refused to close his shop despite shelter-at-home orders staged a hair cutting protest at the state capitol, dubbed \u201cOperation Haircut\u201d, the Lansing State Journal reported. In Texas, a hair salon owner who was briefly jailed after keeping her business open in defiance of public health orders, and who then refused to apologize in court for what she had done, has been championed by Republican leaders, with Texas senator Ted Cruz visiting her salon for a haircut. In Missouri, county health officials said local residents who had been in the same location as the hair stylist with coronavirus, but who had not had direct contact, were \u201cbelieved to be at very low risk\u201d. While infectious, the same individual also visited a Walmart and a Dairy Queen and made three visits to a local gym, they said. Trump is at his golf club in Sterling, Virginia, the pool confirms. Again, White House coronavirus taskforce member Dr Deborah Birx said yesterday playing golf is OK as states seek to reopen, as long as social distancing is observed. But Trump\u2019s decision to play (if indeed he tees off) for the first time since early March is sure to cause controversy. His passion for golf, after all, usually does: Donald Trump has no public events on his schedule today, remember, and here\u2019s something interesting in the circs, via CBS News: The first White House pool report of the day, from John Fritze of USA Today, read thus: Good morning from the White House. Pool is being gathered at the Palm Room doors at 9.37am as a damp and cloudy morning gives way to beautiful blue skies. More detail when we have it. Of course, as we all know, there is both a pandemic on and an all-out assault on Barack Obama, and There Is Always A Tweet from before Trump was president: For what it\u2019s worth, public health expert Dr Deborah Birx said at the White House on Friday that it was OK for the public to go play 18 holes: \u201cYou can all make your decisions about going outside and social distancing, potentially playing golf,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re very careful and you don\u2019t touch the flags and all of those issues, playing tennis with marked balls with just one other person. So you\u2019re only touching your ball. \u201cWe found really people who enjoy sports have been able to really adjust to social distancing, but you can see \u2026 Maryland, the District, and Virginia \u2026 there is still significant virus circulating here.\u201d No word yet from the pooler on whether Trump was socially distancing from his caddie or partners, if indeed golf was on the menu. Monitoring. It has been widely reported \u2013 by the Guardian, here \u2013 that the wearing of masks or not has become a new front in the US culture war. In very, very general terms, extraordinarily general terms, Democrats wear them and Republicans don\u2019t. In more specific terms, Donald Trump is notoriously unwilling to cover his mouth and nose in public, although he did wear a mask in non-media-facing parts of a tour of a Ford plant in Michigan this week. In North Dakota on Friday, though, Republican governor Doug Burgum was so keen to urge citizens not to politicise the issue that he was moved to tears. \u201cThis is a \u2026 senseless dividing line,\u201d Burgum said, according to a Washington Post report, \u201cand I would ask people to try to dial up your empathy and your understanding. \u201cIf someone is wearing a mask, they\u2019re not doing it to represent what political party they\u2019re in or what candidate they support. They might be doing it because they\u2019ve got a five-year-old who\u2019s been going through cancer treatments.\u201d The Post report added that Burgum \u201cbegan to choke up\u201d, and continued: They might have vulnerable adults in their life who \u2026 currently have Covid-19 and are fighting. So again, I would just love to see our state, as part of being \u2018North Dakota smart,\u2019 also be \u2018North Dakota kind,\u2019 \u2018North Dakota empathetic.\u2019\u201d North Dakota does not require residents to wear masks in public settings, as some states have. Federal health authorities have recommended that Americans cover their faces in public when social distancing is difficult \u2013 for example, in grocery stores. Some officials have nixed mandates that people wear masks in stores, with one city\u2019s leaders citing threats and harassment against employees. Clashes over masks have also turned deadly: prosecutors say a Family Dollar security guard was shot and killed in Flint, Michigan, this month after telling a customer her child had to wear a mask to enter. According to Johns Hopkins, by Saturday North Dakota had recorded 2,317 coronavirus cases, and 52 deaths. Burgum allowed reopening to start from 1 May. The Associated Press, helpful as always, considers reactions to Trump\u2019s constitutionally incontinent demand that governors reopen churches and other houses of worship. As the AP notes, \u201cfollowing Trump\u2019s announcement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new guidelines for communities of faith on how to safely reopen, including recommendations to limit the size of gatherings and consider holding services outdoors or in large, well-ventilated areas.\u201d But \u201cin-person religious services have been vectors for transmission of the virus. A person who attended a Mother\u2019s Day service at a church in northern California that defied the governor\u2019s closure orders later tested positive, exposing more than 180 churchgoers. And a choir practice at a church in Washington state was labeled by the CDC as an early \u2018superspreading\u2019 event.\u201d Elsewhere, the AP is reporting from Germany that \u201cseveral members of a congregation\u201d in Frankfurt have fallen ill, with six in hospital, after attending a service. But Trump is attempting to reassure his evangelical supporters. The AP continues: \u201c\u2026Churches around the US have filed legal challenges opposing virus closures. In Minnesota, after Democratic governor Tim Walz declined to lift restrictions on churches, Roman Catholic and some Lutheran leaders said they would defy his ban and resume worship services. They called the restrictions unconstitutional and unfair since restaurants, malls and bars were allowed limited reopening. \u201c\u2026Some hailed the president\u2019s move, including Kelly Shackelford, president of the conservative First Liberty Institute. \u201cThe discrimination that has been occurring against churches and houses of worship has been shocking,\u201d he said. \u201cAmericans are going to malls and restaurants. They need to be able to go to their houses of worship.\u201d But Rabbi Jack Moline, president of Interfaith Alliance, said it was \u201ccompletely irresponsible\u201d for Trump to call for a mass reopening. \u201cFaith is essential and community is necessary; however, neither requires endangering the people who seek to participate in them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe virus does not discriminate between types of gatherings, and neither should the president.\u201d Rhode Island governor Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, made clear churches and other houses of worship will not resume in-person services in her state until at least next weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s reckless to force them to reopen this weekend. They\u2019re not ready,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a good plan. I\u2019m going to stick with it.\u201d New Hampshire governor Chris Sununu, a Republican, said he would review the federal guidance while maintaining a decision rests with him. \u201cObviously we\u2019d love to get to the point where we can get those open, but we\u2019ll look at the guidance documents and try to make some decisions rather quickly, depending on what it might say,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the governor\u2019s decision, of course.\u201d Donald Trump has no public events scheduled today or tomorrow \u2013 which, briefing fans, means, at the moment, no briefing \u2013 but he is busy tweeting. Among his early targets is of course Joe Biden, his presumptive opponent in the election in November. On Friday, Biden told an African American radio host if black voters \u201chave a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black\u201d. Controversy spread like brush fire and Biden swiftly apologised, telling the US Black Chambers, a business group, he \u201cshouldn\u2019t have been such a wise guy\u201d and \u201cshouldn\u2019t have been so cavalier\u201d. Biden also said he would never \u201ctake the African American community for granted\u201d but Republicans obviously hope he will, or that such voters will think he will, given comments like this. And so, with the Trump campaign having pounced, launching a website and selling t-shirts featuring their new and gifted slogan, here comes the president. First on Saturday, he touted \u201cAll things that I have GOTTEN DONE, including Criminal Justice Reform!\u201d. That bipartisan legislative achievement was indeed supported by many in the African American community, a part of the US population disproportionately affected by draconian sentencing, as indeed it has been disproportionately hit by the coronavirus. Then: \u201cSleepy Joe cannot bring us to greatness. He is the reason I\u2019m here!\u201d For good measure, Trump also repeated his Friday night attacks on Dean Baquet, the first African American executive editor of the New York Times who the president claims has \u201clong been considered one of the dumbest men in the world of journalism\u201d. Trump\u2019s attacks on Baquet and the Times are familiar, however, and not generally considered part of the president\u2019s own long history of racially tinged invective. On the flip side of all this, Biden is indeed strongly supported by African American voters, who do heavily favour the Democrats. Biden is also considering prominent African American women to be his running mate and he does have in his corner the first African American president, Barack Obama. \u201cYou rarely have a former president that is more popular than the now-sort-of-nominee,\u201d Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher tells Daniel Strauss in the following piece. \u201cBarack Obama is the most popular political figure in America right now.\u201d More about Donald Trump and hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial drug some claim can be used to treat or guard against coronavirus, which the president says he has been taking but which studies suggest is unproven regarding Covid-19 and potentially lethal to people with pre-existing health problems. At the White House on Friday, public health expert Dr Deborarh Birx was asked about a new global study from the Lancet which says the drug has increased deaths in hospitals around the world during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI think the FDA has been very clear on their website about their concerns about hydroxychloroquine,\u201d Birx said. \u201cWhat I take home from the Lancet study, and I hope everyone here does in addition to what you just commented on, it clearly shows the comorbidity that puts individuals at more risk. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of our clearest studies because there were so many, tens of thousands of individuals involved that the doctors clearly annotated who had heart disease and who had obesity. You can see dramatically the increase risk for that.\u201d Reporters were not able to press the point, as press secretary Kayleigh McEnany stepped in. But here\u2019s the thing: by the results of his last published physical Trump is according to federal standards obese, as House speaker Nancy Pelosi pointed out this week. Back in November, meanwhile, an unexplained visit to hospital led the president and the White House doctor to stress that Trump had not had a heart attack, as rumoured. Trump, 73, said then he had started his annual physical, which would be completed in January. But since then\u2026 crickets. In early March, he was asked when he would complete his physical exam. \u201cI\u2019m going probably over the next 90 days,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so busy, I can\u2019t do it.\u201d In April, Trump said he would finish the tests \u201cat the appropriate time \u2026 but I feel very good.\u201d No results have been released. Some raw politics now: on Friday night Donald Trump told Alabamans not to trust Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, Jeff Sessions for short, their former senator who became Trump\u2019s first attorney general, recused himself from the Russia investigation, lost his boss\u2019s support, clung on for more than a year in the face of presidential rage and humiliation, was finally fired and then decided to run for his old seat in Congress. Unusually, Sessions snapped back at the president. More usually, he did so while still being supportive of Trump \u2013 because you have to be if you\u2019re a Republican seeking election in Alabama, as Sessions\u2019 infamous \u201chostage tape\u201d campaign ad showed. Here\u2019s what Sessions wrote on Friday night: Look, I know your anger, but recusal was required by law. I did my duty and you\u2019re damn fortunate I did. It protected the rule of law and resulted in your exoneration. Your personal feelings don\u2019t dictate who Alabama picks as their senator, the people of Alabama do.\u201d Sessions also attacked his Trump-endorsed opponent in the forthcoming Republican run-off, former college football coach Tommy Tuberville, as a coward who did not support Trump\u2019s agenda as faithfully as Sessions. Tuberville is however leading in the polls, and looks set to be the man to take on Doug Jones, the Democrat who won an upset victory over Judge Roy Moore in December 2017, in November\u2019s election. The full report is here: \u2026 and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in the US, and the politics around it. Bryan Armen Graham will be here to take you through the day later, but for now, I\u2019m your guide. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, the US has now recorded 1,601,260 cases and 96,002 deaths. Rates are slowing in some states hard-hit in the first part of the outbreak, New York notably among them, and increasing elsewhere. Nonetheless, most states are attempting some form of economic reopening \u2013 nearly 40m Americans have filed for unemployment under lockdown, after all \u2013 and debate is raging over whether those states moving fastest are moving too fast for safety. It\u2019s Memorial Day weekend, the traditional start of the American summer, and the title of this piece by Amanda Holpuch, Nina Lakhani and Khushbu Shah rather sums up the question: America begins to unlock for summer \u2013 but is it inviting a disastrous second wave? Donald Trump doesn\u2019t think so, and on Friday at the White House he invoked powers he doesn\u2019t have to say governors should reopen all places of worship and if they didn\u2019t, he would. Once again, he can\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t if it came to it, do that. Tenth amendment, etc. As for the motivation behind Trump\u2019s curt announcement, there are reports that his support among evangelicals is slipping. That would be intensely worrying for Trump in a re-election year already marked by economic meltdown. On the upside for the president, on Friday a gaffe by his notoriously gaffe-prone opponent, Joe Biden (if he were a British football manager, he would\u2019ve earned the standard honorific \u201cthe Gaffer\u201d many years ago), showed how swiftly and ferociously the Trump campaign machine still runs. Some say Biden needs only to stay in his Delaware basement to beat Trump. But on Friday, from his basement, the former vice-president told an African American radio host if you \u201chave a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black\u201d. Biden apologised as the Trump campaign pounced \u2013 and liberals too. So there\u2019s that, and any resultant fallout, to consider along with all things coronavirus-related. In the meantime, some further reading. Khushbuh Shah reports from Georgia, a Republican state turning slightly more Democratic, on how one\u2019s view of how soon to reopen depends largely on the way one votes:",
