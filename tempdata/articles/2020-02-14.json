About 40% of people in the UK believe at least one conspiracy theory of some kind, say the researchers from East Anglia University. The figures are even higher in the United States and other parts of the world. Their study, supported by Public Health England, looked at the impact of scare stories, rumours and false information about diseases such as norovirus, flu and monkeypox, shared on sites such as Twitter.

Earlier on Thursday it was revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/13/china-to-open-up-its-internet-for-100000-students-hit-by-australias-coronavirus-travel-ban\">China had agreed to relax some of its internet restrictions</a> so students could study online as they waited to enter the country.</p> <p>\u201cIt is still some four to six weeks before we reach a period of time when it will start impacting on the [academic] year,\u201d Morrison said on Thursday. \u201cThey have put in measures like online learning which can address that for now.\u201d</p> <p>Queensland state Labor MP Kate Jones said she \u201ccould not believe\u201d Morrison had not yet offered financial assistance, and that the state\u2019s tourism council had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katejonesqld/status/1227847287528775680\">written to him \u201ccrying out for funding\u201d</a>.</p> <p>All people, including Australian citizens and residents, must isolate themselves for 14 days after they have left China, or if they have been in close contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said the continued expansion of the outbreak outside of the locked-down province of Hubei was the rationale for extending the travel ban. <strong><br><br></strong>\u201cWe\u2019ve recommended the continuation of the travel ban for an additional week at this time. There has been significant growth in Hubei province, in other provinces in China there has been slower growth, perhaps not at the same rate as we\u2019ve seen previously, but still growth.<br><strong><br></strong>\u201cThat is the reason why we would like to maintain the travel ban at the moment,\u201d he said.<strong><br></strong><br>Murphy said if Chinese authorities were able to stop the smaller outbreaks outside of Hubei, Australia would be able to review the ban.<strong><br><br></strong>The chief medical officer said there had been no new cases detected in Australia, and commended those Australians who\u2019d returned from China and \u201cbehaved impeccably\u201d in adhering to self-isolation.<strong><br><br></strong>There are no confirmed cases among the 538 Australian citizens and permanent residents currently in quarantine on Christmas Island or Manigurr-Ma work camp in the Northern Territory.</p> <p>The economic impact of the travel ban on Australia\u2019s tourism and education sectors is estimated to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/12/coronavirus-fallout-could-leave-australian-tourism-and-retail-sector-in-the-doldrums\">slash 0.5% from Australia\u2019s GDP growth</a> in the first quarter, according to analysts from ANZ bank.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Australian government has extended its travel ban on people who have travelled through China by another week, Scott Morrison has announced. The ban, initially set for 14 days and due to expire on Saturday, was extended on Thursday on the advice of Australia\u2019s health authorities and the national security committee. The ban would be reviewed every week, the prime minister said. Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family are exempt from the ban, designed to limit the spread of the new coronavirus, now named Covid-19. In its original statement on 1 February, the government said foreign nationals in mainland China \u201cwill not be allowed to enter Australia for 14 days from the time they have left or transited through mainland China\u201d. The ban does not apply to people who left China before 1 February, or to travellers from Hong Kong and Macau. Overnight, the number of new cases of Covid-19 rose by 14,887 in the Hubei province where it first emerged \u2013 a sevenfold increase on the day before. China recorded 245 new deaths, taking the national total to 1,359. Globally, more than 60,000 people have been infected by the virus, and 1,369 have died. There have been 15 cases of Covid-19 in Australia, with no deaths, and five people have recovered from the virus. There have been no recorded human-to-human transmissions of Covid-19 in the general community in Australia. All cases in Australia contracted the disease while in Wuhan, except for one person who had contact, in China, with a person with the virus. On Thursday Morrison said arrangements to protect Australia from coronavirus \u201care working\u201d. \u201cThis afternoon we have agreed to accept the recommendations to maintain the ban on entry restrictions on foreign nationals from mainland China for a further week. This is something we will continue to review on a weekly basis, and consider all the medical evidence on a weekly basis.\u201d He encouraged Australians to support members of the Chinese Australian community, who have been subject to a range of racist responses to the outbreak. \u201cAs we go into the weekend I encourage everyone to support Chinese-Australian businesses ... they are such an integral part of Australian life and it is important that all Australians are putting their arms around them and supporting them, in any way they can.\u201d He also extended his thoughts to China, saying \u201cwe will bounce back together\u201d. The prime minister said he was \u201cvery mindful of the economic impacts\u201d of the extended ban, but was not currently looking at providing financial assistance to the tourism and education sectors. International students contributed $34bn to the Australian economy last year, and the ban is expected to result in $8bn of losses. A range of universities have delayed the start of semester, or allowed international students to enrol later. Earlier on Thursday it was revealed that China had agreed to relax some of its internet restrictions so students could study online as they waited to enter the country. \u201cIt is still some four to six weeks before we reach a period of time when it will start impacting on the [academic] year,\u201d Morrison said on Thursday. \u201cThey have put in measures like online learning which can address that for now.\u201d Queensland state Labor MP Kate Jones said she \u201ccould not believe\u201d Morrison had not yet offered financial assistance, and that the state\u2019s tourism council had written to him \u201ccrying out for funding\u201d. All people, including Australian citizens and residents, must isolate themselves for 14 days after they have left China, or if they have been in close contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said the continued expansion of the outbreak outside of the locked-down province of Hubei was the rationale for extending the travel ban. \u201cWe\u2019ve recommended the continuation of the travel ban for an additional week at this time. There has been significant growth in Hubei province, in other provinces in China there has been slower growth, perhaps not at the same rate as we\u2019ve seen previously, but still growth. \u201cThat is the reason why we would like to maintain the travel ban at the moment,\u201d he said. Murphy said if Chinese authorities were able to stop the smaller outbreaks outside of Hubei, Australia would be able to review the ban. The chief medical officer said there had been no new cases detected in Australia, and commended those Australians who\u2019d returned from China and \u201cbehaved impeccably\u201d in adhering to self-isolation. There are no confirmed cases among the 538 Australian citizens and permanent residents currently in quarantine on Christmas Island or Manigurr-Ma work camp in the Northern Territory. The economic impact of the travel ban on Australia\u2019s tourism and education sectors is estimated to slash 0.5% from Australia\u2019s GDP growth in the first quarter, according to analysts from ANZ bank.",

      "bodyText": "Anthony Albanese has accused Scott Morrison of personal involvement in the Coalition\u2019s controversial $100m sports grant program and misleading parliament by claiming that all projects funded were eligible. The Labor leader cited evidence from the Australian National Audit Office on Thursday evening that in fact 43% of projects, 290 in total, were ineligible for the community sport infrastructure grant program when agreements were signed. The evidence stunned the Morrison government, which had relied on the ANAO\u2019s conclusion that \u201cno applications assessed as ineligible were awarded grant funding\u201d to defend the program, only to discover at the Senate inquiry hearing that statement referred only to the point in time projects were assessed by Sport Australia and not their current status. ANAO officials also revealed the prime minister\u2019s office made \u201cdirect\u201d representations about which projects to fund, including the exchange of dozens of emails with the former sport minister Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office and several versions of controversial spreadsheets that colour-coded projects by electorate and party. On Friday, Albanese told reporters in Sydney that Morrison had said 18 times \u2013 including in the parliament \u2013 that all projects were eligible. In press conferences and interviews in the past month, Morrison has variously said that \u201cthe auditor general found that there were no ineligible projects\u201d, \u201cthere [were] no issues about ineligibility of any projects\u201d and \u201cthere were no ineligible projects that were funded under this scheme\u201d. \u201cThey were all eligible projects,\u201d Morrison told the House of Representatives on 5 February. Albanese said \u201cin fact\u201d that 43% of projects were not eligible, suggesting Morrison is \u201cloose with the truth\u201d and had attempted to use \u201cmarketing and spin\u201d to solve a political problem. \u201cHe has misled the Australian people. He has also misled the parliament, yet again. And he will have to correct the record when parliament resumes in a week\u2019s time.\u201d Although the ANAO found in its report, published in January, that \u201cno applications assessed as ineligible [by Sport Australia] were awarded grant funding\u201d, ANAO officials revealed on Thursday that some 290 projects subsequently became ineligible. The majority of these (272) were ineligible because work had started by the time agreements were signed, a result of the community sport infrastructure grant program being extended to a second and third round months before the 2019 federal election. The Coalition senators Matt Canavan and Eric Abetz were stunned by the ANAO officials\u2019 evidence on Thursday, seeking to confirm that no ineligible projects were funded only to be contradicted by Brian Boyd, the ANAO performance audit services group executive director, who replied: \u201cThat\u2019s not what we found.\u201d On Friday, the government doubled down, with the deputy prime minister Michael McCormack and the finance minister Mathias Cormann both defending the eligibility of projects. \u201cNo project which was funded was assessed as ineligible at the time the assessment was made,\u201d Cormann told reporters in Perth. \u201cThe point here is when the minister exercised her discretion in relation to funding decisions \u2026 not a single project which received funding had been assessed as ineligible.\u201d In Sunshine Beach, McCormack committed to consider the Senate committee\u2019s report after it had concluded rather than rush to judgment on evidence from the first night of what he called a \u201cpolitically charged\u201d inquiry. Earlier, Albanese described the sports grants program as \u201ca scandal of massive proportions\u201d both because of the number of ineligible projects funded and because volunteers in community sporting organisations had spent \u201chundreds of hours putting forward submissions to a scheme that they thought would be funded on the basis of merit and we now know it was all about politics\u201d. In its scathing report the ANAO found the $100m community sport infrastructure fund was targeted at marginal or Coalition target electorates, eventually prompting McKenzie to resign on 2 February over a conflict of interest in one grant. Albanese seized on revelations that dozens of emails were exchanged between Morrison and McKenzie\u2019s offices about the program. \u201cNo wonder it took them so long to sack Bridget McKenzie because, quite clearly, Scott Morrison was in this right up to his neck,\u201d he said. On Thursday the auditor general, Grant Hehir, said that although Morrison\u2019s office made both direct and indirect representations about which projects should be funded, not all representations changed the outcome of funding decisions. The ANAO did not find sufficient correlation between representations and an outcome to make it a focus of the audit. \u201cThe evidence before us was that the minister [Bridget McKenzie] was the decision-maker,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we had have identified someone else as the decision-maker, we would have gone down that path.\u201d On Thursday, Morrison was caught by surprise by the new evidence, telling reporters at a press conference to discuss the coronavirus that he hadn\u2019t seen the ANAO statement. Earlier, Albanese dismissed the relevance of mere \u201celigibility\u201d, arguing it is \u201cspin\u201d that does not mean the most meritorious projects won funding. \u201cI am eligible to play Davis Cup for Australia. I play for Marrickville lawn tennis club \u2026 I am in division two, grade five,\u201d he said. \u201cSo chances are there are tens of thousands of players who are better suited to play Davis Cup rather than me.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sajid Javid\u2019s sudden cabinet departure electrified what had initially been billed as Boris Johnson\u2019s modest reshuffle, bringing out references to bloodbaths, knifings, warning shots and power grabs on the front pages. Deploying the magic of photoshop, the Mirror portrays No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings as the puppet master, saying he ordered a \u201cbrutal cabinet cull\u201d. It says the government is now \u201cfilled with spineless stooges\u201d. It is not the only newspaper to go with the headline: \u201cBloodbath\u201d. The Guardian says \u201cBrutal Johnson tightens grip as Javid forced out\u201d and notes the influence of Cummings, the rapid rise of loyalist replacement Rishi Sunak and the departures of Andrea Leadsom, Geoffrey Cox and Julian Smith. The Telegraph carries an air of celebration, saying the PM has \u201cbrought the Treasury to heel\u201d and seized control in the biggest power grab of modern times. It reports: \u201cThe move follows years of frustration among senior Brexiteers who believe that the Treasury was seeking to thwart Britain\u2019s exit from the EU.\u201d The hope now is that budget will \u201ccut taxes and boost enterprise in the wake of Brexit\u201d, it says. Cartoonist Matt takes a jab at Cummings in his Valentine\u2019s Day offering. The Daily Mail goes hyperbolic with not one but two bloodbaths: a report on Harry and Meghan axing their UK staff, as well as Johnson\u2019s \u201cbrutal power grab\u201d. Its treatment focuses on Javid\u2019s response, saying \u201cno self-respecting minister\u201d could stay on the terms put to him by the PM (namely, to fire all your advisers). \u201cSajid fury over PM knifing\u201d is the headline. The Times also gives prominence to Javid\u2019s concerns about the credibility of the Treasury and the integrity of the PM\u2019s inner circle. The headline is \u201cJavid fires warning shot at Johnson\u201d. It says Sunak, his replacement, is already being pressured by No 10 to ditch Javid\u2019s spending commitments in next month\u2019s budget. It says the pound rose on expectations of a \u201cgiveaway budget\u201d. Metro riffs off Javid\u2019s family history in public transport with the simple headline: \u201cThrown under the bus\u201d. Its says Johnson ambushed Javid with a demand to sack all his aides and makes particular reference to reports that Cummings called him \u201cChino\u201d (chancellor in name only). The Express says \u201cBoris the iron man tightens his grip\u201d after Javid lost a power struggle with No 10. The i says \u201cJavid quits as No 10 takes control\u201d. It reports in bullet points that the reshuffle was thrown into chaos by the sudden departure of Johnson\u2019s most powerful minister four weeks before the budget, and blames Cummings for the rift with No 11. The FT adds a rare bit of budget red to its front page picture featuring Cummings, Johnson, Javid and Sunak. It says: \u201cJavid walks out in protest over Johnson\u2019s Treasury power grab\u201d, explaining that the battle centred on how to manage Britain\u2019s finances after Brexit, and says the pound rose on expectations that the purse strings might be loosened. There is front-page billing for an opinion column by Robert Shrimsley that points out that the departure was unnecessary and shows the PM will brook no dissent. \u201cChaotic exit shows compliance trumps competence in Downing Street\u201d is the headline. The Sun focuses on a mother\u2019s concerns that her young son might have contracted the coronavirus but it briefly mentions Javid\u2019s departure and his call for the PM to retain people who can give him \u201cclear and candid advice\u201d. The headline is \u201cSaj raps PM as he quits\u201d.",

An Obama-era justice department official, Matthew Miller, wrote that Barr was telling Trump that if he \u201cwould just shut up, Barr could take care of him much more effectively\u201d. The White House said Barr had a right to his opinion. The Republican majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, told Fox News: \u201cIf the attorney general says it\u2019s getting in the way of doing his job, the president should listen to the attorney general.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Cummings and goings \u2013 </strong>The modest reshuffle that quickly escalated into high drama has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/sajid-javids-exit-leaves-boris-johnson-in-control-of-treasury\">left Boris Johnson with control of the Treasury</a>, Heather Stewart writes this morning.

In Huanggang \u2013 one of the worst-hit areas outside of Wuhan \u2013 and Dawu county in central Hubei, authorities gave orders \u201cfully sealing\u201d all residential areas and banning private use of vehicles. American officials, though, have questioned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/coronavirus-china-not-being-honest-says-us-as-wartime-measures-widened\">whether China is being honest</a> in its sharing of information on the outbreak.

UK experts have warned that fake news and advice about the Covid-19 virus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/coronavirus-false-rumours-cost-lives-researchers\">could cost lives</a>. Prof Paul Hunter from East Anglia University said: \u201cWorryingly, people are more likely to share bad advice on social media than good advice from trusted sources.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/14/coronavirus-latest-updates-wuhan-hubei-china-deaths-cruise-ship-sydney-cases-covid19-live-news\">Find out more at our live blog</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Racism in medical schools \u2013 </strong>Black, Asian and minority ethnic trainee doctors are experiencing a \u201cclimate of fear\u201d at medical schools amid a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/feb/14/bame-trainee-doctors-in-climate-of-fear-over-racism\">failure to address widespread racism</a>, according to the British Medical Association. Its investigation with the British Medical Journal (BMJ) found medical schools were ill-prepared to deal with racism against students. Of the 32 medical schools that responded to freedom of information requests, only half said they kept specific record of racism complaints. Gurdas Singh, co-chair of the BMA\u2019s medical students committee, said the most common racist incidents included patients refusing to be treated by BAME people, and female black medical students being mistaken for nurses. The BMA has launched a charter for medical schools that offers guidance for students on how to get support and calls for dedicated procedures to handle racism complaints.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Chatbot sex sting \u2013 </strong>Anti-slavery campaigners have used chatbots to disrupt sex trafficking by drawing thousands of men into online conversations and then confronting them with messages to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/13/sex-worker-chatbots-fool-thousands-to-hit-trafficking-industry\">deter them from buying sex online</a>. Seattle Against Slavery said it led to a 50% decline in the city for online searches with keywords such as \u201cteen escort\u201d. The bots had about 19,000 conversations with 15,000 people.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018I\u2019m not going to be bullied\u2019 Hello, Warren Murray with you as we find ourselves crashing into the end of another week. The US attorney general, William Barr, has publicly rebuked Donald Trump, saying the president\u2019s tweets about the case of Roger Stone \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody ... whether it\u2019s Congress, a newspaper editorial board, or the president,\u201d said Barr, in the wake of the justice department intervening in Stone\u2019s case after the president vented his anger about the severity of the sentence being sought. \u201cI\u2019m gonna do what I think is right,\u201d Barr added. \u201cAnd you know \u2026 I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me.\u201d Observers were sceptical about Barr\u2019s bullish stance, given that he presented a watered-down assessment of Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation findings to shield the president. An Obama-era justice department official, Matthew Miller, wrote that Barr was telling Trump that if he \u201cwould just shut up, Barr could take care of him much more effectively\u201d. The White House said Barr had a right to his opinion. The Republican majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, told Fox News: \u201cIf the attorney general says it\u2019s getting in the way of doing his job, the president should listen to the attorney general.\u201d * * * Cummings and goings \u2013 The modest reshuffle that quickly escalated into high drama has left Boris Johnson with control of the Treasury, Heather Stewart writes this morning. Sajid Javid threw the job back in the PM\u2019s face after being told that in order to remain as chancellor he must sack his advisers. Javid said he didn\u2019t believe \u201cany self-respecting minister would accept such conditions\u201d. Swiftly replaced by Rishi Sunak, Javid has become the shortest-serving chancellor in 50 years. The prime minister\u2019s new cabinet includes some intriguing choices: a leader for the Cop26 talks who has only said \u201cclimate\u201d six times in parliament; an attorney general who supported the illegal prorogation of parliament, and thinks human rights have gone too far; and an international development secretary who questions the value of foreign aid. Our editorial concludes: \u201cThis is the sixth different Tory-led government since 2010 \u2026 a government beholden to one man, Mr Johnson, and to his grey eminence, Mr Cummings.\u201d * * * China ramps up war with Covid-19 \u2013 Chinese authorities have expanded \u201cwartime\u201d measures to combat coronavirus as deaths reached nearly 1,400 and more than 5,000 new cases were reported. In Huanggang \u2013 one of the worst-hit areas outside of Wuhan \u2013 and Dawu county in central Hubei, authorities gave orders \u201cfully sealing\u201d all residential areas and banning private use of vehicles. American officials, though, have questioned whether China is being honest in its sharing of information on the outbreak. In Japan, the first Covid-19 fatality \u2013 a woman in her 80s \u2013 has been recorded and there are indications the virus might be spreading there after several other people with no recent connection to China tested positive. UK experts have warned that fake news and advice about the Covid-19 virus could cost lives. Prof Paul Hunter from East Anglia University said: \u201cWorryingly, people are more likely to share bad advice on social media than good advice from trusted sources.\u201d Find out more at our live blog. * * * Racism in medical schools \u2013 Black, Asian and minority ethnic trainee doctors are experiencing a \u201cclimate of fear\u201d at medical schools amid a failure to address widespread racism, according to the British Medical Association. Its investigation with the British Medical Journal (BMJ) found medical schools were ill-prepared to deal with racism against students. Of the 32 medical schools that responded to freedom of information requests, only half said they kept specific record of racism complaints. Gurdas Singh, co-chair of the BMA\u2019s medical students committee, said the most common racist incidents included patients refusing to be treated by BAME people, and female black medical students being mistaken for nurses. The BMA has launched a charter for medical schools that offers guidance for students on how to get support and calls for dedicated procedures to handle racism complaints. * * * Chatbot sex sting \u2013 Anti-slavery campaigners have used chatbots to disrupt sex trafficking by drawing thousands of men into online conversations and then confronting them with messages to deter them from buying sex online. Seattle Against Slavery said it led to a 50% decline in the city for online searches with keywords such as \u201cteen escort\u201d. The bots had about 19,000 conversations with 15,000 people. The campaign also involved placing more than 2m Google adverts warning people of the risks of buying sex online. * * * Play it again \u2013 A music fan has been reunited with a cassette tape she lost while on holiday 25 years ago after it was found by an artist and made into an exhibition piece. Stella Wedell was 12 when, during a Spanish holiday, she lost the tape containing songs by the likes of Pet Shop Boys, Shaggy and Bob Marley. She was astounded to spot it a quarter of a century later in a touring exhibition called Sea of Artifacts by the British artist and photographer Mandy Barker, who found it washed up on Lanzarote and had it restored and made playable. \u201cIt was an astounding chance for Stella to walk into my exhibition and recognise her tape,\u201d the artist said. Prof Richard Thompson, head of the marine litter research unit at Plymouth University, said: \u201cThe fact it has survived intact shows the durability of plastic and the threat it can pose to the marine environment.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Who killed Olof Palme? After a night at the cinema in 1986, the Swedish prime minister was assassinated on Stockholm\u2019s busiest street. The identity of his killer has never been proven. Jan Stocklassa discusses whether novelist Stieg Larsson\u2019s theory can provide any answers. And: the first same-sex couple to get married in Northern Ireland. Lunchtime read: The trouble with anti-populism With rightwing demagogues gaining power and public debate getting nastier, many are calling for a return to a more sensible politics. But does this approach have its own fatal flaws? Sport UK Athletics is in more turmoil after its chair, Chris Clark, resigned after barely seven months in charge on the day the troubled organisation announced its new chief executive. Premier League clubs, the sports minister and football fans have condemned StubHub, as data emerged that uncovers for the first time the scale of the website\u2019s grip on thousands of tickets to football matches. Pel\u00e9 has dismissed his son\u2019s claims that he is depressed and reclusive, assuring fans he is doing well and maintaining a busy schedule. McLaren\u2019s Zak Brown says Formula One would be right to once more put its participants first if it had to postpone or cancel the Vietnam Grand Prix as it did in China because of the coronavirus outbreak. In darts, Fallon Sherrock narrowly failed to create more history as she drew 6-6 with Glen Durrant at the Premier League in Nottingham.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.

      "bodyText": "A senior White House official has called on Beijing to be more transparent over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak as Chinese authorities expanded \u201cwartime\u201d measures to limit its spread. \u201cWe are a little disappointed that we haven\u2019t been invited in and we\u2019re a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, the director of the US National Economic Council. His comments came after Chinese authorities said they had altered how they count cases, resulting in confusion amid dramatic changes to the reported figures for two days in a row, and dampening hopes that the outbreak may peak later this month. On Thursday, Hubei officials reported a large spike in cases after including those confirmed by CT scans, not just lab tests. The revision added 254 deaths to the overall Chinese toll. Then on Friday, China added 121 new deaths \u2013 but also removed 108 fatalities from the total, due to what China\u2019s National Health Commission said were \u201cduplicate statistics\u201d. In its latest update, the commission reported 121 new deaths and 5,090 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of people infected to more than 64,000 worldwide, with 63,851 of the cases in China. The death toll stands at 1,383 \u2013 with three of those deaths outside of mainland China, one in Hong Kong, one in Japan and one in the Philippines. The commission did not give further explanation of the double-counted cases on Friday. \u201cBased on the current trend in confirmed cases, this appears to be a clear indication that while the Chinese authorities are doing their best to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the fairly drastic measures they have implemented to date would appear to have been too little, too late,\u201d said Adam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney. Chinese authorities also announced that 1,716 health workers had been infected as of 11 February. Six had died. Officials on Friday, responding to questions about how those cases are counted, said that when asymptomatic patients show symptoms during quarantine they would be included as confirmed. While public health experts have greeted the change in reporting \u2013 in order to capture more cases and get more patients needed treatment \u2013 positively, others say it raises more questions about the data. The change in diagnostic criteria has been applied only to Hubei province. \u201cIs the politburo really being honest with us?\u201d Kudlow asked, referring to communist China\u2019s top leadership body. Kudlow said President Xi Jinping had assured Donald Trump that Beijing would accept US help, but \u201cthey won\u2019t let us\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know what their motives are. I do know that apparently more and more people are suffering over there,\u201d he said.

The meeting, chaired by the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, called on Wuhan to speed up classifying and quarantining residents suspected or confirmed of contracting the virus. In Huanggang, one of the worst-hit areas outside of Wuhan with more than 2,000 cases and at least 59 deaths, authorities issued an emergency measures for 14 days, \u201cfully sealing\u201d all residential areas and banning vehicles, except for those for emergency, medical or official purposes. Checkpoints would be set up and public security deployed to enforce the measures. Local district committees are to organise residents\u2019 food and supplies. \u201cAll residents must not enter or leave their communities without authorisation,\u201d the notice said.

Researchers at China National Biotech, a state-owned company, said that human antibodies from survivors had helped patients who were critically ill, prompting calls for recovered patients to donate blood plasma. The next few weeks are critical for judging whether quarantine measures have worked, and as residents return to work in major cities. Officials said this year would not see a \u201cpeak\u201d in return journeys after the lunar new year holiday and that all parts of the country should \u201ccontinue protection and control measures\u201d. Containing the coronavirus in Wuhan, where the virus emerged in December, is still of \u201cutmost importance\u201d in order to achieve \u201ceconomic and societal development\u201d this year, officials said. Outside China, one person died in Japan from the virus on Thursday night. Japan\u2019s health ministry said a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture, west of Tokyo, had died.

The role of public health is to spot potential problems and to point them out.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said three unlinked cases in neighbouring Singapore \u2013 an \u201cexpert\u201d country at contact tracing \u2013 had increased concern similar transmission was happening under the radar elsewhere.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a09a661-0ee2-41ea-b0a0-9e1deefd9268\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A leading hypothesis for the lack of reported cases in Indonesia is that imported cases were missed, said Lipsitch, who pointed to a Sydney Morning Herald report that the country had no test kits until 5 February in support of the theory. </p> \n<p>\u201cIf cases have been introduced into Indonesia, then there is a good chance that more cases are circulating via transmission from those cases. If so, they may go undetected for some weeks as the individuals may not seek care or may not be suspected and tested for coronavirus, especially if there is no direct link to China.\u201d</p> \n<p>Putranto told reporters in Jakarta earlier this week: \u201cThey can be baffled but it\u2019s a fact [that there are no cases]\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A Harvard academic has defended research suggesting a possible underreporting of coronavirus cases in Indonesia, following fierce criticism from the health minister in the world\u2019s fourth most populous country, which insists it has no cases. Professor Marc Lipsitch analysed air traffic out of the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak in China and suggested in a report last week that Indonesia might have missed cases. On Tuesday the Indonesian health minister Terawan Agus Putranto called the report \u201cinsulting\u201d and said the country had proper testing equipment. On Thursday, health officials in Indonesia, which has a population of 272 million and is a popular destination for Chinese tourists, said they were retracing the movements of a Chinese tourist who was diagnosed with coronavirus upon his return from Bali. No-one in Bali has yet been found with symptoms. The World Health Organization said earlier this month it was particularly concerned about high-risk nations with weaker health systems that may lack the facilities to identify cases. Lipsitch, from the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, co-authored a paper that found several locations including Indonesia, Cambodia and Thailand where the number of cases were below the levels expected. \u201cWe stand by our research,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly do not intend it as an insult to any country or person. The role of public health is to spot potential problems and to point them out.\u201d He said three unlinked cases in neighbouring Singapore \u2013 an \u201cexpert\u201d country at contact tracing \u2013 had increased concern similar transmission was happening under the radar elsewhere. A leading hypothesis for the lack of reported cases in Indonesia is that imported cases were missed, said Lipsitch, who pointed to a Sydney Morning Herald report that the country had no test kits until 5 February in support of the theory. \u201cIf cases have been introduced into Indonesia, then there is a good chance that more cases are circulating via transmission from those cases. If so, they may go undetected for some weeks as the individuals may not seek care or may not be suspected and tested for coronavirus, especially if there is no direct link to China.\u201d Putranto told reporters in Jakarta earlier this week: \u201cThey can be baffled but it\u2019s a fact [that there are no cases]\u201d. The former military doctor was reprimanded in January by the Indonesian Medical Association Ethics Council for pushing his own controversial \u201cbrainwash\u201d treatment for stroke victims. One senior former diplomat in the country, who did not want to to be named, said he did not believe official assertions that no cases had been found. \u201cThere\u2019s a tendency to hide or gloss over serious problems in the top levels of the government,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a bit concerned.\u201d. Dr Yanri Wijayanti Subronto, a lecturer at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, said the local health offices had surveillance teams in place and that \u201cthis is a system that works\u201d. But other experts expressed concern over inadequate training of public health practitioners and over public messaging. Dr Riris Andono Ahmad, director of the Center for Tropical Medicine at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, said facilities had been set up to handle potential cases but health practitioners have not received sufficient training. \u201cWe need to be much more alert,\u201d Ahmad said. Currently, the policy in Yogyakarta is to ship all samples from potentially affected patients to testing facilities in Jakarta, he said. \u201cPublic awareness of effective prevention measures is not high,\u201d he said. \u201cFor instance, there was a lot of panic-buying of masks, but masks only work with people who are already sick.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The broadcaster\u2019s member of staff is understood to have been on holiday in China in the last month and felt unwell.

An ambulance with NHS staff in what were described as \u201chazmat\u201d suits arrived to pick him up. </p> \n<p>A Channel 4 spokesperson said: \u201cOn Thursday a member of staff who had travelled to Asia within the last month felt unwell.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs a precautionary measure they decided to seek medical advice and, in line with the latest public health advice regarding the coronavirus, they were taken to hospital for a precautionary test.

The broadcaster\u2019s member of staff is understood to have been on holiday in China in the last month and felt unwell. He is not a journalist and had not been to Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak. The man, who went to hospital on Thursday from Channel 4\u2019s office in Horseferry Road, London, has now returned home and is awaiting his test results. One source said the individual had been at work over the past 10 days before becoming ill, and there was anger that he had not been offered the opportunity to work from home. An ambulance with NHS staff in what were described as \u201chazmat\u201d suits arrived to pick him up. A Channel 4 spokesperson said: \u201cOn Thursday a member of staff who had travelled to Asia within the last month felt unwell. \u201cAs a precautionary measure they decided to seek medical advice and, in line with the latest public health advice regarding the coronavirus, they were taken to hospital for a precautionary test. We have informed our staff of this and continue to follow all the latest public health guidance.\u201d The UK\u2019s chief medical officers are advising anyone experiencing a cough, fever or shortness of breath who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the past 14 days to stay indoors and call NHS 111. More than 1,750 people have been tested for the virus in the UK, of which nine were confirmed positive.",

As they entered the last leg of their isolation at Daikoku pier in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, some passengers, whose luxury cruise ship has turned into a giant quarantine station, were attempting to take the edge off their ordeal. They posted photos of their meals, tackled sudoku puzzles and played hopscotch during brief and restricted forays on to the deck. They shared encouraging messages from weary crew members who have kept them fed and entertained throughout a quarantine that Japanese authorities insist will come to an end next Wednesday. Outside, a steel band, hula dancers and jet skiers provided a welcome contrast to health officials in hazmat suits and rows of ambulances waiting to take infected passengers to hospital. Some said they were simply bored of life in floating limbo, while others broke their silence to voice fears for their health. As Japanese health authorities revealed another 44 infections, Sonali Thakkar, a security officer on the Diamond Princess, was in isolation fearing she could be among the next batch of cases. \u201cAll we want is to be safe and to have more doctors on board,\u201d said Thakkar, who was awaiting the results of her test after developing a fever and cough. The ship security officer was present on the gangway when passengers who tested positive disembarked in Yokohama to be taken to hospital.

Once we get home, a nice pizza is high on the list!\u201d On Friday, some passengers were able to send messages to loved ones via smartphones \u2013 a gift from the Japanese government. There were also displays of affection for the Princess Diamond crew, who were greeted by cutout paper hearts stuck to the door of one woman\u2019s cabin. \u201cThank you for all your hard work,\u201d read the message on one. And on another: \u201cThank you for taking care of us.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It is the ultimate sporting get-together: 11,000 athletes from 200 countries all striving to live up to the Olympic motto \u2013 faster, higher and stronger. But as this year\u2019s Games in Tokyo approaches it is not the usual concerns \u2013 the potential for high temperatures or the logistics of putting on the world\u2019s biggest sporting event \u2013 that is the biggest problem for organisers. It is the coronavirus. On Friday, China reported 5,090 new cases and 121 new deaths in the previous 24 hours, Japan has also had its first death as the virus continues to spread. For now, however, the International Olympic Committee position is clear: there is absolutely no chance the Games, which are due to start in late July, will be postponed despite the growing global health emergency. But athletics was similarly upbeat before the World Indoor Championships, due to take place in Nanjing in March, was cancelled. And so was Formula One before the Shanghai Grand Prix was also shelved. The virus has also wiped out golf tournaments, matches, and almost all sports in China \u2013 including Olympic qualifying events. What is worrying medical experts is that with so many people packed into a small area there is a possibility for infectious diseases to spread. This month Toshiro Muto, the chief executive of the Tokyo organising committee, voiced some of those concerns by saying he was \u201cseriously worried\u201d the spread of coronavirus \u201ccould throw cold water on the momentum toward the Games\u201d. Muto later backed down and this week the organising committee\u2019s president Yoshiro Mori said he was clear that \u201cWe are not considering a cancellation or postponement of the Games\u201d. An IOC spokesperson also said all preparations for Tokyo 2020 were going ahead as planned. \u201cThe IOC is in contact with the World Health Organisation, as well as its own medical experts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have full confidence that the relevant authorities, in particular in Japan, China and the World Health Organisation, will take all the necessary measures to address the situation.\u201d Craig Spence, the spokesperson for the International Paralympic Committee, insisted the Paralympics will go ahead in late August. \u201cFear is spreading quicker than the virus, and it is important that we quell that fear,\u201d he said. It is worth noting that next month\u2019s Tokyo marathon is going ahead \u2013 although organisers have announced that runners based in China can defer until 2021 as many will have trouble travelling to Japan. They will also issue masks and hand sanitisers during race week. Meanwhile it remains unclear whether Chinese athletes due to compete in sporting events in Britain in the next month will take part. Public Health England confirmed there are currently no restrictions on Chinese players coming to the prestigious All-England Badminton Championships or the Gymnastics World Cup, both of which will be staged in Birmingham. However it is rumoured from within the sport that the Chinese badminton players will withdraw from all European tournaments this month, as well as from one in Germany the week before the All England event. The chief executive of Badminton England, Adrian Christy, said the advice the organiser has been given is to carry on preparations for the All England as planned. \u201cWe are monitoring the coronavirus very closely and are in touch with Public Health England several times a week \u2013 and they have been very helpful indeed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe advice we have been given is to carry on our preparations for the All England as planned, and we are doing that. \u201cWe are also in regular touch with our international governing body who are monitoring this from a global perspective.\u201d Birmingham will also stage a World Cup gymnastics meeting next month and a spokesperson for GB Gymnastics insisted that \u201cas it stands it\u2019s business as usual. \u201cWe continue to plan for the Chinese delegations competing in Birmingham at the end of next month,\u201d he added.",

They warn in a new report that Europe\u2019s largest member risks a \u201cstranded future\u201d, unless it can strengthen its economy and become more competitive.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the key points, kicking off on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/feb/14/german-economy-stagnates-growth-eurozone-gdp-business-live?page=with:block-5e4643448f0811db2faf780f#block-5e4643448f0811db2faf780f\">today\u2019s growth figures</a>.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Recession avoided in 2019, but no rebound on the cards for 2020</strong>. At +0.6%, about half the rate for the Eurozone as a whole, German GDP grew at the slowest pace since the region\u2019s sovereign debt crisis. We do not expect 2020 to bring much relief with GDP growth likely to slow marginally to a seasonally-adjusted +0.5%. Moreover the risk that Germany\u2019s \u201cgolden\u201d decade of uninterrupted economic growth \u2013 the longest period of expansion since reunification \u2013 will come to an end in 2020 remains on the table for now, given the cautious outlook for global trade and the automotive industry as well as lingering elevated political uncertainty over trade and Brexit.</li> <li><strong>The subdued outlook for the German economy provides a glimpse of a \u201cstranded\u201d future. </strong>Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse is struggling to keep up with structural change, putting it at risk of becoming a \u201cstranded economy\u201d with its long-standing competitive advantage in industry and in particular the car sector becoming obsolete. While the German economy remains highly innovative, it is increasingly struggling to leverage its potential, given the lack of even a basic digital infrastructure, a growing digital skills gap and inadequate start-up funding.</li> <li><strong>But a \u201clost\u201d decade for Germany is not a done deal, yet. </strong>What is needed is a significant long-term investment plan focused on upgrading infrastructure, updating the education system, boosting research &amp; development capabilities and creating a venture fund to co-invest in promising start-ups. But solely throwing money at the problem is not the solution. Instead the German economy\u2019s digital catch-up initiative needs to be accompanied by a \u201csimplification shock\u201c i.e. a notable reduction in red tape to allow for a better delivery of large-scale infrastructure projects, as well as to make life easier for corporates, particularly SMEs.</li> </ul> <p>More <a href=\"https://www.eulerhermes.com/en_global/economic-research/insights/is-germany-a-stranded-economy.html\">here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Economist_Kat/status/1228279359066210305\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/German?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#German</a> economy ended 2019 on a weak note &amp; 2020 is unlikely to provide much relief.

      "bodyText": "Finally, the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 has closed down 0.6%, or 43 points, at 7,409. Europe did better, despite today\u2019s unimpressive growth report. The Stoxx 690 has finished the day flat (rather like Germany\u2019s GDP...). Have a lovely weekend. GW The eurozone will probably struggle to grow in the current quarter, reckons Greg Daco of Oxford Economics. He predicts that the mere 0.1% growth reported in October-December will be repeated in January-March, with coronavirus restrictions hurting the economy. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s the AFP newswire\u2019s take on today\u2019s German growth figures: Hopes pale for German growth rebound after late 2019 flatline Europe\u2019s largest economy Germany marked time in the fourth quarter of 2019 as its export-oriented industry\u2019s woes continued to weigh on growth, official data showed Friday. Gross domestic product (GDP) was flat quarter-on-quarter in October-December, federal statistics authority Destatis said, disappointing the agency\u2019s own expectations and those of analysts surveyed by Factset. The statisticians also revised their third quarter growth figures, saying that GDP had added 0.2% rather than 0.1%. Over the whole year, the annual growth rate of 0.6% was Germany\u2019s worst since 2013. The economy \u201cremains in a weak phase,\u201d the economy ministry in Berlin said, highlighting \u201cvery weak\u201d industrial production and incoming orders for manufacturing firms towards the end of the year. After a surge in 2017-18, Germany\u2019s export-oriented economy has been sapped since late 2018 by trade conflicts and other sources of uncertainty, including Brexit and slower growth in emerging economies. For some analysts, that meant simply avoiding a second quarter of shrinkage in 2019 after the contraction in April-June was worth celebrating. \u201cOverall economic stagnation in the fourth quarter is already a small success\u201d given that industrial output shrank strongly, said Dr. Fritzi Koehler-Geib, chief economist at KfW banking group. Industry continues to suffer, with production shrinking sharply in December, Destatis data showed. Meanwhile, \u201cprivate and state consumer spending lost significant momentum after a strong third quarter,\u201d the statisticians added. Supported by unemployment close to historic lows and gradually rising public spending, consumption had been an important buttress to economic activity in Germany compensating for ailing industry. Looking ahead into 2020, the rebound many observers were hoping for in the first half of the year will likely be pushed back by the effects of the novel coronavirus COVID-19. \u201cThe German economy\u2019s performance in the first quarter will largely depend on how the coronavirus affects the Chinese economy, and German exports to China,\u201d Commerzbank economist Joerg Kraemer said. Goods sold to China account for around three percent of German GDP, Oddo bank analysts noted. But there are challenges to Europe\u2019s powerhouse beyond the cyclical slowdown. \u201cThe manufacturing sector remains caught between cyclical weakness, on the back of the trade conflict and weaker global growth, and structural weakness, on the back of disruption in the automotive sector and too little investment,\u201d said ING bank economist Carsten Brzeski. In the coming months, the country has little to look forward to but \u201cstagnation, with a risk of a technical recession,\u201d he added. Fancy some afternoon reading? Here\u2019s a fascinating thread from Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway about UK statistics, and how a mysterious gold transaction flattered Britain\u2019s trade data: The US stock market has opened gently, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 33 points or 0.1% at 29,456. That\u2019s despite a 0.1% drop in US factory output last month, as Boeing\u2019s 737 Max crisis hits. With stock markets at record highs, Universal Music wants to join the party with an IPO: Here\u2019s our story about Tesco illegally blocking its rivals from opening stores: Wall Street is expected to post fresh gains today, despite the uncertainty created by Covid-19. Mihir Kapadia, the CEO of Sun Global Investments, says: \u201cWith the coronavirus death total now reaching 1,000 and looking likely to go much higher, Asian shares have nevertheless followed yesterday\u2019s Wall Street rally as factories begin to re-open across China. Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.9%, with Shanghai blue chips gathering momentum by reaching 0.8%. The Japanese Nikkei market was closed due to a public holiday. In Europe, stocks are also higher the FTSE up 0.7%. Although markets are higher , investors will likely remain concerned about the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy. After 18-months of the trade dispute wreaking havoc on the markets and China, the coronavirus outbreak has been an additional source of concern, though markets are remarkably resilient for now.\u201d For days, investors have been fluctuating between panicking about the coronavirus, and persuading themselves that the crisis is abating. Today they\u2019re in a calm mood, pushing stocks in Europe up to new record highs. The Stoxx 600 index has gained 0.15% to a fresh peak, after China reported that some deaths have been \u2018double-counted\u2019. This has reassured traders, who hit the sell button yesterday after a big spike in cases. But new cases keep cropping up around the world, including a Channel 4 employee in London: Back in the UK, supermarket chain Tesco has been blasted by regulators for unlawfully blocking its rivals from opening stores. The Competition and Markets Authority has announced that Tesco has pledged to stop using covenants and exclusivity arrangements to prevent landlords letting sites to other supermarkets. A review has found 23 separate agreement of this type, which has been illegal since 2010. Andrea Gomes da Silva, Executive Director, Markets and Mergers at the CMA, says: It\u2019s unacceptable that Tesco had these unlawful restrictions in place for up to a decade. By making it harder for other supermarkets to open stores next to its branches, shoppers could have lost out. In the future, we want the ability to fine businesses if we find that they are in breach of our orders. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve called on the Government for more powers. The CMA is also asking other supermarkets to check whether they have used similar anti-competitive restrictions. Back in the debt crisis, some of Europe\u2019s smaller countries were the black sheep of the euro-flock. Today, these peripheral nations are driving growth, as France and Italy shrink and Germany stagnates. Barret Kupelian, senior economist at PwC, says the periphery are the euro area\u2019s bright spot: \u201cToday\u2019s country breakdown of Eurozone\u2019s GDP growth showed us that the bloc grew by 1.2% in 2019. This rate of expansion is comparable to that of the UK. The US economy, however, grew by 2.3% in 2019, which is around double the rate of the Eurozone and the UK\u201d The Eurozone performance can be mainly explained by the poor performance of Germany and Italy, which are its biggest and third largest economies respectively. Size matters when it comes to GDP growth rates - a one percentage point increase in the growth rate of Germany and Italy increases Eurozone GDP by 0.5 percentage points.\u201d \u201cHowever, the bright spot in the Eurozone continues to lie in the peripheral economies. With the exception of Greece, all of the bailout economies have surpassed pre-crisis output levels and continue to grow at strong rates. In fact, we estimate that the three bailout economies (Spain, Portugal and Cyprus) which reported Q4 2019 output estimates today, grew by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter compared to virtually no growth in the German, French, Italian and Dutch economies in GDP weighted terms (see Figure below).\u201d Germany\u2019s economy is unlikely to improve much this year, due to trade tensions, the shift away from petrol and diesel cars, and Brexit. So argues Ludovic Subran and Katharina Uterm\u00f6hl, top economists at German insurance giant Allianz. They warn in a new report that Europe\u2019s largest member risks a \u201cstranded future\u201d, unless it can strengthen its economy and become more competitive. Here\u2019s the key points, kicking off on today\u2019s growth figures. Recession avoided in 2019, but no rebound on the cards for 2020. At +0.6%, about half the rate for the Eurozone as a whole, German GDP grew at the slowest pace since the region\u2019s sovereign debt crisis. We do not expect 2020 to bring much relief with GDP growth likely to slow marginally to a seasonally-adjusted +0.5%. Moreover the risk that Germany\u2019s \u201cgolden\u201d decade of uninterrupted economic growth \u2013 the longest period of expansion since reunification \u2013 will come to an end in 2020 remains on the table for now, given the cautious outlook for global trade and the automotive industry as well as lingering elevated political uncertainty over trade and Brexit. The subdued outlook for the German economy provides a glimpse of a \u201cstranded\u201d future. Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse is struggling to keep up with structural change, putting it at risk of becoming a \u201cstranded economy\u201d with its long-standing competitive advantage in industry and in particular the car sector becoming obsolete. While the German economy remains highly innovative, it is increasingly struggling to leverage its potential, given the lack of even a basic digital infrastructure, a growing digital skills gap and inadequate start-up funding. But a \u201clost\u201d decade for Germany is not a done deal, yet. What is needed is a significant long-term investment plan focused on upgrading infrastructure, updating the education system, boosting research &amp; development capabilities and creating a venture fund to co-invest in promising start-ups. But solely throwing money at the problem is not the solution. Instead the German economy\u2019s digital catch-up initiative needs to be accompanied by a \u201csimplification shock\u201c i.e. a notable reduction in red tape to allow for a better delivery of large-scale infrastructure projects, as well as to make life easier for corporates, particularly SMEs. More here. Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics has told clients: \u201cWe think the economy will continue to flirt with recession in the first half of this year.\u201d It\u2019s hard to put too much gloss on a stagnating economy, but the German government has tried to strike an optimistic-ish tone this morning. Berlin\u2019s economy ministry says Germany\u2019s economy is going through a weak phase, but it\u2019s encouraged that business sentiment has improved. But... the ministry also warns that the coronavirus outbreak means that the risks from overseas have increased, but it\u2019s hard to say what the impact will be. More encouragingly, employment growth across the eurozone has risen. The number of employed people rose by 0.3% in the euro area in the final quarter of 2019, and by 0.2% in the European Union. That\u2019s up from 0.1% in Q3. This jobs creation has pulled the unemployment rate down to its lowest level since the financial crisis, which is clearly welcome -- but it\u2019s disappointing that it\u2019s not leading to faster growth. At just 0.1%, the eurozone and the EU has both posted their weakest growth since early 2013 (when the debt crisis drove Europe into recession). Although countries in the periphery grew quite strongly in the last quarter of 2019, weakness at Europe\u2019s largest economies was to blame. Here\u2019s what we know (not all countries have reported GDP yet): Romania: +1.5% quarter-on-quarter in October-December Lithuania: +1.3% Hungary: +1.0% Cyprus: +0.8% Bulgaria: +0.7% Portugal: +0.6% Slovakia: +0.6% Spain: +0.5% Belgium: + 0.4% Netherlands: +0.4% Austria: +0.3% Denmark: +0.3% Czechia: +0.2% Latvia: +0.2% Poland: +0.2% Germany: no growth France: -0.1% Italy: -0.3% Finland: -0.4% And here\u2019s how some non-EU members performed China: +1.5% growth quarter-on-quarter US: + 0.5% UK: no growth Just in: The eurozone nearly stalled in the final quarter of 2019, dragged down by weakness in its three largest economies. Statistics body Eurostat reports that the euro area and the wider European Union only grew by 0.1% in October-December. That\u2019s down from 0.3% growth across Europe in July-September Germany stagnated (as we learned at 7am), while France and Italy contracted during the quarter. On an annual basis, the eurozone only grew by 1.2% in 2019 while the EU expanded by 1.4%. This matches Eurostat\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 GDP estimates from a couple of weeks ago, and confirms that Europe ended 2019 on a weak note. Paul Sommerville of Sommerville Advisory Markets points out that Germany\u2019s economy has been basically flat for nine months: European stock markets are subdued today, following Germany\u2019s underwhelming growth figures. The Stoxx 600 index is flat, having dropped yesterday as traders fretted about a sharp leap in coronavirus cases. In London, the FTSE 100 is being pulled down by RBS (-6%); its weak outlook has also pushed Lloyds and Barclays down almost 1%. Over in the City, shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have slumped 6% as new chief executive Alison Rose outlines her strategy alongside its latest financial results RBS is being rebranded as NatWest, with Rose perhaps hoping to put the legacy of the bank\u2019s bailout firmly into history. She is also slashing the size of its investment bank and cutting its long-term profitability targets. But arguably the most important news is that RBS has laid out its climate emergency strategy. It plans to\u201dat least halve\u201d the climate impact of our financing activity by 2030, and will phase out all support for the coal industry by the end of the decade. It will also stop lending to energy firms from next year if they don\u2019t have a plan to help achieve the Paris Agreement goals. Rose concedes this will be tough: This will be a significant challenge as we, like others, do not yet fully understand what this will require and how it will be achieved, not least as there is currently no standard industry methodology or approach. Solving this will require UK and international industry, regulators and experts to come together and find solutions. We are determined to not just play our part, but to lead on the collaboration and co-operation that is so critical to influencing the transition to a low carbon economy. RBS also posted a 93% jump in profits for 2019. Investors, though, are disappointed that RBS didn\u2019t announce a larger special dividend today. They may also be concerned that the bank says it faces a \u201crange of significant risks and uncertainties\u201d from political, economic and regulatory angles. The euro has dropped to its lowest level in over two and a half years, after this morning\u2019s German GDP figures. The single currency has dipped to \u20ac1.0828, its weakest levels since May 2017, extending its recent losses. The risk of a full-blown recession is hanging over Germany, says economist Carsten Brzeski of ING. He fears that the Covid-19 outbreak will hurt Germany, although a pick-up in construction could cushion the blow. Having analysed today\u2019s GDP report, Brzeski writes: Looking ahead, the latest soft indicators and industrial data for December do not bode well for the short-term outlook. Also, the impact from the coronavirus on the Chinese economy is likely to delay any rebound in the manufacturing sector as it at least temporarily disrupts supply chains. However, despite these rather discouraging factors, there are several \u2013 partly technical \u2013 drivers which should soften any pessimism. The poor performance of the construction sector in the fourth quarter was mainly driven by the Christmas break. With mild winter weather, a rebound in the first quarter looks likely. Also, changes in the inventory cycle could support growth in the short run. Brzeski reckons that hopes of a strong rebound this year have been wiped out: Some weeks ago, we had started to investigate which form the recovery could take from the alphabet soup of options. Will it be a \u2018V\u2019 for a strong rebound, a \u2018U\u2019 for a longer bottom followed by a strong rebound, a \u2018J\u2019 for a longer period of stagnation followed by a weak rebound, an \u2018L\u2019 for a long period of stagnation or even a \u2018W\u2019 for a double dip recession? Today\u2019s data shows that the alphabet soup has been taken off the menu for the time being. Stagnation, with a risk of a technical recession, currently looks like the only dish served. Stagnation is bad, but there\u2019s some relief that Germany didn\u2019t do even worse. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics feared German GDP could actually have contracted in the last quarter, given recent weak data: Bloomberg\u2019s Fergal O\u2019Brien agrees: But currency analyst Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fongern is concerned about Germany\u2019s prospects this year, given the coronavirus outbreak will hurt its manufacturing base. 2019 was not a great year for Germany. Today\u2019s GDP report shows that the economy grew by 0.5% in January-March, only to shrink by 0.2% in April-June. Growth picked up by 0.2% in July-September, before fizzling out in the last quarter. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. Newsflash: Germany\u2019s economy is flatlining, as a slowdown in spending and exports wipes out growth. Figures just released show that German GDP was unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2019. Economists had expected a rise of 0.1%, so this is disappointing (and matches the UK\u2019s own performance in Q4). On an annual basis, the German economy only grew by 0.6% during 2019, Destatis adds. That\u2019s a very weak result, as Europe\u2019s largest economy struggles to handle trade tensions, changes in the auto industry, and a slowing European economy. It\u2019s not all gloom -- growth in the third quarter has been revised up to 0.2%. But the general picture is weak: Destatis, Germany\u2019s statistics body, reports that household and government spending both slowed in the last quarter, while investment from companies was mixed. After a very strong third quarter, the final consumption expenditure of both households and government slowed down markedly. Trends diverged for fixed capital formation. While gross fixed capital formation in machinery and equipment was down considerably compared to the third quarter, fixed capital formation in construction and other fixed assets continued to increase. Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars also hurt Germany. Destatis reports that German exports were \u201cslightly down\u201d in the last quarter, while imports of goods and services increased. Later today we\u2019ll get an updated reading on eurozone GDP for the last quarter. Preliminary figures release last month showed that the region only grew by 0.1%, with France and Italy shrinking.

But she did make the argument twice. In her speech she said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In this leadership election, our party needs to exercise the greatest care in who we choose to lead us. Because the British establishment wants to put us into a box. A box that separates us from the people our party was built to represent. Well I will not be put in that box and won\u2019t allow our party to be either. </p> \n   <p>Yes, we have to be credible to regain trust with voters but I\u2019m not interested in the definition of credibility used by the media and chattering classes. The only credibility I\u2019m interested in winning is that of the people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And in her Q&amp;A, Long-Bailey said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have got a government that wants to put us into a box. They want us to be viewed as the establishment. They are laying a trap for us. They would love nothing more than for us to go down the route of shiny suit wearing, not rocking the boat too much, not setting out a transformative vision, and trying to scale back our ambitions, so that they can turn round to our communities and say: \u2018They\u2019re part of the establishment.\u2019</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It is obvious why Long-Bailey is making this argument when she appears to be trailing badly behind Starmer in the contest and looking \u201cestablishment\u201d could be seen as one of his weak points. But having an establishment, \u201cshiny suit\u201d image has never stopped Conservative leaders winning general elections, so the premise of her argument is questionable. And Long-Bailey may be wrong to claim that being credible with the chattering classes is not the same as being credible with the public. She seemed to accept that Starmer has credibility with the former, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/06/boris-johnson-labour-scottish-politics-derek-mackay-have-behaved-foolishly-and-am-truly-sorry-scottish-finance-ministers-resignation-statement-live-news?page=with:block-5e3c2e4b8f086a28115a6d2a#block-5e3c2e4b8f086a28115a6d2a\">the polls suggest he has more credibility with the latter too</a>.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She criticised colleagues in the party who had said they would vote remain in any second referendum on Brexit instead of backing a deal negotiated by Labour.</strong> In the Q&amp;A, talking about the problems with Labour\u2019s Brexit policy at the election, she said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It was also confusing and ambiguous, the final stage of our policy position, because we talked about a people\u2019s vote as a way to resolve the conversations that were happening in our communities; we were going to give people a vote on the final deal. But then when we were asked if we were going to campaign for our own deal, our answer was: [at this point Long-Bailey put on a posher accent] \u201cI don\u2019t know, we will have to see what it looks like, might campaign for remain.\u201d And that was really bad, and it confused a lot of people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The official party policy, agreed at conference last autumn, was to reserve any decision about how to campaign in a second referendum until after a Labour government had renegotiated the withdrawal agreement. Jeremy Corbyn himself would not say how he would campaign, and eventually resolved this conundrum by saying he would be neutral. But Long-Bailey\u2019s comment seemed aimed at colleagues such as Starmer and Emily Thornberry who were explicit about wanting to back remain.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She described herself as someone who was good at both details and big vision. </strong>And she said that, as a working-class woman, she was used to having to prove she was much better than middle-class men. In her speech she said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To deliver our path to power, we need both details and big vision. I do both.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019m a details person. I work hard. I don\u2019t slack off. I suppose that\u2019s the benefit of being a working-class woman, always having to work twice as hard to show you\u2019re just as good, in fact better, than an upper-middle-class man.

I\u2019ll ridicule the most absurd smears and lies. We won\u2019t just rebut factual errors in stories, but provide a counter-narrative about deliberate media efforts to hold back aspirational socialism.</p> \n   <p>But a credible and effective communications strategy extends beyond just being more combative and self-confident.

affecting historic investigations</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Arlene Foster</strong>, the first minister of Northern Ireland and DUP leader, told the Today programme this morning that Brandon Lewis, the new Northern Ireland secretary, should \u201crevisit\u201d the scope of the historical investigation unit that was proposed in the power-sharing deal negotiated by his sacked predecessor.</p> \n  <p>Under <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/856998/2020-01-08_a_new_decade__a_new_approach.pdf\">the \u201cNew Decade, New Approach\u201d deal (pdf)</a> between the parties and the UK government that led to the restoration of the power-sharing executive, the UK promised to \u201cwithin 100 days, publish and introduce legislation in the UK parliament to implement the Stormont House agreement to address Northern Ireland legacy issues\u201d. </p> \n  <p>The<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/390672/Stormont_House_Agreement.pdf\"> Stormont House agreement (pdf),</a> which was agreed in 2014 but never implemented in full, promised:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Legislation will establish a new independent body to take forward investigations into outstanding Troubles-related deaths; the Historical Investigations Unit (HIU). The body will take forward outstanding cases from the HET process, and the legacy work of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland (PONI). A report will be produced in each case.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Unionists fear this will lead to former soldiers and police officers facing fresh investigation over matters for which they thought they had been cleared.</p> \n  <p>Foster told Today:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[What was] originally mooted in the Stormont agreement does need to be revisited because a lot of matters have changed since then, not least the fact that the chief constable put all of the so-called state killings into the historical investigation unit, so there are great difficulties in that - not least that 90% of those who lost their lives in Northern Ireland were killed by paramilitaries, terrorists if you will.</p> \n   <p>There is a need for balance in everything we do here in Northern Ireland.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if she would be asking Lewis to review the terms of the \u201cNew Decade, New Approach\u201d deal, Foster said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I had already written to the secretary of state Julian Smith a number of weeks ago saying to him it is very important that the victims take the lead in all of these issues and that there is a co-design of any legislation so they are at the heart of dealing with the matters of the past.</p> \n   <p>It is very important that the victims are at the fore. I hope Brandon Lewis will listen to the voices of the victims. That is something I will certainly be saying to him.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f518714beb873c5b108513f01b3f7cefd4f77a36\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f518714beb873c5b108513f01b3f7cefd4f77a36/0_162_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lorraine O\u2019Sullivan/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e466be38f0811db2faf78ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-14T09:45:37.660Z\">9.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Walking into Downing Street, <strong>Mark Spencer</strong>, the chief whip, was asked by reporters if Sajid Javid had been forced out of the cabinet.

Boris Johnson will chair a meeting of his new cabinet this morning and, while it is expected to discuss<a href=\"https://politicshome.com/news/uk/home-affairs/immigration/news/109910/new-points-based-immigration-system-could-cut-low\"> the government\u2019s plans for a new post-Brexit immigration system</a>, many of the attendees - like the rest of Westminster - will probably spend just as much time mulling over the implications of the events that led up to yesterday\u2019s shock resignation of Sajid Javid as chancellor. The papers this morning are full of analysis - here is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/sajid-javids-exit-leaves-boris-johnson-in-control-of-treasury\">a take from my colleague <strong>Heather Stewart</strong></a>; I will post links to some others later - but, roughly speaking, the move raises four big questions about the future of British politics.</p> \n  <p><strong>1) Does this mean Boris Johnson will now abandon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/sajid-javid-rips-up-tory-fiscal-rules-vow-spend-extra-20bn\">the fiscal rules announced during the election</a>, allowing him to borrow even more than planned for spending on infrastructure and public services?</strong> Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, is thought to be angling for this, and yesterday No 10 was vague about whether the government was still committed to those fiscal rules (which were already seen as a loosening from the Philip Hammond era). The rules were drafted when the Tories were expecting to win a small majority, and the scale of Johnson\u2019s victory in December means the pressure to deliver for new Tory voters in the north is much stronger than it was.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) Does this mean Johnson is emasculating the Treasury? </strong>That certainly seems to be the intention, and yesterday one commentator said the plan to effectively merge No 10 and the Treasury into a more cohesive unit amounted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/13/politics-live-cabinet-reshuffle-set-to-get-underway-live-news?page=with:block-5e454f778f08e133247429da#block-5e454f778f08e133247429da\">the \u201cmost significant development since the creation of the devolved parliaments in 1999\u201d.</a> But most prime ministers try at one point to curtail the powers of No 11, and most of them fail. The Treasury may prove to be more institutionally resilient than Cummings imagines, and even if the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is more firmly under No 10\u2019s line management, he stills heads a department stuffed with hundreds of clever officials who are professionally trained to tell politicians truths they don\u2019t want to hear.</p> \n  <p><strong>3) Does this mean Johnson is getting more like Donald Trump? </strong>In some respects, because the reshuffle had all the hallmarks of a powergrab, and the appointment of Suella Braverman as attorney general has gone down badly with defenders of the judiciary. But even though Johnson\u2019s preferred model for leadership is probably Emperor Augustus, cabinet government still very much applies.</p> \n  <p><strong>4) Ultimately will this reshuffle leave Johnson politically stronger or politically weaker? </strong>At this point it is impossible to tell. Some Tory MPs must be unhappy about the way Javid has been treated, but if they are, they have not yet been saying so in public. Johnson is so powerful at the moment that he can more or less do whatever he wants, but that won\u2019t last forever and in the end the reshuffle will be judged by whether or not it delivers for the Conservative party.</p> \n  <p>Here is our overnight story about the reshuffle.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/javid-resigned-after-johnson-pushed-him-to-sack-advisers\">Javid resigned after Johnson pushed him to sack advisers</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>And here is a graphic from last night about the reshuffle. It features the 10 ministers who were allowed to attend cabinet before the reshuffle. No 10 has now drastically slimmed down those numbers and, in addition to the full cabinet, there will be only four extra attendees: Stephen Barclay, chief secretary to the Treasury; Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the Commons; Mark Spencer, the chief whip; and Suella Braverman, the attorney general.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/ups_and_downs-zip/giv-3902w5QlEGEEYcJP/\" data-alt=\"Cabinet changes\"> \n   <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/ups_and_downs-zip/giv-3902w5QlEGEEYcJP/\">Cabinet changes</a> \n   <figcaption>\n    Cabinet changes\n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>10am:</em> Boris Johnson chairs a meeting of the new cabinet.</p> \n  <p><em>10am: </em>Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Labour leadership candidate, give a speech in Salford.</p> \n  <p><em>1pm: </em>Downing Street lobby briefing.</p> \n  <p>Also, today is the final day for candidates for the Labour leadership and deputy leadership to get the CLP or affiliate nominations that they need to make it onto the final ballot.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s overhauled cabinet has agreed that a new points-based immigration system will be implemented from 1 January next year, believing that it will reduce the number of people coming to the UK, Downing Street has announced. Downing Street is still refusing to say whether or not the budget will go ahead on 11 March as scheduled. (See 2.04pm.) The attempt by Boris Johnson to emasculate the Treasury and seize control of economic policy is doomed to failure, people close to the former prime minister Gordon Brown have said. Rebecca Long-Bailey has set out her four-point plan to rebuild the Labour party and said she was behind at the start of the leadership race as her focus had been on winning the general election. In a major speech in Salford, she also took a veiled swipe at her main rival, Sir Keir Starmer, saying Labour should not let the Tories present them as an establishment, \u201cshiny suit-wearing\u201d party. (See 1.13pm.) Bomb disposal experts have warned it would be too dangerous to build a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland if it was to involve spanning the vast offshore munitions dump that lies on the most direct route over the Irish Sea. Two Labour MPs, Lilian Greenwood and Alex Sobel, have said they are cancelling their public engagements after attending a bus summit at Westminster also attended by someone who has since tested positive for coronavirus. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. I\u2019m away next week during the half-term recess, but will be back on Monday week. A colleague may be writing the blog next week, but that will depend on how busy the politics news diary gets. Here is Newsnight\u2019s Lewis Goodall on the moment when Boris Johnson treated his new cabinet like children, expecting them to chant back Tory election messages at him. (See 10.33am.) It\u2019s a Johnson party piece. He did the same thing at the first cabinet meeting after the general election. And he has tried the same trick with Tory MPs in the Commons. And here is David Gauke, the former Tory cabinet minister who lost his seat after having the party whip withdrawn over a Brexit rebellion, on the same moment. Downing Street has just announced two more appointments. Lord Callanan, who was a Brexit minister until the department was wound up at the end of January, has been made a business minister. Gillian Keegan has been made an education minister. She was a backbencher. From Sky\u2019s Joe Pike The Institute for Government has been looking at how much cabinet experience Boris Johnson\u2019s new team has. Quite a lot, it says. \u201cOnly three full members \u2013 Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Amanda Milling and George Eustice \u2013 and Suella Braverman, the new attorney general who attends cabinet - have not been around the table before,\u201d Gavin Freeguard writes at the IfG blog. The government reshuffle seems to be running out of steam. No 10 has just issued a press release of 25 appointments, which all involve ministers staying in the same posts. Earlier today Downing Street announced seven junior-level promotions, of which more than half involved women. Amanda Sollaway has been made a business minister. She was a backbencher. Victoria Prentis has been made an environment minister. She was a backbencher. Rachel Maclean has been made a transport minister. She was parliamentary private secretary to Sajid Javid. Nigel Huddleston has been made a culture minister. He was a government whip, and will continue with that role alongside his ministerial job. Theodore Agnew was made joint minister of state at the Cabinet Office and in the Treasury. He had been a junior education minister. Nicholas True has joined the government as a minister of state in the Cabinet Office. Elizabeth Berridge has been made an education minister. She was a government whip in the Lords, and will continue in that role alongside her education post. The full list of appointments is here, on the No 10 website. These are from my colleague Heather Stewart, who has been at the Downing Street lobby briefing. Three Labour leadership candidates, Sir Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy, are guaranteed a place on the final ballot, and all five deputy leadership candidates \u2013 Angela Rayner, Dawn Butler, Richard Burgon, Ian Murray and Rosena Alin-Khan \u2013 have also got the CLP or affiliate nominations they need. Emily Thornberry, a candidate for the leadership, is the only person still looking for CLP nominations. As of last night she had 30. She needs three more by the deadline at midnight tonight. Around 18 CLPs are supposed to be nominating today. In an article for PoliticsHome, Thornberry has floated a new policy idea. She says the government is going to have problems in the decades ahead meeting its unfunded public sector pension liabilities, and she proposes a solution: letting people with only limited contributions (two years\u2019 worth initially) take out 75% of their money now, but forgoing their pension when they retire. She says this would free up money for people who need it now, as well as reducing the long-term pension liabilities. And it would be good for the public finances, she claims. This scheme obviously comes at a short-term cost, which would have to be funded through borrowing, but there are two points. First, there is no better time to borrow given the historic lows in interest rates. And second, even if it mean an increase in short-term borrowing, the credit agencies, investment firms and others will all see that it puts Britain on a much sounder footing in terms of our long-term fiscal health. We would therefore have a practical measure that starts to tackle a major long-term threat to the public finances, but at the same time puts money into the pockets of millions of working people on low to medium incomes, at a time when the economy is slowing down. The Jewish Labour Movement has also announced its stance on the Labour leadership. It is nominating Lisa Nandy for leader, and Ian Murray for deputy leader. Here are the results of its ballot. And, while we\u2019re on about Boris Johnson\u2019s proposed bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland, my colleague Dan Sabbagh has spoken to bomb disposal experts who say the plan is flawed because the bridge would span a vast offshore munitions dump. The leftwing TSSA transport union has announced that it is nominating Sir Keir Starmer for the Labour leadership, and Angela Rayner for the deputy leadership. Manuel Cortes, the TSSA general secretary, described them as \u201cfantastic candidates, both of whom have made commitments to public ownership of our railways\u201d. Starmer has posted this on Twitter in response. Ministers from the Scottish government and the Northern Ireland executive have criticised the plan floated by No 10 earlier this week for a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland, the Press Association reports. The Scottish transport secretary, Michael Matheson, has said: I strongly believe that if \u00a320bn is available for investment in infrastructure in Scotland and Northern Ireland that, rather than indulging the prime minister with this vanity project, such funding should be made available to our respective governments so it could be better spent on meeting the priorities of the people we represent. And the Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, has said: I am extremely concerned that pursuit of this project, costing \u00a320bn, will be a waste of significant money and resource that could be put to better use by addressing pressures and deliverable projects here in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. By spending just a fraction of the reported cost of this bridge, I am of the view that we could bring significantly more benefits to people across the north by investing in infrastructure here and making a real difference to improving the lives of citizens across Northern Ireland. Here are the main points from Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s \u201cLabour\u2019s path to power\u201d speech in Salford this morning. It was well-written and well-delivered, and John Rentoul has posted a link to the full text. Much of what Long-Bailey said repeated points she has already made in the campaign, but here are the new or newish lines that stuck out. Long-Bailey said Labour should not let the Tories present them as an establishment, \u201cshiny suit wearing\u201d party. This seemed a clear jibe at Sir Keir Starmer, the favourite in the leadership contest, although Long-Bailey did not make this explicit. But she did make the argument twice. In her speech she said: In this leadership election, our party needs to exercise the greatest care in who we choose to lead us. Because the British establishment wants to put us into a box. A box that separates us from the people our party was built to represent. Well I will not be put in that box and won\u2019t allow our party to be either. Yes, we have to be credible to regain trust with voters but I\u2019m not interested in the definition of credibility used by the media and chattering classes. The only credibility I\u2019m interested in winning is that of the people. And in her Q&amp;A, Long-Bailey said: We have got a government that wants to put us into a box. They want us to be viewed as the establishment. They are laying a trap for us. They would love nothing more than for us to go down the route of shiny suit wearing, not rocking the boat too much, not setting out a transformative vision, and trying to scale back our ambitions, so that they can turn round to our communities and say: \u2018They\u2019re part of the establishment.\u2019 It is obvious why Long-Bailey is making this argument when she appears to be trailing badly behind Starmer in the contest and looking \u201cestablishment\u201d could be seen as one of his weak points. But having an establishment, \u201cshiny suit\u201d image has never stopped Conservative leaders winning general elections, so the premise of her argument is questionable. And Long-Bailey may be wrong to claim that being credible with the chattering classes is not the same as being credible with the public. She seemed to accept that Starmer has credibility with the former, but the polls suggest he has more credibility with the latter too. She criticised colleagues in the party who had said they would vote remain in any second referendum on Brexit instead of backing a deal negotiated by Labour. In the Q&amp;A, talking about the problems with Labour\u2019s Brexit policy at the election, she said: It was also confusing and ambiguous, the final stage of our policy position, because we talked about a people\u2019s vote as a way to resolve the conversations that were happening in our communities; we were going to give people a vote on the final deal. But then when we were asked if we were going to campaign for our own deal, our answer was: [at this point Long-Bailey put on a posher accent] \u201cI don\u2019t know, we will have to see what it looks like, might campaign for remain.\u201d And that was really bad, and it confused a lot of people. The official party policy, agreed at conference last autumn, was to reserve any decision about how to campaign in a second referendum until after a Labour government had renegotiated the withdrawal agreement. Jeremy Corbyn himself would not say how he would campaign, and eventually resolved this conundrum by saying he would be neutral. But Long-Bailey\u2019s comment seemed aimed at colleagues such as Starmer and Emily Thornberry who were explicit about wanting to back remain. She described herself as someone who was good at both details and big vision. And she said that, as a working-class woman, she was used to having to prove she was much better than middle-class men. In her speech she said: To deliver our path to power, we need both details and big vision. I do both. I\u2019m a details person. I work hard. I don\u2019t slack off. I suppose that\u2019s the benefit of being a working-class woman, always having to work twice as hard to show you\u2019re just as good, in fact better, than an upper-middle-class man. So yes, I do think it\u2019s time our party had a woman leader. She said she felt sad that the party had not focused more on its plans for a green industrial revolution during the election campaign. (See 11.04am.) And she gave an example of how she thought it could have helped the party win in Falmouth. (See 11.05am.) She said Labour should be more robust in tackling negative coverage in the media. In her speech she said: My leadership will be far more robust with the media ... I\u2019ll not only call that out, I have a plan to deal with it. I\u2019ll ridicule the most absurd smears and lies. We won\u2019t just rebut factual errors in stories, but provide a counter-narrative about deliberate media efforts to hold back aspirational socialism. But a credible and effective communications strategy extends beyond just being more combative and self-confident. It must also be more creative. So I\u2019ll set up a dedicated creative digital communications unit in the party, producing viral content that can both get around media hostility and speak directly to voters. This implies that Labour hasn\u2019t tried this before. It has, repeatedly, including employing people to focus on digital media, although admittedly there is always room for improvement. She said Labour should support a mass trade union membership drive and back workers in every dispute and strike against exploitative bosses. She said: We aren\u2019t just a different team of politicians in Westminster, alternating power with the Tories. Our party was born out of a movement in communities like mine and many of those we lost in the election. To win again, we need to look and sound like it. And it\u2019s our members and our trade unions, on the frontline in workplaces and communities, who will make that a reality. That\u2019s why under my leadership, Labour will back workers in every dispute and strike against unfair and exploitative employers. And we\u2019ll launch a mass trade union membership drive, supporting hundreds of thousands of young activists who have been inspired by our party to become active trade unionists in their workplaces. She implied that she does not see a case for keeping on Diane Abbott, John McDonnell or Corbyn in any frontline roles in Labour. She said: I\u2019ve learned so much from Jeremy, John and Diane. They helped our party and our movement rediscover its heart and soul. We owe them so much and I thank them for their huge efforts. History will be much kinder to them than today\u2019s media consensus and we mustn\u2019t retreat from that politics. But they have done their bit and it is time for a new generation to take us forward. She quoted Tony Blair approvingly. She said: In his introduction to the 1997 manifesto, Tony Blair wrote that our party was the \u201cpolitical arm of the British people\u201d. That is what we must become. I believe I can chart the course to get us there. Last night Jake Berry announced that he was leaving the government. He had been the Northern Powerhouse minister, but Boris Johnson wanted him to move to the Foreign Office and Berry refused because he said the foreign travel meant he would not see enough of his three young children. Berry\u2019s portfolio has been handed to Simon Clarke, who has moved from the Treasury to be a minister in the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government, although it is not clear whether or not Clarke will call himself the Northern Powerhouse minister. He says he\u2019s in charge of levelling up. Berry was one of the 10 ministers who used to attend cabinet without being a full member. Clarke won\u2019t do that, which could be seen as a downgrade, although the PM has taken a deliberate decision to reduce the number of of cabinet non-member attendees from 10 to four, because it was felt that their numbers were getting out of hand. Rather than going to the pub (see 11.51am), Julian Smith, the former Northern Ireland secretary, has been visiting a school in his Skipton and Ripon constituency. It turned out the pupils hadn\u2019t been keeping up with the news. Julian Smith, who was sacked as Northern Ireland secretary yesterday, was doorstepped by Sky News this morning. Asked about his future plans, he replied: I think my future plans involve things like going to the pub and I\u2019m now going to my constituency. I wish the new cabinet and new secretary of state all the best of luck. Jackson Carlaw has been elected the new leader of the Scottish Conservatives. Carlaw, who had been filling the role on an interim basis since Ruth Davidson stepped down last August, comfortably defeated his rival, Michelle Ballantyne, the party\u2019s social security spokesperson at Holyrood by 4,917 votes to 1,581. Carlaw promised to offer voters a \u201cclear, focused, ambitious alternative to the SNP\u201d, which will include a refreshed approach to the union that would be \u201cpositive and forward-looking, not lazy and historical\u201d. Insisting that he would be \u201can ambassador for Scotland to the UK government\u201d, Carlaw said he would have no problem speaking up against Boris Johnson where necessary. During his leadership campaign, Carlaw, who has served as an MSP since 2007, signalled that he wants to put forward a more populist policy agenda, to dovetail with Johnson\u2019s plans for the UK party, and win over blue-collar voters disillusioned with the SNP and Labour. Q: If the UK goes into recession, how would that affect your plans? Long-Bailey says the economy is vulnerable because the economic model is broken. She refers to the film The Big Short. That shows how people have not learned lessons from the financial crash, she says. She says government should invest more in the UK. It is too unequal, she says. She says the green industrial revolution would spread power. She says people think of collective ownership as an obsession. But it is not, she says. It is about spreading power. Q: What would you replace the House of Lords with? Long-Bailey says she does not support the Lords, because it is the only unelected chamber in Europe. There are some great Labour peers, she says. But a second chamber should be democratically accountable, she says. It should be replaced with an elected senate outside of London. That would be one step towards restoring faith in politics, she says. And that\u2019s it. I will post a summary shortly. Q: How much would your policy on freedom of movement affect the wages of workers? Long-Bailey says the UK will be out of the single market. She says she wants an immigration system based on values, not on targets. She says she is worried EU nationals could be facing deportations. And she says Labour has a moral duty to oppose the far right, and to make the positive case for immigration. She says she is a child of immigrants. She is proud of that, she says. She says the impact of immigration on wages is \u201cnegligible\u201d. But she says communities are right to be angry about how services are not working for them. That\u2019s not an immigration problem, she says. She says that is because the Conservative government has starved public services of resources. Q: Do you think it was a mistake backing the election to take place? And what would you do to stop a no-deal Brexit at the end of this year? Long-Bailey says she would rather not have had the election. But the party was not in a good place. Many people in Labour communities saw the party as one trying to overturn the referendum. And remain supporters did not like the party\u2019s stance either, she says. She says it did not help that people in the party were saying different things. And she says it was \u201creally bad\u201d that Labour could not even say it would campaign for its own Brexit deal. She says Labour needs to scrutinise the government, and make sure it does not water down standards. And she says businesses will need support. They have been preparing for the worst, she says. But smaller businesses do not have the resources to prepare, especially firms in the supply chain. Labour should be demanding the government support these firms, she says. Rebecca Long-Bailey is now taking questions. Q: This room isn\u2019t full. Are you worried that your campaign is not going as well as you hoped? Long-Bailey does not accept this. She says she has got some of her finest supporters in the room this morning. It is a long campaign, she says. And she did not have a campaign ready to go. She was concentrating on trying to win the election. She says she thought members would go through a grieving process. But she is standing to tell people that their ambitions are not wrong. Q: Do you only see a path to power outside parliament? She says Labour will only get into power if it has a strong membership. She wants to have a million members. And she thinks the party needs a more robust media strategy. The government wants Labour to be seen as the establishment, she says. It would like Labour to go down the route of \u201cshiny suit wearing\u201d, so they can tell Labour voters the party is unrepresentative. Long-Bailey says Tories want to portray Labour as an establishment, \u201cshiny suit wearing\u201d party. She says parliament has to have a role in giving power away. She wants the nations and regions to be given far more power. She says they also need to define what the role of the government is. She supports a written constitution, so that every decision a government makes should be based on how much it improves people\u2019s lives. UPDATE: This picture helps to explain the question about the room not being full. Long-Bailey is now winding up. When we win the next general election, I want you to be able to say that you stared defeat in the face last time. You felt the pain. But you picked yourself up and were part of a new path to power than runs through social justice, delivering a new, green economy, uniting our people, and empowering them to realise their hopes, dreams and aspirations. Because not only can we do that, it\u2019s the best way to win. So, let\u2019s empower our movement to show that big change is possible through a democratic revolution that delivers aspirational socialism and a green industrial revolution. That\u2019s our path to power. Let\u2019s take it together. Long-Bailey says she can do details and big vision. To deliver our path to power, we need both details and big vision. I do both. I\u2019m a details person. I work hard. I don\u2019t slack off. I suppose that\u2019s the benefit of being a working-class woman, always having to work twice as hard to show you\u2019re just as good, in fact better, than an upper-middle-class man. So yes, I do think it\u2019s time our party had a woman leader. Long-Bailey cites Falmouth as an example of a place where Labour should have promoted its green industrial revolution more effectively. Our green industrial revolution would have transformed Falmouth\u2019s fortunes - but we didn\u2019t get that message out. Alongside local businesses, the community and energy experts, we developed plans to expand Falmouth\u2019s historic docks, which are a big part of the town\u2019s identity. We worked out how we\u2019d use public investment to crowd in private capital to create marine technology jobs and floating offshore wind. We should have given our activists in the town a detailed vision to sell on the doorstep. The new, high-skill, high-tech jobs wouldn\u2019t just benefit those working in the docks. Those extra salaries would be spent supporting local businesses, helping revive the high street. The whole town could be renewed, and through the docks that help define its identity and give it pride and purpose. Long-Bailey turns to the need for a green industrial revolution. She says she is \u201csad\u201d that this did not feature more in the party\u2019s campaign during the general election. The green industrial revolution could have been for us what the NHS was to the 1945 Labour government, our huge, era-defining project. And it still can be. In fact, it must. Because our green industrial revolution can bring people together. It unites young people, who want to fight for our planet\u2019s survival, with workers in every community, from the largest cities, to our nations, towns and villages, who will see new green jobs and lower bills, and the whole country proud to be world leaders in combating the climate crisis. Long-Bailey says Labour has to tell a \u201cconcrete story\u201d about how this plan would help communities. The green industrial revolution will never take off if it\u2019s something done to people rather than done with them. Long-Bailey says Labour has to tell a credible story about how it will help people improve their lives. My socialism isn\u2019t just a moral socialism \u2013 an outrage at the injustice done to others. It\u2019s the socialism of the majority, where everyone can live better lives together. I believe building that majority for change is a socialism that wins. So our path to power requires us to speak an everyday language to people simply going about their normal lives. We have to understand that people want a better life for their children \u2013 that\u2019s aspiration \u2013 but we can only secure that together \u2013 that\u2019s socialism. Long-Bailey says Britain needs a democratic revolution. Westminster feels as distant to many people as Brussels. We need a democratic revolution to break the hold of Westminster and the City over our politics, and show people that they can and will have the power to achieve what they want to achieve. Six of the 10 poorest regions in northern Europe are in the UK, because for too long the fate of our regions has been in the hands of people who only visit them for a photo op in a hi-vis jacket. So power needs to be closer to people geographically, with meaningful new powers and funding devolved to local level to grow local economies, invest in communities and build council homes. We spoke about the economy in the general election, but we didn\u2019t have anything to say to people who\u2019d lost trust with democracy. And after the Iraq war, the expenses scandal and the austerity lie that we\u2019re all in it together, who can blame them? So to follow our path to power, we will champion a democratic revolution. And just the first step would be scrapping the House of Lords and creating an elected senate representing our regions and nations, to scrutinise how every law impacts inequality, the environment and our people\u2019s wellbeing. Long-Bailey says she would be more \u201crobust\u201d with the media. And my leadership will be far more robust with the media. Journalists have a vital role to play in our society. We should respect their work \u2013 and look to ways to free them from government or corporate influence. But let\u2019s be honest: large sections of the media represent vested interests. Much of the press is owned by billionaires, so it\u2019s no surprise they support the Tories and monster Labour. I\u2019ll not only call that out, I have a plan to deal with it. I\u2019ll ridicule the most absurd smears and lies. We won\u2019t just rebut factual errors in stories, but provide a counter-narrative about deliberate media efforts to hold back aspirational socialism. But a credible and effective communications strategy extends beyond just being more combative and self-confident. It must also be more creative. So I\u2019ll set up a dedicated creative digital communications unit in the party, producing viral content that can both get around media hostility and speak directly to voters. Long-Bailey says she wants to empower members. The least they can do is give them open selections, she says. She says she has heard the criticism about how the party should be focusing on getting rid of Tory MPs, not Labour ones. But having empowered members will allow the party to get rid of Tory MPs, she says. Long-Bailey says she thinks she is the only candidate to have worked out a path to power. It has four elements. To win again, Labour has to look like the party of the workers, she says. She says under her leadership it will back workers in every strike and every dispute against unfair employers. She says it will fight any further Tory attempt to restrict the unions. She says she has been wearing a \u201clove unions\u201d badge this week, because it is the love unions week. She says she was the only candidate on Newsnight wearing the badge. In her speech Long-Bailey has just quoted Tony Blair. In his introduction to the 1997 he said that the Labour party was the political arm of the British people, she says. She says he was right. Long-Bailey has tweeted a link to extracts from her speech. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Labour leadership candidate, is delivering a speech in Salford. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. According to the advance briefing from her team, she is going to set out a path to power for Labour. Her team says it has four elements. 1) Improve Labour\u2019s messaging with \u201can everyday language\u201d of aspirational socialism to sell policies and principles 2) Empower our movement to reconnect with voters in the red wall and beyond 3) Stir up a democratic revolution to \u201cbreak the hold Westminster and the City over our politics, and show people that they can have the power to achieve what they want to achieve\u201d 4) Use the green industrial revolution to unite Labour\u2019s heartlands, from Blyth to Brixton And if you want to know what Sajid Javid is up to this morning, the former chancellor is at a pensioners\u2019 fair in his Bromsgrove constituency. Sky News has just broadcast some footage of Boris Johnson addressing his new cabinet. We\u2019re here to deliver for the people of this country. They have elected us to serve them and this government has to get on with delivering the people\u2019s priorities, and in the next few years we must get on with our basic work. And you know what it is? We are going to cut crime, we are going to tackle homelessness, we are going to tackle waiting lists in our NHS. At that point Johnson launched into his familiar primary school teacher routine. \u201cHow many hospitals are we going to build?\u201d he asked. \u201cForty,\u201d his ministers chanted back at him. No one was brave enough to say a more accurate figure would be six. Johnson then asked the same question about how many more police officers the government was recruiting (20,000, they told him) and how many more nurses (50,000, they told him - although arguably 30,000 is a more accurate figure). He also asked how many extra buses the government was providing, but only some of his ministers seemed to know the answer (announced in his statement to MPs on Tuesday) - 4,000. Johnson went on: All those things we want to achieve, but of course they won\u2019t make any difference in themselves. This is about improving the quality of everybody\u2019s life if possible. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Salma Shah, a former adviser to Sajid Javid, said it would have been \u201cincredibly detrimental\u201d to him if he had allowed No 10 to appoint his advisers. She explained: I think Sajid rightly understood that not having his own political advisers would be incredibly detrimental to his decision-making power. You cannot have a minister that does not appoint their own special advisers because they cannot appoint anyone else. They are the only people in a government department that are the minister\u2019s responsibility and chosen by them. She also played down suggestions that, as a backbencher, Javid would seek to cause problems for Boris Johnson. She said: I think the thing you have to remember about him as a person is he is non-confrontational. He is not someone who is going to rock the boat for the sake of his own ego. In an interview this morning Robert Jenrick, who kept his job as housing secretary, denied that Rishi Sunak, the new chancellor, would be a \u201cpuppet\u201d because No 10 is not letting him appoint his own advisers. When this suggestion was put to him, Jenrick said: That\u2019s completely untrue. I know Rishi Sunak well and he is one of the most talented people in politics today. He is going to be a fantastic chancellor. He brings with him a great deal of experience from the private sector, he\u2019s been an excellent minister in my department, and now at the Treasury. He has been heavily involved in the preparations for the budget in March and I think he is going to hit the ground running. Ministers have been arriving at No 10 for the first meeting of the new cabinet. Here are some of them walking up Downing Street. Here is my colleague Graham Russell\u2019s round-up of how the papers have covered Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation. Arlene Foster, the first minister of Northern Ireland and DUP leader, told the Today programme this morning that Brandon Lewis, the new Northern Ireland secretary, should \u201crevisit\u201d the scope of the historical investigation unit that was proposed in the power-sharing deal negotiated by his sacked predecessor. Under the \u201cNew Decade, New Approach\u201d deal (pdf) between the parties and the UK government that led to the restoration of the power-sharing executive, the UK promised to \u201cwithin 100 days, publish and introduce legislation in the UK parliament to implement the Stormont House agreement to address Northern Ireland legacy issues\u201d. The Stormont House agreement (pdf), which was agreed in 2014 but never implemented in full, promised: Legislation will establish a new independent body to take forward investigations into outstanding Troubles-related deaths; the Historical Investigations Unit (HIU). The body will take forward outstanding cases from the HET process, and the legacy work of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland (PONI). A report will be produced in each case. Unionists fear this will lead to former soldiers and police officers facing fresh investigation over matters for which they thought they had been cleared. Foster told Today: [What was] originally mooted in the Stormont agreement does need to be revisited because a lot of matters have changed since then, not least the fact that the chief constable put all of the so-called state killings into the historical investigation unit, so there are great difficulties in that - not least that 90% of those who lost their lives in Northern Ireland were killed by paramilitaries, terrorists if you will. There is a need for balance in everything we do here in Northern Ireland. Asked if she would be asking Lewis to review the terms of the \u201cNew Decade, New Approach\u201d deal, Foster said: I had already written to the secretary of state Julian Smith a number of weeks ago saying to him it is very important that the victims take the lead in all of these issues and that there is a co-design of any legislation so they are at the heart of dealing with the matters of the past. It is very important that the victims are at the fore. I hope Brandon Lewis will listen to the voices of the victims. That is something I will certainly be saying to him. Walking into Downing Street, Mark Spencer, the chief whip, was asked by reporters if Sajid Javid had been forced out of the cabinet. As the Press Association reports, Spencer replied \u201cNo\u201d, before adding: \u201cIt\u2019s new a government.\u201d Good morning. Boris Johnson will chair a meeting of his new cabinet this morning and, while it is expected to discuss the government\u2019s plans for a new post-Brexit immigration system, many of the attendees - like the rest of Westminster - will probably spend just as much time mulling over the implications of the events that led up to yesterday\u2019s shock resignation of Sajid Javid as chancellor. The papers this morning are full of analysis - here is a take from my colleague Heather Stewart; I will post links to some others later - but, roughly speaking, the move raises four big questions about the future of British politics. 1) Does this mean Boris Johnson will now abandon the fiscal rules announced during the election, allowing him to borrow even more than planned for spending on infrastructure and public services? Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, is thought to be angling for this, and yesterday No 10 was vague about whether the government was still committed to those fiscal rules (which were already seen as a loosening from the Philip Hammond era). The rules were drafted when the Tories were expecting to win a small majority, and the scale of Johnson\u2019s victory in December means the pressure to deliver for new Tory voters in the north is much stronger than it was. 2) Does this mean Johnson is emasculating the Treasury? That certainly seems to be the intention, and yesterday one commentator said the plan to effectively merge No 10 and the Treasury into a more cohesive unit amounted to the \u201cmost significant development since the creation of the devolved parliaments in 1999\u201d. But most prime ministers try at one point to curtail the powers of No 11, and most of them fail. The Treasury may prove to be more institutionally resilient than Cummings imagines, and even if the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is more firmly under No 10\u2019s line management, he stills heads a department stuffed with hundreds of clever officials who are professionally trained to tell politicians truths they don\u2019t want to hear. 3) Does this mean Johnson is getting more like Donald Trump? In some respects, because the reshuffle had all the hallmarks of a powergrab, and the appointment of Suella Braverman as attorney general has gone down badly with defenders of the judiciary. But even though Johnson\u2019s preferred model for leadership is probably Emperor Augustus, cabinet government still very much applies. 4) Ultimately will this reshuffle leave Johnson politically stronger or politically weaker? At this point it is impossible to tell. Some Tory MPs must be unhappy about the way Javid has been treated, but if they are, they have not yet been saying so in public. Johnson is so powerful at the moment that he can more or less do whatever he wants, but that won\u2019t last forever and in the end the reshuffle will be judged by whether or not it delivers for the Conservative party. Here is our overnight story about the reshuffle. And here is a graphic from last night about the reshuffle. It features the 10 ministers who were allowed to attend cabinet before the reshuffle. No 10 has now drastically slimmed down those numbers and, in addition to the full cabinet, there will be only four extra attendees: Stephen Barclay, chief secretary to the Treasury; Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the Commons; Mark Spencer, the chief whip; and Suella Braverman, the attorney general. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Boris Johnson chairs a meeting of the new cabinet. 10am: Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Labour leadership candidate, give a speech in Salford. 1pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. Also, today is the final day for candidates for the Labour leadership and deputy leadership to get the CLP or affiliate nominations that they need to make it onto the final ballot. Emily Thornberry is the only candidate who still has not hit this threshold, but three more CLP nominations today would get her over the line. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

I think we have to generate some defensive stability, but not by defending deep. I don\u2019t like that. It\u2019s by defending high and pressing the opponent as much as possible. But the process - together as many times as possible in the most efficient way - has to be done properly from here. If not in two passes when you arrive there, that transition is impossible to control because you are too far from the opponent. So we need to do that well first to after be able to generate and sustain our attacks as many times as possible during the games.\u201d</p> \n  <p><em>What did the squad work on in Dubai, during their winter break?</em></p> \n  <p>\u201cIt was like a mini pre-season for us in Dubai, we had time to work on a lot of our principles: how we want to set up against different formations, the relevant things we need to work on [both] on and off the ball and apart from that it was great to be together and spend some time together, get to know each other, not just the players but the staff and the backroom staff as well. It was a very productive trip.\u201d</p> \n  <p><em>Has he started planning for the summer?</em></p> \n  <p>\u201cAbsolutely. We have to plan and we need to know the direction we want to head and with that we need to bear in mind different scenarios and with that in mind, I have to tell the club what we need, where we think we can improve and where we want to end. And if we all end with the same thing, we put a plan together to try and execute it and make the process as short as possible.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e46afc38f086a28115abc81\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-14T14:34:23.396Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The hits keep on coming</strong>, as far as press conferences are concerned.

We had three complete days off but then were back on the training pitch to prepare for the following weeks and months. We never had a full week to prepare in the Championship. Liverpool have had enough time to prepare as well and will be switched on.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnfield [where they lost 4-1 at the start of the season] was a huge task for us but we showed that when we are good at our topics we are competitive. We created chances and should have been more clinical and switched on. There is always hope. Everything can happen in one game. In 20 games Liverpool will probably win the most, but our game against Man City showed that when we\u2019re good at our topics we can beat them.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to bring the mental attitude to the group, whether fighting for promotion or relegation. I\u2019m responsible for man management and leading the group. I admire J\u00fcrgen Klopp because they were so successful last season, but are still so consistent and greedy.</p> \n  <p>\u201cTeams often choose to sit deep against Liverpool, but they\u2019re too strong against that in counter-attacks. If not, they\u2019ll score from a set piece with [Virgil] Van Dijk. We have to have periods on the front foot, dominating possession and be fully aware there will be periods we have to be solid defending.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-14T13:52:17.574Z\">at 1.52pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e46a3a18f086a28115abc14\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-14T13:44:19.650Z\">1.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Lampard (continued) on Monday\u2019s match against Manchester United: </em>\u201cIt\u2019s a chance to open up a gap against a rival and we need to take that chance ... it\u2019s a game we want to win, you can\u2019t control certain factors, but you can control how you go into it.

Plus of course there\u2019ll be a host of matches in the Football League as the romance of the title race(s) ramps up.</p> \n  <p>On top of that, there are some fascinating fixtures in the leagues across Europe with the business end of the season in Germany, Italy, Spain - indeed, everywhere - fast approaching.</p> \n  <p>Valencia meet Atletico Madrid in La Liga this evening, with Barcelona taking on Getafe tomorrow and Real Madrid hosting Celta Vigo on Sunday night. In Germany Borussia Dortmund play tonight, against Eintracht Frankfurt, while leaders Bayern Munich travelling to FC K\u00f6ln on Sunday.</p> \n  <p>But possibly the biggest fixture in Europe this weekend is Lazio\u2019s meeting with Inter Milan in Rome, the city of love, on Sunday. Inter currently top the table on goal difference from Maurizio Sarri\u2019s Juventus, with Lazio lurking a point behind them both.</p> \n  <p>There are several Premier League press conferences coming up throughout the day, starting with league leaders scheduled for Liverpool at 11am, so we\u2019ll bring you quotes and news from those, and much more besides. Let\u2019s hope we all come up smelling of roses.</p> \n  <p><strong>Weekend Premier League fixtures</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Tonight</strong></p> \n  <p>Wolves v Leicester City</p> \n  <p><strong>Saturday</strong></p> \n  <p>Southampton v Burnley<br>Norwich City v Liverpool</p> \n  <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p> \n  <p>Aston Villa v Tottenham<br>Arsenal v Newcastle</p> \n  <p><strong>Monday</strong></p> \n  <p>Chelsea v Manchester United<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-14T09:53:52.187Z\">at 9.53am GMT</time></p> \n</div>",

With that in mind I have to tell the club what we need, where we think we can improve and where we want to aim, and if we all want to aim for the same things then we put a plan together to try to execute it and make the process as short as possible.\u201d Since the turn of the millennium West Bromwich Albion have gone: up (2002), down (2003), up (2004), down (2006), up (2008), down (2009), up (2010) and down (2018) and it looks like they\u2019re on course to bounce back once more: Here\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, speaking earlier on his discussions with Dele Alli: And some Chelsea news ahead of their game against Manchester United on Monday: Tammy Abraham faces a late fitness test having missed several training sessions this week with an ankle problem. Christian Pulisic (adductor) and Ruben Loftus-Cheek (achilles) will both miss out, with neither man match fit despite being in training. A bit of Tottenham team news from the Press Association: Steven Bergwijn, Ben Davies and Giovani Lo Celso are all back in the Spurs squad. Erik Lamela (groin) will be assessed, but Harry Kane, Moussa Sissoko and Juan Foyth miss out. Spurs, by the by, have won on their last five visits to face Villa at Villa Park at an aggregate score of 14-1. Hello all. We\u2019re on the final straight. Let\u2019s kick off with your bumper* Friday edition of the Fiver: *may not be bumper That will be all from me today - thanks for reading, and for sending love on email and Twitter - I\u2019m handing over to my colleague John Ashdown, who will steer you even closer to this weekend\u2019s footballing action. Bye for now. As reported here earlier on, Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has his Valentine\u2019s Day evening plans well sorted: \u201cSomething like Wolves against Leicester, then maybe a nice takeaway, then Love Island on ITV + 1.\u201d Lucky Christine! A couple of match previews for you here - leaders Liverpool v rock-bottom Norwich: And Southampton v Burnley, a chance for one of these clubs to climb into the top half: \u201cI say what I think and that\u2019s why I\u2019m not the easiest guy for some coaches.\u201d Get to know a bit more about new Chelsea signing Hakim Ziyech, thanks to Bart Vlietstra: Back to that Manchester United press conference ... In France - in Monaco to be precise - there is a match tonight which will have an impact on the race for Champions League qualification. Seventh-placed Monaco (35 points) host fifth-placed Montpellier (37 points). Lille, Rennes and Marseille sit fourth, third and second respectively, and of course PSG are running away with the league with 61 points - 12 ahead of nearest challengers Marseille. Suitably earth-shattering quotes from Monaco defender Fod\u00e9 Ballo-Tour\u00e9 ahead of this one: \u201cWinning? Of course it\u2019s good for the team. We have to string together the wins and we are working towards that. Now we want to get closer to the top of the table.\u201d Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r says on-loan striker Odion Ighalo may make his debut against Chelsea on Monday: \u201cHe\u2019ll be involved with us and he\u2019ll travel down with us and, obviously, now he\u2019s out of that two-week period of precaution and it\u2019s a precaution we\u2019ve made,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cHe\u2019ll travel with us and let\u2019s see if he\u2019s involved or not. \u201cHe\u2019s done his [training programme] and it was always going to be a case of him having to integrate into the group anyway after having been out in China. He needs to get used to the players and the team and up to speed as quick as he can. \u201cOdion can help the club. He is a very professional player, a good lad and he\u2019ll give something to the group.\u201d Quotes thanks to manutd.com Over at Borussia Dortmund\u2019s social media dept. they\u2019ve put together a Valentine\u2019s Day video which mainly consists of players kicking each other to classical music: The Axel Witsel social media dept., meanwhile, have told his fans on Twitter that Dortmund will get the result they need against Eintracht Frankfurt this evening. Third-placed Dortmund sit four points off the pace set by leaders Bayern Munich, and three behind second-placed RB Leipzig: Here\u2019s a social media snippet of Inter Milan strike duo Romelo Lukaku and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez cuddling, for Valentine\u2019s Day and all that ... Words from Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r will be coming up as soon as humanly possible, by the way. The IOC have insisted that the 2020 Tokyo Olympics will be going ahead, despite the increasingly worrying Coronavirus outbreak. There are men\u2019s and women\u2019s football tournaments as part of the Olympics, of course, with 16 men\u2019s teams due to compete and 12 women\u2019s teams. Sean Ingle reports: Earlier mention of Tony Cottee (one of only two players to score on PL goals on Valentine\u2019s Day and Halloween, along with Jamie Vardy) got me thinking of my first-ever visit to a football match, West Ham v Nottingham Forest at Upton Park, all the way back in 1987. A youthful Cottee scored twice, including a fairly sensational bicycle kick: I\u2019ll be here for the next hour to serve your weekend football countdown needs. Any burning issues that need discussing? Get in touch on email or on Twitter, as above. It seems Belgium, Croatia, Portugal and Switzerland are all off to Qatar at the end of March for the inaugural \u2018Qatar Airways International Tournament\u2019: Always good to squeeze a few friendly fixtures into the sparse playing schedule, I\u2019d say. EXCLUSIVE! At the team\u2019s winter training camp in Marbella, Manchester United granted access to ... their own media team: By the way, it seems that Manchester United press conference has been shifted to 3.15pm GMT. \u201cFor me it was quite an easy conversation.\u201d Barry Glendenning has the full story on how Spurs manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho dealt with Dele Alli\u2019s recent social media controversy: Some thoughts here from Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta in his press conference - thanks to www.arsenal.com - Has he had to sacrifice attacking flair for defensive solidity since taking over? \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I think we have to generate some defensive stability, but not by defending deep. I don\u2019t like that. It\u2019s by defending high and pressing the opponent as much as possible. But the process - together as many times as possible in the most efficient way - has to be done properly from here. If not in two passes when you arrive there, that transition is impossible to control because you are too far from the opponent. So we need to do that well first to after be able to generate and sustain our attacks as many times as possible during the games.\u201d What did the squad work on in Dubai, during their winter break? \u201cIt was like a mini pre-season for us in Dubai, we had time to work on a lot of our principles: how we want to set up against different formations, the relevant things we need to work on [both] on and off the ball and apart from that it was great to be together and spend some time together, get to know each other, not just the players but the staff and the backroom staff as well. It was a very productive trip.\u201d Has he started planning for the summer? \u201cAbsolutely. We have to plan and we need to know the direction we want to head and with that we need to bear in mind different scenarios and with that in mind, I have to tell the club what we need, where we think we can improve and where we want to end. And if we all end with the same thing, we put a plan together to try and execute it and make the process as short as possible.\u201d The hits keep on coming, as far as press conferences are concerned. Manchester United will be ticking the media box in a little over 10 minutes ahead of Monday night\u2019s meeting with Chelsea in London. The former England captain Dave Watson has a neurodegenerative disease that was \u201cmost likely\u201d brought on by head injuries and repeated heading of the ball during his playing days, his wife has said in a statement released to the PA news agency: Let\u2019s head briefly to Japan, where the imminent kick-off of the J-League has had players, managers, and player-managers on media duty today. Striker Kazuyoshi Miura of Yokohama FC (right) is still going strong at the age of 52 (!!!). He made his professional debut all the way back in 1986. The man on the left, of course, is Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, who is now 35. So he was a mere two years old when Miura ran on to a pitch as a professional for the first time. More evidence, if it were needed, of the health-giving benefits of the Japanese diet and general way of life. Sad news from Gigg Lane, where it appears the club are heading for liquidation. They were promoted to League One for this season, but then expelled from the Football League owing to their financial difficulties. David Conn reports: A few more lines from Lampard here, speaking about Morocco winger Hakim Ziyech, who will be joining the club from Ajax in time for next season: \u201cI think he has an incredible left foot; he has an elegance about him that can find a pass,\u201d said Lampard. \u201cI see a player that hopefully can have a big imprint on our team and the Premier League. At times this season we\u2019ve missed the player with the finishing touch. Hopefully he can be a piece of that puzzle.\u201d Gunners fitness update klaxon! They take on Newcastle at the Emirates on Sunday afternoon: Kolasinac, Nelson, Saka are all fit. Some of the others, not so much: Sead Kolasinac - Available following left thigh strain. Reiss Nelson - Available following right hamstring strain. Bukayo Saka - Available for following a knock to right leg against Burnley. Cedric Soares, Kieran Tierney, Calum Chambers are all still out - Pablo Mari is in full training following transfer from Brazilian pre-season. Over in Spain, new-ish Barcelona manager Quique Seti\u00e9n has been speaking to media about his shortage of options in the forward line. The club have requested special dispensation to bring someone in outside the transfer window in view of the players on the sidelines. Ahead of their meeting with third-placed Getafe tomorrow afternoon, Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 has been ruled out for six months after having surgery on a leg injury, while ex-Liverpool man Luis Su\u00e1rez is recovering from a knee problem. \u201cI am always prepared for whatever comes up, work with what I have,\u201d Seti\u00e9n said. \u201cEverybody would like to have their team better than they are, but we will adapt to the situation. We must wait for the response to see if we can sign (another striker). The club is working on it. If we are given permission to sign a player, it is preferable, but we will always find a plan - because in the end you have to play with 11. We will adapt, find a solution and the way forward.\u201d In the end, you have to play with 11. He\u2019s not wrong there, is he? By the way, leaders Real Madrid - who are on 52 points, three clear of Bar\u00e7a at the moment - meet Celta Vigo on Sunday evening. Courtesy of the official Canaries website, here are some thoughts from Norwich City manager Daniel Farke, who is preparing his bottom-placed club to take on runaway leaders Liverpool at Carrow Road tomorrow evening: \u201cThe winter break was too short! In Germany we have four-five weeks and I\u2019m lazy! But it was good to be able to calm things down. We had three complete days off but then were back on the training pitch to prepare for the following weeks and months. We never had a full week to prepare in the Championship. Liverpool have had enough time to prepare as well and will be switched on. \u201cAnfield [where they lost 4-1 at the start of the season] was a huge task for us but we showed that when we are good at our topics we are competitive. We created chances and should have been more clinical and switched on. There is always hope. Everything can happen in one game. In 20 games Liverpool will probably win the most, but our game against Man City showed that when we\u2019re good at our topics we can beat them. \u201cIt\u2019s important to bring the mental attitude to the group, whether fighting for promotion or relegation. I\u2019m responsible for man management and leading the group. I admire J\u00fcrgen Klopp because they were so successful last season, but are still so consistent and greedy. \u201cTeams often choose to sit deep against Liverpool, but they\u2019re too strong against that in counter-attacks. If not, they\u2019ll score from a set piece with [Virgil] Van Dijk. We have to have periods on the front foot, dominating possession and be fully aware there will be periods we have to be solid defending.\u201d Lampard (continued) on Monday\u2019s match against Manchester United: \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to open up a gap against a rival and we need to take that chance ... it\u2019s a game we want to win, you can\u2019t control certain factors, but you can control how you go into it. Sometimes at home we haven\u2019t got what we wanted, maybe what we deserved.\u201d It\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day, do you have a special evening planned? \u201c[Laughs] Do you want the details? The finer details? It will look something like Wolves against Leicester, possibly a nice takeaway, then Love Island on ITV + 1.\u201d Fitness update: \u201cChristian [Pulisic] trained with the Under-23s today, he won\u2019t be fit. Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] won\u2019t be fit for this game, he is getting closer ... it\u2019s great to have him nearly back. Tammy [Abraham] is still feeling the effects [of recent injury] and we had to take him out of training a couple of times this week ... we are hopeful, but he is to be assessed over the weekend.\u201d What will new signing Hakim Ziyech bring to the team? \u201cQuality in what he\u2019s got, in terms of the ability to make assists and score goals ... we\u2019ve had games where we\u2019ve had a lot of the ball but we haven\u2019t had that final bit ... he\u2019ll have to fit into the way we want to work here, working hard off the ball with a lot of energy, but the quality he has got will be there for the fans to see.\u201d Has the winter break made a different to the players? \u201cI think ... I haven\u2019t seen a visible difference but I think it\u2019s a good thing for them to mentally rest, get away from each other, and spend time with their families as they see fit.\u201d Did Lampard need the break, it seemed like he was frustrated at the end of January? \u201cThe only thing that frustrates me is that I want to be as successful as I can at this club ... looking back I enjoyed having a bit of time away, it was a small reboot for everybody.\u201d What will Man United bring? \u201cThey\u2019ve added in a couple of positions, but they\u2019re a good team anyway, they are always going to be a threat for the top four. I do expect a tough game on Monday and of course it\u2019s a direct rival, they are not too many points behind us, so we need to take that into account. Manchester United and Tottenham coming up are huge games for us.\u201d (Eighth-placed Manchester United are six points behind Chelsea in fourth.) J\u00fcrgen Klopp, the smilingest manager in Premier League history, has more reason to beam - he has won the Manager of the Month award for a record fifth time, breaking the previous record of four, set by Manchester City rival Pep Guardiola. \u201cDele is a great guy\u201d - some quotes here from Tottenham manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho regarding the recent furore over Dele Alli\u2019s Snapchat posts, in which he appeared to joke about the Coronavirus outbreak and mock and Asian man: Mourinho said: \u201cI spoke with him about that but it was quite an easy conversation because he was very sorry about - let\u2019s say, the mistake - but it was never his intention to hurt or offend. \u201cHe immediately regretted and recognised it was a young generation mistake and he apologised. So my conversation was easy. What can I say, I can say he regrets and that is the best feeling he can show. \u201cI have a son at the same age as Dele and many of the players. I know social media is for his generation but when you are a public person like footballers are, they have to know and they have to be very, very careful. \u201cDele is a great guy. The last thing he is is anything connected with racism.\u201d Newcastle\u2019s big man up front (fitness permitting), Andy Carroll, tried to volley a ball in training and got injured. Magpies manager Steve Bruce doesn\u2019t sound very happy about it, although he refrained from aiming a volley of abuse in Carroll\u2019s general direction. \u201cHe\u2019s strong-minded and tough mentally, and I suppose he\u2019s had to be. However tough you are mentally though, it affects you if you can\u2019t play. It becomes frustrating and disappointing for everybody, and, for Andy, it\u2019s the worst scenario,\u201d said Bruce. I\u2019m currently unable to find a live stream of either the Spurs or Norwich press conferences, but there will definitely be something from Chelsea at 1.30pm, and maybe Arsenal too. Stay tuned. Stats gurus at the official Premier League website tell us that Norwich v Liverpool is the joint highest-scoring match up in the competition: \u201cThe sides have met 17 times in the Premier League and there have been a total of 68 goals, an average of four per fixture.\u201d The equal highest is the head-to-head between Nottingham Forest and Blackburn Rovers, who have banged in a total of 40 goals between them in 10 Premier League encounters. Even I can work out that\u2019s an average of exactly four per match ... Tottenham welcome back Steven Bergwijn, Ben Davies and Giovani Lo Celso for the trip to Aston Villa. Bergwijn was ineligible for Spurs\u2019 FA Cup game with Southampton while Lo Celso (thigh) and Davies (ankle) were unfit. Kane, Sissoko and Foyth all remain out for Tottenham, with Lamela a possibility to feature against Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon: Creative genius Giovani Lo Celso is back in training with the squad, after a thigh injury, and is \u2018in the frame\u2019 for the Villa meeting. Just to mark your card for what is coming up, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho will be speaking at 1pm (so very shortly) and at half past Mikel Arteta will also face the cameras. Frank Lampard is also set for his press conference at 1.30pm, while Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is up at 2.45pm. Rangers manager Steven Gerrard has defended his comments in the wake of his side\u2019s defeat against Kilmarnock in midweek. Gerrard said his team \u201cfailed to handle the heat\u201d at Rugby Park, comments which prompted some criticism. But Gerrard on Friday insisted that honesty is the best policy. \u201cMy way of looking back at what I said is that I always try to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get in a situation where people don\u2019t believe me or it\u2019s not authentic. At the time, I felt like we\u2019d really let ourselves down and I took responsibility for the group\u2019s performance on the night. So I have no regrets for what I said on the night.\u201d Joe Howlett has emailed in boasting about his Euro 2020 tickets: \u201cI got very lucky. Denmark v Finland in Copenhagen. I\u2019ve heard it being touted as game of the tournament already!\u201d A trip to Copenhagen is never a bad thing, or so I\u2019ve heard. Sounds like fun Joe. Enjoy. Premier-League wise, Tottenham\u2019s press conference is next on the menu at 1pm. They head to Aston Villa tomorrow and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho should be along shortly. Let\u2019s take a quick look at Italy and one of Mourinho\u2019s former clubs, Inter Milan. The Nerazzurri head for Rome and a Sunday evening showdown with Lazio. Antonio Conte\u2019s Inter are top, by virtue of goal difference. But Lazio are only a point behind Inter and Juventus. They could go top with a win if Juve fail to beat Brescia at home earlier on Sunday. The prolific ex-Manchester United striker Romelu Lukaku has scored 12 times away from home for Inter so far this season, the most in Europe\u2019s top leagues. \u201cRoad goals,\u201d in US Sports-speak. But hang on - Lazio striker Ciro Immobile has netted the most home goals of any striker in Europe, with 15. Who will come out on top on Sunday? There is a stats piece here on the Inter Milan website, if you fancy it. It\u2019s Hull City v Swansea City tonight, as 15th plays 10th in the Championship. Hull are on a poor run, winless in the Championship since New Year\u2019s Day. That\u2019s partly down to a lengthy injury list, although defenders Matthew Pennington and Ryan Tafazolli may be in line to return tonight. Visitors Swansea City are six points off the play-off places. They will be without midfielder George Byers for the rest of the season after he picked up an ankle injury, and Mike van der Hoorn and Jordon Garrick both remain sidelined. Hull City boss Grant McCann told the club\u2019s website: \u201cWe want to bring the smile and the enjoyment back and to go out there and express ourselves. We all need to stick together. When results don\u2019t go your way it\u2019s very easy to point fingers and look to put the blame somewhere, but we don\u2019t have that culture here. \u201cWe understand that we haven\u2019t been good enough in our last five or six league games but we have the opportunity to turn it around.\u201d Things are heating up in the Championship and no mistake. The weekend\u2019s fixtures look like this, with leaders West Brom hosting Nottingham Forest in the lunchtime kick-off tomorrow before second-placed Leeds hosts Bristol City in a good old-fashioned 3pm Saturday KO: Tonight Hull City v Swansea Saturday West Brom v Nottingham Forest Birmingham v Brentford Cardiff City v Wigan Athletic Charlton v Blackburn Derby County v Huddersfield Fulham v Barnsley Leeds United v Bristol City Middlesbrough v Luton Preston v Millwall QPR v Stoke City Sheffield Wednesday v Reading If you missed it, here\u2019s a story from yesterday evening by David Conn, regarding AFC Wimbledon\u2019s funding of their new stadium at an old location - Plough Lane. The club has raised over \u00a34million via a bond scheme: Uefa have issued a press release this morning outlining the record numbers of fans trying to get their hands on tickets for Euro 2020 this summer, which is being hosted across 12 countries. \u201cIn the ticketing sales phase for fans of qualified teams in December 2019, supporters requested a record number of 8,977,427 tickets, which is more than three times the number of tickets requested during the same sales phase for UEFA EURO 2016,\u201d reads the statement. \u201cFollowing on from last summer\u2019s successful general public sales (12 June \u2013 12 July), when there were 19.3 million ticket applications, there has been an unprecedented total of approximately 28.3 million ticket requests for 2.5 million available tickets. \u201cSignificantly, the overall number of tickets requested for EURO 2020 is double the amount of the total tickets requested for UEFA EURO 2016.\u201d The highest demand has been for the final at Wembley on July 12, which has attracted more than 714,000 ticket requests, eight times the stadium\u2019s capacity. The group stage encounter between Germany and France at the 75,000-capacity Allianz Arena in Munich on June 16 has received 710,000 applications. Fans are loving the multiple-country hosting format, basically, and are proving it with an insatiable - indeed, record-breaking - demand for tickets. Did you get lucky in the sale? Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham, Arsenal and Norwich press conferences are all scheduled for between now and 3pm. There is nothing due before 1pm though, in case you need to nip to the petrol station for a bunch of flowers and a card. It\u2019s quiz time. Test your knowledge of runaway league leaders, including a curveball on a team from one of Lithuania, Lativa, Estonia or Finland ... Now then. Is Tatith Chong going to go the same way as Ashley Young, Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku, and sign for Inter Milan from Manchester United? Fabrizio Romano writes that he is \u2018seriously considering\u2019 an offer from the Antonio Conte-managed Italian outfit: Klopp finishes the press conference by answering a question on the winter break, and the fact that Manchester City\u2019s match was scheduled during it, and then postponed due to weather: \u201cIt just shows the problem with the schedule, that\u2019s how it is. The winter weather, you can\u2019t change \u2026 we decided the winter break must be a winter break [regarding Liverpool\u2019s FA Cup replay against Shrewsbury]. \u201cI just hope somebody will find a solution to these problems. I think the next problem will be if Manchester City go through in the FA Cup, then other games will have to be rescheduled. You cannot please everybody. We need to talk [the clubs with the authorities] about these problems, because if we don\u2019t, it will get worse.\u201d Newcastle target man Andy Carroll has suffered a setback in his fight for full fitness, says manager Steve Bruce. Newcastle host Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday, and Bruce said: \u201cThe big problem we\u2019ve got still is Andy\u2019s not right, so that\u2019s a concern to us going forward. We expected him to be okay and unfortunately, he\u2019s not.\u201d Asked if the injury is more serious than was first feared, Bruce added: \u201cWe don\u2019t think so. Thankfuly, it\u2019s not his ankle, but this hip, hip flexor, whatever it is. When he gets to a certain level in his rehabilitation, he\u2019s still not quite right, so we\u2019ll just have to keep monitoring it and see how he is.\u201d Is Klopp surprised to see how Norwich have struggled given how well they competed in the team\u2019s first match this season? \u201cIs it a surprise? I am not sure, this league is so strong. What I admire is that they stick to their principles, they do what they do ... it\u2019s super coaching, you can see all the patterns and the movements on the pitch ... they caused 95 per cent of the teams they played against real problems ... from the outside it looks like this club really sticks together, they know what they have to do, and strange as it may sound, they are in a really good moment in the club. To stay in the Premier League will be difficult ... but no-one questions Daniel Farke because he is doing an incredible job. I was at a similar club, at Mainz ... you need a plan for tomorrow, for next month, for the next few years, and to me it looks like they have that ... they had a lot of chances in the first game [4-1 to Liverpool at Anfield] so it was a good warning for us ... we will feel the quality of Norwich.\u201d Klopp says James Milner and Sadio Man\u00e9 are in contention to start against Norwich. \u201cThey both trained for Monday on and they are in contention.\u201d Liverpool manager Klopp is asked to compare title races in Germany to the UK: \u201cIt\u2019s intense. People ask silly questions, you have to answer [laughs]. If you want to be successful you have to be consistent ... actually the nicest problem you can have in football is to answer or to not answer these questions ... there are a lot of games to come. It\u2019s question two or three [in this press conference] and Norwich hasn\u2019t been mentioned yet, but they are obviously my first concern. We have no other chance to make this game against Norwich the most important of our lives. People think it will be easy, because they look at the table ... we know they can cause problems, but we know we can cause problems too.\u201d The impact and benefit of the winter break ? \u201cWe sent the players all over the world, we wanted them to rest, and I can see a difference in training. Rest is only one word - it\u2019s rest, it\u2019s recovery, there are a lot of things that start with \u2018re-\u2019 that happen in that week. You don\u2019t lose a lot in a week [in terms of fitness and conditioning], but you can gain a lot.\u201d Klopp speaks! Will Mohamed Salah go to the Tokyo Olympics with Egypt? \u201cDo I want to lose a player in pre-season? Of course not, that\u2019s clear \u2026 we need more information, how will it look, when will the preparation start and so on \u2026 and no-one really contacted us so far, it\u2019s all in the media. So, no decision made yet but we\u2019ll see. We cannot discuss it really because we don\u2019t know a lot about it, really. We need to speak to them [Egypt\u2019s Olympic team management].\u201d Here, Louise Taylor looks ahead to the weekend\u2019s women\u2019s FA CUp action- she speaks to Sunderland Ladies boss Melanie Reay (cousin of Alan Shearer) who is plotting Birmingham\u2019s downfall in their fifth-round meeting on Sunday: Tottenham will take on RB Leipzig in the Champions League in north London next Wednesday. Second in the Bundesliga, just a point behind Bayern Munich, Leipzig are first in action against domestic rivals Werder Bremen tomorrow afternoon. Nick Ames has spoken to midfielder Emil Forsberg, looking ahead to the Spurs match, and looking back on his time in Germany so far: Ruben Vinagre is the only injury absentee for Wolves tonight for their meeting with Leicester. Quoted on the Wolves website, manager Nuno Espirito Santo is expecting a stiff test against the Foxes: \u201cBrendan [Rodgers] is doing a fantastic job, very good players, everybody can see the quality they have. So, we know what we\u2019re going to face. They are a very good team, with a lot of quality players, a clear idea of football.\u201d Fittingly, it\u2019s a Valentine\u2019s Day love-in over on the Leicester City website too, where Rodgers in turn pours praise on the job Nuno is doing with Wolves: \u201cNuno\u2019s done an outstanding job there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a big investment in the Championship. Players came in, but he\u2019s been able to put them into a structure and a format and a way of working. Of course, in the Championship, they were terrific and then they came up, invested again, and then showed that consistency and quality in the Premier League ... \u201cThey play a counter-attacking style, so they\u2019ll be happy to sit a bit deeper and then look to break out with the pace and they have the quality and the understanding to do that.\u201d Leicester\u2019s Wilfred Ndidi is doubtful with a knee injury while January loan signing Ryan Bennett is ineligible against his parent club. Veteran centre-back Wes Morgan returns to the squad. Liverpool manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp is due to be speaking in less than 25 minutes ... Meanwhile, here\u2019s Reds goalie Alisson Becker with a sumptuous first touch in training. Not so sure about the last touch, though ... Don\u2019t forget, sports fans - you can contact me on Twitter or on email with any thoughts on the weekend\u2019s imminent footballing action. I wouldn\u2019t recommend proposing marriage to your significant other via this blog, but all entries will be considered on merit. Meanwhile, this seems fair regarding social media on Valentine\u2019s Day, from Adam Crafton: Will Spurs or Arsenal sign Norwich City\u2019s Ben Godfrey this summer? Will Jos\u00e9 Mourinho also swoop for Max Aarons? Will Manchester United\u2019s goalie Dean Henderson, on loan at Sheffield United, sign for PSG?? Barry Glendenning has this morning\u2019s transfer tittle-tattle for you right here: Here\u2019s a story we broke last night, regarding the astonishing volume of football match tickets being resold via sites such as StubHub. \u201cEvidence seen by the Guardian indicates that one person may be behind a large proportion of transactions in English football. Internal StubHub data includes multiple listings with the same \u201cseller ID\u201d. Only StubHub knows who they are but they are responsible for nearly \u00a32m of tickets advertised on one day.\u201d Rob Davies has all the details here: Opta\u2019s Duncan Alexander is winning football Twitter, yet again: Here we have an eclectic mix of 10 things to look out for this weekend - from Nottingham Forest\u2019s date with Championship-leading West Brom, to RB Salzburg\u2019s crunch encounter against title rivals Lask in the Austrian top division tonight. Nick Ames, Simon Burnton and Paul Doyle muck in for this one: Who\u2019d have thunk it? Wolves have won 4-3 in both of their home Premier-League era encounters against the Foxes. Will we have another seven-goal thriller tonight? In keeping with \u201cGlobal Britain\u201d, meanwhile, Leicester City have kindly provided kick-off times for fans from Vancouver to Sydney and pretty much everywhere in between. If you\u2019re in the UK, it\u2019s an 8pm start. Italy and Juventus great Gigi Buffon has been adding to his collection of football memorabilia. The goalkeeper snaffled Daniel Maldini\u2019s shirt after the 1-1 draw in Milan last night, adding another father-son combo to his haul, along with Chiesa, Thuram and Weah: Now, here\u2019s a round-up of last night\u2019s action in Europe. In Italy Juventus needed a late Cristiano Ronaldo penalty to salvage a 1-1 draw with Milan in the first leg of their Coppa Italia semi-final, while Napoli beat Inter 1-0 on Wednesday: Paul Pogba is in the news again. He wants to leave Manchester United, says agent Mino Raiola ... but who will stump up the \u20ac100m (\u00a383m) the club apparently want? Here\u2019s Fabrizio Romano: Good morning everybody, and welcome to this Valentine\u2019s Day-themed weekend football countdown. There are six Premier League matches across the weekend, starting with Wolves v Leicester this evening, and ending with a semi-seismic clash between Chelsea and Manchester United on Monday night. Plus of course there\u2019ll be a host of matches in the Football League as the romance of the title race(s) ramps up. On top of that, there are some fascinating fixtures in the leagues across Europe with the business end of the season in Germany, Italy, Spain - indeed, everywhere - fast approaching. Valencia meet Atletico Madrid in La Liga this evening, with Barcelona taking on Getafe tomorrow and Real Madrid hosting Celta Vigo on Sunday night. In Germany Borussia Dortmund play tonight, against Eintracht Frankfurt, while leaders Bayern Munich travelling to FC K\u00f6ln on Sunday. But possibly the biggest fixture in Europe this weekend is Lazio\u2019s meeting with Inter Milan in Rome, the city of love, on Sunday. Inter currently top the table on goal difference from Maurizio Sarri\u2019s Juventus, with Lazio lurking a point behind them both. There are several Premier League press conferences coming up throughout the day, starting with league leaders scheduled for Liverpool at 11am, so we\u2019ll bring you quotes and news from those, and much more besides. Let\u2019s hope we all come up smelling of roses. Weekend Premier League fixtures Tonight Wolves v Leicester City Saturday Southampton v Burnley Norwich City v Liverpool Sunday Aston Villa v Tottenham Arsenal v Newcastle Monday Chelsea v Manchester United",

GDP growth stagnated at 0% in the fourth quarter of 2019 after its struggling export-oriented industry came under pressure from trade tensions, changes in the auto industry and a slowing European economy. Germany was also hit by a slowdown in consumer and government spending over the three months, according to the official statistics body Destatis. The euro dipped to \u20ac1.0828, its weakest levels since May 2017, after the growth figures were published. Growth in the eurozone overall slowed to 0.1% in the final quarter of 2019, from 0.3% in the third, in a second estimate of GDP in the single currency bloc by the statistics body Eurostat. Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at online trading firm IG, said: \u201cThe German economy has gone from being the bastion of eurozone growth to perhaps the greatest hinderance, with the industrial powerhouse continuing to suffer under the wrath of Donald Trump\u2019s combative approach to global trade.\u201d With the effects of the coronavirus yet to be felt in official data, analysts said a return to growth in an export driven economy like Germany\u2019s was unlikely happen in the short term. Destatis said there was better news from the third quarter, where growth figures were higher than previously estimated at 0.2% rather than 0.1%. Germany\u2019s annual growth rate in 2019 slowed to 0.6%, the weakest since 2013. Government officials said the economy \u201cremains in a weak phase,\u201d following \u201cvery weak\u201d industrial production and a drop in incoming orders for manufacturing firms towards the end of the year. Industry continues to suffer, with production shrinking sharply in December, Destatis data showed.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe need to know more about these figures, including the time period and circumstances in which the health workers became sick.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the same day, Egypt reported a case, making it the first country in Africa to do so. The country\u2019s health ministry said the affected person was a foreigner who had been put into isolation at hospital, adding that the WHO had been immediately informed and that all necessary preventative measures had been taken. It did not give the nationality of the affected person or any other details.</p> \n<p>Earlier this month the WHO said it was particularly concerned about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/12/african-countries-braced-for-inevitable-arrival-of-coronavirus\">high-risk nations with weaker health systems</a> that may lack the facilities to identify cases.</p> \n<p>Doctors and nurses in China are having to adopt makeshift measures to try to protect themselves in the face of dire shortages of protective gowns, gloves and masks, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/world/asia/china-coronavirus-doctors.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">according to the New York Times</a>. Eyewitnesses told of health professionals patching up damaged protective masks with tape and reusing goggles meant to be used once and thrown away. They are wrapping their shoes in plastic bags because they have no protective covers for them.</p> \n<p>Some have used their own money to buy protective gear if they could find it for sale, or begged from friends. Others told of avoiding eating and drinking for long stretches because going to the toilet meant removing and discarding safety gowns<strong> </strong>that they would not be able to replace.</p> \n<p>Tedros pointed out that the WHO had disseminated its guidelines for protecting health workers to China and other countries with Covid-19 cases, but the critical problem in coronavirus-hit Chinese hospitals appears to be obtaining protective gear.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said that it would send 3.5 tonnes of medical protective equipment to Wuhan Jinyintan hospital\u2014 one of the hospitals at the forefront of treating patients with the virus.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/feb/04/daily-life-in-wuhan-during-the-coronavirus-lockdown-in-pictures\">lockdown in China</a>\u2019s cities is intended to stop the virus travelling but has impeded the production and delivery of essential supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) and masks and glove, while donations have not always got through to where they are most needed.</p> \n<p>WHO is already seeking more information from the Chinese government about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/13/huge-rise-coronavirus-cases-raises-doubts-scale-epidemic-china\">change in the way doctors are now diagnosing</a> Covid-19, which led to a big surge in diagnoses numbers on Thursday. An extra 15,000 cases were reported from the centre of the outbreak, Hubei province, who had all been diagnosed by a CT scan of their lungs and not a lab test.</p> \n<p>On Saturday the National Health Commission announced the total number of cases in China stood at 66,492. Deaths from the virus stood at 1,523. The total cases included lab-confirmed Covid-19 and clinically diagnosed cases by doctors. Tedros said they needed to know doctors were not misdiagnosing other infections as the coronavirus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7181c82d-f06e-481e-9368-c70de70396ce\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aerq4byr7ps?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWhile it is not uncommon in outbreaks for clinical definitions to change over time as more information becomes available, we are seeking further clarification on how the clinical diagnosis is being made, to ensure that other respiratory illnesses including influenza are not getting mixed into the Covid-19 data,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>US experts will be part of an international team that will arrive in China at the weekend to hold talks with their counterparts, the WHO said. The confirmation followed calls from a senior White House official for Beijing to be more transparent over its handling of the outbreak and its change in the reported data, as Chinese authorities expanded \u201cwartime\u201d measures to limit its spread.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re a little disappointed in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/coronavirus-china-not-being-honest-says-us-as-wartime-measures-widened\">lack of transparency</a> coming from the Chinese,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, the director of the US National Economic Council.</p> \n<p>China\u2019s national health commission\u2019s vice-director, Zeng Yixina, confirmed that more than 1,700 Chinese medical workers had been infected and six had died, adding that the commission was \u201chighly concerned about this issue\u201d and had issued guidelines for the prevention and control of infection within medical institutions.</p> \n<p>Healthcare workers accounted for about 3.8% of confirmed cases as of three days ago, Zeng said. </p> \n<p>The death toll stands at 1,383.

      "bodyText": "The World Health Organization is seeking more information from China about the large numbers of health workers falling sick because of the coronavirus after it was revealed 1,760 of them have tested positive and six have died. This is the first time China has included the specific numbers for healthcare professionals in the data it has provided on the spread of the epidemic. \u201cThis is a critical piece of information because health workers are the glue that holds the health system and the outbreak response together,\u201d said the WHO\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cWe need to know more about these figures, including the time period and circumstances in which the health workers became sick.\u201d On the same day, Egypt reported a case, making it the first country in Africa to do so. The country\u2019s health ministry said the affected person was a foreigner who had been put into isolation at hospital, adding that the WHO had been immediately informed and that all necessary preventative measures had been taken. It did not give the nationality of the affected person or any other details. Earlier this month the WHO said it was particularly concerned about high-risk nations with weaker health systems that may lack the facilities to identify cases. Doctors and nurses in China are having to adopt makeshift measures to try to protect themselves in the face of dire shortages of protective gowns, gloves and masks, according to the New York Times. Eyewitnesses told of health professionals patching up damaged protective masks with tape and reusing goggles meant to be used once and thrown away. They are wrapping their shoes in plastic bags because they have no protective covers for them. Some have used their own money to buy protective gear if they could find it for sale, or begged from friends. Others told of avoiding eating and drinking for long stretches because going to the toilet meant removing and discarding safety gowns that they would not be able to replace. Tedros pointed out that the WHO had disseminated its guidelines for protecting health workers to China and other countries with Covid-19 cases, but the critical problem in coronavirus-hit Chinese hospitals appears to be obtaining protective gear. On Friday, Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said that it would send 3.5 tonnes of medical protective equipment to Wuhan Jinyintan hospital\u2014 one of the hospitals at the forefront of treating patients with the virus. The lockdown in China\u2019s cities is intended to stop the virus travelling but has impeded the production and delivery of essential supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) and masks and glove, while donations have not always got through to where they are most needed. WHO is already seeking more information from the Chinese government about the change in the way doctors are now diagnosing Covid-19, which led to a big surge in diagnoses numbers on Thursday. An extra 15,000 cases were reported from the centre of the outbreak, Hubei province, who had all been diagnosed by a CT scan of their lungs and not a lab test. On Saturday the National Health Commission announced the total number of cases in China stood at 66,492. Deaths from the virus stood at 1,523. The total cases included lab-confirmed Covid-19 and clinically diagnosed cases by doctors. Tedros said they needed to know doctors were not misdiagnosing other infections as the coronavirus. \u201cWhile it is not uncommon in outbreaks for clinical definitions to change over time as more information becomes available, we are seeking further clarification on how the clinical diagnosis is being made, to ensure that other respiratory illnesses including influenza are not getting mixed into the Covid-19 data,\u201d he said. US experts will be part of an international team that will arrive in China at the weekend to hold talks with their counterparts, the WHO said. The confirmation followed calls from a senior White House official for Beijing to be more transparent over its handling of the outbreak and its change in the reported data, as Chinese authorities expanded \u201cwartime\u201d measures to limit its spread. \u201cWe\u2019re a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, the director of the US National Economic Council. China\u2019s national health commission\u2019s vice-director, Zeng Yixina, confirmed that more than 1,700 Chinese medical workers had been infected and six had died, adding that the commission was \u201chighly concerned about this issue\u201d and had issued guidelines for the prevention and control of infection within medical institutions. Healthcare workers accounted for about 3.8% of confirmed cases as of three days ago, Zeng said. The death toll stands at 1,383. Three deaths were outside of mainland China: in Hong Kong, Japan and the Philippines. Singapore confirmed nine new cases on Friday, bringing its total to 67, while in Japan, the health ministry said 11 elderly passengers on the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess were allowed to leave the vessel after they tested negative. While public health experts have greeted the change in reporting positively, others say it raises more questions about the data. The change in diagnostic criteria has been applied only to Hubei province. \u201cIs the politburo really being honest with us?\u201d Kudlow asked, referring to communist China\u2019s top leadership body. Kudlow said President Xi Jinping had assured Donald Trump that Beijing would accept US help, but \u201cthey won\u2019t let us\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know what their motives are. I do know that apparently more and more people are suffering over there,\u201d he said. At a meeting of senior leaders in Beijing on Thursday, officials called for other areas to \u201cadopt quarantine and rescue measures equal to that of Wuhan\u201d, which has been under lockdown for the past three weeks. The meeting, chaired by the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, called on Wuhan to speed up classifying and quarantining residents suspected or confirmed of contracting the virus. In Huanggang, one of the worst-hit areas outside of Wuhan with more than 2,000 cases and at least 59 deaths, authorities issued emergency measures for 14 days, \u201cfully sealing\u201d all residential areas and banning vehicles, except those for emergency, medical or official purposes. Checkpoints would be set up and public security deployed to enforce the measures.

      "bodyText": "More than 200 people, including several MPs, have been contacted by health officials over fears they could have been exposed to the coronavirus at a conference in central London. Public Health England (PHE) wrote to those who were at the UK Bus Summit at the QEII Centre in Westminster on 6 February after it emerged one of the delegates had tested positive. \u201cOne of our main priorities has been to identify any people who we think have been in close contact with confirmed cases of Covid-19 to provide public health advice, as they may be at slightly increased risk of catching the virus,\u201d said Dr Yimmy Chow, a consultant in health protection at PHE. \u201cWhile the degree of contact conference delegates may have had with the case is unlikely to have been significant, we have taken a precautionary approach and informed them of the situation.\u201d Two of the MPs who attended the conference said they have decided to stay at home after health officials advised people who may be suffering to self-isolate. Lilian Greenwood and Alex Sobel, the Labour MPs for Nottingham South and Leeds North West, both said they were feeling well but had decided to cancel appointments, in line with health officials\u2019 advice. The Transport Times bus summit is an annual event, but one that attracted more enthusiastic delegates this year to the heart of Westminster after major political parties raised buses up their agenda. Before and during the day-long conference, about 250 delegates mingled over refreshments among exhibits in the small adjoining Cambridge Room. As well as transport minister Lady Vere and senior civil servants, delegates came from across the UK, including from Transport Scotland, Transport for London, major bus and rail operators, manufacturers, councils and thinktanks. A sizeable delegation came from Lagos and there were representatives from Heathrow airport and MacMillan Cancer Support, whose service users are most at risk from the virus. The news comes amid growing concerns about the spread of the virus within the UK. As of Friday, a total of 2,964 people have been tested in the country, of which 2,955 were confirmed negative and nine positive. In China, where the virus originated, the number of deaths from coronavirus has reached 1,523, with more than 66,000 recorded infections, in figures announced early on Friday morning. It also emerged on Friday that a Channel 4 employee was among those being tested for coronavirus after feeling unwell following a trip to Asia. A Channel 4 spokesman said: \u201cAs a precautionary measure, they decided to seek medical advice and, in line with the latest public health advice regarding the coronavirus, they were taken to hospital for a precautionary test.\u201d Later the same evening, Facebook said it was cancelling its global marketing summit, which was due to take place in San Francisco next month, because of coronavirus concerns. As many as eight flights at Heathrow airport were said to have been caught up in delays or checks as a result of government health officials responding to coronavirus-related concerns over passengers feeling unwell. United Airlines confirmed that staff in London had been providing assistance to a flight from San Francisco which had landed at Heathrow following reports of an individual becoming unwell onboard. A man who had been on the flight said a passenger had been taken to the back of the plane ahead of the arrival of health officials before passengers were allowed to disembark after half an hour. \u201cThere was an initial announcement that someone had taken ill and would be taken off,\u201d said Andy West, a public relations executive at Hotwire, said. \u201cShortly afterwards he said that there was a suspected case of coronavirus and that the passenger had been isolated at the back of the plane.\u201d West said the pilot had said that there were seven other planes at Heathrow experiencing similar issues, including a number in front of it on the tarmac which were due to be visited. After disembarking, passengers were asked to complete a form and were questioned about their recent travel history and symptoms. \u201cThere was no sharp intake of breath when the pilot made the second announcement but I think that a lot of people, including myself, were a bit anxious and probably worried. I really hope the person doesn\u2019t have it and that if we don\u2019t hear anything then no news will be good news,\u201d he said. The United Airlines flight which was affected was United flight 901, according to the US airline. Heathrow airport, which was unable to say how many flights had been affected, said that the airport was operating as normal. It added that PHE were managing Coronavirus-related issues on the ground, which may require some aircrafts to be slightly held up when disembarking. A Heathrow spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working closely with Public Health England officials to facilitate their access to the airport so that they can implement their enhanced monitoring measures as a precaution. \u201cIn line with the latest Public Health England advice, we are encouraging passengers and colleagues to maintain good hand hygiene and report any suspected symptoms to NHS 111.\u201d PHE said it was not commenting on individual situations and activities at airports but added that it was carrying out \u201cenhanced monitoring\u201d of direct flights from China, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Macau. This is in addition to the usual public health response to someone becoming unwell on a plane from any destination. Enhanced monitoring includes early warning by a pilot of any passenger illness as soon as possible and formal assurance by the captain on the health of passengers prior to disembarkation. Virgin Atlantic said it had not been affected by the reports at Heathrow on Friday. British Airways, the airline with the largest number of flights using the airport, was also approached for comment.",

Since the last serious outbreak, of swine flu in 2009, most hospitals have had pandemic plans in place which aim to allow them to function normally while dealing with an increased number of highly infectious patients.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhat everyone is worried about is 1918 \u2013 Spanish flu. Fifty million deaths in a flu season. That was over 100,000 deaths a day.\u201d Prof Mark Walker, the director of the Australian Infectious Disease Research Centre at the University of Queensland, says Australia has had to respond to the novel coronavirus outbreak by imagining the worst that might happen. \u201cThat\u2019s the perspective. Right at the start of an outbreak, you can\u2019t predict which way it\u2019s going to go, and that\u2019s why there has been such a strong response.\u201d Barely a month after the first recorded death from what is now known as Covid-19, about 1,500 people have died, almost all in the Chinese city of Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. Flight routes have been shut down, travel bans issued, thousands of people evacuated and quarantined. As the World Health Organization\u2019s director general calls on countries to act quickly to prevent the spark of the disease \u201cbecoming a bigger fire\u201d, leading epidemiologists say Australia\u2019s response has been robust, but not perfect. In Australia, the number of cases remains steady at 15, with five people having recovered and 10 stable. The Australian government has enacted a range of measures, advising residents to avoid travel to China, evacuating Australians from Wuhan to quarantine facilities on Christmas Island and outside Darwin, and banning arrivals from China of non-citizens and permanent residents \u2013 on Thursday Scott Morrison announced a week-long extension of the initial two-week ban. Wuhan itself is in lockdown. Recent figures coming out of China have caused confusion about the number of cases, but it will be months before the trajectory of the virus is properly understood, epidemiologists say. Current evidence suggests coronavirus has a mortality rate between 2% and 2.5%, compared with well below 1% for regular flu. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard making decisions in the absence of much evidence,\u201d says Prof Allen Cheng, the incoming president of the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be saying \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be anything\u2019, and then it turns out to be worse than you think.\u201d While researchers in Australia and globally have been mobilised to try to understand, treat and vaccinate against the virus, epidemiologists say it is the magnitude of uncertainty around the virus\u2019s components and behaviour which has prompted extreme caution on the part of national public health agencies. \u201cThe problem is you don\u2019t know, so it\u2019s best to prepare for the worst,\u201d Walker says. Australia\u2019s preparation \u2018a bit clunky\u2019 Measures to deal with \u201cthe worst\u201d are canvassed as part of the Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza, from vaccines and antiviral medication \u2013 which yet do not exist for Covid-19 \u2013 to border measures. Should current containment measures no longer be effective and the virus spreads more widely, the government will consider \u201csocial distancing\u201d, which means cancelling large public events, encouraging people to work from home if possible, and closing down schools if it appears children are susceptible to the virus. Public health messaging about basic measures such as hand hygiene would also be amplified. The plan also involves continuity preparation for businesses and hospital pandemic planning. Since the last serious outbreak, of swine flu in 2009, most hospitals have had pandemic plans in place which aim to allow them to function normally while dealing with an increased number of highly infectious patients. As in 2009, it is likely fever clinics would be established to isolate patients presenting with symptoms, and wards or spaces identified to hold those with the virus. \u201cMost hospitals are fairly stretched at the best of times in the middle of winter,\u201d Cheng says. But elective surgeries may be deferred in order to free up beds. \u201cIntensive care is probably the pressure point,\u201d he says. Australia\u2019s preparation is in line with best practice, Cheng says, but the situation in Hubei province would test any government. Australia last ran a national simulation exercise for pandemic flu, testing the system\u2019s preparedness, in 2006. Cheng says the current system is working, but \u201cit\u2019s just a bit clunky. It could work better.\u201d Rather than drawing on a network of different committees and bodies, as the pandemic plan does, he says a permanent centre for disease control would be more efficient. \u201cWe don\u2019t need one tomorrow. This is for the next one, and it\u2019ll be something to review when we\u2019re done with this virus,\u201d he says. Christmas Island choice \u2018draconian\u2019 The Australian Medical Association has praised the national response so far, saying Australia has been prepared and acted in accordance with international best practice, although it criticised the choice of remote Christmas Island as a quarantine facility, noting specialist teams had to be flown to the island. Prof Catherine Bennett, the chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, says the isolation on Christmas Island or the mining accommodation in Darwin \u201cappears almost draconian \u2026 but that\u2019s the extra step of caution that\u2019s protecting a lot of people, including healthcare workers\u201d. She says there are limited places where people can go for quarantine, and without those facilities it would be harder for people to return home at all. Outside China, she says, \u201cwe have the opportunity to try to get the gate closed, pick up any cases that come through by screening people and putting them into these 14-day holding periods to make sure they\u2019re OK, because if it gets out into the community you\u2019re chasing it, and it becomes a very difficult outbreak to manage\u201d. But Australia\u2019s federal system has meant the response has not been entirely uniform. Bennett says there have been inconsistencies between states in public messaging, specifically around who needs to self-isolate. \u201cThe more consistent the message is, the less confusing it is for people and the more likely they are to abide by it,\u201d she says. The outbreak has prompted the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases to renew its call for the establishment of a central government body to monitor and coordinate responses to public health threats such as novel virus outbreaks. \u201cThe main issue is that things are changing so quickly that some states may get ahead of others in terms of response,\u201d Cheng says. \u201cThat\u2019s always going to be a problem in a situation like this, because our knowledge keeps changing. \u201cI think in general the coordination has been reasonably good this time, but I think with the speed of changes and those sorts of things, there is a little bit of slippage.\u201d Cheng and Asid say a national body like the European Centre for Disease Control, which coordinates a Europe-wide response to emerging threats, could improve Australia\u2019s national response. Australia has a model for coordinating response to outbreaks \u2013 in food. OzFoodNet draws together food epidemiologists to monitor and respond to new threats to food security. Walker says the coordination and speed of the Australian response to disease outbreaks has vastly improved, but a centralised body for disease control could be \u201cuseful\u201d if it were backed by the states and well funded by the federal government. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to do that sort of thing on the cheap,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good wake-up call nationally.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a summary of the key points from today\u2019s coronavirus coverage as governments and health leaders continue to battle to control the spread of the disease: Africa has its first confirmed case of coronavirus after a person in Egypt tested positive for the disease, it has emerged. The person, who is not Egyptian, is in hospital isolation, the country\u2019s health ministry said. Eight Heathrow flights were delayed earlier amid coronavirus concerns. Government health officials were responding to coronavirus-related concerns over passengers feeling unwell. Two MPs who were among more than 200 attendees at a London conference alongside a delegate who has since tested positive for coronavirus have gone into self-isolation. Nearly 3,000 people in the UK have now tested negative for coronavirus, according to the government. But officials warn the number of people who have the disease in the UK \u2013 currently nine \u2013 is highly likely to rise in the coming days. More from the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan due to coronavirus, as my colleague Justin McCurry reports how passengers are spending Valentine\u2019s Day. Travellers, who have been stuck on board for nearly two weeks now, are being treated today with Californian wine and a dinner menu including \u201cCupid\u2019s avocado and shrimp\u201d, coq au vin and a \u201csurprise dessert of the day\u201d. As the boredom sets in for passengers on the luxury cruiser \u2013 which has seen more than 200 confirmed cases of the disease \u2013 individuals posted photos of their meals, tackled sudoku puzzles and played hopscotch during brief and restricted forays on to the deck. Africa has its first confirmed case of coronavirus after a person in Egypt tested positive for the disease, it has emerged. The person, who is not Egyptian, is in hospital isolation, the country\u2019s health ministry said. The ministry said it had immediately informed the World Health Organization and taken all necessary preventative measures. No other details are known yet about the individual who caught the disease. Airline passengers who have sat within two rows of a person suspected to have caught coronavirus should be quarantined, according to guidance published by the government today for transport staff. The guidance released by the Department for Transport states: \u201cAny contacts of a possible case need to be isolated or quarantined. In practice for passengers who have travelled via airplane, this will include all passengers in the 2 rows in front and behind of where the possible case was sat.\u201d Staff working on planes, trains or ships are recommended to cooperate with emergency medical services at airports or ports if a passenger becomes symptomatic on board. Meanwhile, transport staff should not wear face masks but instead stick to good hygiene to avoid the risk of coronavirus, according to the guidance. It advises staff not to wear masks as \u201cthey do not provide protection from respiratory viruses\u201d. Instead, the best way of reducing risk is \u201cgood hygiene\u201d and to avoid getting within two metres with a potentially infected person. The World Health Organization (WHO) will join forces with China to start its investigation into the coronavirus outbreak in the country this weekend, the organisation\u2019s director has announced. The joint-mission will probe how the disease is spreading and its severity, seeking more precise details on the circumstances surrounding how more than 1,700 health workers have been infected. \u201cWe expect the full team to touch down over the weekend,\u201d WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. \u201cParticular attention will be paid to understanding transmission of the virus, the severity of disease and the impact of ongoing response measures.\u201d A British man stuck with his wife onboard a cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan because of the coronavirus outbreak has criticised Boris Johnson and appealed to billionaire Richard Branson to save them. David Abel, who is on the Diamond Princess ship with his wife Sally where more than 200 people have been diagnosed with the disease, said despite being a \u201cstaunch Tory\u201d he had \u201cno confidence\u201d in the prime minister. Abel said: \u201cWhen he [Johnson] just says \u2018keep calm, don\u2019t panic\u2019 - I\u2019d like to see you in this situation, mate. I really would.\u201d In a Facebook live video, he also appealed for Virgin boss Branson to charter a plane to fly all British nationals on the ship home to carry out their quarantine. He appealed directly to Branson, saying: \u201cIf you and your family were in this situation, what would you do? And please don\u2019t say \u2018chill out, stay calm\u2019, that\u2019s not what we want to hear. I\u2019m asking, what would it cost to hire one of your smaller planes, put all the Brits onboard, no flight attendants, packaged food? Take us to Brize Norton, take us straight into the medical facility and let us do our quarantine there by people who can speak our language.\u201d Abel added: \u201cI\u2019m serious, Richard Branson, absolutely serious. I think he is the man, he\u2019s not afraid to speak his mind. He\u2019s the guy who could resolve this for the Brits.\u201d He continued: \u201cWhatever the cost, we will somehow find a way of paying for that plane. Don\u2019t know how but we wouldn\u2019t want you to be out of pocket on that. But this is just how damned desperate some of the passengers are becoming.\u201d The couple said previously that they had declined the offer to leave the ship and continue their quarantine ashore if they test negative for the virus. The vessel was quarantined when it arrived in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, at the start of the month after it emerged that a passenger who had disembarked in Hong Kong in late January had tested positive for the disease. As many as eight flights at Heathrow Airport were said to have been caught up in delays or checks as a result of government health officials responding to coronavirus-related concerns over passengers feeling unwell. United Airlines confirmed that staff in London had been providing assistance to a flight from San Francisco which had landed at Heathrow following reports of an individual becoming unwell onboard. A man who had been on the flight said a passenger had been taken to the back of the plane ahead of the arrival of health officials before passengers were allowed to disembark after half-an-hour. \u201cThere was an initial announcement that someone had taken ill and would be taken off,\u201d said Andy West, a public relations executive at Hotwire, told the Guardian. \u201cShortly afterwards he said that there was a suspected case of coronavirus and that the passenger had been isolated at the back of the plane.\u201d Alex Sobel, one of two MPs who has gone into self-isolation over a virus scare, called on the government to do more to track down those who may have come into contact with those with coronavirus. Speaking to Sky News, the Labour MP revealed he found out through media reports that he was at the same event \u2013 a Bus Summit \u2013 as someone who has since been tested positive for coronavirus. He said: I hope the government do properly put the resources into public health and tracking people. I found out through the media. I do think there needs to be a stepping of the resource and support for this, because it has got the potential to be a pandemic.\u201d Sobel said he was not on the official list of delegates at the 6 February event but he did attend a fringe event outside the QEII Centre at which several buses were on show. He said he has since been in contact with Public Health England which is trying to track everyone at the event. Public Health England gave the advice that I should take reasonable precautions. Right now I should be at surgeries with constituents. We thought it a reasonable caution to self isolate until next Wednesday evening. I\u2019m still at the office as it all blew up this morning. I\u2019m in the end meeting room in the office away from everybody else. Once I\u2019ve finished all these media reviews, I\u2019ll be going home, and then I\u2019ll be isolating myself. Like most MPs I\u2019ve got a pile of things to do, things to read, things to write, Netflix to watch, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine. It is obviously much more important that I isolate myself in case I am a risk than being a bit bored or being a little bit stir crazy The advice that we\u2019ve been given is that as long you feel well, then you can carry on as normal. Because myself and Lilian another MP, come into contact with a lot of people ... we\u2019ve taken this additional precautions.I\u2019m not showing any symptoms. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve got no fever. I\u2019ve got no flu-like symptoms. I\u2019ve gotten to respiratory issues. But as you can present after up to 14 days, I\u2019ve taken these precautionary measures.\u201d Professional golf tournaments in China and Malaysia have both been postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak, organisers have announced. The Volvo China Open, in Shenzhen, and the Maybank Championship, in Kuala Lumpur were due to take place in April. Organisers are looking at rescheduling the tournaments for later this year. Keith Pelley, Chief Executive of the European Tour, said: The well-being of our players, spectators and staff is always our absolute priority. While it is therefore regrettable that the Maybank Championship and Volvo China Open have been postponed, we feel this is the correct course of action at this time. We are currently investigating alternative dates for both events.\u201d Datuk Abdul Farid Alias, Group President &amp; CEO of Maybank, said: The decision to postpone the Maybank Championship was made after intense deliberation and careful consideration in the interest of all the players, visitors, working teams and partners. The postponement of the Maybank Championship was not an easy decision to make, however, the safety of all stakeholders takes precedence, and we want to ensure that any risk of possible exposure to Covid-19 is mitigated. We will monitor the situation and work closely with the European &amp; Asian Tours, as well as our other partners, as we plan for our return in the future.\u201d Here\u2019s a dispatch from the opening day of London fashion week by my colleague Hannah Marriott, who reports that the coronavirus outbreak has dealt a blow to the numbers in attendance. The majority of press and buyers from China, which is responsible for a third of global luxury sales, are not at the five-day event, she reports. The British Fashion Council\u2019s chief executive, Caroline Rush, has announced that heightened hygiene measures are in place at the central London venue on the Strand, with a \u201cdeep clean\u201d each night and antibacterial hand sanitisers handed out. Two MPs who went to a London conference alongside a delegate who has since tested positive for coronavirus are among more than 200 attendees who have been contacted by health officials. A letter has been sent by Public Health England (PHE) to those who went to the UK Bus Summit at the QEII Centre in Westminster on February 6. The attendee who has caught the disease is among nine people diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK. Dr Yimmy Chow, consultant in health protection at PHE, said: One of our main priorities has been to identify any people who we think have been in close contact with confirmed cases of Covid-19 to provide public health advice, as they may be at slightly increased risk of catching the virus. While the degree of contact conference delegates may have had with the case is unlikely to have been significant, we have taken a precautionary approach and informed them of the situation.\u201d People trapped in Wuhan have been volunteering and checking in on the animals whose owners are stuck outside the city. A second MP who was speaking at the Bus Summit attended by someone who has since tested positive for coronavirus has also gone into self-isolation. Lilian Greenwood, the MP for Nottingham South, joined her Labour colleague Alex Sobel in cancelling her engagements until next week as a precaution (see earlier) In a Twitter post, Greenwood shared a letter from Public Health England which has been trying to contact all those who attended the conference last week at London\u2019s QEII Centre. It advise that if she develops symptoms she should \u201cstay indoors and avoid contact with other people\u201d. Nearly 3,000 people in the UK have now tested negative for coronavirus, according to the latest daily update from the Department of Health and Social Care. Of the 2,964 tests conducted in the UK, those who have tested positive still stands at nine. But officials have said it highly likely there will be more in the coming days. A Labour MP has cancelled all his engagements after admitting that he was one of 200 delegates at a summit attended by someone who has since tested positive for the virus. Alex Sobel, the MP for Leeds north west, said he attended the Bus Summit in central London on 6 February. Public Health England has been trying contacted everyone who came into close contact with someone who has since tested positive for coronavirus, including fellow attendees at the Bus Summit (see earlier). Sobel said he had been informed he was \u201cvery low risk\u201d but cancelled engagements until next Thursday as a precaution and is waiting to be assessed. A spokesman for Sobel said he was not unwell and had no symptoms, but had decided to self-isolate at home until next week as a precaution. Taiwan has accused China of dragging its feet over the evacuation of citizens stranded in the province at the centre of the outbreak, in the latest spat between the two neighbours, AFP reports. Multiple countries have successfully arranged evacuation flights for nationals stuck in Hubei province where the epidemic is at its most intense and deadly. But nearly 1,000 Taiwanese have been waiting for the best part of two weeks for a flight out. On Wednesday, Chinese state media quoted local officials accusing Taiwan\u2019s government of \u201crepeatedly delaying\u201d their return. The reports said \u201cpolitical manipulation\u201d was behind the delay but gave no concrete details. For days Taiwanese officials gave few clues on what was behind the hold up as officials tried to broker an agreement behind the scenes. But on Friday health minister Chen Shih-chung ended that silence, saying Beijing had \u201crefused to cooperate\u201d. \u201cThe Chinese side has used all kinds of reasons to stall and refused our plans and recommendations. We deeply regret this,\u201d he told reporters. Taiwanese stuck in Wuhan said they have no idea what was causing the delays. \u201cMost people who are still in Wuhan and Hubei are very anxious and worried and we want to go back to Taiwan,\u201d Hsiao Yung-jui, head of the Wuhan Taiwan Enterprises Association, told AFP. Here\u2019s a summary of events so far today: A senior White House official has called on Beijing to be more transparent over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cWe are a little disappointed that we haven\u2019t been invited in and we\u2019re a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, the director of the US National Economic Council. One of the people diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK attended a central London conference last week with more than 200 delegates. Public Health England is trying to identify anyone who had close contact with the unnamed individual, including those who attended the UK Bus Summit at the QEII Centre on 6 February. A Channel 4 employee was taken to hospital to be tested for coronavirus on Thursday after being met at the channel\u2019s London headquarters by health officials in protective clothing. The person is understood to have been on holiday recently in China in the last month and had some concerns about feeling unwell. China has reported another 121 deaths from the virus taking death toll in mainland China to 1,380. The lates figures remove 108 deaths from a previously issued count due to double-counting. The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China rose to 63,851, a rise of 5,090 new cases. Six healthcare workers are among those who have died from the virus, Chinese health officials have disclosed. They were among 1,716 healthcare workers who have been infected. In Cambodia, more than 2,000 passengers and crew of the Westerdam cruise ship finally disembarked, after passengers were cleared of the virus. The ship had been refused entry to five different countries. A cruise ship, docked in Sydney, was also given the all clear after a person tested negative for the virus. Japan recorded its first death from the new coronavirus. It is the third coronavirus fatality outside mainland China. A Harvard academic has defended research suggesting a possible underreporting of coronavirus cases in Indonesia, following fierce criticism from the health minister in the world\u2019s most fourth most populous country, which insists it has no cases. Professor Marc Lipsitch analysed air traffic out of the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak in China and suggested in a report last week that Indonesia might have missed cases. On Tuesday the Indonesian health minister Terawan Agus Putranto called the report \u201cinsulting\u201d and said the country had proper testing equipment. On Thursday, health officials in Indonesia, which has a population of 272 million and is a popular destination for Chinese tourists, said they were retracing the movements of a Chinese tourist who was diagnosed with coronavirus upon his return from Bali. No-one in Bali has yet been found with symptoms. Hong Kong will give handouts worth HK$25 billion (\u00a32.4m) to hospitals and businesses in a bid to revive the city\u2019s ailing economy which has been hit by the coronavirus outbreak. Announcing the relief package earlier, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the government would give HK$4.7 billion (\u00a3460m) to the Hospital Authority, as well as other one-off payments to businesses \u2013 including restaurants and travel agents \u2013 hurt by the spread of the disease. It comes after Lam has been under fire, accused of mishandling the crisis, with figures showing Hong Kong has 56 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with one reported death. \u201cMy biggest concern now is really for us to overcome this public health crisis together so that we could then focus on re-launching Hong Kong and rebuilding Hong Kong\u2019s economic strength,\u201d Lam said. The package will need to be approved by the city\u2019s Legislative Council, Reuters reports. Travel restrictions have hampered the city\u2019s economic prospects. Hong Kong\u2019s economy contracted for the first time in a decade last year as the city has seen months of anti-government protests. One of the latest coronavirus scares was on a United Airlines flight from San Francisco to Heathrow. In a statement the airline said: \u201cOur team at London Heathrow Airport is providing assistance related to United flight 901 (San Francisco-London Heathrow) today, following reports of an individual becoming unwell onboard. \u201cThe safety of our customers and employees is our highest priority and we continue to work closely with local authorities.\u201d North Korea is one of several countries with close ties to China which has not formally reported any coronavirus cases, but may already be battling the disease. Officials there are clearly extremely worried about the danger of an outbreak, and have have effectively put the entire country into quarantine to try and prevent one, sealing the borders and stopping all international trains and flights. Despite these precautions, there have been reports of cases in the north, and in the capital Pyongyang, said Jiro Ishimaru, the head of Osaka-based Asia Press, who runs a secret network of citizen journalists inside North Korea. Speaking to the Guardian\u2019s Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry, Ishimaru said: \u201cThere are lots of rumours flying around that some people have been infected near Dandong, just on the Chinese side of the border, and Rason special economic zone (on the North Korean side),\u201d \u201cI have heard from our contacts that some people in Rason have been put in isolation for 20-30 days to prevent an outbreak. There is an unconfirmed report that one man in isolation was arrested and shot after he escaped.\u201d The US state department has said it would \u201csupport and encourage\u201d international efforts to help North Korea fight the disease, despite stringent sanctions on the country because of its nuclear weapons programme. \u201cThe United States is deeply concerned about the vulnerability of the North Korean people to a coronavirus outbreak,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement, adding that they would back the work of both American and international aid and health groups. \u201cThe United States is ready and prepared to expeditiously facilitate the approval of assistance from these organisations,\u201d she added. North Korea has only a rudimentary health system and in a bid to ward off the disease the government has tried to seal off the population from the rest of the world. It has suspended international tourism, cancelled international flights and cross border trains, summoned officials back from abroad and sent home some South Koreans posted to a \u201cliaison office\u201d. Pyongyang has also closed the land border with China, normally a somewhat porous frontier that people and goods are smuggled across in both directions. The border closure has already had a dramatic impact on the economy, which is spreading news of the disease in a society where state media offer little reliable information. \u201cGiven the North\u2019s huge dependence on China for things like food, cooking oil and gasoline, there are shortages of daily necessities. People are asking why that is happening, and that\u2019s how they heard about the coronavirus,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThe authorities can deny that the coronavirus has reached North Korea, but inflation and shortages are a fact of life.\u201d Another cause for concern has been the apparent disappearance from public life of leader Kim Jong-un. This Sunday is his father\u2019s birthday, when he would be expected to pay his respects to Kim Jong-il, the country\u2019s previous ruler, at a mausoleum in Pyongyang. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t do that on Sunday or Monday, then it might be a sign that he is concerned about the coronavirus,\u201d Ishimaru said. Vietnam has turned away a German-owned cruise ship with more than 1,000 passengers on board over fears of coronavirus infections on board, Reuters reports citing state media. Authorities in Quang Ninh province, home to the Unesco world heritage site Ha Long Bay, decided on Tuesday not to allow passengers of the ship AIDAvita to disembark on Thursday, the official Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported. \u201cThe vessel has docked in the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore, which have all reported coronavirus cases,\u201d VNA said. \u201cNot allowing AIDIvita\u2019s passengers to disembark is just a temporary solution to prevent the intrusion of diseases,\u201d VNA cited a local official as saying. Germany\u2019s AIDA Cruises, the owner of the AIDAvita, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The cruise liner left the Philippines port of Coron on 10 February bound for Vietnam via the South China Sea, according to data published by the Marine Traffic ship tracking website. It had been scheduled to visit Ha Long Bay, in northern Vietnam, on Saturday, then proceed to the Vietnamese ports of Da Nang, Nha Trang and Ho Chi Minh City from Feb. 16-20, according to CruiseMapper, a website which tracks cruise ships. The AIDAvita was 176 km (109 miles) south of the Thai capital Bangkok, according to Marine Traffic. The virus\u2019 impact on global travel was clear to see on a flight from Sydney to Hong Kong. Belfast born ex BBC journalist Letitia Maria Fitzpatrick posted this image on board her flight to Hong Kong on her long haul way back to Europe. The Australian based Belfast woman said the planes she normally takes back to see loved ones at home is full to its 270 capacity. This one had just 70 passengers on board. Catering staff on the quarantined Diamond Princess where more than 200 people have been diagnosed with the virus have recorded a dance video intended to raise spirits on cruise ship. This ship, which is docked in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, will remain quarantined until at least 19 February. Older passengers and those with chronic health conditions not connected to the virus have been allowed to leave. Here\u2019s footage from Sihanoukville in Cambodia today, as 1,455 passengers and 802 crew were finally allowed to disembark from the Westerdam cruise ship. The ship had been refused port by five countries over Covid-19 fears, but tests by Cambodian doctors said no passengers had the new virus. Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen greeted the passengers with roses as they left the ship. A Channel 4 employee was taken to hospital to be tested for coronavirus on Thursday after being met at the channel\u2019s London headquarters by health officials in protective clothing, it has emerged. The person is understood to have been on holiday recently in China in the last month and had some concerns about feeling unwell. They are not a journalist and had not been to Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak. The person, who works at the Channel 4\u2019s office in Horseferry Road, London, has now returned home and are expected to get their test results in the coming days. They are understood to have had a light cough and had not been displaying any more than one symptom but opted to contact health authorities as a precaution. A Channel 4 spokesperson said: \u201cOn Thursday a member of staff at Channel 4 who had travelled to Asia within the last month felt unwell.\u201d \u201cAs a precautionary measure they decided to seek medical advice and, in line with the latest public health advice regarding the Coronavirus, they were taken to hospital for a precautionary test. We have informed our staff of this and continue to follow all the latest public health guidance.\u201d While there are commissioning editors at Horseferry Road, Channel 4 News is based at ITN\u2019s headquarters elsewhere in London. Singapore has reported nine new coronavirus cases \u2013 its biggest daily increase, according to the Straits Times. The new cases take Singapore\u2019s virus tally to 67. Six of the new cases are linked to the Grace Assembly of God church which is now the biggest cluster of cases in Singapore with 13 in total. Here\u2019s a picture of last week\u2019s Bus Summit at the QEII Centre which was attended by someone who has since diagnosed been with coronavirus. Transport Times, which organised the conference, said all questions about the event should be directed to Public Health England. One of the people diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK attended a central London conference with more than 200 delegates, PA reports. The person, who has not been named, attended the UK Bus Summit at the QEII Centre in Westminster on 6 February. Transport Times, the conference organiser, emailed attendees on Thursday afternoon informing them that a person confirmed to be suffering from coronavirus illness - also known as Covid-19 - had been at the event. Dr Yimmy Chow, consultant in health protection at Public Health England (PHE), said: \u201cOne of our main priorities has been to identify any people who we think have been in close contact with confirmed cases of Covid-19 to provide public health advice, as they may be at slightly increased risk of catching the virus. \u201cWhile the degree of contact conference delegates may have had with the case is unlikely to have been significant, we have taken a precautionary approach and informed them of the situation.\u201d The case is not linked to the ninth patient with coronavirus in the UK - a woman from China. The Transport Times email attached a letter from PHE saying delegates should take no action if they were well but to stay indoors, avoid contact with others and call NHS 111 if they developed symptoms such as a fever or cough. \u201cWhile the degree of contact you may have had with the case at the summit is unlikely to have been significant, we are taking a precautionary approach and informing you,\u201d the letter said, as reported by the Financial Times. The bus conference listed about 250 delegates from the nationwide bus and transport industry. It comes after a coronavirus expert warned that the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories could lead to more cases in the UK. We\u2019ve updated our coronavirus (or should that now be covid-19?) Q&amp;A: Authorities in Taiwan have put out an appeal to locate three people who travelled from Hong Kong to Taipei on February 8 and who went missing during home quarantine. Xinqi Su, an AFP correspondent in Hong Kong, has tweeted that authorities in the Taiwanese capital has publicised information about the individuals and asked the public to help search for them. A senior White House official has called on Beijing to be more transparent over its handling of the outbreak amid moves by Chinese authorities to expand \u2018wartime\u2019 measures to limit its spread. Here\u2019s footage of Larry Kudlow, the National Economic Council director, expressing US \u201cdisappointment\u201d in the response of China to the coronavirus outbreak. He said it was a concern for the wellbeing of people in China, adding that the virus had been contained in the US. Japan has vowed to step up testing and efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus after suffering its first death and finding new cases, including a doctor and at least one taxi driver, in different parts of the country. The biggest cluster of coronavirus infections outside China is linked to a cruise liner quarantined in a Japanese port, with 218 people from the ship confirmed as infected and taken off to hospital. On Friday, some of the ship\u2019s passengers were allowed to disembark - with priority given to older passengers who have been confined to windowless cabins - to complete their quarantine on shore. Japan\u2019s NHK public television network said that a female taxi driver on the southern island of Okinawa had tested positive for the virus, and the chances were high she had contact with passengers from the ship during a February 1 call at a port. \u201cWe will stay in touch with local governments and expand our testing procedures and treatment of patients in order to prevent the spread,\u201d Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters, a day after a task force on the disease drew up measures to deal with it, including spending 10.3 billion yen from budget reserves. Investors have reassessing the potential economic impact of the virus, it appears from movement in gold trading. Gold dropped off a more than one-week high on Friday as hopes for global measures to counter the coronavirus outbreak increased appetite for equities, according to Reuters. However, analysts said that interest in gold remains undimmed as the death toll in China\u2019s Hubei province continues to rise. Florists across Hong Kong say their business is down as much as 50 percent compared with last year, but masks and alcohol sanitisers have emerged as new favourite Valentine gifts for lovers, reports Verna Yu in Hong Kong for the Guardian. A survey conducted by dating agency HK Romance on 572 men and women shows that masks and alcohol sanitisers are the most wished for Valentine gifts for women this year, with 30 percent wanting those, compared with 18 percent wanting flowers, 14 percent wanting jewelry or watches and 9 percent for flights and hotel stays. For men, 32 percent want masks and alcohol sanitisers, while 19 percent don\u2019t want anything and 11 percent want electronic products. The dating agency says it plans to host classes showing people how to make DIY masks as many simply cannot get hold of them. Masks, alcoholic sanitisers, disinfectants and even toilet rolls and rice have become prized commodities in Hong Kong for days amid the coronavirus outbreak. Even public hospitals are running out of masks and protective gear, prompting widespread anxiety. The coronavirus epidemic has killed more than 1,350 in China, with one fatality in Hong Kong, while nearly 64,000 people have been infected. Amid the grim atmosphere, 31 percent of men and 32 percent of women say they will stay home this year to avoid infection while 27 percent say they will go out for dinner anyway. Concerts and events across Hong Kong have been cancelled due to the outbreak while many shops and restaurants close early. Chinese health officials have been talking about the impact of the outbreak on frontline health workers, 1,716 of whom have been infected. Six had died as of Tuesday, with the number of infected staff rising, according to the Chinese health commission vice minister, Zeng Yixin, \u201cThe duties of medical workers at the front are indeed extremely heavy; their working and resting circumstances are limited, the psychological pressures are great, and the risk of infection is high,\u201d Zeng told a news conference. Chinese officials and hospitals have repeatedly spoken of a shortage of protective equipment, including face masks. Footage earlier this month of government officials in Wuhan appearing to take face masks intended for health workers has fuelled a growing wave of anger over how Chinese authorities have handled the outbreak. Images of medical staff making protective equipment out of rubbish bags, sleeping in hospitals, and crying in frustration and exhaustion have dominated Chinese social media over the last two weeks, inspiring an outpouring of sympathy and donations of supplies. Concern about the impact on Asian financial hubs has been heightened by the news that HSBC and Royal Dutch Shell have been sending staff home in Hong Kong and Singapore after contact with people infected by the coronavirus. HSBC, which employs 21,000 people in Hong Kong, said on Friday that one of its employees has been placed in government quarantine after \u201cclose contact\u201d with relatives diagnosed with the coronavirus. The bank is also making contact with staff who may have recently come in close contact with the person and will advise them to observe 14-day self-care at home, according to the Straits Times, which referred to a memo confirmed by a Hong Kong-based spokesman. \u201cAll employees have been reminded to be mindful of hygiene procedures and to stay at home or see a doctor if they feel unwell in any way,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cHSBC will continue to closely monitor the development of case and stay in close contact with health authorities.\u201d A senior White House official has called on Beijing to be more transparent over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak as Chinese authorities expanded \u201cwartime\u201d measures to limit its spread, reports Lily Kuo is the Guardian\u2019s Beijing bureau chief Casualties from coronavirus reached nearly 1,400, with more than 5,000 new cases reported on Friday, dampening optimism that the virus will soon be contained. At a meeting of senior leaders in Beijing leading the government\u2019s response to the crisis, officials called for other areas to \u201cadopt quarantine and rescue measures equal to that of Wuhan\u201d, which has been under lockdown for more than two weeks, including centralising and quarantining patients. The meeting, held on Thursday and chaired by premier Li Keqiang called on Wuhan to \u201cspeed up\u201d classifying and quarantining residents suspected or confirmed of contracting the virus. It came as a top White House official called on Beijing to be more open. The first group of French nationals repatriated from China due to the coronavirus outbreak returned to the outside world today after two weeks in quarantine, Reuters reports. None of the 181 involved - who had been flown home from Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic - tested positive for the virus, local health officials said. \u201cThere have been no problems ...but people are happy that it\u2019s over,\u201d Marc Zyltman, Red Cross head at the southern holiday resort of Carry-Le-Rouet where they were quarantined, told reporters. A further 157 people remain in quarantine in southern France, of whom 122 will be allowed home on Feb. 16 and the remainder on Febuary 23. France has recorded 11 cases of the virus, out of a global total of 63,851, of whom the vast majority are in China. The epidemic has killed close to 1,400 people. China\u2019s public broadcasting network, CCTV, has been showing images of what it reports is \u201cthe third batch\u201d of 35 patients transferred to the Leishenshan (Thunder God Mountain) Hospital in Wuhan, one of two new hospitals built over the course of a few weeks as the official face of the country\u2019s struggle against coronavirus. Four days after its opening, this week the larger Leishenshan hospital had only 90 patients, on wards designed for 1,600, but was reporting no spare beds, Wuhan city health data, first reported by the Chinese magazine Caixin, showed. The other facility, Huoshenshan, had not yet filled its 1,000 beds a week after opening. This is Ben Quinn (@BenQuinn75) picking up the blog now in London. Reuters reports that 1,716 health workers have been infected by the coronavirus and six of them have died, as of Tuesday. China National Health Commission Vice Minister Zeng Yixin said on Friday that, at a press conference about protecting medical workers, said the number of infected medical staff is increasing. Chinese officials and hospitals have repeatedly noted a shortage of protective equipment, including face masks, as the disease took hold in Hubei and spread throughout the country. Lily Kuo has the latest from China, where wartime measures are being expanded to more cities, as a US official has questioned whether Beijing is being transparent over the outbreak. Read the full story here: So far today: The total death toll in mainland China rose to 1,380 \u2013 after 121 new deaths were recorded on Thursday, but also after 108 deaths were removed due to supposed double-counting. The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China rose to 63,851, a rise of 5,090 new cases. A cruise ship, docked in Sydney, has been given the all clear after a person tested negative for the virus. Earlier, media reports erroneously claimed the ship was in lockdown. In Cambodia, the more than 2000 passengers and crew of the Westerdam cruise ship finally disembarked, after 20 of its passengers were tested and cleared of the virus. The ship had been refused entry to five different countries. A 78-year old man and an 18-month old toddler are still among the Australian citizens still stranded in Wuhan. Japan recorded its first death from the new coronavirus, which is the third coronavirus fatality outside mainland China. It was confirmed that yesterday\u2019s large spike in recorded deaths and cases was due to China changing the methodology of confirming cases, and broadening the definition. An explanation here for shifting numbers. China\u2019s National Health Commission has said it removed 108 deaths from its national total because it made a statistical error, according to Agence France-Presse. On Friday, Hubei\u2019s health commission said an extra 116 people had died in the province overnight, and more than 4,800 new cases were reported. However, it also removed 108 deaths from the running total, saying they had been double counted. That leaves the total number of deaths so far, in mainland China, at 1,380. Three people have died outside of China: in Japan, Hong Kong and the Philippines. The number of cases and deaths was also revised upwards yesterday, when China announced it was changing its methodology for registering Covid-19 cases. Previously, the government was only counting cases that had been confirmed in a laboratory as the new coronavirus. Yesterday, they changed that to cases where a doctor observed a chest infection on a CT scan. This led to a jump of 13,300 extra cases, which go back retrospectively days or weeks. 254 new deaths were also added. Michael Ryan, the head of World Health Organisation\u2019s health emergencies programme, said this \u201cdoes not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak\u201d \u2013 because it was retrospective. Meanwhile, Larry Kudlow, the director of the US National Economic Council, said he was \u201cdisappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese\u201d. Reports here of lockdowns and quarantine measures that have begun to start in Shanghai. In broader medical news, generic drugmakers from India may face shortages and price hikes due to the knock-on effect of the Covid-19 outbreak, analysts say. Indian companies procure almost 70% of their active pharmaceutical ingredients from China, Reuters report. \u201cWe are comfortably placed with eight to 10 weeks of key inventory in place,\u201d said Debabrata Chakravorty, head of global sourcing and supply chain for Lupin Ltd, adding that the company does have some local suppliers for ingredients. An extended outbreak that limits the volume of active ingredients and drugs available for export from China could lead to drug shortages and price increases, particularly in the United States - where prices are subject to market forces - according to rating agency Moody\u2019s. India supplies nearly a third of medicines sold in the United States. Daara Patel, secretary general of the Indian Drug Manufacturers Association, which represents over 900 drug producers, said he expects supplies to be disrupted from April. Patel said vitamins and antibiotics are likely to be among the hardest hit as India is a major global producer of both. Sudarshan Jain, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance trade group, said there are no API shortages at the moment because drugmakers had stocked up on inventory ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in China, which was later extended to contain the virus. A person has been tested for the new coronavirus on a cruise ship moored in Sydney and does not have the virus, NSW Health have confirmed. Earlier this morning, media reports in other outlets incorrectly said a man had a confirmed case on board the Norwegian Jewel, which had sailed from New Zealand. NSW Health had said earlier that \u201cnone [of the passengers] had been in China in the previous 14 days and there was no outbreak of any disease on board\u201d. Three people were transferred to hospital from the cruise ship, but this was not due to Covid-19, and were in fact \u201cpre-booked by the cruise ship\u201d But NSW Health said they did test one person, but this was \u201ca precaution and \u201cthere is no indication that the person is at particular risk of Covid-19.\u201d \u201cThere is no concern for other passengers or people in and around Circular Quay,\u201d they said. Ketchup and cola factories are partially closing across China, as confirmed by the Kraft Heinz company and PepsiCo. Pepsi has closed one of its six Chinese factories ever since the Chinese New Year, but it is expected to open again soon, Bloomberg reports. But both companies say disruption will be minimal, and Kraft Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio said only 2% of its sales came from China. Some odd scenes in Sihanoukville in Cambodia today, as 1,455 passengers and 802 crew were finally allowed to disembark from the Westerdam cruise ship. The ship had been refused port by five countries over Covid-19 fears, but tests by Cambodian doctors said no passengers had the new virus. Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen greeted the passengers with roses as they left the ship. Anna Marie Melon, from Queensland, said that Hun Sen had \u201ca wonderful heart\u201d as he handed a rose to her. \u201cCambodia alone, even the United States, Guam, did not let us land, but Cambodia did, so thats wonderful,\u201d said American Joe Spaziani to Associated Press. \u201cWe appreciate it very very much. Its been a long struggle and we appreciate everyone being here.\u201d Domestically, Hun Sen has been criticised for arresting political opponents, and was described a \u201cfully fledged military dictator\u201d by Human Rights Watch. The former Khmer Rouge member has been in power for 35 years, making him the world\u2019s longest-serving prime minister. And here\u2019s some much needed explanation on why the figures and death toll have changed so rapidly recently. The big spike in confirmed cases and deaths yesterday was the result of the Chinese government changing the way it classifies new cases. Previously, the government was only counting cases that had been confirmed in a laboratory as the new coronavirus. Yesterday, they changed that to cases where a doctor observed a chest infection on a CT scan. This led to a jump of 13,300 extra cases, which go back retrospectively days or weeks. 254 new deaths were also recorded. Japan has vowed to step up testing and containment of Covid-19 after the country recorded its first death, Reuters report. On Thursday, Japan\u2019s health ministry confirmed a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture, just to the west of Tokyo, had died. \u201cWe will stay in touch with local governments and expand our testing procedures and treatment of patients in order to prevent the spread of the illness,\u201d Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters, a day after a task force on the disease drew up new measures to deal with it, including spending 10.3 billion yen from budget reserves. But chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Sugaand health minister Katsunobu Kato said there was no evidence the new coronavirus, was spreading widely in Japan. The latest national government figures are in \u2013 there have been a total of 1,380 deaths in mainland China since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak. This comes after 116 new deaths were recorded just in the Hubei province. That is a drop in the rate of new deaths and new cases, compared to yesterday. There are now a total of 55,748 confirmed cases across mainland China. Figures on the unofficial Tencent tracker are still higher than these government figures, by about 100 deaths. And more on cruises, Royal Caribbean \u2013 whose ships have not yet been hit by either a Covid-19 case or Covid-19 scare \u2013 is still cancelling 18 of its cruises. As reported by Bloomberg News, this will reduce its earnings by 65 US cents a share this year. Today so far: 116 new deaths, and 4,823 new cases were confirmed in Hubei \u2013 which is a drop in the rate of new deaths and cases. Japan recorded its first death, only the third coronavirus fatality outside mainland China. In Cambodia, the Westerdam cruise ship has been cleared of coronavirus cases by the Cambodian health ministry. 20 tests came back negative, the cruise operator said. Passengers have now started disembarking. In Sydney, NSW Health said there was no confirmed coronavirus, and no \u201coutbreak of disease\u201d on a cruise ship docked in Sydney harbour. One person is being tested for the disease as a precaution, but they had not been in China over the past 14 days. China\u2019s chicken shipments have been diverted to other countries, due to a lack of freezer space at its ports, as lockdowns lead to lower food consumption. An elderly Australian man, from Perth, has reportedly tested positive for the new coronavirus while on another cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, which has multiple confirmed cases \u2013 unlike the Westerdam and the Norwegian Jewel. His daughter told ABC radio that her father, Val, had tested positive and would be taken to hospital in Japan. The woman, Marcelly, did not give her surname to the ABC. Passengers from the Westerdam \u2013 the cruise ship denied entry to five countries \u2013 have begun disembarking in Cambodia after tests for coronavirus came back negative. China\u2019s incoming chicken shipments have also been disrupted, according to Reuters This is due to consumption slowing down due to so many cities under lock down. As a result, freezer space is running out in China\u2019s ports. Reuters report: \u201cShips carrying refrigerated cargo containers of chicken from the United States to China are being diverted to ports in Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to a U.S. poultry export trade group. \u201cChinese ports have run out of space for refrigerated containers, Jim Sumner, president of the USA Poultry &amp; Egg Export Council, told Reuters on Thursday. \u201cFrozen and refrigerated product is starting to spoil because of the lack of available power, a manager for a Los Angeles port terminal operator said.\u201d Speaking of, researchers from East Anglia University in the UK say that misinformation and conspiracy theories about on coronavirus could cost lives \u2013 because people stop following actual health advice. Further statement from Norwegian Cruise Line: \u201cDuring Norwegian Jewel\u2019s sailing from Auckland to Sydney, a few guests on board experienced a stomach-related illness. To mitigate any impact of this rare occurrence, we implemented stringent sanitation procedures. \u201cThere are various false inflammatory media reports regarding the ship...The vessel remains in operation, and all guests onboard are in good health.\u201d The official NSW Health statement is in, on the conflicting reports around a cruse ship docked in Sydney, the Norwegian Jewel. \u201cNone [of the passengers] had been in China in the previous 14 days and there was no outbreak of any disease on board,\u201d NSW Health said. \u201cThere were 3 routine medical transfers, none related to respiratory illness.\u201d However, \u201cone person has been tested for respiratory illness on board with results expected this afternoon\u201d. But NSW Health say this was \u201ca precaution and \u201cthere is no indication that the person is at particular risk of Covid-19.\u201d \u201cAt this point there is no concern for other passengers or people in and around Circular Quay.\u201d Earlier, the operator of the ship said media reports about coronavirus on board were false. \u201cThis morning there were various false media reports related to an illness on board our ship,\u201d they said. \u201cThere is absolutely no truth to this. The vessel remains in operation, and all guests onboard are in good health.\u201d The Norwegian Jewel, registered in the Bahamas, is a 15-year-old cruise ship with a capacity of nearly 2,400 passengers. It departed from Dunedin four days ago, having been sailing between ports in New Zealand. In other cruise ship news, the Westerdam \u2013 which has been turned away from five different countries over coronavirus fears \u2013 has said that 20 of its passengers have been tested and do not have the new virus. The ship has always maintained that it has no sick passengers, but was it was refused entry by multiple countries because it had been in Hong Kong two weeks ago. It was eventually allowed to dock in Cambodia. Just now, the cruise operator, Holland America Line announced: \u201c20 samples taken onboard Westerdam have all been confirmed as negative for coronavirus by the Pasteur Laboratory in Phnom Penh\u201d. \u201cAs stated in previous communications, there were never any suspected cases of coronavirus on board.\u201d The ship has 1,455 passengers and 802 crew, and Cambodian authorities have given the ship permission to disembark its passengers. \u201cWe sincerely thank all those in Cambodia who have demonstrated a willingness to welcome us with an open mind and make decisions based on facts,\u201d Stein Kruse, the CEO of Holland American Line said. \u201cThis has all been a terrible and unfortunate misunderstanding that has impacted 2,257 people on board and hundreds of others shoreside,\u201d he said. A 78-year old, former Royal Australian Air Force engineer is the latest Australian to be confirmed as still stranded in the Wuhan, as reported exclusively by myself and my colleague Ben Doherty. This comes after we revealed that an 18-month old toddler, also an Australian citizen, was still in the Hubei province, under lockdown, and had not been given a place on one of the Australian evacuation flights. The flights were supposed to prioritise the elderly, the young and the \u201cisolated and vulnerable\u201d. Now Garry Ridder has spoken to us as well, saying that when he asked if 78 qualified as old, he got \u201cno response but a quiet chuckle.\u201d Earlier, other stranded Australians said the priority process was unclear, and they felt they were being \u201cswept under the carpet\u201d. Desmond Lim, whose wife is still trapped in Wuhan, said he felt like they were being punished for following the process. \u201cThe mantra of most army units in the world is \u2018Leave no one behind\u2019,\u201d Ridder told Guardian Australia. \u201cThis is obviously not in the Australian government\u2019s playbook.\u201d The US state department has issued a statement saying it is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about North Korea\u2019s vulnerability to the new coronavirus. \u201cThe US is deeply concerned about the vulnerability of the North Korean people to a coronavirus outbreak...The US is ready and prepared to expeditiously facilitate the approval of assistance from these organisations\u201d. If you\u2019re struggling to keep up with the news on coronavirus, the fabulous team at Full Story (Guardian Australia\u2019s news podcast) has made a podcast that traces the outbreak and reviews the public health response, both in China and Australia. You can listen here: At the very end you can also hear some snippets of my interview with Moko Yong, a photographer from Melbourne who is still trapped in Wuhan, along with many other Australians. That latest figures out of China show that there has been a drop in the number of new deaths and new infections, but the toll does continue to rise. There have been 116 new deaths, and 4,823 new cases in the Hubei province, where the virus first emerged. That is a total of 51,986 cases in the province, according to Reuters. However, this is a smaller increase than yesterday, when there was a dramatic 240 new deaths and nearly 15,000 new cases. The operators of a Norwegian cruise ship docked in Sydney Harbour say there\u2019s \u201cno truth\u201d to reports of a potential coronavirus case amongst its passengers. Norwegian Cruise Line, operators of the Norwegian Jewel, said the vessel remained in operation and all the passengers were healthy. \u201cThis morning there were various false media reports related to an illness on board our ship,\u201d a Norwegian Cruise Line spokeswoman said in a statement to AAP on Friday. \u201cThere is absolutely no truth to this. The vessel remains in operation, and all guests onboard are in good health.\u201d NSW Health told AAP on Friday that while no passengers of the Norwegian Jewel cruise ship had visited mainland China in the past 14 days they were being screened for the illness for precautionary reasons. A passenger on board a cruise ship that docked in Sydney harbour Friday morning has reportedly been taken for testing for a possible case of novel coronavirus. The Singaporean national fell ill with a respiratory illness and was taken from the Norwegian Jewel shortly after it docked at the international passenger terminal at Circular Quay at 6am this morning. The man is being tested as a precaution. He has not yet been confirmed as having the virus. Other passengers have been allowed to disembark from the ship, after earlier being kept on board as a precaution. The Norwegian Jewel, registered in the Bahamas, is a 15-year-old cruise ship with a capacity of nearly 2,400 passengers. It departed from Dunedin four days ago, having been sailing between ports in New Zealand. The cruise ship operator has been contacted for comment. This is Naaman Zhou bringing you the latest coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. These are the top developments: A surge in recorded cases in China\u2019s Hubei province is caused by a new reporting method, not an increase in the severity or mortality of the disease. Japan recorded its first death, only the third coronavirus fatality outside mainland China. Meanwhile, Singapore recorded its biggest daily jump in cases, with eight new infected patients. The first British coronavirus evacuees flown back to the UK from Wuhan, China, have left quarantine, shouting \u201cwe\u2019re free\u201d and thanking staff for their compassion \u201cin our time of turmoil\u201d. A Wuhan evacuee became the 15th coronavirus case in the US. Oil demand is set to fall year on year in the first quarter for the first time since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. The WHO chief has said the outbreak could still go in \u201cany direction\u201d. You can get in touch with me on naaman.zhou@theguardian.com or on Twitter @naamanzhou",
