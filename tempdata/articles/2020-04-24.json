      "bodyText": "A couple in government-enforced quarantine at an Auckland airport hotel are documenting their experience of luxury lockdown \u2013 and causing envy worldwide with images of waffles delivered to the door, mini-fridges stocked full of cake, and escorted walks under stormy New Zealand skies. The Instagram blog thequarantinecanteen_nz has recorded 13 days of quarantine at the four-star Novotel, a lockdown measure introduced by the Jacinda Ardern government to stop the spread of coronavirus. The majority of those in quarantine are New Zealanders, as the country closed its borders to foreign nationals in mid-March. Most of New Zealand\u2019s 1,400 virus cases have links to overseas travel and arrivals, and the island country of five million people is now attempting to eliminate the virus with stringent lockdown rules that are among the toughest in the world. While horror stories have emerged from similar compulsory quarantines in Australia, the New Zealand quarantine is creating envy among many, with glossy food-porn images of high-quality meals, and mini-fridges stocked with treats: \u201cThe government has a cake problem\u201d the blog\u2019s authors have said, adding that the whole process has been \u201creally impressive\u201d. Breakfast on day 13 was poached eggs on a bean medley with chorizo sausage and porridge with spiced apple and almonds, while lunch on day seven was a mushroom frittata with buttered potatoes, a green salad with french dressing, a banana, a cheese scone with butter, hummingbird cake and a can of coke. Other highlights have included a slow-cooked beef stew, a Thai red chicken curry with mango fried rice, and plenty of fresh salads including caesar, beetroot and feta, and coleslaw. The authors of the blog, who have chosen not to be identified, said they had put on three kilograms in quarantine, despite taking walks with aviation security staff around the carpark. \u201cThe government has a real cake problem \u2026 we asked the kitchen to stop sending up cake,\u201d the author\u2019s wrote. \u201cIt was starting to become an issue in our day-to-day\u201d According to the blog those in quarantine at the Novotel were previously allowed to roam free in the carpark for exercise, but that privilege was cancelled when someone allegedly tried to \u201crun away\u201d. In addition to the daily 45-minute walk, the blog\u2019s authors said they were enjoying watching the news, home school and exercise TV, the lending library in the hotel\u2019s foyer, and dropping in on the physically distanced knitting group run on the hotel\u2019s front steps. They attended health checks every day, too. \u201cMaking friends is not allowed in the hallways and room-to-room friends are also strictly forbidden,\u201d the couple said. \u201cBut making friends is easy to do in the front car park. It\u2019s very cliquy, think your sixth-form high school lunch hour but most of the world has shut down and you\u2019re living your best life in the front carpark of a hotel. It\u2019s very \u2018day of the living quarantined\u2019\u201d. The couple said the atmosphere at the hotel has been \u201cfriendly and relaxed\u201d throughout, but noted that families with children were showing more strain than singles or couples. According to the government, more than 2,000 people are currently being held in enforced quarantine in more than a dozen hotels across Auckland. The government has so far agreed to pick up the tab for the quarantine.",

But the findings have not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal. Previous research has suggested that sunlight is unlikely to kill the novel coronavirus. Donald Trump suggested that light and disinfectant could be injected into people\u2019s bodies as a cure for coronavirus. His public health advisors immediately played down the idea. Medics warn that attempting such at thing at home is very dangerous and could be fatal. The president ignored questions about Dr Rick Bright, who said he would file a whistleblower complaint after being removed from his role overseeing the development of a coronavirus vaccine. Bright said he was removed from his post overseeing the development of a coronavirus vaccine at the department of health and human services because he refused to promote hydroxychloroquine as a potential coronavirus treatment. Trump has repeatedly touted the drug as a cure despite limited evidence. The House approved a $484bn coronavirus relief bill, which the president said he would sign into law. The package would boost a depleted loan program for small businesses and provide funding for hospitals and coronavirus testing efforts. Only five representatives voted against the bill. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez was the only one to oppose it, maintaining that it didn\u2019t provide enough relief for medical facilities. Congress also approved a resolution to create a select committee to review the distribution of coronavirus relief funds. The final vote was 212-182 and fell exactly along party lines, with Republicans unanimously voting against the Democratic proposal. . Few Americans trust Trump as a source for information on the pandemic. According to a new AP/NORC poll, only 23% of Americans say they have high levels of trust in the information the president shares. Another 21% say they have a moderate amount of trust in his information. New York governor Andrew Cuomo fiercely criticized Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for suggesting states should declare bankruptcy instead of receiving more federal funds. The Democratic governor called McConnell\u2019s suggestion \u201cone of the really dumb ideas of all time,\u201d and he said McConnell\u2019s warning against \u201cbailouts\u201d for Democratic states was \u201cirresponsible\u201d and \u201creckless.\u201d Elizabeth Warren announced her older brother died of coronavirus this week. The Massachusetts senator and former presidential candidate had not previously disclosed that her brother, Don Reed Herring, had tested positive for the virus. While the president\u2019s suggestions that light and disinfectact could be injected into people as a cure for the coronavirus has attracted the most attention tonight, we\u2019ve also been wondering about the emerging research that the DHS\u2019s Bill Bryan presented during the daily White House briefing. \u201cOur most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that solar light appears to have on killing the virus, both surfaces and in the air,\u201d Bryan said. The research he referenced has yet to be published or validated. David Brenner, who directs the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Medical Center told The Guardian that \u201cPrima facie, the suggestion that solar light will have an effect on the Covid-19 pandemic seems implausible.\u201d There are different types of UV light: UVA and UVB are the ones we encounter as the ones that can cause sunburns, tanning and sun damage. UVC gets mostly filtered out by the Earth\u2019s ozone later \u2014 \u201cthere is almost no UVC in the sunlight that reaches us,\u201d Brenner says. But it\u2019s mostly UVC light that contains antimicrobial properties. Brenner\u2019s research looks into a type of UVC light that he and his colleagues believe has the potential to kill the Covid-19 virus, while being safe for exposure to humans. Here\u2019s a belated fact check, courtesy of CNN. Medics are reminding the public to disregard Trump\u2019s suggestion that disinfectant could be injected into the body to cure coronavirus. Hydroxychloroquine \u2013 an old anti-malarial drug that is today more commonly used to treat lupus \u2013 has become another partisan political wedge issue in the US: conservative politicians and media figures have hyped studies that support the theory that the drug is a potential treatment. And on Wednesday, Rick Bright, the head of a US government agency charged with investing in treatments and responses for pandemics, said he was forced out of his job over his resistance to the administration\u2019s \u201cmisguided directives\u201d promoting \u201cbroad use\u201d of the drug, which he said \u201cclearly lack scientific merit\u201d. The limited evidence around hydroxychloroquine so far has come in a steady stream of scientific studies, often as soon as they are posted online as \u201cpreprints\u201d \u2013 ie before they have gone through the rigorous vetting process known as peer review. None of the studies that have been released meet the gold standard for demonstrating a drug\u2019s effectiveness \u2013 a large-scale, double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT), though multiple trials of that kind are under way. While the world awaits those results, here\u2019s a guide to some of the studies released thus far: During the briefing, the president evaded questions about Rick Bright, the vaccine expert who says he was removed from his post after resisting the president\u2019s push to use hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for coronavirus without proper vetting and testing. Bright said he would file a whistleblower complaint, after being reassigned from his post overseeing the development of a coronavirus vaccine. Read more: Fact check: Testing As he does almost daily during his briefings, Trump repeated the claim that the US has done \u201cmore tests than all other countries combined\u201d. This is not true. Moreover, overall, the US had administered more than 4.6m coronavirus tests, according to the Covid Tracking Project. From a very slow start, the US, with a population of 329m, had ramped up to a testing rate of one in every 71 people \u2013 a bit better than to South Korea\u2019s rate of 1 in every 90 people. But Germany has done even better, testing every 1 in 63 people. In America, despite the recent increase in testing, backlogs are reported in labs across the country, and many people with symptoms \u2013 including health workers \u2013 are still struggling to access tests. The briefing has ended. Trump finished by criticizing the media (\u201cCNN is fake news. Don\u2019t talk to me.\u201d), the \u201cfake Russia, Russia, Russia deal\u201d and the \u201cillegal witch hunt,\u201d and implying that the media is giving Joe Biden \u201ca pass\u201d. The president is \u201cnot happy about Brian Kemp\u201d Trump said, referring to the governor of Georgia, who has moved ahead with a plan to reopen businesses despite criticisms from the president and other Republican and Democratic lawmakers. \u201cI don\u2019t want this thing to flare up because you\u2019re deciding to do something that\u2019s not in the guidelines,\u201d Trump said. Fact check: Blue states and coronavirus \u201cIt is interesting the states that are having trouble are blue,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe states that seem to have the problem happen to be Democrat.\u201d That\u2019s not really the case. Although New York and Washington, both led by Democratic governors, experienced devastating surges, red states led by Republicans have suffered too. For the Guardian, Josh Wood compared the fates of Kentucky (led by a Democrat) and Tennesee (led by a Republican): \u201cMedical doctors,\u201d should see \u201cif there any way to apply light and heat to cure\u201d, the president said. He asked Dr Deborah Birx if that\u2019s possible. Fevers are the body\u2019s way of apply heat to treat itself, but she hasn\u2019t heard of it being used as a treatment, she responded. \u201cIt\u2019s just a suggestion,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf heat is good and if sunlight it good, that\u2019s. a great thing as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d \u201cWe may, we may go beyond that - we\u2019ll have to see where it is. Until we feel it\u2019s safe, we\u2019re going to be extending,\u201d Trump said. The president\u2019s message today is much different than what he\u2019s said earlier this week. We cannot immediately fact-check Bryan on the emerging research he is presenting on the effect of heat, light, and humidity on the coronavirus, but we\u2019ll circle back to it. As I noted earlier, while there are a few preliminary studies suggest that hotter temperatures could slow the virus, most of this research so far has not been through a rigorous process of peer review. The DHS\u2019s Bryan is asked about the president\u2019s suggestions that disinfectants be injected into a person. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that within our lab,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cMaybe it works, maybe it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Trump interjected \u2014 but a disinfectant like isopropyl alcohol definitely has an effect on \u201cstationary objects.\u201d Note: If you are not a stationary object and are, in fact, a person, please follow medical advice and do not inject disinfectant into your body. Representatives voted 388-5 in favor of the $484bn package. \u201cSupposing you brought the light inside the body - either through the skin or some other way,\u201d Trump wondered. He also mused about ways to use disinfectants on people, \u201cby injections inside or almost a cleaning.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019d be interesting to check that,\u201d the president said. \u201cYou\u2019d have to use medical doctors.\u201d The DHS has worked with Johns Hopkins to test how the virus in droplets of saliva and respiratory fluids survives at different temperatures, Bryan said. The virus survives best indoors, in dry conditions. UV rays and hotter, more humid temps cut down the halflife of the virus. Both Trump and Mike Pence have referenced research that the virus will fade in warm weather. The president said \u201cyou won\u2019t even believe\u201d how the virus reacts to sunlight. Preliminary studies, which have not been peer-reviewed, indicate that warm weather could slow the virus. Some researchers think that some Southeast Asian countries, like Cambodia and the Philippines, were spared larger outbreaks because of their hot, humid climate. But there have several outbreaks in other warm areas. The science is far from conclusive on whether the virus is seasonal. Bill Bryan, who heads the science and technology directorate at the Department of Homeland Security, is presenting more information on how the virus reacts to heat, humidity and light. While the briefing is underway, Congress is voting on the $484bn package for small businesses. Only five representatives have voted against the deal, Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Republicans Thomas Massie, Jody Hice, Ken Buck, and Andy Biggs. Ocasio-Cortez has maintained that the bill doesn\u2019t go far enough in providing relief for hospitals and coronavirus testing effots. \u201cWe\u2019re very close to a vaccine,\u201d Trump said, before immediately contradicting himself. \u201cWe\u2019re not close on testing\u201d the vaccine, he clarified. Public health officials have said that it will take at least a year to 18 months to test and approve a vaccine. \u201cHarvard, Princeton, Stanford and other institutions\u201d will return funds to the federal government, Trump said. The president had a public dispute with Harvard this week. Education secretary Betsy DeVos yesterday also called on \u201celite, wealthy institutions\u201d should not take relief funds intended for struggling educational institutions. After initially refusing to comply with Trump\u2019s demand that they return the funds, Harvard announced it would return $8.6m in taxpayer funds. Stay tuned for live coverage and fact-checking The owner of the Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House chain said the company could return $20m in federal loans intended for small businesses. This week, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said the government would ask bigcompanies to return money after the Payroll Protection Program, created to help companies cover payroll and expenses, ran out of money last week. Congress is expecting to add an additional $320bn to the fund. Hi there, it\u2019s Maanvi, blogging from the West Coast. First up, Nancy Pelosi demonstrates distancing: Earlier, her technique was less effective. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Dr Rick Bright said he would file a whistleblower complaint after being removed from his role overseeing the development of a coronavirus vaccine. Bright has claimed he was moved to a less important role at the department of health and human services because he refused to promote the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential coronavirus treatment. Despite limited evidence, Trump has touted the drug as a potential \u201cgame changer\u201d in coronavirus treatment. The House approved a resolution to create a select committee to review the distribution of coronavirus relief funds. The final vote was 212-182 and fell exactly along party lines, with Republicans unanimously voting against the Democratic proposal. The House will soon vote on the nearly $500 billion coronavirus relief bill passed by the Senate yesterday. Few Americans trust Trump as a source for information on the pandemic. According to a new AP/NORC poll, only 23% of Americans say they have high levels of trust in the information the president shares. Another 21% say they have a moderate amount of trust in his information. New York governor Andrew Cuomo fiercely criticized Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for suggesting states should declare bankruptcy instead of receiving more federal funds. The Democratic governor called McConnell\u2019s suggestion \u201cone of the really dumb ideas of all time,\u201d and he said McConnell\u2019s warning against \u201cbailouts\u201d for Democratic states was \u201cirresponsible\u201d and \u201creckless.\u201d Elizabeth Warren announced her older brother died of coronavirus this week. The Massachusetts senator and former presidential candidate had not previously disclosed that her brother, Don Reed Herring, had tested positive for the virus. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The House has voted exactly along party lines to create a select committee to review the distribution of coronavirus relief funds. The final vote was 212-182, and it took an hour and a half to complete because members were asked to vote in staggered groups to limit the risk of coronavirus spread. Despite concerns about lawmakers traveling to Washington as the DC region remains under stay-at-home orders, only 35 members did not return to the Capitol to cast their votes. The House will now take a 15-minute recess to have the chamber cleaned, and members will then return to vote on the nearly $500 billion coronavirus relief package. When asked about Dr Rick Bright\u2019s claim that he was ousted from his role at HHS because he refused to echo questionable claims regarding potential coronavirus treatments, Trump pleaded ignorance. \u201cI never heard of him,\u201d the president said at his press conference yesterday. \u201cIf a guy says he was pushed out of a job, maybe he was, maybe he wasn\u2019t. You\u2019d have to hear the other side. I don\u2019t know who he is.\u201d But some of the president\u2019s critics raised concerns that Bright\u2019s demotion was further evidence of the administration\u2019s efforts to sideline experts in the middle of a pandemic. Ron Klain, who oversaw the Obama administration\u2019s response to the Ebola outbreak, warned the White House was trying to \u201cput politics ahead of science and safety.\u201d Dr Rick Bright formerly served as the director of the department of health and human services\u2019 Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or Barda, and as the deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response, but he was recently demoted to a much smaller role at the National Institutes of Health. Bright said in a statement yesterday that he believed he was ousted because he refused to back some of Trump\u2019s questionable claims about coronavirus. \u201cSpecifically, and contrary to misguided directives, I limited the broad use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, promoted by the administration as a panacea, but which clearly lack scientific merit,\u201d Bright said. \u201cWhile I am prepared to look at all options and to think \u2018outside the box\u2019 for effective treatments, I rightly resisted efforts to provide an unproven drug on demand to the American public.\u201d Dr Rick Bright, the vaccine expert who claims he was ousted from his role helping to oversee the development of a coronavirus vaccine because he challenged Trump\u2019s claims on hydroxychloroquine, is filing a whistleblower complaint against the government. Lawyers for Bright said the complaint would detail \u201cthe retaliatory treatment to which he was subjected by HHS political leadership after raising appropriate science-based concerns.\u201d Trump has touted the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential \u201cgame changer\u201d in coronavirus treatment, even though evidence of its effectiveness is anecdotal at best. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports on the latest from California: In response to the economic fallout triggered by the coronavirus, California is putting in place protections for those facing debts, governor Gavin Newsom announced today. Twenty-one loan services in California agreed to a 90-day forbearance on student loan debt, with no impact to credit scores \u2014 a move that could mean relief for more than 1.1 million Californians. Illinois has already planned to implement a similar measure. Additionally, Newsom has signed an executive order that prevents debt collectors from garnishing the $1,200 checks provided by the CARES Act. \u201cNo debt collector can take those direct payments from the CARES Act any longer in the state of California, and you can take back those funds that were taken by these collectors\u201d, Newsom said. The order will be retroactive; if debt collectors have already garnished those funds, they\u2019ll have to give it back, Newsom said. The pause on debt-collection will not apply to those who owe financial support to children and former spouses, or those who owe restitution to courts and victims. While the number of coronavirus cases has in some ways stabilized, with hospitalizations and ICU admissions down by 4.4 and 1.2% respectively, the state of California is not yet out of the woods. Yesterday marked a grim milestone in California, with 115 coronavirus deaths recorded, marking the state\u2019s deadliest day so far and an 8.5% increase from the previous day. The treasury department has issued new guidance on the Paycheck Protection Program making it harder for publicly traded companies to receive small-business loans. \u201cBorrowers still must certify in good faith that their PPP loan request is necessary,\u201d the guidance reads. \u201c[I]t is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith, and such a company should be prepared to demonstrate to SBA, upon request, the basis for its certification.\u201d The guidance goes on to add, \u201cAny borrower that applied for a PPP loan prior to the issuance of this guidance and repays the loan in full by May 7, 2020 will be deemed by SBA to have made the required certification in good faith.\u201d In effect, this gives publicly traded companies two weeks to return the money they may have already received in order to avoid scrutiny from the federal government. The administration has attracted criticism for allocating nearly $600 million of the PPP\u2019s funds to publicly traded companies, especially considering so many small businesses were not able to have their applications processed before the program ran out of money last week. The House is about to pass a bill that would give PPP an additional $320 billion in funds, and the treasury department is clearly looking to avoid additional criticism as the program gets up and running again. A new poll finds that most Americans do not trust Trump as a source of information on the coronavirus pandemic. According to a new AP/NORC poll, only 23% of Americans say they have high levels of trust in the information Trump shares. Another 21% say they have a moderate amount of trust in his information. Like the president\u2019s overall approval rating for his handling of the crisis, these numbers vary drastically when broken down by party affiliation. While only 22% of Republicans say they have little or no trust in Trump\u2019s information, 84% of Democrats say they have little to no trust in the president as a source of coronavirus information. The poll comes as Trump continues to hold long daily press conferences on the pandemic, during which the president has frequently shared false or misleading information about the virus. The House is now voting on whether to establish a select committee to oversee the proper distribution of coronavirus relief funds, which is expected to break largely along party lines but will likely still pass thanks to Democratic support. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has already cast her vote, and she is now standing at the back of the chamber helping to direct foot traffic as members vote in staggered groups to limit the risk of spreading the virus. The vote will take longer to complete because of these precautions, but once the count has been finalized, the chamber will be thoroughly cleaned before members return to vote on the nearly $500 billion coronavirus relief bill. A new spokesperson for the deaprtment of health and human services sent a series of now-deleted racist tweets about Chinese people and coronavirus. CNN reports: Michael Caputo, a longtime New York Republican political operative who worked on Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, was appointed last week as Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at HHS, a prominent communications role at the department which serves a central role in the federal government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Caputo, a prolific user who often tweeted insults and profanity, recently erased nearly his entire Twitter history from before April 12. CNN\u2019s KFile used the Internet Archive\u2019s Way Back Machine to review more than 1300 deleted tweets and retweets from late February to early April many of which were regarding the rapidly spreading coronavirus. ... In a series of tweets on March 12, Caputo responded to a baseless conspiracy theory that the United States brought the coronavirus to Wuhan, China, by tweeting that \u2018millions of Chinese suck the blood out of rabid bats as an appetizer and eat the ass out of anteaters.\u2019 He followed up at another user, \u2018Don\u2019t you have a bat to eat?\u2019 and tweeted at another user named, \u2018You\u2019re very convincing, Wang.\u2019 Caputo also used his account to attack Democratic lawmakers and journalist as Trump received criticism for his administration\u2019s early response to coronavirus. Gordon Sondland, the former US ambassador to the EU and a star witness in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, received a small business loan from the Paycheck Protection Program. A spokesperson for Provenance Hotels, the hotel chain Sondland founded, confirmed to Bloomberg News that the company had been approved for a PPP loan. Sondland, who was recalled from his post as EU ambassador two days after Trump was acuitted in his Senate impeachment trial, has a net worth of at least $78 million. The administration has been criticized for its handling of the PPP program, as small businesses complain larger companies have gotten priority in receiving loans. The burger chain Shake Shack announced earlier this week that it would return a $10 million PPP loan amid criticism. Congresswoman Maxine Waters said she was dedicating the next coronavirus relief bill to her sister, who is dying of the virus in St. Louis. \u201cI not only rise in support of this legislation,\u201d the California Democrat said on the House floor. \u201cI also would like to rise in support of what we\u2019re doing for the health care enhancement act in this bill. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to take a moment to dedicate this legislation to my dear sister who is dying in a hospital in St. Louis, Mo., right now infected by the coronavirus.\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren similarly announced earlier today that her older brother, Don Reed Herring, died of coronavirus earlier this week. Waters went on to say that Congress must now turn its attention to the next coronavirus relief bill in order to \u201cprovide more funding for people hurting by the exploding economic fallout of the pandemic.\u201d Dr Deborah Birx reportedly had to convince Trump to come out against Georgia\u2019s plan to start reopening non-essential businesses this Friday. Trump said during yesterday\u2019s press conference that he disagreed \u201cstrongly\u201d with Georgia governor Brian Kemp\u2019s reopening plan, which many public health experts have warned is dangerously hasty. That criticism represented a reversal from Trump, who expressed confidence in Kemp\u2019s leadership a day before coming out against the plan. CNN has the details on how Birx convinced Trump to reconsider his position: At a meeting before Wednesday\u2019s briefing, task force members discussed the likelihood of being asked about [Kemp\u2019s] controversial move to open up many businesses such as nail salons and bowling alleys, [a White House] source added. ... During the meeting, Dr. Anthony Fauci and other task force members said if the scientists were not in agreement with Trump on the Georgia issue during the news conference it would pose a problem. \u2018I cannot defend this publicly,\u2019 Fauci said to others at the meeting, the source said. Members of the group agreed it was necessary to attempt to change Trump\u2019s mind on the subject. They then asked Dr. Deborah Birx, the panel\u2019s coordinator, to try to convince Trump to oppose Kemp\u2019s move. She had a private meeting with the President just prior to the news conference and successfully convinced him to denounce Kemp\u2019s decision. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer said she would likely extend the state\u2019s stay-at-home order while looking at allowing some activties with restrictions in place, emphasizing that the state\u2019s reopening would take place in waves. \u201cIt will permit some activity if our numbers continue to go down and our testing continues to go up,\u201d the Democratic governor told MSNBC this morning. \u201cBut It\u2019s too early to say precisely what each wave looks like and when it happens.\u201d Whitmer similarly told CNN this morning that the reopening process had to be \u201cstrategic and thoughtful,\u201d as many public health experts express concern about the handful of Republican governors who are planning to soon relax restrictions. Whitmer has faced protests in her state over the stay-at-home order, with thousands of people ignoring social distancing guidelines to demonstrate against the order outside the state capitol. \u201cThe worst irony that could come about from these demonstrations is that they force us to stay in this posture longer than we\u2019re already planning to,\u201d Whitmer told MSNBC. \u201cThat\u2019s the last thing any of us wants.\u201d Despite the protests, a new Fox News poll shows Whitmer is still broadly popular in the state, with 63% of Michigan voters approving of her job performance. In comparison, Trump has a 47% approval rating among Michigan voters. Messages of sympathy are being sent across social media for Massachusetts Senator and former presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren after she announced this morning that the oldest of her three brothers died of coronavirus earlier this week. Former presidential rivals in the 2020 race for the Democratic nomination, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O\u2019Rourke have tweeted. Buttigieg. Warren has also received condolences via Twitter from congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Deb Haaland, women who spoke out against Harvey Weinstein, including Patricia Arquette and Alyssa Milano, and Monica Lewinsky. There have been some incredibly spiteful, trollish tweets, perhaps inevitably, but the blog prefers not to go into details. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Another 4.4 million Americans filed for unemployment last week. The latest figures from the labor department mean that more than 26 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since states\u2019 economies started shutting down due to the pandemic. Andrew Cuomo fiercely criticized Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for suggesting states should declare bankruptcy instead of receiving more federal money. Cuomo described McConnell\u2019s suggestion as \u201cone of the really dumb ideas of all time,\u201d and he said McConnell\u2019s warning against \u201cbailouts\u201d for Democrat states was \u201cirresponsible\u201d and \u201creckless.\u201d The House will vote on the next coronavirus relief bill later today. The chamber is expected to easily pass the nearly $500 billion bill, which Trump has already said he would sign. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. New York governor Andrew Cuomo just wrapped up his daily briefing on the state\u2019s response to coronavirus. Here\u2019s some of what he covered: Cuomo criticized Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for suggesting states should declare bankruptcy rather than receive more federal money. Cuomo dismissed McConnell\u2019s suggestion as \u201cdumb,\u201d \u201cirresponsible\u201d and \u201creckless.\u201d The governor noted McConnell has warned against \u201cbailouts\u201d of Democratic states that have been hard hit by coronavirus, which prompted Cuomo to remind reporters that McConnell\u2019s home state of Kentucky is far more dependent on federal money than New York. New York state will launch an investigation of nursing homes\u2019 handling of coroanvirus. The investigation will be jointly conducted by the state department of health and the state attorney general, and it comes as officials have been criticized for their oversight of long-term care facilities, where nearly a quarter of New York\u2019s coronavirus deaths have occurred. New York\u2019s coronavirus death rate may be lower than some estimates indicated. A study of 3,000 antibody tests from across the state indicated that 13.9% of New Yorkers have coronavirus antibodies. Considering the state\u2019s death toll of 15,740, the death rate would be 0.5%, which is lower than some estimates predicted. But Cuomo warned the death rate could change as the state begins to more thoroughly account for coronavirus deaths that occurred at home. Another 438 New Yorkers died of coronavirus yesterday. Wednesday\u2019s death toll represents a slight decline from Tuesday, but Cuomo warned that the state\u2019s daily death toll remains troublingly high. \u201cThat number is not coming down as fast as we would like it to come down,\u201d Cuomo said. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is correct that Kentucky, the home state of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, is particularly dependent on federal funding. \u201cNew York puts in more money into the federal pot than it takes out,\u201d Cuomo said moments ago, criticizing McConnell for suggesting states that are hard hit by coronavirus should declare bankruptcy. \u201cHis state takes out more than it puts in. Sen. McConnell, who\u2019s getting bailed out here? It\u2019s your state that is living on the money that we generate. Your state is getting bailed out. Not my state.\u201d A WalletHub study released last month found that Kentucky is the fifth most federally dependent state in the country. New York ranked 25th. New York governor Andrew Cuomo criticized Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for suggesting Democratic states were looking for a bailout with coronavirus relief money. Cuomo noted that New York produces much more revenue for the federal government than Kentucky, McConnell\u2019s home state, does. \u201cIt\u2019s your state that is living on the money that we generate,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cYour state is being bailed out, not my state.\u201d Asked by a reporter whether he has spoken to McConnell or whether he intends to, Cuomo said no and no. New York governor Andrew Cuomo criticized Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for suggesting states should declare bankruptcy rather than receive more federal funding. During an interview yesterday, McConnell said, \u201cI would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route. It saves some cities. And there\u2019s no good reason for it not to be available. My guess is their first choice would be for the federal government to borrow money from future generations to send it down to them now so they don\u2019t have to do that. That\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to be in favor of.\u201d Cuomo, who has repeatedly demanded that Congress provide more funding for states to cover the costs of the coronavirus crisis, said McConnell\u2019s suggestion was \u201cone of the really dumb ideas of all time.\u201d The governor warned that states declaring bankruptcies could cause \u201ca collapse of this national economy.\u201d Cuomo also lamabasted McConnell for suggesting relief money for states would represent a bailout for Democratic states, which have generally been harder hit by the virus. \u201cIf there\u2019s ever a time for humanity and decency, now\u2019s the time,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cHow irresponsible and how reckless.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced that a study of antibody tests from across the state indicates the coronavirus death rate may be lower than some estimates. Cuomo said that 3,000 antibody tests conducted across New York indicate 13.9% of state residents are positive for antibodies. But those figures vary dramatically by region. While 21.2% of New York City residents tested positive, only 3.6% of residents from upstate New York have the antibodies. Cuomo said a 13.9% infection rate would translate to 2.7 million people infected statewide. Considering the more than 15,000 deaths recorded by the state, New York\u2019s coronavirus death rate is approximately 0.5%, which is lower than some estimates had predicted. But Cuomo acknowledged that statistic could change as the state starts to account for more coronavirus deaths that took place at home, which have so far largely not been included in the official death toll. New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced the state would launch an investigation into nursing homes\u2019 handling of coronavirus. Cuomo said the investigation would be jointly overseen by the state department of health and the state attorney general. The governor empashized that nursing homes must be taking every possible step to limit the spread of coronavirus, warning that facilities found to be negligent could be subjected to a fine or lose their license. Nearly a quarter of New York\u2019s 15,740 coronavirus deaths have come from long-term care facilities, prompting criticism of officials\u2019 oversight of the facilities. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the overall number of coronavirus hospitalizations was down again, part of a days-long decline. But Cuomo noted the number of new coronavirus hospitalizations was relatively flat at roughly 1,300, which is \u201cnot great nws.\u201d The state\u2019s daily death toll remains high, with another 438 New Yorkers dying of the virus yesterday. That represents a decrease from last week\u2019s numbers, but daily death tolls have been flat this week. Cuomo said of the daily death toll, \u201cThat number is not coming down as fast as we would like it to come down.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo will give his daily briefing on the state\u2019s response to coronavirus in about five minutes. Cuomo said at yesterday\u2019s briefing that he would make an announcement today about the state\u2019s nursing homes, which have been particularly hard hit by coronavirus. The governor has described nursing homes as \u201cground zero\u201d in the fight against coronavirus, as nearly a quarter of the state\u2019s 15,302 deaths have come from long-term care facilities. Many of the House members present on Capitol Hill today are wearing masks in the chamber, although a few Republican members were seen not covering their faces. House speaker Nancy Pelosi used a white bandana to cover her face but removed it while she was delivering her floor speech. When congressman Tom Cole, the top Republican on the House rules committee, started speaking, he said he would mirror Pelosi\u2019s mask usage. \u201cI\u2019m going to follow her example,\u201d Cole said. \u201cthink we should keep our mask on when we\u2019re doing our normal business but take them off when we\u2019re speaking and thank you for setting that example, Madam Speaker.\u201d Don Reed Herring, senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s brother who has just died of coronavirus, was a Vietnam War veteran, which Warren often mentioned on the campaign trail. The Boston Globe reports: Herring was born in 1933 and attended the University of Oklahoma, but did not graduate, before enlisting in the Air Force, where he flew B-47 and B-52 bombers. He flew 288 combat missions in Vietnam, eventually becoming a B-52 squadron pilot and a squadron aircraft commander. He earned numerous decorations before retiring in 1973 as a lieutenant colonel and starting an auto-detailing business. In her statement, Warren described Herring as a natural leader with a quick, crooked smile. Warren had not previously disclosed her brother had tested positive for the virus. According to the Globe, he was hospitalized for pneumonia in February and then moved to a rehabilitation center, which had seen other cases of coroanvirus. He was later brought to the intensive care unit of a nearby hospital, where he died. Elizabeth Warren says her older brother, Don Reed Herring, has died of coronavirus Warren said of the loss, \u201cI\u2019m grateful to the nurses and frontline staff who took care of him, but it\u2019s hard to know that there was no family to hold his hand or to say \u2018I love you\u2019 one more time\u2014and no funeral for those of us who loved him to hold each other close. I\u2019ll miss you dearly my brother.\u201d Warren frequently mentioned her three brothers on the campaign trail when she was running for president, and Herring appeared in a campaign video reminiscing about growing up with the senator. The House is in session, and the Democratic chairman of the rules committee, Jim McGovern, has taken to the floor wearing a mask honoring his hometown football team, the New England Patriots. McGovern expressed disappointment that members would not be voting a proposal to temporarily allow voting by proxy as long as the coronavirus crisis lasts. House speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to bring the matter up for a vote today, but she delayed that amid vocal Republican opposition to the proposal. McGovern warned the status quo in the House was \u201cunacceptable and dangerous.\u201d As the coronavirus crisis struck the US, health and human services secretary Alex Azar appointed Brian Harrison, who most recently ran a dog-breeding business, to oversee the department\u2019s daily response to coronavirus. The unusual decision was one of a number of errors and misjudgements from Azar earlier this year that hobbled the country\u2019s initial response to the outbreak. Reuters reports: [A]t the dawn of the coronavirus crisis, Azar appointed his most trusted aide and chief of staff, Harrison, as HHS\u2019s main coordinator for the government\u2019s response to the virus. Harrison, 37, was an unusual choice, with no formal education in public health, management, or medicine and with only limited experience in the fields. In 2006, he joined HHS in a one-year stint as a \u2018Confidential Assistant\u2019 to Azar, who was then deputy secretary. He also had posts working for Vice President Dick Cheney, the Department of Defense and a Washington public relations company. Before joining the Trump Administration in January 2018, Harrison\u2019s official HHS biography says, he \u2018ran a small business in Texas.\u2019 The biography does not disclose the name or nature of that business, but his personal financial disclosure forms show that from 2012 until 2018 he ran a company called Dallas Labradoodles. The company sells Australian Labradoodles, a breed that is a cross between a Labrador Retriever and a Poodle. He sold it in April 2018, his financial disclosure form said. HHS emailed Reuters that the sale price was $225,000. Azar has been repeatedly criticized for overestimating the country\u2019s preparedness as the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the US. The cabinet secretary claimed the virus was \u201cpotentially serious\u201d but insisted America had a \u201cplaybook\u201d to address it. In reality, delays in testing and initial downplaying of the virus\u2019 severity cost the US crucial weeks in its early response to the outbreak. This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Jo Walters. The House will convene at 10 am ET to vote on two measures, the latest coronavirus relief bill and a resoulution to form a select committee on the coronavirus crisis, which would oversee proper distribution of government funds from the relief packages. The House will first debate both measures and then move on to voting, which should start at around 1:30pm ET. Members will vote in staggered groups to limit the risk of spreading coronavirus, and the chamber will also be cleaned between votes, so the process will take longer than usual. The relief bill is expected to pass easily, and Trump has already indicated he will sign it. But the resolution establishing the select committee will likely produce a party-line vote, although Democrats should still be able to get the measure approved. The Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe and Amanda Holpuch report: An additional 4.4 million Americans filed for unemployment last week adding to a total of over 26 million since the coronavirus pandemic shutdown swathes of the US and brought its economy to a standstill. The latest department of labor figures show the pace of layoffs appears to have slowed slightly but a backlog of claims mean millions more are likely to file in the coming weeks. States across the country are encountering problems with the sheer number of people applying for unemployment benefits. In Florida, already bedevilled by the widespread collapse of its already flawed benefits system, just 14.2% of the more than 668,000 claims filed since 15 March have been paid. In Ohio, claimants now have to file on a specific day of the week, depending on the first letter of their last name, to ease congestion. Washington residents are complaining that the state\u2019s website crashes or takes hours to respond. VA health care facilities are struggling with shortages of workers and the equipment necessary to protect employees from contracting the virus. At least 1,900 VA health care workers have become sick with the coronavirus, according to agency documents obtained by The Associated Press. Twenty have died. Another 3,600 of the 300,000-plus VA health care employees are quarantined and unable to work because they have been exposed to the virus, according to VA figures. The Labor Department is now investigating, and several Democrats in Congress plan to send a letter Thursday calling on Donald Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act to get more supplies for VA health facilities. The VA, responsible for the health care of 9 million military veterans, denied it was short of supplies and stressed that it follows federal health guidelines when rationing personal protective equipment like masks and gloves, the AP writes. Full story here. The president has taken to retweeting his tweets from earlier in the week. Here are two examples that he retweeted moments ago that tell you a lot about what\u2019s going on in the Oval Office. And: Good morning, US blog readers, there\u2019s a busy day in store so welcome to our live politics and coronavirus news updates. Here\u2019s some of what\u2019s coming up. Hundreds of members of the House of Representatives will gather in Washington this morning to pass a $484bn coronavirus relief bill, bringing the unprecedented total of funds approved for the crisis to nearly $3tn. The latest tranche covers more support for small businesses and extra funds for hospitals and testing. The next bill could include funds for states. The tension continues as a raft of states start preparing to reopen their economies in steps, with disagreement about whether some are moving too far too fast. Even Donald Trump, who was earlier urging the country to reopen and initially played down the seriousness of coronavirus, has criticized Georgia for beginning its business reopening tomorrow. The latest unemployment figures will be released at 8.30am ET and we\u2019ll have a full story and the news live in our separate business blog, here.",

Students were still expected to start from Wednesday 15 April.</p> <p><strong>Position on schools: </strong>On 7 April the Victorian government advised that \u201cmost students will be educated from home when term two starts to ensure physical distancing helps slow the spread of coronavirus\u201d. Free internet access and laptops will be provided for students who need them.</p> <p>Onsite learning will only be available for children whose parents cannot work from home and vulnerable students without access to a suitable learning environment.</p> <p>On 15 April the state\u2019s chief medical officer, Brett Sutton, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VictorianCHO/status/1250297818939453445\">said on Twitter</a> his advice to the Victorian government \u201cwas and continues to be that to slow the spread of coronavirus, schools should undertake remote learning for term two\u201d.</p> <p>But he added: \u201cSchools are not \u2018dangerous places\u2019 and parents should feel comfortable sending their kids to school \u2013 if they need to. But the mix of onsite &amp; offsite learning supports better physical distancing overall, reducing risk as we drive new cases down. As risk changes, we\u2019ll reassess.\u201d</p> <h2>Queensland</h2> <p><strong>Term two dates</strong>: 20 April\u201326 June</p> <p><strong>Position on schools</strong>: On 13 April, the Queensland government announced that for the first five weeks of term two, from 20 April to 22 May, the state would use remote learning or learning from home. The education minister, Grace Grace, said the government would re-evaluate around 15 May.</p> <p>Children of essential workers can continue to attend in person because schools will remain open.</p> <p>School staff, unless they were vulnerable due to medical conditions, would continue to teach from the classroom so they had access to school resources to deliver online learning, she said.</p> <h2>ACT</h2> <p><strong>Term 2 dates</strong>: 28 April\u20133 July</p> <p><strong>Position on schools</strong>: ACT public schools prepared to move to remote learning in term two, with most public school students expected to undertake their learning from home.</p> <p>For parents and carers who cannot keep their children at home, due to work or additional needs, the ACT government will provide supervision at a reduced number of public school sites.</p> <p>On 23 April the education minister, Yvette Berry, said schools would spend the next four weeks preparing to transition back to face-to-face learning.</p> <p>\u201c[Four] weeks ago today our community was planning for a very very long time in isolation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was looking like months. At least one term of school. Possibly longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut things are changing fast as we navigate our way through this pandemic together. It\u2019s constant.

      "bodyText": "The position of the federal and state governments on whether to send children to school in term two while coronavirus social distancing rules are in force has many parents confused. Throughout March the Morrison government opposed school closures on the basis of medical advice, but the issue was forced by Victoria bringing forward its school holidays, and other states and territories introducing pupil-free days to prepare for online learning. Now, with holidays ending and health results showing the spread of coronavirus has slowed, the national cabinet, states and territories are revisiting their guidance about whether to continue learning at home or send children to school. What do the federal government and national cabinet say? On 9 April the federal education minister, Dan Tehan, ordered independent schools to reopen. On 12 April, he said the federal government \u201cwants all schools open\u201d. Tehan noted states and territories had \u201cput in place different arrangements\u201d. \u201cBut what the nationally consistent approach is, when it comes to parents who have to work and vulnerable children, schools have to be open and have to make sure that they provide a safe learning environment for those children.\u201d On 15 April Scott Morrison posted a video on Facebook, in which he thanked teachers for keeping schools open, and said it was \u201cso important that children are able to keep going physically to school\u201d. On 16 April the national cabinet declared that education was best delivered in the classroom but states run their education systems based on their own advice, so states are still free to pursue different approaches. NSW Term two dates: 27 April\u20133 July Position on schools: State schools have remained open but in-person attendance fell to 5% in the first week of April after the NSW government encouraged parents to have their children study at home if they were able. On 21 April the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, announced planned for a phased return to face-to-face learning starting on week three of term two, from 11 May. \u201cUnder these changes \u2026 every student will be attending school for one day a week,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will look to increase the number of days students are at school in a staged way and hope to have all children back at school full-time by term 3.\u201d At first, about a quarter of a school\u2019s students are expected to be on site at any one time, with individual schools expected to tell parents when their child should attend. Victoria Term two dates: 14 April\u201326 June The first day of term two was a student-free day. Students were still expected to start from Wednesday 15 April. Position on schools: On 7 April the Victorian government advised that \u201cmost students will be educated from home when term two starts to ensure physical distancing helps slow the spread of coronavirus\u201d. Free internet access and laptops will be provided for students who need them. Onsite learning will only be available for children whose parents cannot work from home and vulnerable students without access to a suitable learning environment. On 15 April the state\u2019s chief medical officer, Brett Sutton, said on Twitter his advice to the Victorian government \u201cwas and continues to be that to slow the spread of coronavirus, schools should undertake remote learning for term two\u201d. But he added: \u201cSchools are not \u2018dangerous places\u2019 and parents should feel comfortable sending their kids to school \u2013 if they need to. But the mix of onsite &amp; offsite learning supports better physical distancing overall, reducing risk as we drive new cases down. As risk changes, we\u2019ll reassess.\u201d Queensland Term two dates: 20 April\u201326 June Position on schools: On 13 April, the Queensland government announced that for the first five weeks of term two, from 20 April to 22 May, the state would use remote learning or learning from home. The education minister, Grace Grace, said the government would re-evaluate around 15 May. Children of essential workers can continue to attend in person because schools will remain open. School staff, unless they were vulnerable due to medical conditions, would continue to teach from the classroom so they had access to school resources to deliver online learning, she said. ACT Term 2 dates: 28 April\u20133 July Position on schools: ACT public schools prepared to move to remote learning in term two, with most public school students expected to undertake their learning from home. For parents and carers who cannot keep their children at home, due to work or additional needs, the ACT government will provide supervision at a reduced number of public school sites. On 23 April the education minister, Yvette Berry, said schools would spend the next four weeks preparing to transition back to face-to-face learning. \u201c[Four] weeks ago today our community was planning for a very very long time in isolation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was looking like months. At least one term of school. Possibly longer.\u201d \u201cBut things are changing fast as we navigate our way through this pandemic together. It\u2019s constant. And we are changing with it as the circumstances change.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know the time frame at this stage for when ACT schools will transition to face-to-face.\u201d South Australia Term two dates: 27 April\u20133 July Position on schools: In South Australia, the advice of the chief public health officer is that schools, preschools and early childhood services should remain open. Parents can choose to keep their children at home. The education department has written to parents ahead of term three urging them to send their children to school but accepting that if they \u201cdon\u2019t feel comfortable \u2026 for whatever reason\u201d they are not obliged to. Western Australia Term 2 dates: 29 April\u20133 July Position on schools: From 26 March, families were encouraged to keep children at home, if they could access the online or other resources for their education to continue. School holidays began at the Easter weekend. On 17 April the government announced a \u201csoft term two opening\u201d. All public schools will be open, with year 11 and 12 students \u201cstrongly encouraged to attend\u201d although parents can choose whether or not to send their kids to school. For those students who learn at home, distance education packages and resources, including online resources where possible, will be provided so all students can continue to learn. The arrangements will be reviewed before the start of week four (18 May). Tasmania Term two dates: 28 April\u20133 July Position on schools: Teachers are preparing to continue delivering learning from home, but parents are advised that \u201cif you have to send your children to school, we will continue to provide a safe environment for them and support their learning\u201d. Northern Territory Term two dates: Begins 20 April. Position on schools: Unless a school contacts parents directly with alternative arrangements, children are to physically attend school. Exceptions can be made for parents who have informed the school their child will be learning from home.",

      "bodyText": "Local authorities in Japan are sacrificing tens of thousands of flowers to deter visitors, as the country attempts to contain the coronavirus outbreak. Tiptoeing through the tulips or breathing in the scent of roses are popular spring rites in Japan, but there is concern that flower festivals could become the source of new infection clusters. This week workers began severing the buds of about 3,000 rose bushes at Yono park in Saitama, north of Tokyo, in an attempt to keep flower viewers away. The local government had already cancelled the annual rose festival, but the park is still open to the public, prompting the decision to rid the venue of its main attraction \u2013 180 varieties of rose bushes that reach their peak from around the middle of May. \u201cIt\u2019s very painful, but we decided to take action after looking at the situation in other cities,\u201d a local official told the Mainichi newspaper, adding that it would take about a week to remove all the buds. Japan reported more than 430 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, bringing the country\u2019s total to more than 12,000, public broadcaster NHK quoted health ministry officials as saying. The virus has killed more than 300 people in Japan, with 29 deaths reported on Thursday. Those figures do not include 712 infections and 13 deaths linked to the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined in Yokohama in February. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, declared a state of emergency on 7 April, encouraging people to avoid unnecessary outings and to observe social distancing. The governor of Tokyo, Yuriko Koike, on Thursday urged residents in the capital to shop for food less frequently to reduce the risk of spreading the virus at supermarkets and shopping arcades, many of which remain crowded. Koike said the 12 days starting from Saturday \u2013 a period that includes the Golden Week public holidays \u2013 would be an opportunity for the city\u2019s 13.4 million people to \u201cstay home and save lives\u201d. The move to prune the roses hasn\u2019t gone down well with some residents. \u201cThe roses at their best are worth seeing every year,\u201d a 76-year-old man who regularly visits the park, told the newspaper. \u201cI think it\u2019s a waste, but we have no choice.\u201d In Sakura, a town 50km east of Tokyo, officials razed more than 100,000 tulip stems and cancelled its annual festival after crowds defied social distancing guidelines during the coronavirus emergency. \u201cMany visitors came at the weekend when the flowers were in full bloom,\u201d Sakiho Kusano, a local tourism official, told Reuters. \u201cIt became a mass gathering, so we had no choice but to make the decision to cut the flowers.\u201d Flower lovers will have to wait until next year to see the pink and red tulips carpeting the 7,000-square-metre Sakura Furusato Hiroba venue. \u201cIt\u2019s, very, very unfortunate.

Let\u2019s hope that the same kinds of individualism and selfishness don\u2019t undermine our collective efforts in the real world, where the stakes are so much higher.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Too Hot to Handle is streaming now on Netflix</em></p>",

When it comes to lockdown, if everyone decides that visiting their friend, family or lover is OK, then our collective action to stop the spread of the virus evaporates. What both situations reveal is the fantasy of individualism. Covid-19 is not a problem that can be resolved on an individual level. It requires all of us to act in concert. And while you might think a dating show where people compete purely for money is as individualistic as it gets, Too Hot To Handle proves that wrong. The contestants can only prevail through solidarity and a collective commitment to remaining sexually unsatisfied. But the problem in Too Hot To Handle, just like in the real world, is that human beings don\u2019t behave in a purely rational way. You can explain Kantian ethics all you like, but if someone\u2019s desperate for a shag, whether they\u2019re on a reality show or in lockdown, they probably won\u2019t act rationally. \u201cThe way to actually convince people is based on collective identity, solidarity and collective shame,\u201d Dr Beard says. Unfortunately, the attempts to build a sense of unity and purpose in Too Hot To Handle don\u2019t really work out. Let\u2019s hope that the same kinds of individualism and selfishness don\u2019t undermine our collective efforts in the real world, where the stakes are so much higher. \u2022 Too Hot to Handle is streaming now on Netflix",

But for local newspapers, already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/01/news-corp-to-suspend-print-editions-of-60-local-newspapers-as-advertising-revenue-slumps\">struggling if not suspended during the crisis</a>, it was a deadly blow. News Corp has suspended 60 of its community papers and Australian Community Media has stopped printing at least 85 and closed four printing presses.</p> <p>The government has now removed the requirement for council notices to be advertised in newspapers, instead giving them the option of putting all public notices on their websites.</p> <p>Helen Dalton, the member for Murray, said the government had effectively robbed regional papers of their last reliable source of revenue.</p> <p>\u201cWhy on earth would they do this now of all times? It\u2019s as if they want newspapers to die,\u201d Dalton told Weekly Beast. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to a number of regional editors, and they are very frustrated by the lack of NSW government support and advertising.</p> <p>\u201cMany elderly residents are not on the internet. How will they stay informed during the pandemic? Murray Darling water corruption, dodgy council decisions, rural hospital downgrades \u2013 often these big issues are only scrutinised by rural papers.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for News Corp Australia said it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d when local government didn\u2019t support local media. The community relied on public notices in newspapers for information about their local area, he said.</p> <p>Hancock\u2019s office said the government\u2019s hand was forced by the closure of so many papers, and the councils still had the option of advertising with newspapers online or in print if they wished.</p> <p>\u201cThe NSW government will continue to work with local councils to identify, develop and implement more measures to support them and their local communities during the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d Hancock said.</p> <h2>Rating Turnbull</h2> <p>Perhaps proving Turnbull\u2019s critique that the Murdoch media \u201cattacks its enemies and protects its friends\u201d News Corp staffers lined up to pour scorn on the former prime minister\u2019s memoir, which was published by Hardie Grant this week.</p> <p>And it wasn\u2019t just commentators Troy Bramston, Chris Kenny and Paul Murray who had harsh words for the former prime minister, it was even a theme in the Australian\u2019s TV ratings report.</p> <p>\u201cMalcolm Turnbull\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/credlin-ran-abbott-government-turnbull-claims-in-abc-interview/news-story/4725ea19b4cd8ad9798c6e79f38fe194\">much-hyped interview on ABC\u2019s 7.30 television program</a> about his divisive memoir failed to crack the 1 million audience barrier,\u201d the Australian\u2019s media reporter wrote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TroyBramston/status/1252753744984301569\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On interviewing Malcolm Turnbull: I&#39;ve interviewed 10 PMs, asked them all tough questions, but never had any intimidate me by threatening to cancel the interview, telling me my questions were pointless or that it was a useless exercise <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNewsAust?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SkyNewsAust</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#auspol</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/O5H920bnD5\">https://t.co/O5H920bnD5</a></p>&mdash; Troy Bramston (@TroyBramston) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TroyBramston/status/1252753744984301569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 22, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cThe former prime minister\u2019s lengthy interview about his book, A Bigger Picture, with 7.30 host Leigh Sales was watched by 940,000 metropolitan viewers on Monday night, ranking eighth on the TV ratings table.\u201d</p> <p>Now in fact an audience of close to 1 million in 2020 is a hit in anyone\u2019s book.</p> <p>As ratings guru <a href=\"https://tvtonight.com.au/2020/04/turnbull-interview-draws-big-crowd-on-monday.html\">David Knox from TV Tonight</a> wrote: \u201cABC\u2019s interview with former PM Malcolm Turnbull drew a big audience in what was generally a big night all round.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, the interview was (unsurprisingly) beaten by Nine\u2019s reality hit Lego Masters, but the number of people who tuned in for Sales\u2019 showdown with Turnbull was significantly up on a usual 7.30 night by some 200,000.

      "bodyText": "The ABC\u2019s health editor, Norman Swan, is not just ubiquitous in Australia, he\u2019s gone global. When his daily podcast addressed the topic of farting and the coronavirus last Friday the world\u2019s media found it irresistible, with some failing to catch the tongue-in-cheek tone of Swan\u2019s original remarks, when he said a fart could spread the virus because it was aerosolised and that we should ban \u201cbare-bottom farting\u201d. \u201cLuckily, we wear a mask, which covers our farts all the time,\u201d Swan said referring to the fact we usually wear pants when around other people. The New York Post relished the topic: \u201cThe smell may be hell but the mist could leave you pissed. Two Australian doctors are weighing in about the spread of the coronavirus \u2018down under\u2019 \u2014 whether it can be spread through farts, that is.\u201d US conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh took time out from saying the coronavirus was being \u201cweaponised\u201d by the media to bring down Donald Trump, to highlight Swan\u2019s comments. \u201cBy the way, my friends, there could be another way of both spreading and acquiring the coronavirus, and we owe this discovery to our great friends in Australia, the Australian Broadcasting Company [sic],\u201d Limbaugh said, before playing an excerpt from Coronacast: \u201cNorman Swan, the doctor, is who says we gotta stop farting, and we gotta stop farting \u2026\u201d The Toronto Sun said \u201cwe have hit a stinky new COVID-19 low\u201d but warned that there was no conclusive study that \u201cass gas is a COVID threat\u201d. But you know you\u2019ve really made it internationally when you\u2019re featured on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Swan, who was once again targeted by the Australian for allegedly seeking \u201ccash for coronavirus\u201d when an educational video company he is associated with unsuccessfully bid for a government contract, is unfazed by the attention. \u201cNext to breathing and eating, farting is core to human existence,\u201d Swan told Weekly Beast. \u201cBut unlike eating and breathing, farting never fails to amuse \u2013 unless of course it\u2019s too close for comfort. \u201cAt Coronacast we\u2019re proud that we\u2019ve been able to make the world\u2019s farting safer. And given the threat of aerosolisation, I\u2019m reminded of one Vietnam War correspondent who claimed: \u2018Happiness is a dry fart.\u2019\u201d Local blow The New South Wales minister for local government, Shelley Hancock, quietly dropped some new rules for councils last week, apparently designed to give flexibility for councils and ratepayers during the pandemic. But for local newspapers, already struggling if not suspended during the crisis, it was a deadly blow. News Corp has suspended 60 of its community papers and Australian Community Media has stopped printing at least 85 and closed four printing presses. The government has now removed the requirement for council notices to be advertised in newspapers, instead giving them the option of putting all public notices on their websites. Helen Dalton, the member for Murray, said the government had effectively robbed regional papers of their last reliable source of revenue. \u201cWhy on earth would they do this now of all times? It\u2019s as if they want newspapers to die,\u201d Dalton told Weekly Beast. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to a number of regional editors, and they are very frustrated by the lack of NSW government support and advertising. \u201cMany elderly residents are not on the internet. How will they stay informed during the pandemic? Murray Darling water corruption, dodgy council decisions, rural hospital downgrades \u2013 often these big issues are only scrutinised by rural papers.\u201d A spokesman for News Corp Australia said it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d when local government didn\u2019t support local media. The community relied on public notices in newspapers for information about their local area, he said. Hancock\u2019s office said the government\u2019s hand was forced by the closure of so many papers, and the councils still had the option of advertising with newspapers online or in print if they wished. \u201cThe NSW government will continue to work with local councils to identify, develop and implement more measures to support them and their local communities during the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d Hancock said. Rating Turnbull Perhaps proving Turnbull\u2019s critique that the Murdoch media \u201cattacks its enemies and protects its friends\u201d News Corp staffers lined up to pour scorn on the former prime minister\u2019s memoir, which was published by Hardie Grant this week. And it wasn\u2019t just commentators Troy Bramston, Chris Kenny and Paul Murray who had harsh words for the former prime minister, it was even a theme in the Australian\u2019s TV ratings report. \u201cMalcolm Turnbull\u2019s much-hyped interview on ABC\u2019s 7.30 television program about his divisive memoir failed to crack the 1 million audience barrier,\u201d the Australian\u2019s media reporter wrote. \u201cThe former prime minister\u2019s lengthy interview about his book, A Bigger Picture, with 7.30 host Leigh Sales was watched by 940,000 metropolitan viewers on Monday night, ranking eighth on the TV ratings table.\u201d Now in fact an audience of close to 1 million in 2020 is a hit in anyone\u2019s book. As ratings guru David Knox from TV Tonight wrote: \u201cABC\u2019s interview with former PM Malcolm Turnbull drew a big audience in what was generally a big night all round.\u201d Yes, the interview was (unsurprisingly) beaten by Nine\u2019s reality hit Lego Masters, but the number of people who tuned in for Sales\u2019 showdown with Turnbull was significantly up on a usual 7.30 night by some 200,000. When the regional and catch-up audience was factored in it would be well over 1 million. Greg versus the relentless behemoth The Australian\u2019s foreign editor Greg Sheridan appeared on the ABC three times in two days: on ABC TV\u2019s Insiders on Sunday, ABC Melbourne radio on Monday morning and then as a panelist on The Drum on Monday night. It\u2019s a rare media organisation that would repeatedly host a virulent critic who days earlier wrote that the ABC was a \u201crelentless behemoth of unaccountable and vindictive power that persecutes designated enemies in a grievously unfair and unprofessional way\u201d. While Sheridan was given free rein on Insiders to accuse the ABC of using its \u201cgiant power\u201d against a single individual \u2013 his friend George Pell \u2013 he was challenged on some of his assertions on Virginia Trioli\u2019s radio program. On Insiders Sheridan said the ABC across its news and current affairs and comedy and entertainment programs was \u201ctremendously unfair to George Pell\u201d, and mentioned Tim Minchin\u2019s song Come Home (Cardinal Pell). But the charity song was not an ABC production. Minchin first performed the song publicly on Channel 10\u2019s The Project in 2016. An ABC spokeswoman told Beast the corporation \u201chad nothing to do with satirist Tim Minchin\u2019s song Come Home (Cardinal Pell) beyond reporting on it, as did most major news outlets\u201d. \u201cWhen the song was released in Australia in February 2016 it created much controversy which was clearly newsworthy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe editorial advice to News and Radio was to use the song carefully and in its news context. Its exposure on the ABC was not excessive.\u201d Trioli challenged him, and asked him if he\u2019d like to \u201ccorrect the record that the ABC was somehow involved when the ABC wasn\u2019t\u201d. Sheridan was mightily affronted and told Trioli she was wrong. \u201cAs ever the ABC has a glass jaw and its personalities like to dish out punishment and to gang up on innocent human beings in a way that constitutes a breach of human rights in this country,\u201d Sheridan said before hanging up. \u201cWhat was that he said about glass jaws?\u201d Trioli asked. ABC restores Pell episode Ten days after it was taken down, the third episode of the ABC\u2019s documentary series Revelation, which includes previously unheard details of allegations against Pell, has been returned to iview. The episode aired before Pell was freed from prison and had his convictions overturned. \u201cIn response to the high court\u2019s decision regarding Cardinal George Pell, the ABC has temporarily removed episode three of Revelation from its platforms while updating its content,\u201d a spokesman for the ABC said earlier this month. On Monday an edited version of the episode went live, with a new opening featuring a piece to camera from Sarah Ferguson about the high court verdict. Footage of Andrew Bolt defending Pell on Sky News is included. But all the original allegations remain. Lockdown silver lining There\u2019s a silver lining in the forced slowdown of TV production due to the coronavirus. The ABC has launched a $5m development fund to \u201cprovide urgent and critical support to independent Australian producers and safeguard local content and creativity during these unprecedented times\u201d. With the broadcaster already facing restrictions from looming budget cuts, sources say it has managed to scrape together the cash by saving money on travel and from reduced operating costs on productions due to Covid-19 restrictions. \u201cThe ABC\u2019s Fresh Start Fund will support the sustainability and growth of Australia\u2019s production industry during the Covid-19 shutdown and supercharge the development of new Australian content for audiences across multiple genres, including drama, comedy, children\u2019s, factual, music and the arts,\u201d the ABC said. NRL sabotage? Depends who\u2019s reporting Readers of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Daily Telegraph may be confused about when the NRL season is going to start. The animosity between the NRL and free-to-air broadcast partner Nine over when the coronavirus-delayed footy season will kick in again is playing out in the newspapers, with differing takes appearing in the Tele, owned by News Corp, and the SMH, owned by Nine. While the Herald has the headline: \u201cChannel Nine slams brakes on \u2018premature\u2019 May 28 NRL restart\u201d, the Telegraph, owned by News Corp, leads with \u201cChannel 9 Footy Sabotage\u201d and reports that Nine\u2019s determination to delay the start is frustrating fans and players alike. Fox Sports, owned by News Corp, is in dire straits without live sport and has had to lay off staff in recent weeks. The sooner the play resumes the better for News Corp\u2019s business model.",

Thanks to the worldwide pandemic we\u2019re all dealing with, this year\u2019s NFL Draft is being held remotely. What has traditionally been a slick, made-for-television spectacle will now be something of a chaotic jumble. The players themselves will be responsible for providing their own camerawork which, as we learned from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/apr/12/nba-horse-tournament-espn-basketball-chris-paul-trae-young-live\" style=\"background-color: rgb(246, 246, 246);\">ESPN\u2019s Horse Tournament</a>, could give this whole affair a DIY feel.<br></p> <p>Considering the restrictions imposed upon them by the COVID-19 outbreak, the NFL should consider itself relieved that they have found a way to hold the draft at all.

In the meantime here\u2019s a look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/23/nfl-2020-mock-draft-joe-burrow-chase-young-football\">Graham Searles\u2019 projected picks</a> for tonight\u2019s first round.</p> <blockquote> <h2><strong>1) Cincinnati Bengals</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joe-burrow?id=32194255-5267-9731-81c8-48673dcec5e2\">Joe Burrow, quarterback, LSU</a>.</strong> The Bengals have to take Burrow. He has the potential to lead them for the next 15 years and to finally get Cincinnati that playoff win Andy Dalton failed to provide. Burrow excelled in his final year at LSU leading the Tigers to an undefeated college championship. Burrow completed 76.3% of his passes for 5,671 yards, 60 touchdowns and six interceptions. Free agency showed a new era may be dawning in Cincinnati and Burrow is the man to make it concrete.</p> <h2><strong>2) Washington</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chase-young?id=3219594f-5514-6550-d662-263c81d981b1\">Chase Young, edge rusher, Ohio State</a>.</strong> Washington have a no-brainer of their own in Young. Ron Rivera can build a strong defensive identity with a player following in the footsteps of premium Ohio State edge defenders, Joey and Nick Bosa. A 6ft 5in wrecking-ball whose tremendous speed off the line allowed him to rack up 16.5 sacks, 21.5 tackles for a loss and seven forced fumbles across 12 games in 2019. Tua Tagovailoa could be an upgrade on Dwayne Haskins but the inability to assess the quarterback\u2019s fitness up close makes Young the sensible pick.</p> <h2><strong>3) Detroit Lions</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeffrey-okudah?id=32194f4b-5519-2813-7f59-b79efab52dd1\">Jeffrey Okudah, cornerback, Ohio State</a>.</strong> The Lions need a replacement for Darius Slay after trading him to Philadelphia. Okudah can slip straight into Slay\u2019s role as Detroit\u2019s leader in the backfield and make an impact as the best shutdown corner entering the league.</p> <h2><strong>4) New York Giants</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jedrick-wills?id=32195749-4c62-6320-8b63-20c37d057bf8\">Jedrick Wills, offensive tackle, Alabama</a>.</strong> Offensive line is a must-upgrade for the Giants. Wills, Mekhi Becton and Tristan Wirfs all would do exactly that for head coach, Joe Judge, but Wills makes sense as Judge was once Nick Saban\u2019s assistant in Alabama. Familiarity tips the scales in Wills\u2019s favour without the ability to meet with prospects this year owing to lockdown.</p> <h2><strong>5) Miami Dolphins</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-herbert?id=32194845-5203-1169-a699-ce41d700202a\">Justin Herbert, quarterback, Oregon</a>.</strong> The Dolphins can pick from the best of the rest with Burrow off the board. Herbert gets the nod over Tagovailoa due to the latter\u2019s fitness problems. His 6ft 6in frame and huge arm pass the eye test. Three rushing touchdowns against Wisconsin in Oregon\u2019s Rose Bowl victory showed he can shift when needed too.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/23/nfl-2020-mock-draft-joe-burrow-chase-young-football\">NFL 2020 mock draft: Joe Burrow is No1 but who are the sleeper picks?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

Despite all the logistical headaches, the end result was, interestingly enough, one of the least surprising drafts that I can remember. Beyond the Packers\u2019 surprise pick of quarterback Jordan Love, there weren\u2019t many controversial selections and only two trades, both of them relatively minor. Under different circumstances, maybe there would be a reason to complain, but with everything else going on right now it\u2019s not like are particularly starved for drama. In any case, that will do it for our live coverage of the NFL draft for tonight. Thanks to everybody who followed along with us today, particularly those who contributed. Ciao! 32. Kansas City Chiefs: Clyde Edwards-Helaire, RB, LSU And we\u2019re here at the final pick of the first round as the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs. They take the first running back of the draft and the only one in the first round. 31. Minnesota Vikings: Jeff Gladney, CB, TCU The Vikings select Jeff Gladney out of Texas Christian. 30. Miami Dolphins: Noah Igbinoghene, CB, Auburn The Packers were going to be picking here but they traded up in order to create a quarterback controversy that we could all talk about. That was basically the only major surprise of the draft so far. The Dolphins pick Auburn cornerback Noah Igbinoghene. It\u2019s weird that after all the conversation about the million ways that this draft could go wrong, it might actually end up being one of the most drama-free first rounds I can recall. 29. Tennessee Titans: Isaiah Wilson, OT, Georgia The Titans, who ended Tom Brady\u2019s New England career and came within a game of the Super Bowl last year, get a big guy for their offensive line. 28. Baltimore Ravens: Patrick Queen, ILB, LSU Goodell is somehow getting worse at reading his scripted lines as the night goes on. The Ravens select Patrick Queen out of LSU. Interestingly, he is the first player the Ravens have ever drafted out of the Baton Rouge school in 24 drafts. I won\u2019t lie. I\u2019m kind of angry at this joke. 27. Seattle Seahawks: Jordyn Brooks, ILB, Texas Tech The Seahawks take Jordyn Brooks, a speedy inside linebacker to shore up their defense. This still on? So, all Love has to do is follow in the footsteps of Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers. No pressure. 26. Green Bay Packers: Jordan Love, QB, Utah State The Dolphins were on the clock, but they just traded that pick to the Packers and they choose Jordan Love. That\u2019s a surprise considering quarterback isn\u2019t an obvious need for Green Bay with Aaron Rodgers having thrown for 51 touchdowns and six interceptions over the last two seasons. But Rodgers turns 37 in December and they appear to be earmarking his successor. Love has a strong arm, plenty of talent, and a 20:17 touchdown-to-interception ratio last year. He\u2019s capable of huge plays and jaw-dropping turnovers, in roughly equal amounts. He feels like the second coming of Jameis Winston, but without the troubling rap sheet. 25. San Francisco 49ers: Brandon Aiyuk, WR, Arizona State The 49ers trade up to get this pick, which was the Vikings\u2019 selection. They go for a receiver, in this case Brandon Aiyuk out of Arizona State. 24. New Orleans Saints: Cesar Ruiz, C, Michigan The Saints select Cesar Ruiz. In what\u2019s becoming a trend here, Ruiz has a sad backstory here as well as he lost his father at a young age in a tragic accident. Honestly, this is the one draft day tradition that I\u2019m rather glad we left behind. 23. Los Angeles Chargers: Kenneth Murray, LB, Oklahoma This would have been the New England Patriots\u2019 spot if they hadn\u2019t traded down because that\u2019s what the Patriots do. The Chargers go for one of the best defensive players on the board. 22. Minnesota Vikings: Justin Jefferson, WR, LSU The Vikings get themselves a nifty receiver here, a big need after the departure of Stefon Diggs. Shocker number two: the Patriots might be trading down. This really might be the most predictable NFL draft in my lifetime. This may come as a massive shock, but the response from Eagles fans about their draft pick was not unanimously positive. 21. Philadelphia Eagles: Jalen Reagor, WR, TCU The Eagles, badly in need of talent on the outside (on both sides of the ball, really), go for an offensive weapon here, taking Texas Christian receiver Jalen Reagor. 20. Jacksonville Jaguars: K\u2019Lavon Chaisson, Edge Rusher, LSU Chaisson missed 2018 with a torn ACL but had a comeback season in 2019, where he record 6.5 sacks and racked up 60 tackles. His overall track record isn\u2019t great \u2013 again, coming back from a serious injury did him no favors \u2013 but it\u2019s possible that he\u2019s only shown glimpses of his potential. Let\u2019s Try This Again Department: Goodell announced that the Raiders would host the 2020 NFL draft, which they wouldn\u2019t because that is this draft. I took to mean that he mispoke and he meant next year\u2019s draft. It turns out he actually meant the 2022 draft would be in Las Vegas, as 2021 is already set for Cleveland. So there we are. 19. Las Vegas Raiders: Damon Arnette, CB, Ohio State Las Vegas was supposed to host the draft this year, Goodell announces that they host a non-virtual draft next year. The Raiders choose Ohio State\u2019s Damon Arnette to help shore up their defense. It\u2019s hard not to root for Jackson after seeing him go through a bone marrow transplant to keep his sister alive. Just a powerful segment. 18. Miami Dolphins: Austin Jackson, OT, USC The Dolphins go for offensive tackle Austin Jackson from Southern Cal. I am sensing a theme. 17. Dallas Cowboys: CeeDee Lamb, WR, Oklahoma The Cowboys might have just stumbled upon the best wide receiver in this draft. He\u2019s coming off a year where he picked up 1,327 yards and 14 touchdowns. Throughout his career he\u2019s averaged 19.0 yards per catch, so you know he\u2019s capable of making the big play. He may not be as fast as teams want from an elite receiver, but he has sure hands. 16. Atlanta Falcons: AJ Terrell, CB, Clemson The Falcons take Clemson\u2019s AJ Terrell as a cornerback. And we\u2019ve hit our first player that I didn\u2019t have a prewritten summary for; usually it happens much earlier, but there haven\u2019t been too many surprises so far. 15. Denver Broncos: Jerry Jeudy, WR, Alabama Jeudy\u2019s key ability just might be his elusiveness, he\u2019s shown an ability to escape the tackle. He has the quickness that fellow receiver CeeDee Lamb doesn\u2019t quite have, but he also had a few drops. There\u2019s some concern that his frame (6ft 1in, 195lbs) might leave him vulnerable in the pros. His production has been consistent, however: he had 68 catches for 14 touchdowns in 2018 and followed it up with 77 catches for 10 scores last year. Email from D. Hamilton on Tua Tagovailoa: Who could forget him fumbling the ball running untouched in open field in the red zone against LSU? On the first play after Trump had been introduced to the crowd. And LSU taking that recovered possession the length of the field for a TD. And recovering a muffed 4th down snap on the next series and scoring a field goal, en route to a 33-13 half time lead and a famous win in Tuscaloosa Trump leaves at half time. Crowd chants \u2018Lock him out\u2019. Unforgettable. 14. San Francisco 49ers: Javon Kinlaw, DT, South Carolina The 49ers select Javon Kinlaw. The 22-year-old senior is coming off a six-sack, 35-tackle year with South Carolina. He\u2019s a bit older than some of the other players being chosen here, but the additional experience might do him well. He\u2019s a team captain, well-respected by his peers and has all of those intangibles that NFL teams at least claim they appreciate. More importantly, he can completely discombobulate opposing offenses. And his dad may have just stolen the show. The details on that (rather underwhelming) trade: 13. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Tristan Wirfs, OT, Iowa The San Francisco 49ers trade picks with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and they choose Wirfs, who is 6ft 5in and 320lbs yet quick on his feet, a combination of size and agility that should allow for him to easily adjust to the NFL. He could potentially be the most dominant offensive lineman in the draft. His job is going to be protecting maybe the best quarterback in NFL history. Also, this ... https://twitter.com/MaxPreps/status/1253503273484660737/ Visual evidence: OK, Ruggs was wearing a robe while being drafted and he\u2019s maybe my new favorite player. Also check out his basketball moves: 12. Las Vegas Raiders: Henry Ruggs III, WR, Alabama Yet another Alabama alumnus. Of the 98 receptions he recorded with the Crimson Tide, 24 of them went for touchdowns. He\u2019s very quick and very dangerous, although he doesn\u2019t seem to be much of an every-down type of player. What\u2019s that old complaint: \u201cAll he does is catch touchdowns?\u201d The Raiders are on the clock, leaving me to ponder when my brain will start accepting the \u201cLas Vegas Raiders\u201d as an actual sports team and not the title a weird, 90\u2019s action movie. 11. New York Jets: Mekhi Becton, OT, Louisville Becton is 6ft 7in and 364lbs. He is coming off winning the Jacobs Blocking Trophy and received first team all-ACC honors. He has a 7ft wingspan, the kind that makes one wonder if he maybe he could try out for the NBA (assuming that this will exist in the near future). There might be some concerns that his weight could become a problem, but that\u2019s not a major concern given his position. If the New York Jets make a pick without their fans being able to boo it, have they really made a pick? 10. Cleveland Browns: Jedrick Wills Jr, OT, Alabama Never mind about the production values; they just totally cut back to Roger Goodell before he was ready. The Browns choose Jedrick Wills Jr. Unlike fourth pick Andrew Thomas, Wills has exclusively played as a right tackle so far, but he\u2019s an absolute monster at the position. During his 2019 season for Alabama, he gave up just a single sack in 714 snaps. He\u2019s not super-speedy, but he makes up for it with brute strength. 9. Jacksonville Jaguars: CJ Henderson, CB, Florida The weird thing about this draft is that it hasn\u2019t been that weird. Everything\u2019s basically playing out as expected so far. Henderson is super-fast and super-talented. He also had zero interceptions last year. He might have the most talent of any cornerback in the draft but he also is coming off a somewhat down year marked by an ankle injury and some questions about his tackling. He feels like a player who is either going to be a star or a bust, with little in-between. And now we\u2019re getting a weird, awkward conversation via television between Goodell and Burrow. It should be noted that there have been absolutely no technical hiccups here so far, it\u2019s been rather smooth going. 8. Arizona Cardinals: Isaiah Simmons, lots of different things, Clemson I was about to ask whether Simmons was going to be the player to unexpectedly fall this draft, but the Cardinals are one step ahead of me. It\u2019s impossible to summarize what exactly Isaiah Simmons is and what he could be in the NFL. His main selling point is that he doesn\u2019t really have a position, as he skips between linebacker, safety, pash-rusher and cornerback. Maybe that will frustrate some teams, it\u2019s nice to know exactly what you\u2019re getting in and whether or not he will fit your needs, but in the modern NFL, there\u2019s something to be said about a player you can shift from position-to-position based on the situation. In any case, the 100+ tackles and 8 sacks he picked up last season certainly look eye-popping no matter where he ends up playing. 7. Carolina Panthers: Derrick Brown, DT, Auburn The Panthers take Auburn\u2019s Derrick Brown. I\u2019m going to be lazy here and just quote a tweet from Pro Football Focus: \u201cDerrick Brown didn\u2019t miss a single tackle on 42 attempts all season and had a 90.6 pass-rushing grade.\u201d He can also play a little nose-tackle and is difficult to block no matter where ends up. The dude is strong is what I\u2019m getting at. 6. Los Angeles Chargers: Justin Herbert, QB, Oregon At 6ft 6in, he\u2019s the kind of tall, strong-armed quarterback that would perfectly fit the role if you were casting a movie. He threw for 32 touchdowns and just six interceptions in his last season with Oregon. Herbert looks to be a solid QB in the NFL, but there are questions about whether he could be the type of player that can truly stand out at the highest level or whether he\u2019s another Brock Osweiler. OK, maybe I was wrong about how players dress for this stay-at-home draft. 5. Miami Dolphins: Tua Tagovailoa, QB, Alabama They very much do take a quarterback and possibly the steal of the draft. Tagovailoa is one of the biggest names in this field. In another universe, Tagovailoa is the first overall draft pick. That is not this universe, as he suffered a dislocated hip back in November. During his Alabama career he boasted a ridiculous touchdown percentage, 12.7% (the best in Division I history by a lot), and he\u2019s a dynamic rusher as well. And who could forget when he came off the bench at halftime to lead Alabama to an unforgettable comeback win over Georgia in the 2017 national championship game. The only question is: how healthy will he be and how healthy can he remain? Miami Dolphins are on the clock, the question here is whether or not they go for a quarterback here. 4. New York Giants: Andrew Thomas, OT. Georgia While he\u2019s not quite at Isaiah Simmons levels of versatility, Thomas has played 15 games at right tackle and 26 games at left. Thomas has been impressive at preventing pressures but needs work at being a more consistent blocker. Not everyone is happy with the Joe Burrow/Cam Newton comparison: Email from Nyles Glynn: Dude, Cam Newton is currently without a team! That is fair enough, but that has more to do with Newton\u2019s injury history than his talent. 3. Detroit Lions: Jeff Okudah, CB, Ohio State Detroit takes Ohio State\u2019s Jeff Okudah with the third pick. One of those players whose talent and potential makes him look better than what the numbers might tell you (he has three career interceptions, for one thing). He\u2019s shown a gift at excelling in man-to-man coverage and has the flat-out speed that should make him an effective starter right out of the gate. One of those players who might find himself at the professional level. Chase Young is not just a great player but he\u2019s not a bad singer either. 2. Washington: Chase Young, defensive end, Ohio State Washington, as expected, take Chase Young with the second overall pick. An elite pass rusher, Young is probably the most heralded defensive player in the draft. In his last two seasons Young has 27 sacks, including a record 16.5 in 2019. He was a Heisman finalist, just the ninth defensive player to become one since 1982. How good is Joe Burrow? Well... \u201cThere is only one Tiger King and its Joe Burrow.\u201d That\u2019s some nice SEO work there. There is absolutely no way it should have taken that long to announce that. 1. Cincinnati Bengals: Joe Burrow, QB, LSU The LSU quarterback threw for seven touchdowns in the Tigers\u2019 national semi-final win over Oklahoma. He ended up throwing for an eye-popping 60 touchdowns last year and just six interceptions. Theoretically, some of that success could partially be a product of LSU\u2019s offense but it\u2019s hard to see how a season this incredible could be a mirage. The Cincinnati Bengals are on the clock and, you know, I\u2019m going to make a wild guess and say that they will pick Joe Burrow. And here we have Dr Fauci talking about social distancing. And Roger Goodell pops up and encourages us all to boo him from home, to keep up the tradition of booing the commissioner. Twitter is pointing something out that I completely missed: I don\u2019t recall there ever being a national anthem in any of the previous drafts. Harry Connick Jr plays piano and sings a quick jazzy run through the Star-Spangled Banner. So far, the production values have been about as good as one could possibly expect under the circumstances. Roger Goodell, working from home, starts things off with a salute to all those combating the coronavirus pandemic. And asks us to observe a moment of silence. And we\u2019re officially off! As a sign of this being a very special episode of the NFL Draft, they get Peyton Manning to recite some words on football and hope. It\u2019s not entirely un-cheesy, but it\u2019s well-done. Here\u2019s what our current draft order looks like. It will almost certainly change as teams decide whether they want to make a trade or not. 1. Cincinnati Bengals 2. Washington 3. Detroit Lions 4. New York Giants 5. Miami Dolphins 6. Los Angeles Chargers 7. Carolina Panthers 8. Arizona Cardinals 9. Jacksonville Jaguars 10. Cleveland Browns 11 New York Jets 12. Las Vegas Raiders 13. San Francisco 49ers (from Indianapolis) 14. Tampa Bay Buccaneers 15. Denver Broncos 16. Atlanta Falcons 17. Dallas Cowboys 18. Miami Dolphins (from Pittsburgh) 19. Las Vegas Raiders (from Chicago) 20. Jacksonville Jaguars (from Los Angeles Rams) 21. Philadelphia Eagles 22. Minnesota Vikings (from Buffalo) 23. New England Patriots 24. New Orleans Saints 25. Minnesota Vikings 26. Miami Dolphins (from Houston) 27. Seattle Seahawks 28. Baltimore Ravens 29. Tennessee Titans 30. Green Bay Packers 31. San Francisco 49ers 32. Kansas City Chiefs Meanwhile, ESPN\u2019s coverage paused its football talk to give Jennifer Hudson a chance to sing the late, great Bill Withers\u2019s \u201cLean On Me.\u201d It\u2019s the first of what promises to be many references to our current situation. Those are definitely the top two receivers in this draft class, we\u2019ll see where they end up. Just in case you need any more evidence that we\u2019re all going through the same things: This is not going to be one of the more fashionable drafts in sports history. While you\u2019re waiting here, you might want to read Oliver Connolly\u2019s take on Isaiah Simmons, who almost certainly be a Top 10 pick today, and the future of NFL defenses. Despite that, it\u2019s very possible that this might be the most-watched NFL Draft ever since there literally hasn\u2019t been any live sports for over a month. Last weekend, sports fans found themselves counting down the hours until ESPN aired the first two episodes of its Michael Jordan documentary series. It\u2019s getting really rough and it will be nice to have something to watch where the outcomes aren\u2019t predetermined. Just a note to start things off: this is going to be a strange one. Thanks to the worldwide pandemic we\u2019re all dealing with, this year\u2019s NFL Draft is being held remotely. What has traditionally been a slick, made-for-television spectacle will now be something of a chaotic jumble. The players themselves will be responsible for providing their own camerawork which, as we learned from ESPN\u2019s Horse Tournament, could give this whole affair a DIY feel. Considering the restrictions imposed upon them by the COVID-19 outbreak, the NFL should consider itself relieved that they have found a way to hold the draft at all. To put things mildly, we\u2019re in unchartered waters right now. If you\u2019d like to join the conversation today, feel free to send us an email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or Twitter (@HunterFelt), and we\u2019ll include them in this liveblog as we go on. The 2020 NFL Draft is set to start around 8pm EST, but we\u2019ll be back before then. Hunter will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s a look at Graham Searles\u2019 projected picks for tonight\u2019s first round. 1) Cincinnati Bengals Pick: Joe Burrow, quarterback, LSU. The Bengals have to take Burrow. He has the potential to lead them for the next 15 years and to finally get Cincinnati that playoff win Andy Dalton failed to provide. Burrow excelled in his final year at LSU leading the Tigers to an undefeated college championship. Burrow completed 76.3% of his passes for 5,671 yards, 60 touchdowns and six interceptions. Free agency showed a new era may be dawning in Cincinnati and Burrow is the man to make it concrete. 2) Washington Pick: Chase Young, edge rusher, Ohio State. Washington have a no-brainer of their own in Young. Ron Rivera can build a strong defensive identity with a player following in the footsteps of premium Ohio State edge defenders, Joey and Nick Bosa. A 6ft 5in wrecking-ball whose tremendous speed off the line allowed him to rack up 16.5 sacks, 21.5 tackles for a loss and seven forced fumbles across 12 games in 2019. Tua Tagovailoa could be an upgrade on Dwayne Haskins but the inability to assess the quarterback\u2019s fitness up close makes Young the sensible pick. 3) Detroit Lions Pick: Jeffrey Okudah, cornerback, Ohio State. The Lions need a replacement for Darius Slay after trading him to Philadelphia. Okudah can slip straight into Slay\u2019s role as Detroit\u2019s leader in the backfield and make an impact as the best shutdown corner entering the league. 4) New York Giants Pick: Jedrick Wills, offensive tackle, Alabama. Offensive line is a must-upgrade for the Giants. Wills, Mekhi Becton and Tristan Wirfs all would do exactly that for head coach, Joe Judge, but Wills makes sense as Judge was once Nick Saban\u2019s assistant in Alabama. Familiarity tips the scales in Wills\u2019s favour without the ability to meet with prospects this year owing to lockdown. 5) Miami Dolphins Pick: Justin Herbert, quarterback, Oregon. The Dolphins can pick from the best of the rest with Burrow off the board. Herbert gets the nod over Tagovailoa due to the latter\u2019s fitness problems. His 6ft 6in frame and huge arm pass the eye test. Three rushing touchdowns against Wisconsin in Oregon\u2019s Rose Bowl victory showed he can shift when needed too.",

      "body": "<p>Lucinda Williams has been sleep-talking more than usual. One night last week, she dreamed that Mormons invaded her house, converted her friends and stole her possessions. That wasn\u2019t the issue: \u201cThey were all sitting next to each other, and I said: \u2018Don\u2019t you understand, you\u2019re supposed to be quarantined!\u2019\u201d Williams laughs, her laconic outlaw baritone spilling into a surprising giggle. Her husband and manager, Tom Overby, told her she had grown agitated in her sleep. She thinks it came from the nightly TV marathons that have become their new lockdown routine, staying up until 5am watching the Jewish drama <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81019069\">Unorthodox</a>, \u201conly in my dream they came out as Mormons\u201d.</p> <p>Wiggy dreams are a quarantine staple, but Williams has had a lot to process lately. She and Overby only recently moved to Nashville and don\u2019t yet have any furniture. No sooner had they arrived than a tornado hit the city, taking part of their roof with it. Then coronavirus killed two old friends: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/08/hal-willner-music-producer-and-snl-supervisor-dies-aged-64\">Hal Willner</a>, who produced Williams\u2019s 2007 album, West, and the country musician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/08/john-prine-us-folk-and-country-songwriter-dies-aged-73\">John Prine</a>. She last saw Prine in November when she played his festival in the Dominican Republic. \u201cIt\u2019s been insane,\u201d she says in disbelief, calling from her home.</p> <p>Now aged 67, Williams has written often about death in her 40-year career: songs such as Pineola, Sweet Old World, Lake Charles and Drunken Angel have become alt-country classics, often depicting complex men who might otherwise easily be reduced to caricature. That familiarity doesn\u2019t soften the losses. \u201cI think that\u2019s why I write about death,\u201d she says, her gorgeous accent kneading every vowel, \u201cbecause it\u2019s so hard to deal with.\u201d The subject features less on her new album, <a href=\"https://www.allmusic.com/album/good-souls-better-angels-mw0003357520\">Good Souls Better Angels</a>, although you could say it deals with worse fates: shame, depression, the uncanny horror of watching despots crush the values you hold dear.</p> <p>Williams\u2019s career renaissance started with 2014\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/music/down-where-the-spirit-meets-the-bone/lucinda-williams\">Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone</a>, yet Good Souls is yet another cut above: flinty garage blues that foregrounds the punk spirit Rough Trade recognised when the British label elevated her from relative obscurity with her 1988 self-titled third album. Now releasing her first collection of what she calls \u201ctopical\u201d songs, she has been baffled by critics asking why she wrote them (\u201cBecause I\u2019m frustrated and angry\u201d), or remarking on how \u201cprophetic\u201d Bad News Blues and Man Without a Soul (namely Trump) feel, mid-pandemic. Williams isn\u2019t psychic, just attuned to injustice: she keeps suitcases of unused lyrics dating back to the 1970s and weaves them through her writing. \u201cThere\u2019s always been something going on in this country to rebel against and be pissed off about,\u201d she says.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=272voTjeHy4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/272voTjeHy4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Still, Williams says Trump is \u201cdifferent than anything I\u2019ve ever experienced in my entire lifetime\u201d. She knew \u201call the racism and the intolerance and the bigotry\u201d that he represents was part of the American psyche, \u201cbut I thought it had been suppressed to some degree, or that we had some control over it\u201d. Trump gave people of that mindset \u201cpermission in a subliminal way to come on out of the closet,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018You can hate, you can get your guns and your anger.\u2019\u201d She\u2019s reeling from discovering, via a fractious Facebook thread about Man Without a Soul, that she has fans who are Trump supporters. \u201cThat\u2019s just incongruous,\u201d she says. \u201cHow can those things go together?\u201d Their comments kept her awake one night, although she ultimately found them validating. \u201cIt feels good to rebel. To tell you the honest truth, I don\u2019t mind pushing people\u2019s buttons, y\u2019know? I like to get a reaction out of people.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m not trying to say: \u2018Poor Ryan, he was all misunderstood.\u2019 I\u2019m just taking the situation and turning it into a song</p> <footer> <cite>Lucinda Williams</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Williams is no cheap rabble-rouser: it is her insistence on compassion and complexity that is provocative. There is pity even in Man Without a Soul. On the new song Wakin\u2019 Up, she reflects on an abusive relationship she was in around 2003. \u201cPulled the kitchen chair out from under me / He pulled my hair and then he kicks me / Next thing I swear, he wants to kiss on me,\u201d she rasps over choppy guitar. \u201cI used to judge women who were in these abusive, horrible relationships,\u201d she admits. \u201cAnd now here I was in the same situation. You just kinda numb yourself. It\u2019s easy when you love the person.\u201d Drunk on whiskey, that boyfriend would fly into violent rages that he forgot the next day. Then he started shooting heroin and cocaine. \u201cIt just got worse and worse until one night, he actually said: \u2018You need to get out.\u2019 He snapped-to long enough to realise what he was doing. So I totally understand the whole battered-woman syndrome; it\u2019s not black and white.\u201d</p> <p>That perspective fuels Shadows &amp; Doubts, a song billed in publicity as confronting \u201cour quick-to-judge, social-media-led society\u201d. I ask Williams if she had a specific situation in mind. For the first time, she is hesitant, outlining a situation whereby a male celebrity that she knows was accused of sexual harassment, but insisting the song should be \u201cmore universal or open to interpretation\u201d. I am surprised that she\u2019s surprised when I guess correctly that it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/14/the-ryan-adams-allegations-are-the-tip-of-an-indie-music-iceberg\">Ryan Adams</a>: he played on her 2001 album Essence and she wrote about his troubles \u2013 well documented before last year\u2019s accusations of sexual harassment (which he denies) \u2013 on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HqOIri7o8Q\">Little Rock Star</a>, from 2008\u2019s Little Honey.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I know Ryan, and I know he\u2019s fucked up a lot of things,\u201d she says plainly. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those people who you can love but he can also piss you off. God knows he\u2019s made enough mistakes.\u201d She says the song is not about the sexual allegations. \u201cThis is looking at somebody who basically fucked things up and trying to deal with seeing that person in that place but still being concerned about them. I still love Ryan. Do I agree with what he did? No. I\u2019m not trying to say: \u2018Oh, poor Ryan, he was all misunderstood.\u2019 I\u2019m just taking the situation and turning it into a song, but I think you can apply it to different things. I don\u2019t want this to seem like I\u2019m completely defending his actions.\u201d</p> <p>She is aghast that I might name him when she didn\u2019t, but I explain that I don\u2019t think her position is unreasonable: justice requires rehabilitation, even for the likes of Harvey Weinstein. \u201cWell, I agree,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the other thing is, it\u2019s an illness. It\u2019s very taboo but it\u2019s another form of mental illness, and they need help.\u201d We talk about how the social urge to shame can be rooted in fear of our own worst instincts, prompting Williams to raise her love of Freud. \u201cWe all have the ability to go over the edge,\u201d she says. \u201cMy father used to describe it, like when a real close friend of the family committed suicide, as: we\u2019re all standing around the edge of this deep, dark well and some people jump or fall and others don\u2019t. We\u2019re all faced with the same temptations.\u201d</p> <p>Williams attributes her compassion to her childhood. Her mother, Lucille, experienced manic depression with paranoid schizophrenic tendencies. She was medicated with lithium in Williams\u2019s early years, leaving the three children mostly in the care of their father, the noted poet <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/miller-williams\">Miller Williams</a> (he read at Bill Clinton\u2019s 1997 inauguration). \u201cFrom the time I was very young, my father would take me aside and say: \u2018It\u2019s not your mother\u2019s fault, she\u2019s not well,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI learned at an early age not to expect her to be a mother in the way that a traditional mother was supposed to be. But, thank God, I had my father to bond with. I think that\u2019s what saved me from an early age.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8eb6ee8e2cfdae1fea52aeefa567a2d2fc767b6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8eb6ee8e2cfdae1fea52aeefa567a2d2fc767b6b/0_0_2464_3080/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lucinda Williams\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucinda Williams onstage at last year\u2019s Cambridge folk festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Miller introduced his daughter to a world of writers; as a child, she chased <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/06/brief-survey-short-story-flanner-oconnor\">Flannery O\u2019Connor</a>\u2019s peacocks around her garden. That was what attracted her mother to him when they met at Louisiana State University. Miller\u2019s cultured background was the antithesis to her repressive, religious household (\u201cProbably somewhat abusive, too,\u201d says Williams). Lucille studied music, specifically piano, but largely dropped it when she married and had children. \u201cTo this day, I still don\u2019t know what my mother\u2019s dreams were,\u201d says Williams. \u201cIf she saw herself as a professional musician or not.\u201d</p> <p>After her parents split when she was 12, it was at Lucille\u2019s apartment in New Orleans that Williams heard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/08/joan-baez-where-to-start-in-her-back-catalogue\">Joan Baez </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/may/06/leonard-cohen-10-of-the-best\">Leonard Cohen</a> for the first time. She started gigging age 18, moving frequently between southern cities (plus a stint in New York). There was sometimes a piano in the apartment when she visited her mother. \u201cWhen she would get into these states where she didn\u2019t feel good about herself \u2013 maybe she wasn\u2019t on her medication \u2013 she would get rid of her piano,\u201d says Williams. \u201cShe would say something like: \u2018I just couldn\u2019t be around it any more\u2019, almost as if the piano came to represent something that either caused great joy or complete anxiety. But then she would inevitably get another piano and then she would get happy again.\u201d Williams saw the cycle play out several times. \u201cBut she never really talked about it more than that. Did it remind her of what she didn\u2019t accomplish?

      "bodyText": "Lucinda Williams has been sleep-talking more than usual. One night last week, she dreamed that Mormons invaded her house, converted her friends and stole her possessions. That wasn\u2019t the issue: \u201cThey were all sitting next to each other, and I said: \u2018Don\u2019t you understand, you\u2019re supposed to be quarantined!\u2019\u201d Williams laughs, her laconic outlaw baritone spilling into a surprising giggle. Her husband and manager, Tom Overby, told her she had grown agitated in her sleep. She thinks it came from the nightly TV marathons that have become their new lockdown routine, staying up until 5am watching the Jewish drama Unorthodox, \u201conly in my dream they came out as Mormons\u201d. Wiggy dreams are a quarantine staple, but Williams has had a lot to process lately. She and Overby only recently moved to Nashville and don\u2019t yet have any furniture. No sooner had they arrived than a tornado hit the city, taking part of their roof with it. Then coronavirus killed two old friends: Hal Willner, who produced Williams\u2019s 2007 album, West, and the country musician John Prine. She last saw Prine in November when she played his festival in the Dominican Republic. \u201cIt\u2019s been insane,\u201d she says in disbelief, calling from her home. Now aged 67, Williams has written often about death in her 40-year career: songs such as Pineola, Sweet Old World, Lake Charles and Drunken Angel have become alt-country classics, often depicting complex men who might otherwise easily be reduced to caricature. That familiarity doesn\u2019t soften the losses. \u201cI think that\u2019s why I write about death,\u201d she says, her gorgeous accent kneading every vowel, \u201cbecause it\u2019s so hard to deal with.\u201d The subject features less on her new album, Good Souls Better Angels, although you could say it deals with worse fates: shame, depression, the uncanny horror of watching despots crush the values you hold dear. Williams\u2019s career renaissance started with 2014\u2019s Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone, yet Good Souls is yet another cut above: flinty garage blues that foregrounds the punk spirit Rough Trade recognised when the British label elevated her from relative obscurity with her 1988 self-titled third album. Now releasing her first collection of what she calls \u201ctopical\u201d songs, she has been baffled by critics asking why she wrote them (\u201cBecause I\u2019m frustrated and angry\u201d), or remarking on how \u201cprophetic\u201d Bad News Blues and Man Without a Soul (namely Trump) feel, mid-pandemic. Williams isn\u2019t psychic, just attuned to injustice: she keeps suitcases of unused lyrics dating back to the 1970s and weaves them through her writing. \u201cThere\u2019s always been something going on in this country to rebel against and be pissed off about,\u201d she says. Still, Williams says Trump is \u201cdifferent than anything I\u2019ve ever experienced in my entire lifetime\u201d. She knew \u201call the racism and the intolerance and the bigotry\u201d that he represents was part of the American psyche, \u201cbut I thought it had been suppressed to some degree, or that we had some control over it\u201d. Trump gave people of that mindset \u201cpermission in a subliminal way to come on out of the closet,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018You can hate, you can get your guns and your anger.\u2019\u201d She\u2019s reeling from discovering, via a fractious Facebook thread about Man Without a Soul, that she has fans who are Trump supporters. \u201cThat\u2019s just incongruous,\u201d she says. \u201cHow can those things go together?\u201d Their comments kept her awake one night, although she ultimately found them validating. \u201cIt feels good to rebel. To tell you the honest truth, I don\u2019t mind pushing people\u2019s buttons, y\u2019know? I like to get a reaction out of people.\u201d Williams is no cheap rabble-rouser: it is her insistence on compassion and complexity that is provocative. There is pity even in Man Without a Soul. On the new song Wakin\u2019 Up, she reflects on an abusive relationship she was in around 2003. \u201cPulled the kitchen chair out from under me / He pulled my hair and then he kicks me / Next thing I swear, he wants to kiss on me,\u201d she rasps over choppy guitar. \u201cI used to judge women who were in these abusive, horrible relationships,\u201d she admits. \u201cAnd now here I was in the same situation. You just kinda numb yourself. It\u2019s easy when you love the person.\u201d Drunk on whiskey, that boyfriend would fly into violent rages that he forgot the next day. Then he started shooting heroin and cocaine. \u201cIt just got worse and worse until one night, he actually said: \u2018You need to get out.\u2019 He snapped-to long enough to realise what he was doing. So I totally understand the whole battered-woman syndrome; it\u2019s not black and white.\u201d That perspective fuels Shadows &amp; Doubts, a song billed in publicity as confronting \u201cour quick-to-judge, social-media-led society\u201d. I ask Williams if she had a specific situation in mind. For the first time, she is hesitant, outlining a situation whereby a male celebrity that she knows was accused of sexual harassment, but insisting the song should be \u201cmore universal or open to interpretation\u201d. I am surprised that she\u2019s surprised when I guess correctly that it\u2019s Ryan Adams: he played on her 2001 album Essence and she wrote about his troubles \u2013 well documented before last year\u2019s accusations of sexual harassment (which he denies) \u2013 on Little Rock Star, from 2008\u2019s Little Honey. \u201cLook, I know Ryan, and I know he\u2019s fucked up a lot of things,\u201d she says plainly. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those people who you can love but he can also piss you off. God knows he\u2019s made enough mistakes.\u201d She says the song is not about the sexual allegations. \u201cThis is looking at somebody who basically fucked things up and trying to deal with seeing that person in that place but still being concerned about them. I still love Ryan. Do I agree with what he did? No. I\u2019m not trying to say: \u2018Oh, poor Ryan, he was all misunderstood.\u2019 I\u2019m just taking the situation and turning it into a song, but I think you can apply it to different things. I don\u2019t want this to seem like I\u2019m completely defending his actions.\u201d She is aghast that I might name him when she didn\u2019t, but I explain that I don\u2019t think her position is unreasonable: justice requires rehabilitation, even for the likes of Harvey Weinstein. \u201cWell, I agree,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the other thing is, it\u2019s an illness. It\u2019s very taboo but it\u2019s another form of mental illness, and they need help.\u201d We talk about how the social urge to shame can be rooted in fear of our own worst instincts, prompting Williams to raise her love of Freud. \u201cWe all have the ability to go over the edge,\u201d she says. \u201cMy father used to describe it, like when a real close friend of the family committed suicide, as: we\u2019re all standing around the edge of this deep, dark well and some people jump or fall and others don\u2019t. We\u2019re all faced with the same temptations.\u201d Williams attributes her compassion to her childhood. Her mother, Lucille, experienced manic depression with paranoid schizophrenic tendencies. She was medicated with lithium in Williams\u2019s early years, leaving the three children mostly in the care of their father, the noted poet Miller Williams (he read at Bill Clinton\u2019s 1997 inauguration). \u201cFrom the time I was very young, my father would take me aside and say: \u2018It\u2019s not your mother\u2019s fault, she\u2019s not well,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI learned at an early age not to expect her to be a mother in the way that a traditional mother was supposed to be. But, thank God, I had my father to bond with. I think that\u2019s what saved me from an early age.\u201d Miller introduced his daughter to a world of writers; as a child, she chased Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s peacocks around her garden. That was what attracted her mother to him when they met at Louisiana State University. Miller\u2019s cultured background was the antithesis to her repressive, religious household (\u201cProbably somewhat abusive, too,\u201d says Williams). Lucille studied music, specifically piano, but largely dropped it when she married and had children. \u201cTo this day, I still don\u2019t know what my mother\u2019s dreams were,\u201d says Williams. \u201cIf she saw herself as a professional musician or not.\u201d After her parents split when she was 12, it was at Lucille\u2019s apartment in New Orleans that Williams heard Joan Baez and Leonard Cohen for the first time. She started gigging age 18, moving frequently between southern cities (plus a stint in New York). There was sometimes a piano in the apartment when she visited her mother. \u201cWhen she would get into these states where she didn\u2019t feel good about herself \u2013 maybe she wasn\u2019t on her medication \u2013 she would get rid of her piano,\u201d says Williams. \u201cShe would say something like: \u2018I just couldn\u2019t be around it any more\u2019, almost as if the piano came to represent something that either caused great joy or complete anxiety. But then she would inevitably get another piano and then she would get happy again.\u201d Williams saw the cycle play out several times. \u201cBut she never really talked about it more than that. Did it remind her of what she didn\u2019t accomplish? What was it?\u201d When Lucille was well, she would get dressed up to see her daughter play live, \u201cand she was just overjoyed\u201d. After her mother\u2019s death in 2004, Williams wasn\u2019t left with much: just her psychology paperbacks (\u201cShe could talk to you about that all day\u201d) and notebooks. \u201cI ran across something she had written in one of her darker moments,\u201d she recalls. \u201cShe would shift into this place where she would be angry and almost kinda paranoid. And I saw something she\u2019d written down. It said: \u2018I\u2019m tired of living in Miller and Cindy\u2019s shadow.\u2019 See, I was called Cindy when I was growing up. Imagine seeing that written by your mother.\u201d How did it make her feel? \u201cSad,\u201d she says plainly, \u201cjust sad.\u201d Her voice cracks, then she says, warmly: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m gonna cry!\u201d I apologise, but she says: \u201cNo, it\u2019s good!\u201d Williams takes antidepressants for depression and anxiety, although she has never felt alienated from her music. The opposite: she recalls a boy asking her, after a gig in the 90s, how she wrote songs. \u201cI said: you have to go down into this deep, dark well and bring it back up and write about it.\u201d He looked at her, dismayed. \u201cHe goes: \u2018I can\u2019t do that!\u2019 It was one of the saddest things I\u2019ve ever heard.

It occurred to me: I guess that\u2019s how the majority of people live, which is part of the problem with humankind and society. They\u2019re all living on the surface.\u201d Even for someone inclined to self-excavation, Williams has been involved in an intense dig recently: she made Good Souls, spent two years touring her classic 1998 album Car Wheels on a Gravel Road, and is writing a memoir. \u201cGaahd!\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting!\u201d It\u2019s important to her to tell a true, vanishing southern gothic story \u2013 especially since watching her father succumb to Alzheimer\u2019s in 2015 \u2013 and to bear witness when, as she sings on the new album track Big Rotator, today we so often see \u201cstories fabricated, history manipulated\u201d. Her optimism abides in spite of that. She always remembers something her father told her as a child: \u201cNever lose your sense of wonder,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel very grateful to have inherited that. I feel like I\u2019m still the same person. I haven\u2019t gotten jaded or cynical. I feel bad for people who get that way \u2013 it\u2019s a horrible way to live.\u201d Although she was in for Bernie Sanders, she believes that Joe Biden can beat Trump in November (\u201cVote blue no matter who\u201d). And she is moved by a new generation of songwriters naming her as an influence, among them Waxahatchee\u2019s Katie Crutchfield, whose sublime new album bears Williams\u2019s imprint. \u201cI have to remind myself that I\u2019m at that age now,\u201d she says. \u201cI kind of forget sometimes cos I\u2019m out there playing on the road still, just chugging along like I always have been, right alongside them.\u201d Good Souls Better Angels is out on 24 April",

      "body": "<p>Social distancing measures and the subsequent shift to remote working, socializing and school led to questions about the technology available to us, namely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/zoom-technology-security-coronavirus-video-conferencing\">Zoom, which was labelled a \u201cprivacy disaster\u201d</a>. Yet amid the challenges of implementing technology into our home lives, families are having to embrace technology to keep things \u201cnormal\u201d, and finding increasingly creative ways to stay organized and educated online along the way.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who never expected \u2013 nor ever wanted \u2013 to use digital technology to communicate or work now must, and so they are learning how,\u201d explains Sean Michael Morris, director of the Digital Pedagogy Lab at the University of Colorado Denver. \u201cWe could look at this integration of technologies into family life in a positive light, in that the use of these technologies at home necessitates a new level of digital literacy for everyone, but there\u2019s an equally important downside to the movement of work-related technologies into home life, too. Technology is useful, but it is not a substitute for the classroom.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-us-schools-closures-children-meals\">'I literally cried': parents grapple with impact of US school closures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Where the gaps between classroom learning and homeschooling are most apparent a wave of apps aimed at supporting remote learning have risen to prominence. <a href=\"https://web.seesaw.me/\">Seesaw</a>, which allows students to build a digital portfolio of work to share with parents or teachers, has seen a tenfold increase in usage since US schools began to shut down in March.</p> <p>\u201cThere are two types of technologies that have been particularly powerful during this time,\u201d explains Seesaw Co-Founder Adrian Graham. \u201cThe first is live video calling such as Zoom. The second is technology that supports activities that enable personalized attention for students, even in the midst of so many of our routines being disrupted. Often kids are \u2018parked\u2019 in front of technology as a passive solitary experience, but I hope people start to see the immense learning potential that technology has to enable kids to express their thinking and then receive feedback from people who care about them.\u201d</p> <p>Although technology that is specifically catered to remote learning such as Seesaw has seen significant interest, there has also been widespread repurposing of traditionally workplace-based technologies. The meteoric popularity of Zoom is one example, but <a href=\"https://trello.com/\">Trello</a>, a work management tool for organizing projects, also saw a 73% increase in sign-ups in March compared to last year. The company credits a substantial portion of this to its decision to provide <a href=\"https://trello.com/en-US/education\">free access to its premium package</a> to educators in order to help combat the challenges of school closures.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that parents are now serving as the only direct touchpoint that teachers have with younger students. Trello is being used as the central hub to share assignments, attach proof of work and leave comments and questions,\u201d says Michael Pryor, founder and head of Trello at Atlassian. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from teachers that they started using Trello because they found themselves thrown into this situation, but they plan to keep it up in the long run.\u201d</p> <p>Trello is already beginning to plan for a more multipurpose future, currently working on perfecting a new template gallery for teachers and parents, and adding integrations to enable users to customize lesson plans and workflow. For parents and teachers now communicating with their students digitally the rethinking of existing technology for use in an education setting is important, but questions remain about what remote learning can teach us about schooling more broadly.</p> <p>\u201cIf any time is the best time to reinvent \u2018school\u2019 for the better, this time certainly has given us the impetus and rationale and taken away any excuses built on a narrative that \u2018this is how it has to be because this is the way we\u2019ve always done it\u2019,\u201d says Sarojani S Mohammed, Founder of research group <a href=\"https://www.edresearchworks.com/\">Ed Research Works</a>. \u201cI think that there\u2019s an opportunity here to collectively see and experience how personalized learning and true learner-centered instruction can be accomplished. Parents should consider technology to be a tool for interactive learning, for socializing and for social-emotional health and wellbeing at this time. 2020 is illustrating to us what the true non-negotiables are in our conventional education systems, what our critical goals are for learners and alternatively where we do, in fact, have room to innovate.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The pivot to remote learning has surfaced inequalities that, though already present, were not highlighted by classroom-based education</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Morris</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet in addition to forcing educators and parents to consider how technology can better support education, the sudden shift to remote learning has also exposed profound problems. The expectation on parents to provide adequate time and technology to educate their children lays bare vast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/america-inequality-laid-bare-coronavirus\">economic divides</a>, and many families may be concerned by the impact of remote schooling on their child\u2019s educational development as well as their ability to focus on their own work.</p> <p>\u201cIf there are any technologies that will remain useful once we go back to the classroom, I think they will be those which helped us stay in touch with one another, and those that could best provide equitable access to the most marginalized,\u201d says Morris. \u201cToo many students are without internet at home, or adequate enough broadband to be able to participate in school. Too many families can\u2019t afford computers or mobile devices. The pivot to remote learning has surfaced inequalities that, though already present, were not highlighted by classroom-based education. I think the best technological innovation or change that should come next would come as a result of looking carefully at issues of equity and either redesigning existing technologies, or revisiting the whole endeavor.\u201d</p> <p>For many, the future of technology in education does not rely solely on creating new, exciting and innovative tools, but in thinking about how technology can make digital learning safe, accessible and equal for all. The Covid-19 crisis has demonstrated how important technology can be in times of change and uncertainty. The next test for educators and technology companies will be utilizing and shaping digital tools to make the opportunities that they offer equally available to all, inside as well as outside the classroom.</p>",

Yet amid the challenges of implementing technology into our home lives, families are having to embrace technology to keep things \u201cnormal\u201d, and finding increasingly creative ways to stay organized and educated online along the way. \u201cPeople who never expected \u2013 nor ever wanted \u2013 to use digital technology to communicate or work now must, and so they are learning how,\u201d explains Sean Michael Morris, director of the Digital Pedagogy Lab at the University of Colorado Denver. \u201cWe could look at this integration of technologies into family life in a positive light, in that the use of these technologies at home necessitates a new level of digital literacy for everyone, but there\u2019s an equally important downside to the movement of work-related technologies into home life, too. Technology is useful, but it is not a substitute for the classroom.\u201d Where the gaps between classroom learning and homeschooling are most apparent a wave of apps aimed at supporting remote learning have risen to prominence. Seesaw, which allows students to build a digital portfolio of work to share with parents or teachers, has seen a tenfold increase in usage since US schools began to shut down in March. \u201cThere are two types of technologies that have been particularly powerful during this time,\u201d explains Seesaw Co-Founder Adrian Graham. \u201cThe first is live video calling such as Zoom. The second is technology that supports activities that enable personalized attention for students, even in the midst of so many of our routines being disrupted. Often kids are \u2018parked\u2019 in front of technology as a passive solitary experience, but I hope people start to see the immense learning potential that technology has to enable kids to express their thinking and then receive feedback from people who care about them.\u201d Although technology that is specifically catered to remote learning such as Seesaw has seen significant interest, there has also been widespread repurposing of traditionally workplace-based technologies. The meteoric popularity of Zoom is one example, but Trello, a work management tool for organizing projects, also saw a 73% increase in sign-ups in March compared to last year. The company credits a substantial portion of this to its decision to provide free access to its premium package to educators in order to help combat the challenges of school closures. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that parents are now serving as the only direct touchpoint that teachers have with younger students. Trello is being used as the central hub to share assignments, attach proof of work and leave comments and questions,\u201d says Michael Pryor, founder and head of Trello at Atlassian. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from teachers that they started using Trello because they found themselves thrown into this situation, but they plan to keep it up in the long run.\u201d Trello is already beginning to plan for a more multipurpose future, currently working on perfecting a new template gallery for teachers and parents, and adding integrations to enable users to customize lesson plans and workflow. For parents and teachers now communicating with their students digitally the rethinking of existing technology for use in an education setting is important, but questions remain about what remote learning can teach us about schooling more broadly. \u201cIf any time is the best time to reinvent \u2018school\u2019 for the better, this time certainly has given us the impetus and rationale and taken away any excuses built on a narrative that \u2018this is how it has to be because this is the way we\u2019ve always done it\u2019,\u201d says Sarojani S Mohammed, Founder of research group Ed Research Works. \u201cI think that there\u2019s an opportunity here to collectively see and experience how personalized learning and true learner-centered instruction can be accomplished. Parents should consider technology to be a tool for interactive learning, for socializing and for social-emotional health and wellbeing at this time. 2020 is illustrating to us what the true non-negotiables are in our conventional education systems, what our critical goals are for learners and alternatively where we do, in fact, have room to innovate.\u201d Yet in addition to forcing educators and parents to consider how technology can better support education, the sudden shift to remote learning has also exposed profound problems. The expectation on parents to provide adequate time and technology to educate their children lays bare vast economic divides, and many families may be concerned by the impact of remote schooling on their child\u2019s educational development as well as their ability to focus on their own work. \u201cIf there are any technologies that will remain useful once we go back to the classroom, I think they will be those which helped us stay in touch with one another, and those that could best provide equitable access to the most marginalized,\u201d says Morris. \u201cToo many students are without internet at home, or adequate enough broadband to be able to participate in school. Too many families can\u2019t afford computers or mobile devices. The pivot to remote learning has surfaced inequalities that, though already present, were not highlighted by classroom-based education. I think the best technological innovation or change that should come next would come as a result of looking carefully at issues of equity and either redesigning existing technologies, or revisiting the whole endeavor.\u201d For many, the future of technology in education does not rely solely on creating new, exciting and innovative tools, but in thinking about how technology can make digital learning safe, accessible and equal for all. The Covid-19 crisis has demonstrated how important technology can be in times of change and uncertainty. The next test for educators and technology companies will be utilizing and shaping digital tools to make the opportunities that they offer equally available to all, inside as well as outside the classroom.",

Over five days and 40 video sessions, 10 negotiating teams were expected to provide an urgent \u201crefocus\u201d before the 30 June deadline for both sides to formally agree to extend the transition period if the UK asks for one. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s lead negotiator, will host a press conference at noon on Friday in Brussels to give updates, but his team were told on Monday that Boris Johnson was not budging on the issue of the extensions. Barnier\u2019s opposite number, David Frost, opened the first plenary session by \u201creiterating the government wish not to extend the transition period and that the job could be done by the end of the year\u201d. Some observers said the UK government\u2019s position that an extension is not necessary was astonishing given the depth of the coronavirus crisis.

This week\u2019s talks centred solely on the future relationship. A separate strand of work is under way on the implementation of the withdrawal agreement signed off in January. Here is an overview of who is involved in the discussions and what areas are covered. Joint committee Featuring Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, a European commission vice-president, the committee met for the first time on 30 March and will make decisions on recommendations made by civil servants who will staff six specialised committees.

So expect industry bodies and experts to be asked to submit to this group. The remaining specialised committees have not yet been scheduled. Thomas Lieflaender, the deputy head of the European Commission\u2019s Brexit task force, is being tipped to lead the INISC along with a senior figure from the Northern Ireland office, possibly Andrew McCormick, the executive\u2019s director general of international relations. One concern is that civil servants cannot make decisions on politically charged issues such as what checks will be conducted and where. Jess Sargeant, a researcher at the Institute for Government thinktank, said the INISC was likely to make recommendations to the joint committee. One urgent task is to look at what goods will be subject to tariffs when crossing the Irish Sea using data on trade journeys and the goods \u201cat risk\u201d of entering the single market by crossing the border into the Republic of Ireland. Border inspection posts The location of border inspection posts for controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea has yet to be decided, unsurprisingly given Johnson has insisted there would be no checks. The EU would prefer posts to be located in places such as the ports of Liverpool and Cairnryan in Scotland. Fisheries This is one of the most contentious areas and the EU has said there will be no deal unless agreed in outline by June.

      "bodyText": "The governments of nations with large Muslim populations were divided on coronavirus restrictions as Ramadan began, with with some easing lockdowns while others enacted travel bans. As the Muslim holy month was set to begin, US health experts rushed to warn against Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion of exploring the use of UV light on people and injecting disinfectant as a way of combatting coronavirus. The world\u2019s 1.8 billion Muslims have had to adjust to a month-long holy period of fasting and reflection with a much more private tone this year, with mosques closed and feasts after dusk held in private. Some countries have amended curfews to make it easier for people to shop for food. Egypt will allow more businesses to reopen and will shorten a night-time curfew, and shopping malls and businesses will be allowed to open on weekends until 5pm. The announcement by prime minister Mostafa Madbouly came as the country confirmed its highest number of infections in a single day, with 232 new cases reported on Thursday. Another 11 people died, bringing the country\u2019s death toll to 287. Madbouly said the easing of restrictions would be reviewed in two weeks. Algeria and the United Arab Emirates also announced they would ease curfews for Ramadan. However, in Indonesia, the world\u2019s most populous Muslim nation, all non-essential travel between provinces has been banned in order to contain the virus during the holiday. The ban included domestic and international travel, with some exceptions, and police will use roadblocks to enforce the measure on the ground. In the US, Trump stunned onlookers at a press briefing on Thursday when he riffed on his \u201cinterest\u201d in looking at using ultraviolet lights or even injecting disinfectant into people to treat Covid-19. Robert Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and a former labor secretary, said Trump\u2019s briefings were \u201cactively endangering the public\u2019s health\u201d. \u201cBoycott the propaganda. Listen to the experts. And please don\u2019t drink disinfectant,\u201d he said. At the briefing Trump, remarked on research by the Department of Homeland Security that said the virus appeared to weaken faster under exposure to sunlight, heat and humidity. William Bryan, its acting undersecretary for science and technology, told the briefing tests using disinfectants had showed the virus could be killed within minutes by some substances. Dr Irwin Redlener, the director of the Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, told the MSNBC network: \u201cEverything that this scientist talked about from homeland security was basically incoherent, nonsensical, not really supported by evidence and really quite contrary to a lot of things that we do know about some of the things he was saying.\u201d Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, was barely able to contain incredulous laughter when asked if anyone should follow the US president\u2019s latest suggestion. \u201cUm ...

They could be quite toxic to people \u2026And ultraviolet light, look, I don\u2019t know the context in which he said it, so I really would need to study it before I could comment.\u201d The US has reported almost 50,000 deaths and 870,000 cases, according to the John Hopkins University tracker, and could extend social distancing measures. Congress passed a $500bn relief package late on Thursday, bringing the US\u2019s crisis spending to nearly $3tn. Meanwhile, China\u2019s ambassador to the UK strongly rebuked the US for suggesting Beijing was not truthful about the coronavirus, saying Washington should not seek to bully China in a manner reminiscent of the 19th century European colonial wars. \u201cSome other country \u2013 their local courts sued China \u2013 it is absurd,\u201d Liu Xiaoming said, a possible reference to legal action launched by Missouri. \u201cSome politicians, some people, want to play at being the world\u2019s policeman \u2013 this is not the era of gunboat diplomacy, this is not the era when China was a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society.\u201d In other global developments: About 91 crew on Italian cruise ship, the Costa Atlantica, have Covid-19, Japanese officials said on Friday.

In one case, the test centre at Chessington in south-west London, which is being run by the consultancy Deloitte, was unable to ring through with a diagnosis because it hadn\u2019t recorded correct phone numbers.

He also mooted the idea of treating patients with ultraviolet light. In a more conventional policy response, Trump warned that social distancing guidelines could remain in force until the summer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/what-would-year-physical-distancing-mean-for-uk\">while we look at what extended isolation might mean in the UK</a>.</p> \n<p>Cases worldwide have risen to more than 2.7 million while the death toll is above 190,000, with nearly 50,000 of those in the US.

The report, leaked over the Easter weekend, said efforts to tackle the matter were hindered by opposition to former leader Jeremy Corbyn.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Crunch time for government\u2019s testing claims Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and here\u2019s what you need to know today as we reach the end of another week in lockdown. NHS chiefs are considering taking over the running of the government\u2019s much-trumpeted coronavirus-testing centre from private operators after hospital staff said results had gone missing or people had been sent the wrong ones. In one case, the test centre at Chessington in south-west London, which is being run by the consultancy Deloitte, was unable to ring through with a diagnosis because it hadn\u2019t recorded correct phone numbers. The government says millions of key workers and their families in England could start to book tests online from today as it continues to try to reach its target of 100,000 daily tests by the end of April. A leaked email from Public Health England says there are still not enough tests being done on care home residents. Less than a tenth of the controversial shipment from Turkey has arrived despite the UK\u2019s downpayment, and the son of a hospital doctor who died from Covid-19 says his father had \u201cto beg\u201d for PPE and that his death was avoidable. Meanwhile, the New Zealand nurse who helped treat Boris Johnson has broken her silence to say she didn\u2019t treat him any differently from any other patient. Doctors have criticised Donald Trump after he suggested people could be cured by having injections of disinfectant (\u201cknocks it out in a minute\u2026 One minute!\u201d). He also mooted the idea of treating patients with ultraviolet light. In a more conventional policy response, Trump warned that social distancing guidelines could remain in force until the summer, while we look at what extended isolation might mean in the UK. Cases worldwide have risen to more than 2.7 million while the death toll is above 190,000, with nearly 50,000 of those in the US. You can catch up on all the key developments overnight at a glance and read more details on our live blog. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Leak inquiry \u2013 Labour is aiming to conclude by July an investigation into the leaking of the report into alleged antisemitism as Keir Starmer tries to unite a party left battered by the contentious issue and election defeat. The report, leaked over the Easter weekend, said efforts to tackle the matter were hindered by opposition to former leader Jeremy Corbyn. But critics, some of whom are on the right of the party, say it was an attempt to smear whistleblowers. Starmer said disciplinary action could be brought against people named in the report who had broken the party\u2019s rules. * * * Back to Brexit \u2013 Just when you thought it might have gone away, Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s lead Brexit negotiator, will give an update today on how talks that resumed this week have progressed. The talks were postponed for six weeks due to the coronavirus and have restarted via video-conferencing. But there is frustration in Brussels that the UK is refusing to countenance an extension to the transition period despite the Covid-19 disruption. * * * Zoom boom \u2013 The growth in online meetings has prompted the newly popular platform Zoom to update its security protocols. The service has been plagued by complaints that meetings can be hacked easily, so-called \u201cZoom-bombing\u201d. Its boss, Eric Yuan, has hailed a new version with encryption and new privacy controls as part of a 90-day plan to improve security. Coronavirus Extra The Muslim festival of Ramadan is usually marked by social gatherings and feasts, but this year\u2019s celebrations \u2013 which begin today \u2013 promise to be a much more muted affair thanks to the coronavirus restrictions in many countries. The challenges of home schooling in Italy are analysed by the writer Tobias Jones in today\u2019s long read and we also report on a helpline for parents here who might be struggling with the same issue. The Austrian ski resort called the \u201cIbiza of the Alps\u201d which was at the centre of a Covid-19 outbreak has emerged from quarantine with news that it is cleaning up its act and aiming for a more upmarket type of apres-ski. And just to prove there is still some cheer in the world, Tom Hanks has sent a letter and a Corona brand typewriter to an Australian boy who wrote to him about being bullied over his name, Corona. Today in Focus podcast The biggest health crisis in a generation and the enforced isolation of lockdowns is taking not just a physical toll on people but also affecting mental health. The Guardian\u2019s John Crace discusses his mental health challenges and public health specialist Dr Antonis Kousoulis tells Anushka Asthana what may help. Lunchtime read: Lucinda Williams on Trump, Adams and Freud Lucinda Williams, the country music singer, has mined the deepest, darkest wells of the human soul for four decades to amass a peerless body of work. On her latest album, Good Souls, she adds politics into the mix and tells Laura Snapes why she has written about Trump (\u201cI\u2019m frustrated and angry\u201d), her horror at discussing it with Trump-voting fans (\u201cso incongruous\u201d), the harassment case of her friend Ryan Adams and her love of Freud (\u201cWe all have the ability to go over the edge\u201d). Sport European rugby\u2019s governing body has told World Rugby it intends to stage the Champions Cup final in October and says it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d to shoehorn extra autumn Tests into the calendar. The McLaren team principal, Zak Brown, has accused Ferrari of \u201cliving in denial\u201d about the existential threat Formula One faces from the coronavirus crisis. Uefa has confirmed national leagues will not be banned from European competition if they cancel their seasons and must decide for themselves how to determine final placings \u201cbased on sporting merit\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The government is failing to test sick care home residents for coronavirus 10 days after Matt Hancock promised that anyone in residential care would be checked if symptomatic, a leaked email has revealed.</p> \n<p>With a worsening crisis in care homes for the elderly, where thousands have died, the health secretary pledged on 14 April that all residents would be able to get a test, not just an initial five people in an outbreak at each home. He claimed again on Thursday that \u201canybody in a care home who has symptoms now gets tested\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, a leaked email from Public Health England (PHE) to a care provider said on Wednesday that \u201cthe processes to undertake this have still not been established\u201d.</p> \n<p>Asked why it could not test more care home residents, PHE initially said its policy was still only to test residents in an initial outbreak, despite the position of Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) being that all symptomatic residents should be tested.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28f9c4c8-d8b6-4f17-bdd6-1264330215a7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/akiXEfWW-V0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A PHE spokesman said: \u201cIf there is a brand new outbreak and a care home needs to establish if there is an outbreak, they contact their local public health team and the local health protection team will arrange testing and do a risk assessment for that care home.

      "bodyText": "The government is failing to test sick care home residents for coronavirus 10 days after Matt Hancock promised that anyone in residential care would be checked if symptomatic, a leaked email has revealed. With a worsening crisis in care homes for the elderly, where thousands have died, the health secretary pledged on 14 April that all residents would be able to get a test, not just an initial five people in an outbreak at each home. He claimed again on Thursday that \u201canybody in a care home who has symptoms now gets tested\u201d. However, a leaked email from Public Health England (PHE) to a care provider said on Wednesday that \u201cthe processes to undertake this have still not been established\u201d. Asked why it could not test more care home residents, PHE initially said its policy was still only to test residents in an initial outbreak, despite the position of Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) being that all symptomatic residents should be tested. A PHE spokesman said: \u201cIf there is a brand new outbreak and a care home needs to establish if there is an outbreak, they contact their local public health team and the local health protection team will arrange testing and do a risk assessment for that care home. That is done at PHE labs or one of our partner labs in the NHS. \u201cIf after there is an established outbreak they suspect there are more individuals who are symptomatic and may need testing, from a public health point of view, because we have already given advice on what to do, the public health advice doesn\u2019t really change. \u201cSo it isn\u2019t really beneficial from a PHE point of view. So PHE wouldn\u2019t then further test any people in that care home. But the DHSC is rolling out greater testing, so that\u2019s when they get involved.\u201d However following that explanation, a PHE spokesperson later issued a statement saying all sick residents and staff will get tested as soon as possible: \u201cPHE would like to apologise if our letter has caused confusion to the care home. All residents and staff will be tested and we will arrange this straight away.\u201d PHE\u2019s earlier stance meant that care homes are having to rely on the DHSC\u2019s commercial testing capacity at 28 drive-through sites across the UK, which are not appropriate for most care home residents to access. There are also four mobile testing units for England and a small number of home testing kits being piloted, although Prof John Newton, who is coordinating testing efforts, said this would be scaled up to 50 in the coming week. Peter Kyle, the Labour MP who obtained the leaked email, said a care home in his East Sussex constituency was refused tests for further residents beyond an initial outbreak of a handful of people. \u201cThe outbreak in this care home has suddenly worsened with another five symptomatic patients who cannot be tested,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are staff who are sick and staff who are refusing to come to work. \u201cA month ago, the prime minister promised that testing would be rolled out into care homes and personal protective equipment (PPE) would be there by the end of that week.

They could have tested, got the right PPE, and stopped workers working between multiple homes. They put the NHS on battle stations but they left social care as business as usual \u2026 It has been criminal neglect.\u201d Care home providers have pleaded for more testing and warned that the pandemic is still spreading in their sites, after official figures showed more than 1,000 people were confirmed to to have died in care homes from the virus in the week to April 10. Prof Martin Green, the chief executive of industry group Care England, said on Tuesday that the number of fatalities in care \u201ccould easily exceed what\u2019s [happening] in hospitals\u201d, where 17,337 people have already died. He has estimated that at least 7,500 people have died of Covid-19 in care homes. A source at a major care home provider confirmed there are still widespread problems with residents getting tests but it had been promised by the government that this would be resolved. A week ago, the government said 10,000 care home residents had been tested. That figure did not appear to have grown by Wednesday, when Helen Whately, the care minister, gave the same figure of 10,000 for how many care home residents had been tested. Liz Kendall, the shadow care minister, said the problem extended beyond the issue of care home residents being tested to difficulties getting care staff tested as well. \u201cI\u2019ve been sent reports of carers being asked to go from Norfolk to Sheffield, from Peterborough to Stansted, from Oxford to Twickenham and from Leicester to Beeston.

      "bodyText": "Growing numbers of students are asking their universities for financial support during the Covid-19 lockdown amid warnings that more will face hardship as the crisis goes on. Many universities have responded by increasing or creating funds for students in difficulty, with some providing subsidised meals for those who remain on campus. In Scotland, the government has announced a \u00a35m package of emergency financial support. But according to a survey by the National Union of Students (NUS), 80% of students across the UK are worried about how they will cope financially after losing work and support from their parents. The NUS has called on the government to supply a \u00a360 million hardship fund that would provide students with a \u201csafety net\u201d during the coronavirus lockdown. The NUS also demanded that universities reimburse students\u2019 tuition fees and allow them to retake the year to make up for the disruption to their degrees. This has been echoed by cross-party MPs, who have asked the chancellor to set up emergency maintenance grants for those who are not entitled to claim universal credit. Lily Taylor, a master\u2019s student at Sheffield Hallam University, lives off \u00a390 a week after being furloughed from her bar job, along with her savings that will run out soon. \u201cThe hardest part is having no space to study,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the house I rent we have a high-up dining table with stools. I have a bad back after an accident a couple of years ago and I can\u2019t sit here for longer than 20 minutes without it being a strain.\u201d Taylor tried asking her university if it could supply her with a desk chair. She was told to apply for the university\u2019s hardship fund, but says her application was denied. \u201cI\u2019m stuck on my own in Sheffield, 160 miles away from my friends and family, and I\u2019m worried about how I\u2019m going to be able to complete my dissertation.\u201d Sheffield Hallam has launched a crowdfunding appeal to raise money for struggling students after its usual hardship fund was overwhelmed by requests from students as a result of the pandemic. Similar measures have been announced by the University of York and the University of Greenwich. Greenwich has also offered free laptops and broadband for students and staff, while students at the University of Loughborough can request free meals if they are struggling to cope financially while stranded on campus. But students will need to meet certain eligibility criteria to receive support. Sophie Cartwright, a master\u2019s student, applied for the University of Birmingham\u2019s hardship fund after losing her income from three part-time jobs. Although she comes from a single-parent, lower socioeconomic background, she says she doesn\u2019t meet requirements. \u201cThe university requires any postgraduate applicant to have a minimum average of \u00a3180 a week in income throughout the academic year in order to even apply to the fund. This is extremely counterintuitive as it means those who most need the financial support are immediately not eligible,\u201d she says. Some students who have lost their jobs were employed by universities themselves \u2013 in campus shops or student unions, for example \u2013 and are frustrated by the lack of clarity around the future of their employment. Issy Emmitt, a third-year student at the University of Bath, was working two jobs on campus before the outbreak, as both a student ambassador and in the campus supermarket. When the lockdown began, she and other student employees were informed via a Facebook page that there was no more work available at the shop. \u201cThose of us working zero-hour contracts on campus still haven\u2019t been told whether or not we have been officially furloughed or just plain fired yet \u2013 four weeks on,\u201d she says. \u201cA coursemate of mine lost three campus jobs and estimates her losses to be already around \u00a31,000.\u201d In the meantime, Emmitt is worried about how she will pay rent. \u201cI have no savings because of how expensive living in Bath is, and so I\u2019m suddenly in a position where I not only can\u2019t afford my rent, but even basic living necessities,\u201d she says. \u201cI also can\u2019t move home at the moment as my father is severely immunocompromised.\u201d Rent is a major concern for hard-pressed students. Nearly 75,000 students have signed a petition for universities to suspend all student accommodation rent for those who have returned home due to Covid-19. Many universities have waived rent for the final term of the year, and some for the whole year. But according to the Office for Students, only 19% of students live in university accommodation, with the vast majority renting from private providers. In some cases, students stranded in their housing without an income have organised rent strikes. For students like Cartwright, the financial pressures may be too much. \u201cIf I do not receive additional support, I will likely not be able to finance somewhere in Birmingham to live for the remainder of my degree,\u201d she says. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to afford a deposit or save up rent upfront for the new property.

He said all arts companies needed now to be \u201cnimble and quick\u201d and react to circumstances, but at the moment ENO was not planning for seats being empty. \u201cTo be honest we\u2019re trying to test the temperature every day.\u201d Some countries have allowed drive-in cinemas to remain open during the lockdown. Germany, for example, has two year-round operations, in Essen and Cologne. According to the Hollywood Reporter, both have sold out for every screening since Germany\u2019s lockdown was declared. Makeshift drive-ins are also popping up around the country. In the US, the spiritual home of the drive-in, fewer than 25 of the nation\u2019s 320 drive-ins are reportedly open for business, but that could change. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, said last week he would consider allowing drive-ins to reopen. \u201cWhere is the public safety issue? It\u2019s a drive-in theatre. You\u2019re in the car with the same people,\u201d he said.",

If lockdown lasts for three months, GDP could crash by around 13% for 2020 as a whole.</p> \n<p><strong>Unemployment<br></strong>More than 2 million people could lose their jobs by June, according to the OBR. But some analysts expect a bigger impact. David Blanchflower, a former Bank of England rate-setter, has warned that job losses could surpass the Great Depression by rising to more than 6 million people, around 21% of the workforce.</p> \n<p><strong>Public finances<br></strong>Britain\u2019s budget deficit, the gap between public spending and income from taxes, is expected to surge to the highest levels since the second world war, surpassing the damage caused by the 2008 financial crisis. As spending rises to fund emergency support measures and the economy crashes, the OBR said the deficit could hit \u00a3273bn this year, or around 14% of GDP.</p> \n<p><strong>World economy</strong><br>The International Monetary Fund has warned that the world faces the worst recession since the Great Depression. It said world GDP could fall by 3% this year, compared with the 3.3% growth it forecast for 2020 just three months ago.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One month after a national lockdown was declared in an attempt to limit the spread of Covid-19, it is clear that Britain is heading for the deepest recession in living memory. Boris Johnson\u2019s government launched unprecedented restrictions on 23 March, telling the British public that they must stay at home and bringing life as the nation knew it to an abrupt halt. Thousands of lives have been lost to Covid-19, while millions of jobs are at risk with the economy effectively in deep freeze. Pubs and restaurants remain shut, high streets are empty, and planes are grounded. As the global health emergency prompts an economic crash unparalleled since at least the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Guardian is launching a monthly Covid-19 crisis watch to track the financial shock facing households and businesses. One month in to tough government controls, early snapshots of business activity, transport usage and the numbers of people signing up to claim universal credit paint a picture of an economy grinding to a halt, as the urgent challenge to save lives is made paramount. Over the coming months, the Guardian will attempt to map out the damage to jobs, companies and living standards by following the latest economic developments on a monthly basis, tracking indicators such as inflation, unemployment, GDP and retail sales, as well as the FTSE 100 and house prices. The Guardian\u2019s Covid crisis watch will also consider how the UK is faring compared with other countries. At this stage, much of the official economic data has yet to catch up with events, as government analysts and statisticians require weeks to gather enough data to make a judgment. However, the impact of lockdown is clear in several rapid indicators, including travel, online restaurant bookings, cinema ticket sales, travel and retail footfall, which has plunged by 85%, according to Google location data. Highlighting the effectiveness of the lockdown measures, government figures showed transport use down by around 60% or more since February, with rail journeys and trips on the London Underground down by more than 95%. Road traffic levels have also slumped to 1950s levels. Fewer vehicles on the streets and planes in the air, alongside sharp reductions in industrial output, have come as a boon for the environment. Early figures suggest pollution levels have dropped by up to half in London and several other big cities. Among the most rapidly available barometers of economic stress, financial markets around the world have been plunged into turmoil, with the biggest collapse in share prices since Black Monday in 1987. The price of oil has crashed on global markets as demand for crude crumbles, with factories closed or running reduced hours, while international travel is grounded. Falling oil prices have been exacerbated by a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. In the US, oil prices turned negative for the first time ever on Monday as producers paid buyers to take barrels of oil off their hands. Ahead of what is expected to be the deepest global recession in peacetime, closely watched surveys of business activity suggested service sector output, manufacturing and construction projects had slipped into reverse, with the monthly purchasing managers index (PMI) barometer falling by the biggest margin since records began more than two decades ago. In a glimmer of hope for the economy, some firms are starting to eye a return to work, including Jaguar Land Rover, B&amp;Q and Taylor Wimpey. Economic activity has collapsed around the world at the onset of an unprecedented synchronised downturn, little more than a decade after commentators believed the world had witnessed a once-in-a-generation recession with the 2008 financial crisis. The Guardian will track the government\u2019s unprecedented emergency financial support measures for firms and individuals, and the impact they will have on the public finances. In response to the coronavirus crisis, ministers have stepped in to cushion the economic fallout and save as many jobs and businesses as possible. Despite a price tag spiralling into the billions, with costs rising the longer lockdown continues, significant holes in the safety net still remain, made worse by a decade of austerity before the coronavirus struck. Launching a job retention scheme to pay 80% of the wages of workers up to \u00a32,500 each per month on Monday, the government has received applications for furlough payments from more than 387,000 firms to pay more than 2.8 million people, an intervention that has cost at least \u00a32bn so far. Although a similar scheme to compensate the country\u2019s 5 million self-employed workers is planned, it will take until June to set up, and millions will receive no support under the current plans. The government has promised to back more than \u00a3300bn of loans to businesses, with larger firms able to access finance from the Bank of England and smaller firms able to borrow using Treasury-guaranteed loans from high street banks. The central bank has also cut interest rates to the lowest levels in history, 0.1%, and pumped \u00a3200bn more into its quantitative easing bond-buying programme to lower borrowing costs for households and businesses. Despite hopes that the interventions would help companies to bridge a black hole in sales during the lockdown, many firms are struggling to access support and rising numbers of people are losing their jobs. As rising numbers of people find themselves without a job and facing the threat of financial hardship, around 1.5 million people have signed up to apply for universal credit payments. Almost one in four adults have already suffered a financial hit as the crisis unfolds, according to the Office for National Statistics. As demand for goods and services evaporates, shoppers stay away from the high street and the global oil price plummets, inflation has started to tumble. However, prices of some goods in high demand have spiralled in recent weeks after shoppers scrambled to stockpile long-life food and sanitary products. Forecasts UK growth The Office for Budget Responsibility has warned that the coronavirus crisis could cause a 35% fall in gross domestic product (GDP) this spring. The damage to jobs and growth depends on the length of lockdown measures, with a bigger impact the longer tough controls last. If lockdown lasts for three months, GDP could crash by around 13% for 2020 as a whole. Unemployment More than 2 million people could lose their jobs by June, according to the OBR. But some analysts expect a bigger impact. David Blanchflower, a former Bank of England rate-setter, has warned that job losses could surpass the Great Depression by rising to more than 6 million people, around 21% of the workforce. Public finances Britain\u2019s budget deficit, the gap between public spending and income from taxes, is expected to surge to the highest levels since the second world war, surpassing the damage caused by the 2008 financial crisis. As spending rises to fund emergency support measures and the economy crashes, the OBR said the deficit could hit \u00a3273bn this year, or around 14% of GDP. World economy The International Monetary Fund has warned that the world faces the worst recession since the Great Depression. It said world GDP could fall by 3% this year, compared with the 3.3% growth it forecast for 2020 just three months ago.",

      "body": "<p>By a grim irony, this is the World Health Organization\u2019s year of the nurse and the midwife \u2013 and so it has turned out to be, as the pandemic makes harsher demands on the profession than ever. The Health Service Journal\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/exclusive-deaths-of-nhs-staff-from-covid-19-analysed/7027471.article\">latest analysis</a> of deaths shows 106 dead: 35 nurses, 27 health care assistants, two midwives, 18 doctors and 10 in social care, along with others \u2013 and a high proportion from ethnic minorities. One nurse, at Witney Community hospital in Oxfordshire, was <a href=\"https://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/news/18396907.witney-nurse-margaret-tapley-died-contracting-coronavirus/\">Margaret Tapley</a>, who died of the virus while still in service at the age of 84.</p> <p>Before anyone gets carried away by Boris Johnson\u2019s eulogy for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/boris-johnson-leaves-hospital-as-he-continues-recovery-from-coronavirus\">life-saving angels</a>, the facts of nursing life are brutal and it\u2019s worth recounting them in detail. In recent years, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-42653542\">leavers have outnumbered joiners</a> by up to 3,000 and the more nurses quit, the harder it becomes for those who stay in understaffed wards. Remember this epidemic began with the highest ever number of nurse vacancies: 44,000 in February. But, says Anne Marie Rafferty, the president of the Royal College of Nursing and professor of nursing policy at King\u2019s College London, that\u2019s not a true reflection: \u201cThose vacancies run on affordability. That\u2019s only the number of nurses they can pay for, not the number needed.\u201d Even the 10,000 retired nurses who have returned to help out in the crisis, mostly not on the frontline, don\u2019t cover those lost since 2010, she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The government talks breezily of more care in the community, but district nurses have almost vanished</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nurse training was an early casualty of George Osborne\u2019s axe-swinging 2010 budget. Despite recent efforts, numbers are still down on 2010, though the decade saw a huge increase in patients, who are far sicker in a population with 25% more over-65s. After the 2016 cavalier removal of nursing bursaries, applicants fell by 24%: although the government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/18/why-is-matt-hancock-bringing-bursaries-back-for-student-nurses\">restored the \u00a35,000 maintenance grants</a>, fees at \u00a39,000 a year are impossible for many healthcare assistants seeking to upgrade with families to support. The King\u2019s Fund expects the nurse shortage to rise steeply <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/blog/2020/02/will-2020-see-nursing-student-numbers-recover\">to 100,000</a> over the next eight years. The UK has fewer nurses per head of the population than countries such as France, Denmark, Germany and Ireland \u2013 hence the growing tendency to substitute assistants for trained nurses.</p> <p>Any hope the government takes this seriously enough is blown away by the sheer insanity of charging non-EU medical staff<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/foreign-nhs-workers-coronavirus-frontline-nhs-surcharge\"> \u00a3624 a year</a> for each member of their family for their right to be treated by the health service they support. It looks like a deliberate policy to deter those we most need. Besides, nurses\u2019 pay starts at \u00a318,000, well below the high bar of \u00a325,600 set for the right to work here. Brexit saw the departure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/24/nhs-winter-crisis-thousands-eu-staff-quit\">thousands of EU staff</a>.</p> <p>This week <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/survey-of-uk-nurses-and-midwives-highlights-their-concerns-about-health-training-and-workload-during-covid-19\">a survey of 2,600 nurses</a> by a group of universities and the RCN found an alarming state of anxiety, stress and fear about their own safety and their families\u2019 and a lack of training before being plunged into new roles: <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/survey-of-uk-nurses-and-midwives-highlights-their-concerns-about-health-training-and-workload-during-covid-19\">a third of them</a> reported severe depression. More than half worked longer than their contracted shifts, mostly unpaid, and only about half had the correct amount of personal protective equipment. </p> <p>During the austerity years nursing was seen as disposable, often first to be cut. Before this crisis wards were running hot, with a dangerous 95% or more beds filled. The ratio of nurses to very sick patients keeps rising, as does the average age of nurses, now at 47. The government talks breezily of more care in the community, getting people out of hospital beds faster, but that\u2019s where the nurse shortage is gravest: district nurses have almost vanished, <a href=\"https://www.qni.org.uk/resources/outstanding-models-of-district-nursing-report/\">cut by 43%</a> since 2010. Many have caseloads of 400, with just one for every 14,000 people in England \u2013 and nearly half are due to retire or leave in the next six years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/nurse-shortage-causes-nightingale-hospital-to-turn-away-patients\">Nurse shortage causes Nightingale hospital to turn away patients</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is nothing insoluble about any of this. Encouraging and keeping nurses is not difficult. Pay them decently, give them as clear a career path ahead as doctors enjoy, and see what happens. As it is, the usual graduate premium for most occupations doesn\u2019t apply to nurses\u2019 meagre lifetime earnings. Housing for key workers would help. There used to be good accommodation for nurses, vital in high-cost areas, but the old nurses\u2019 homes were sold off in one of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s cost-cutting Rayner Scrutinies.</p> <p>Where nurses are treated as precious commodities and given maximum flexibility in their shift times, a few hospitals buck the trend and hold on to them, says Rafferty. As everyone reaches for some good to emerge from this catastrophe, she tells of a surgeon she just met, reassigned to an intensive care unit, \u201camazed\u201d at the expertise of those specialist nurses \u2013 and humbled to find himself relegated to assisting. \u201cBut of course, they are still paid around a third of his salary,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>So when next week\u2019s clap for the NHS comes, join in out of gratitude but also out of anger \u2013 anger at how depleted the nursing workforce has become and how badly the successive Conservative governments have treated the profession.</p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p>",

One nurse, at Witney Community hospital in Oxfordshire, was Margaret Tapley, who died of the virus while still in service at the age of 84. Before anyone gets carried away by Boris Johnson\u2019s eulogy for his life-saving angels, the facts of nursing life are brutal and it\u2019s worth recounting them in detail. In recent years, leavers have outnumbered joiners by up to 3,000 and the more nurses quit, the harder it becomes for those who stay in understaffed wards. Remember this epidemic began with the highest ever number of nurse vacancies: 44,000 in February. But, says Anne Marie Rafferty, the president of the Royal College of Nursing and professor of nursing policy at King\u2019s College London, that\u2019s not a true reflection: \u201cThose vacancies run on affordability. That\u2019s only the number of nurses they can pay for, not the number needed.\u201d Even the 10,000 retired nurses who have returned to help out in the crisis, mostly not on the frontline, don\u2019t cover those lost since 2010, she says. Nurse training was an early casualty of George Osborne\u2019s axe-swinging 2010 budget. Despite recent efforts, numbers are still down on 2010, though the decade saw a huge increase in patients, who are far sicker in a population with 25% more over-65s. After the 2016 cavalier removal of nursing bursaries, applicants fell by 24%: although the government has restored the \u00a35,000 maintenance grants, fees at \u00a39,000 a year are impossible for many healthcare assistants seeking to upgrade with families to support. The King\u2019s Fund expects the nurse shortage to rise steeply to 100,000 over the next eight years. The UK has fewer nurses per head of the population than countries such as France, Denmark, Germany and Ireland \u2013 hence the growing tendency to substitute assistants for trained nurses. Any hope the government takes this seriously enough is blown away by the sheer insanity of charging non-EU medical staff \u00a3624 a year for each member of their family for their right to be treated by the health service they support. It looks like a deliberate policy to deter those we most need. Besides, nurses\u2019 pay starts at \u00a318,000, well below the high bar of \u00a325,600 set for the right to work here. Brexit saw the departure of thousands of EU staff. This week a survey of 2,600 nurses by a group of universities and the RCN found an alarming state of anxiety, stress and fear about their own safety and their families\u2019 and a lack of training before being plunged into new roles: a third of them reported severe depression. More than half worked longer than their contracted shifts, mostly unpaid, and only about half had the correct amount of personal protective equipment. During the austerity years nursing was seen as disposable, often first to be cut. Before this crisis wards were running hot, with a dangerous 95% or more beds filled. The ratio of nurses to very sick patients keeps rising, as does the average age of nurses, now at 47. The government talks breezily of more care in the community, getting people out of hospital beds faster, but that\u2019s where the nurse shortage is gravest: district nurses have almost vanished, cut by 43% since 2010. Many have caseloads of 400, with just one for every 14,000 people in England \u2013 and nearly half are due to retire or leave in the next six years. There is nothing insoluble about any of this. Encouraging and keeping nurses is not difficult. Pay them decently, give them as clear a career path ahead as doctors enjoy, and see what happens. As it is, the usual graduate premium for most occupations doesn\u2019t apply to nurses\u2019 meagre lifetime earnings. Housing for key workers would help. There used to be good accommodation for nurses, vital in high-cost areas, but the old nurses\u2019 homes were sold off in one of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s cost-cutting Rayner Scrutinies. Where nurses are treated as precious commodities and given maximum flexibility in their shift times, a few hospitals buck the trend and hold on to them, says Rafferty. As everyone reaches for some good to emerge from this catastrophe, she tells of a surgeon she just met, reassigned to an intensive care unit, \u201camazed\u201d at the expertise of those specialist nurses \u2013 and humbled to find himself relegated to assisting. \u201cBut of course, they are still paid around a third of his salary,\u201d she adds. So when next week\u2019s clap for the NHS comes, join in out of gratitude but also out of anger \u2013 anger at how depleted the nursing workforce has become and how badly the successive Conservative governments have treated the profession. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

In a report released on Friday, sponsor board members, who took control of the repair programme this month, have been urged to come up with a clear plan so they are not thrown off by competing interests, especially among MPs. Auditors have also disclosed that an estimated \u00a3149.6m to develop the business case in 2020-21 was rejected by the palace\u2019s authorities partly because of concerns about the impact of the pandemic. Formally appointed on 8 April, the board is due to submit a business case, which will include a budget range and full details of the work involved, by 2022. Before parliament voted in 2018 to approve the renewal works, which will entail decanting the whole building for at least six years, MPs had pushed rival plans that would have seen only a partial vacating required, forcing builders to work around the Commons schedule.

But he does it anyway, only adding to the sense that his arms could squeeze all the loneliness out of you. It also adds to the sense of confidence he exudes throughout.\u2019 9. I\u2019ve never seen ... Titanic \u2018In the real world, people are strange and confusing. In Titanic they\u2019re not. The good people are the poor ones who appreciate painting and dancing. The bad people are the rich ones who disapprove of Picasso and have never heard of Freud. As with many inherently conservative films, it likes to think of itself as siding with the radicals and underdogs.\u2019 10. Teenage chess prodigy Alireza Firouzja beaten by Magnus Carlsen and wifi woes \u2018\u201cI wanted to crush him,\u201d said Carlsen afterwards, using the c-word which was also a favourite of the legendary crushers Bobby Fischer and Judit Polgar. The champion dominated the play and showed a higher level of understanding in the first three games.\u2019",

      "bodyText": "The Northern Territory government has been accused of walking away from the six-month moratorium on residential evictions agreed by the national cabinet. All other Australian jurisdictions have legislated new laws giving effect to the March agreement to protect tenants for six months through a moratorium, or four months in the case of Tasmania, which acted before national cabinet. But the territory Labor government has opted against a moratorium on evictions and instead intends to make changes to negotiating and notice periods via legislation introduced on Friday in what tenants advocates labelled a \u201cbroken promise\u201d. That decision has angered housing advocates in a jurisdiction where half the population rents and where the rate of homelessness is 12 times the national average, said Peter McMillan, the chief executive of Shelter NT. McMillan told the Guardian the approach \u201cfalls way short of what was agreed at national cabinet on the 29th of March\u201d. \u201cIn our view there is no justification whatsoever why the NT government shouldn\u2019t introduce legislation \u2026 that gives full effect to the national agreement,\u201d he said. Tamara Spence, the managing solicitor of the Tenants Advice Service, said clients in the Northern Territory were already being issued breach notices for rental arrears. She said evictions had been ongoing over the past few weeks. \u201cThey promised that the moratorium would be for six months. To do any less than that would be a broken promise,\u201d she said. National cabinet\u2019s six-month moratorium In a statement on 29 March, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the national cabinet had \u201cagreed to a moratorium on evictions over the next six months for commercial and residential tenancies in financial distress\u201d. But the national cabinet failed to agree on specific provisions to protect residential tenants, leaving the specific enactment of the moratorium and other measures to individual states and territories. All states and territories except the NT and Tasmania have since passed laws enacting a six-month moratorium and of those that did, only NSW did not also ban rent increases over the period. Tasmania announced a four-month evictions moratorium before national cabinet\u2019s 29 March agreement. Most states and the ACT have also included tax breaks for homeowners or emergency cash grants to encourage landlords and tenants to come to the negotiating table. The NT attorney general, Natasha Fyles, conceded \u201cmost jurisdictions have gone with 180 days\u201d, adding that \u201chere in the territory we\u2019ve gone for 120 days\u201d. \u201cAnd that\u2019s split into two parts,\u201d she said on Thursday. \u201cThe first part is extending if someone is having difficulty in paying their rent that negotiation period is currently set at 14 days, it extends it out to 60 days. \u201cAnd then when they have to give notice, the landlord gives notice to a tenant that currently again sits at 14 days, extends that out to 60 days, so that\u2019s 120 days total. We believe that\u2019s reasonable.\u201d Fyles told the Guardian the NT\u2019s legislation was \u201cguided by the principles from National Cabinet\u201d. \u201cThe work we have undertaken to implement the Tenancies Legislation Amendment Bill 2020 is a direct result of the Chief Minister\u2019s commitment to work with all states and the Federal Government to quickly and decisively protect Australians in these unprecedented times,\u201d she said in a statement. While the ACT government has enacted a six-month moratorium on evictions, Fyles said the government was confirmed by a \u201cjust terms\u201d provision in the NT Self Government Act. \u201cWe cannot speak for the ACT,\u201d she said. But McMillan said the government \u2019s approach was \u201csimply kicking the can down the road\u201d. \u201cExtending notice periods gives no comfort to tenants that may well be evicted by their landlords,\u201d he said. \u201cIt provides no security that there will be bargaining in good faith.\u201d Linda Weatherhead, the executive director of the Darwin Community Legal Service, said her organisation, which runs the territory\u2019s only tenancy advice service, was not consulted over the legislation introduced on Friday. \u201cWe do know that there have been a lot of discussions with the Real Estate Institute,\u201d she said. Fyles did not deny the government had been lobbied by the real estate industry against adopting the moratorium when asked directly, but said the bill was \u201cshaped by our existing legislative framework\u201d. \u201cAdvocates for impacted parties will of course have their own feelings about these amendments, and we respect that,\u201d she said.

The chief executive of peak body Private Healthcare Australia, Dr Rachel David, has said health funds were going to extraordinary lengths to offer financial relief to their members. \u201cHealth funds have given a commitment that any funds resulting from the cancellation of elective surgery and some allied health services will be returned to members.\u201d Consumer group Choice has argued that health insurers should stop charging for benefits that are not available during the pandemic shutdown and reduce their premiums by at least half. Modelling by the Australia Institute argues hospital insurance benefits may be reduced by between 50% and 70% and extras claims by 10% to 30%.

The federal government cancelled all elective surgery in March to free up beds for Covid-19 patients, and to preserve limited personal protective equipment for health professionals. Some surgeries are set to resume next week, health minister Greg Hunt has announced, \u201cusing a staged and controlled process\u201d balancing the ongoing need for Covid-19 capacity and a resumption of the most pressing elective surgeries. Procedures that are \u201clow-risk and high-value\u201d, patients at low risk of post-operative complications, as well as children who have been waiting for surgeries will be prioritised. Choice said the easing of surgery restrictions would still mean only about a quarter of the usual surgical load would proceed in hospitals. \u201cThis pandemic has highlighted many of the problems and inequities in the private health insurance and hospital systems,\u201d Choice health insurance campaigner Dean Price said. \u201cSurgeries have been cancelled and other services limited, and right now health funds are charging us for services we can\u2019t use. \u201cUntil our health system is back to normal, people need relief from their health insurance premiums.\u201d Private Healthcare Australia has said a number of measures were being considered to recompense members. \u201cIn the next couple of months, if it looks like abnormal profits are accumulating, we will work out how to distribute those profits back to members,\u201d CEO Rachel David told the ABC. \u201cThat can be done in a number of ways, either by a cash rebate that is deposited in the member\u2019s bank account, or by reducing the extras premium going forward, or by actually rolling over the benefit people would have got this year for next year.\u201d Sheena Jack, the chief executive of the non-profit fund HCF has pledged to return any additional profits to members. \u201cWe will not be keeping any windfall gains that may accrue by a reduction in claims. \u201cWe are exploring how we help members now as well as how we can pass back any savings to them that accrue from reductions in claims due to Covid-19.\u201d HBF, another non-profit fund, said it would similarly return additional money to members. \u201cIf the current situation continues for an extended time, we\u2019ll certainly consider how we should use accumulated funds for the benefit of our members,\u201d chief executive John Van Der Wielen said.

Moulin says the team is considering developing an app with a panic button for women, as well as one for men to deter them from committing acts of violence.</p> <p> </p> <p>The nudge theory was put forward in a 2008 book of the same name by economist Richard Thaler and political scientist Cass Sunstein. One of Thaler\u2019s insights is that people do not always behave in their own best interests. From this, he developed an argument that nuanced changes can trigger desirable shifts in behaviour for individuals and society.</p> <p>Former UK prime minister David Cameron was a fan and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/nov/12/david-cameron-nudge-unit\">in 2010</a> set up the first nudge unit, the Cabinet Office behavioural insights team. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/10/nudge-unit-pushed-way-private-sector-behavioural-insights-team\">Its successes</a> include sending letters to British GPs who were prescribing more than their peers, cutting unnecessary prescriptions by 3.3%.</p> <p>The UK government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/why-is-the-government-relying-on-nudge-theory-to-tackle-coronavirus\">early response to the pandemic</a> was thought to be largely influenced by the behavioural insights team.

      "bodyText": "Brazil has been the Latin American country hardest-hit so far by the coronavirus pandemic, with many fearing that deaths from Covid-19 are rocketing well beyond the 2,588 officially recorded so far. The situation is particularly dire for the millions of Brazilians living in densely populated favelas where physical distancing is almost impossible. But Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro doesn\u2019t seem to be taking concerns over the virus seriously, accusing the media of \u201chysteria\u201d. And he has clashed with Rio de Janeiro\u2019s governor, Wilson Witzel, who has ordered the state\u2019s 17 million citizens to stay at home \u2013 and off the city\u2019s beaches. Helping in the effort to keep people safe and away from public areas is NudgeRio, a department in Rio\u2019s city hall that uses behavioural science to influence people\u2019s decisions. The team has helped produce messages to encourage people to stay at home, including a photograph of Sugar Loaf mountain with accompanying text that reads: \u201cRio\u2019s landscape gives the hint. Let\u2019s flatten the curve.\u201d For the past week, city hall has been sending drones around the city with audio messages, created by NudgeRio, to remind people to avoid crowded areas and to wash their hands. \u201cWe have produced three messages so far, but will be doing more,\u201d says Jose Moulin Netto, who set up NudgeRio in 2018. The team is also involved in a project to combat growing domestic violence, a global problem exacerbated by lockdown situations. Moulin says the team is considering developing an app with a panic button for women, as well as one for men to deter them from committing acts of violence. The nudge theory was put forward in a 2008 book of the same name by economist Richard Thaler and political scientist Cass Sunstein. One of Thaler\u2019s insights is that people do not always behave in their own best interests. From this, he developed an argument that nuanced changes can trigger desirable shifts in behaviour for individuals and society. Former UK prime minister David Cameron was a fan and in 2010 set up the first nudge unit, the Cabinet Office behavioural insights team. Its successes include sending letters to British GPs who were prescribing more than their peers, cutting unnecessary prescriptions by 3.3%. The UK government\u2019s early response to the pandemic was thought to be largely influenced by the behavioural insights team. But this was subsequently changed and, as Tony Yates, a former professor of economics at Birmingham University, pointed out in early March, the UK strategy was an outlier: \u201cIf the nudgers have got it right, why are so many other countries taking a very different view of the \u2018science\u2019?\u201d Before coronavirus took hold, the four permanent members of the Rio team were working onchanging messaging to tackle flooding. In April 2019, Rio de Janeiro recorded its worst level of rainfall in 22 years, with storms that left 10 people dead. Monsoon rains impact poorer communities worst, especially those in favelas on steep hillsides. This year alone, about 150 Brazilians have been killed or are missing following heavy rains, landslides and flooding. Summer in the city is always \u201cproblematic\u201d, according to Thais Miguelino, a spokeswoman for the Rio operations centre that monitors traffic, accidents and weather and manages crisis situations, including the pandemic. \u201cWe need to know how to communicate with people so they know what they need to do,\u201d she says. \u201cThe idea is to change people\u2019s thinking so we can save lives.\u201d The centre wants to work out how best to use its social media channels to communicate messages that will encourage people to stay put and avoid travel during a storm, or advise them how to get to a place of safety.

Two days later the government announced a \u00a375m scheme to help repatriate Britons stranded abroad, and suggested citizens should get on any available commercial flights \u201cwithout delay\u201d. For those left in Panama, flights out quickly became fully booked, were cancelled or were too expensive. This week Panamanian authorities announced a 30-day extension to its ban on international travel into and out of the country. \u201cThe embassy is a joke,\u201d Bates said. \u201cThere was a glorified lift-off site and that was it. There\u2019s been no help with food, accommodation, nothing. We\u2019re told there are no further plans of future flights for Britons leaving Panama, and now we were being offered lifts back home on flights put on by other European countries. Then how do I get home from there? I\u2019ve lost three flights already; I\u2019m not in a financial position to keep booking them. We\u2019re facing months here.\u201d The Foreign Office said it had helped 85 people return to the UK. \u201cWe are in regular contact with members of the group remaining at Tribal Gathering,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe have provided details of available accommodation and have offered safe passage letters to assist in moving there.\u201d",

Communities that were already lacking funds for education, health and housing are now faced with alarming infection rates and fatalities. And these communities lack access to testing and equitable healthcare.\u201d Last weekend, she gave support to African American communities during the livestreamed benefit concert One World: Together at Home. She said they were \u201cseverely affected by this crisis \u2026This virus is killing black people and in an alarmingly high rate here in America.\u201d Dorsey created #startsmall earlier this month, moving $1bn of his equity in his payments company Square to the fund \u2013 around 28% of his personal wealth. #startsmall has distributed $8m to different causes so far, not including Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s donation; its activity can be tracked in a public spreadsheet.

The Guangzhou people\u2019s procuratorate told the Guardian there was no official statement on the case at this time. Lee reportedly went missing in August last year after travelling from Taiwan to Shenzhen. In September the Taiwan affairs office of China\u2019s state council said he was being investigated for \u201cengaging in criminal acts that endanger state security\u201d, and in late November Chinese media revealed he had been arrested in Guangzhou. At least three other Taiwan residents were arrested around the same time, for charges relating to assisting foreign forces in relation to Hong Kong or endangering national security.

In November the vice-foreign minister told the US to \u201cstop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and interfering in China\u2019s internal matters\u201d. Lee\u2019s case is the first prosecution of a foreigner in relation to the protests, but more than 7,000 citizens, mostly young Hong Kongers, have been charged or prosecuted. On Friday the pro-democracy former legislator Au Nok-hin was sentenced to 140 hours of community service after being convicted of assault by yelling through a loudspeaker and damaging the hearing of a police officer. Despite consistent accusations of brutality against demonstrators, no police officers have faced charges. Crackdowns on those leading and participating in the pro-democracy protests reached a crescendo last week, with the arrest of 15 senior figures including the 81-year-old barrister and founder of the Democratic party, Martin Lee. Interventions by Beijing\u2019s top bodies in Hong Kong have also deepened the city\u2019s political crisis, ahead of legislative council elections in September. Last year Hong Kongers voted overwhelmingly in favour of pro-democracy candidates in the district council elections, despite the damage done by the protests to the city\u2019s social and economic life. It is widely anticipated that once coronavirus physical distancing measures are lifted the protests will return, and that they will have been spurred on by recent events.

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has laid down the gauntlet to aged care providers over what he sees as excessive restrictions, warning that the Australian government will step in if elderly residents are locked in their rooms without access to visitors. The prime minister has also rejected teachers\u2019 union calls for physical distancing in classrooms before schools can return, arguing it is not supported by medical advice and \u201cnot a credible requirement\u201d to insist on 1.5 metres between students or 4 sq metres of personal space in such settings. Addressing reporters in Canberra after the latest meeting of the national cabinet, Morrison confirmed he was working with state and territory leaders on plans to resume community sport as the country moved into the \u201cnext phase\u201d of the coronavirus response. Morrison announced that parliament would resume on 12, 13 and 14 May, a move welcomed by the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, who suggested the next session would need to deal with \u201cimportant privacy legislation\u201d to protect information gathered by Australia\u2019s contact tracing app. Morrison confirmed the ABC report that data collected from the app, still under development but soon to be released, would be stored by Amazon Web Services. But Morrison said the servers would be located in Australia and \u201cit will be illegal for information to go out of that data store to any other person other than\u201d people conducting contract tracing, rejecting the thrust of the story that data would be within reach of US intelligence services. On Friday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, also announced a raft of changes expanding eligibility for the $130bn jobkeeper wage subsidy, including allowing charities to exclude government revenue from the reduction in turnover needed to access the program. \u201cThis will help to ensure that the eligibility of charities is not adversely affected where they are delivering significant services that are funded by government,\u201d Frydenberg said. The move is designed to help charities which run services including child care, homelessness and aged care. The government will also provide an alternative decline in turnover test for special purpose service entities that employ staff who then work in related entities in a company group. The new test will examine the turnover decline of the related entities using the services of the employer entity. Earlier, Morrison said national cabinet had reiterated its concerns about some aged care providers imposing restrictions on visitors above and beyond the national rules. Morrison acknowledged it was \u201centirely sensible\u201d to have tougher rules in some places such as in north-west Tasmania and western Sydney due to local outbreaks, but this should be an exception rather than a rule. \u201cMore broadly, having people stuck in their rooms, not being able to be visited by their loved ones and carers and other support people, that\u2019s not OK,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not going to have these as secret places, where people can\u2019t access them.\u201d Morrison warned that if he did not see an \u201cimprovement\u201d on a voluntary basis, he would move towards a mandatory system where aged care providers had to apply for permission to stray from the rules. As New South Wales has announced a phased return to face-to-face teaching in term two and the Australian Capital Territory prepares a plan to do the same, the argument is slowly turning in the commonwealth\u2019s favour that schools should be reopened. But a return to full face-to-face learning is opposed by Victoria, based on its own medical advice, and the New South Wales Teachers Federation, which has called for physical distancing in classrooms. On Friday Morrison reiterated that schools did not need to impose the rules, telling Sky News \u201cthe 1.5m [distance] and the 4 sq metre [rules] are not required, based on the health advice, so suggestions that are coming from that group that this is necessary \u2013 that\u2019s just not true, that\u2019s not a credible requirement\u201d. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee advised it believes the \u201cvenue density\u201d rules are not \u201cappropriate or practical in classrooms or corridors\u201d. However, on 16 April the AHPPC did note that schools were taking such measures to \u201cminimise risk\u201d. Morrison said physical distancing should apply in the staff room, lunch room and at the pick-up and drop-off of school children but the risk in classrooms was \u201cno different\u201d to workers in supermarkets or bus drivers. Earlier, at the press conference, he said parents who were trying to work from home while also trying to help the children learn was \u201cnot working too well\u201d for them. \u201cSo when we can get back to the point where we can have kids back at school, and we can get people back at work, then I think we\u2019re going to see that also lift our economy in ways that we very much need.\u201d National cabinet agreed to a set of \u201csafe workplace principles\u201d, asking employers to consult with workers to understand risks and introduce hygiene and physical distancing measures. The government also released the latest update to its modelling on how the virus was spreading in Australia. The effective rate of transmission remains below 1, although experts urged against complacency. Jodie McVernon, a professor at the University of Melbourne and director of Doherty Epidemiology, said the modelling team had updated its assumptions about the spread of infections by returned travellers because strong quarantine measures had been put in place. That meant the estimate of the effective rate of transmission was \u201ca bit higher than our previous report, but still below the critical threshold of 1 needed to prevent case numbers from increasing, confirming that current public health and distancing measures are working\u201d. According to the revised estimates, the reproduction rate remains above 1 in Tasmania, and just below in Western Australia and Queensland.",

      "body": "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Calla Wahlquist bringing you the main stories on Friday 24 April.</p> \n<h2>Aged care providers put on notice over restrictions</h2> \n<p>Scott Morrison has warned aged care providers to loosen restrictions or face stronger regulations that would prevent them from locking down residents without commonwealth approval. The prime minister said aged care providers had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/21/elective-surgery-restart-will-allow-government-to-wind-back-support-for-private-hospitals\">previously been told</a> not to restrict residents beyond the measures recommended by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, but despite that warning some homes were not allowing visitors and confining residents to their rooms even when no outbreak had taken place.'</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up to get this delivered as daily email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Morrison said there were reasonable circumstances \u2013 such as the outbreak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/some-australian-aged-care-homes-go-beyond-official-coronavirus-advice-with-lockdowns\">at Newmarch House aged care home in NSW, where five people have died</a> \u2013 in which to impose stronger restrictions to protect residents. \u201cBut more broadly, having people stuck in their rooms, not being able to be visited by their loved ones and carers and other support people, that\u2019s not OK,\u201d he said.</p> \n<h2>Testing expanded nationally</h2> \n<p>Every state and territory has now broadened its testing criteria, which is the first of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/the-exit-strategy-how-countries-around-the-world-are-preparing-for-life-after-covid-19\">three steps</a> that Morrison said needed to be in place before the national cabinet would consider lifting social distancing restrictions. The other two steps are improved contact tracing and a strengthened local response capability. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said arrangements for testing asymptomatic people in frontline occupations were well under way.</p> \n<p>It appears likely that restrictions on sport and recreation will be lifted first. The national cabinet on Friday began working on a set of national principles under which professional and community sporting clubs, and individual recreational pursuits, might be allowed to resume. The AFL has said it will announce its season return date next week, while the NRL is still aiming for 28 May.</p> \n<h2>Death toll rises to 79</h2> \n<p>Australia recorded just 13 new cases overnight, while the national death toll rose to 79. A 79-year-old woman, who was part of the cluster of cases in north-west Tasmania, died overnight; a passenger from the Artania cruise ship died in hospital in Western Australia; and a fifth resident at Sydney\u2019s Newmarch House aged care facility died on Friday. Health authorities in Victoria, where six new cases were recorded overnight, are investigating a new cluster at a private inpatient psychiatric facility in Melbourne. So far 14 people, including five patients, have tested positive to Covid-19 in relation to this outbreak.</p> \n<h2>Concerns about US access to tracking data</h2> \n<p>It will be illegal to access data collected by the proposed contact tracing app for the purpose of anything other than contact tracing, the federal government has said. The data will be housed in an Amazon Web Services server, located in Australia, raising concerns that the US government will be able to access the data because of laws allowing it to access data held by US companies. The government services minister, Stuart Robert, said security would be ensured by the Biosecurity Act, under which it would be a criminal offence to transfer the data to any country other than Australia. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/24/virgin-australia-owes-68bn-to-more-than-12000-creditors-documents-reveal\">Virgin Australia owes $6.8bn to more than 12,000 creditors, documents reveal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Virgin Australia planes blocked at Perth airport</h2> \n<p>Virgin Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/24/virgin-australia-owes-68bn-to-more-than-12000-creditors-documents-reveal\">owed $6.8bn to 120,000 creditors went it went into administration on Monday</a>, citing the impact of the coronavirus.

But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/13/are-schools-open-closed-term-2-australia-coronavirus-easter-holidays\">states have all adopted different positions</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Calla Wahlquist bringing you the main stories on Friday 24 April. Aged care providers put on notice over restrictions Scott Morrison has warned aged care providers to loosen restrictions or face stronger regulations that would prevent them from locking down residents without commonwealth approval. The prime minister said aged care providers had previously been told not to restrict residents beyond the measures recommended by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, but despite that warning some homes were not allowing visitors and confining residents to their rooms even when no outbreak had taken place.' Morrison said there were reasonable circumstances \u2013 such as the outbreak at Newmarch House aged care home in NSW, where five people have died \u2013 in which to impose stronger restrictions to protect residents. \u201cBut more broadly, having people stuck in their rooms, not being able to be visited by their loved ones and carers and other support people, that\u2019s not OK,\u201d he said. Testing expanded nationally Every state and territory has now broadened its testing criteria, which is the first of three steps that Morrison said needed to be in place before the national cabinet would consider lifting social distancing restrictions. The other two steps are improved contact tracing and a strengthened local response capability. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said arrangements for testing asymptomatic people in frontline occupations were well under way. It appears likely that restrictions on sport and recreation will be lifted first. The national cabinet on Friday began working on a set of national principles under which professional and community sporting clubs, and individual recreational pursuits, might be allowed to resume. The AFL has said it will announce its season return date next week, while the NRL is still aiming for 28 May. Death toll rises to 79 Australia recorded just 13 new cases overnight, while the national death toll rose to 79. A 79-year-old woman, who was part of the cluster of cases in north-west Tasmania, died overnight; a passenger from the Artania cruise ship died in hospital in Western Australia; and a fifth resident at Sydney\u2019s Newmarch House aged care facility died on Friday. Health authorities in Victoria, where six new cases were recorded overnight, are investigating a new cluster at a private inpatient psychiatric facility in Melbourne. So far 14 people, including five patients, have tested positive to Covid-19 in relation to this outbreak. Concerns about US access to tracking data It will be illegal to access data collected by the proposed contact tracing app for the purpose of anything other than contact tracing, the federal government has said. The data will be housed in an Amazon Web Services server, located in Australia, raising concerns that the US government will be able to access the data because of laws allowing it to access data held by US companies. The government services minister, Stuart Robert, said security would be ensured by the Biosecurity Act, under which it would be a criminal offence to transfer the data to any country other than Australia. Virgin Australia planes blocked at Perth airport Virgin Australia owed $6.8bn to 120,000 creditors went it went into administration on Monday, citing the impact of the coronavirus. Federal court judge John Middleton, who gave the administrators until next Thursday to hold a creditors\u2019 meeting, noted he might himself be a creditor, because he had flights booked with the airline for July and was a member of its lounge club. Meanwhile at Perth airport, Virgin planes have been parked in because the airline owes $16m in airfield and terminal use fees. The airport said blocking planes in was \u201cstandard practice\u201d. Fight over schools continues The federal government is pushing for schools to reopen, with Morrison stressing that there is no requirement under the national health advice for classrooms to ensure students remain 1.5m apart, with four square metres per child, at all times. But the states have all adopted different positions. Public schools in Western Australia will offer face-to-face teaching from Monday, and the WA premier Mark McGowan said parents of independent and Catholic schools that had not resumed face-to-face teaching should request a discount on their school fees.

Companies will also be able to book them for employees.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/why-the-uk-is-finding-it-so-hard-to-reach-100000-covid-19-tests-a-day\">Why the UK is finding it so hard to reach 100,000 Covid-19 tests a day</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>People who register will receive a text or email with an appointment at one of 48 drive-through centres or can request a home test kit. However, moments after the website went live on Friday morning all the home tests for key workers had already gone.</p> \n<p>A note on the government website said: \u201cCurrently, only drive-through tests available. We\u2019ve issued today\u2019s allocation of home test kits. If you need a home test kit, check back here tomorrow, when more will be available. You can continue if you\u2019re able to visit a drive-through test centre.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hancock said testing was \u201cslow at the beginning of the month\u201d but claimed the government was ahead of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/matt-hancock-sets-target-of-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day\">its plan</a> to be able to test 100,000 people a day by May.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe reason why the increase was pretty slow at the start of the month is because we have been building these symptoms to automate the testing, automate the labs and the IT systems that are needed,\u201d he told the BBC.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are ahead of our internal plan for where we expected the amount of capacity to be and we have got a week left to hit that goal.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Asked if he thought the 100,000 target would be met, he replied: \u201cI do, yes, but nothing is guaranteed in life.\u201d</p> \n<p>A help desk has been set up to aid the process, and 48 mobile units run by the army will travel around the country to where they are needed, such as care homes.</p> \n<p>Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Hancock added: \u201cNot as many people have been coming for [a test] as we had expected. Of course that was a problem but it\u2019s a good problem because it means we\u2019ve been able to expand who can get a test faster than we had planned.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey will start in small numbers but that service will grow, and I think that will be a popular service as it increasingly becomes available.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus-key-workers</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The government also announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-contact-tracing-explained\">contact tracing</a> operation would be functioning in a \u201cmatter of weeks\u201d. Eighteen thousand people, including 3,000 clinicians, will be recruited to work on contact tracing, supporting an NHS mobile phone app that will automatically log users\u2019 contacts and warn them if they have been close to someone who tests positive.</p> \n<p>Hancock said these steps would be crucial to holding down the rate and level of transmission of the disease. \u201cThey work far better when there are fewer new cases but, if they work as they have done in other countries, then they will be able to hold down the number of new cases with fewer social distancing restrictions, which is why they are so important to get in place in large scale.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK health secretary has said a new online booking system will be key as the government scrambles to meet its 100,000 a day coronavirus testing target by the end of the month. The government announced a major expansion of eligibility for testing \u2013 less than a week before a self-imposed deadline \u2013 after it was criticised for a low uptake of tests, with the latest daily figure of 23,000 still less than half the total capacity, which has risen to 51,000. All key workers will be able to get a test if they or their employers request one, announced Matt Hancock, as he said widespread testing and tracing of those coming into contact with confirmed cases was the only way to ease physical distancing measures. The list includes NHS and social care workers, police officers, teachers, social workers, those in the justice system, undertakers, some in local government, supermarket and food production workers, journalists, transport workers and some people in utilities and IT. From today, those seeking a test will be able to register via a government website. Companies will also be able to book them for employees. People who register will receive a text or email with an appointment at one of 48 drive-through centres or can request a home test kit. However, moments after the website went live on Friday morning all the home tests for key workers had already gone. A note on the government website said: \u201cCurrently, only drive-through tests available. We\u2019ve issued today\u2019s allocation of home test kits. If you need a home test kit, check back here tomorrow, when more will be available. You can continue if you\u2019re able to visit a drive-through test centre.\u201d Hancock said testing was \u201cslow at the beginning of the month\u201d but claimed the government was ahead of its plan to be able to test 100,000 people a day by May. \u201cThe reason why the increase was pretty slow at the start of the month is because we have been building these symptoms to automate the testing, automate the labs and the IT systems that are needed,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cWe are ahead of our internal plan for where we expected the amount of capacity to be and we have got a week left to hit that goal.\u201d Asked if he thought the 100,000 target would be met, he replied: \u201cI do, yes, but nothing is guaranteed in life.\u201d A help desk has been set up to aid the process, and 48 mobile units run by the army will travel around the country to where they are needed, such as care homes. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Hancock added: \u201cNot as many people have been coming for [a test] as we had expected. Of course that was a problem but it\u2019s a good problem because it means we\u2019ve been able to expand who can get a test faster than we had planned. \u201cThey will start in small numbers but that service will grow, and I think that will be a popular service as it increasingly becomes available.\u201d The government also announced a contact tracing operation would be functioning in a \u201cmatter of weeks\u201d. Eighteen thousand people, including 3,000 clinicians, will be recruited to work on contact tracing, supporting an NHS mobile phone app that will automatically log users\u2019 contacts and warn them if they have been close to someone who tests positive. Hancock said these steps would be crucial to holding down the rate and level of transmission of the disease. \u201cThey work far better when there are fewer new cases but, if they work as they have done in other countries, then they will be able to hold down the number of new cases with fewer social distancing restrictions, which is why they are so important to get in place in large scale.\u201d",

This may well lead to an attritional bout of \u201cwhack a mole\u201d where states loosen and then tighten restrictions as new cases crop up, said Andy Slavitt, a former healthcare official under Barack Obama.</p> <p>Slavitt said in the absence of consistent federal leadership the public should listen to high-profile public health figures such as Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, and be prepared for long-term changes to the rhythm of everyday life.</p> <p>\u201cUntil we have herd immunity and a safe vaccine that can be distributed to everyone in the country we will be in this altered state,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither will be a silver bullet, though, so maybe older and sicker people will have to socially distance for a certain time in the year on an ongoing basis. Maybe we don\u2019t do handshaking any more. Maybe we wear masks a little more.\u201d</p>",

But Ben Amor said states like Georgia, which is still reporting significant numbers of infections, do not meet the criteria as yet. \u201cWhy the hell is Georgia opening when it isn\u2019t ticking the box of phase one?\u201d he said. \u201cIt still has too many cases. There needs to be a strong, informed approach from the federal government rather than just let the states police themselves.\u201d While infections and hospitalizations are showing signs of plateauing, the US will probably, at some point, be hit with a second wave of Covid-19 infections and experts say the approach taken in reopening the economy and implementing mass testing will be crucial in determining the severity of this second peak. Recent modeling done by researchers at MIT, based upon the experiences of China and Italy, has found that an early reopening will spell disaster. A draft paper by the researchers warns \u201crelaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.\u201d If restrictions are lifted now it may take a month before a surge in new infections is apparent, a window of time that may make states feel confident in further loosening lockdown conditions. This may well lead to an attritional bout of \u201cwhack a mole\u201d where states loosen and then tighten restrictions as new cases crop up, said Andy Slavitt, a former healthcare official under Barack Obama. Slavitt said in the absence of consistent federal leadership the public should listen to high-profile public health figures such as Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, and be prepared for long-term changes to the rhythm of everyday life. \u201cUntil we have herd immunity and a safe vaccine that can be distributed to everyone in the country we will be in this altered state,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither will be a silver bullet, though, so maybe older and sicker people will have to socially distance for a certain time in the year on an ongoing basis. Maybe we don\u2019t do handshaking any more. Maybe we wear masks a little more.\u201d",

Last week, the Arizona department of health services <a href=\"https://indiancountrytoday.com/news/arizona-16-percent-of-covid-19-deaths-are-native-americans-b-n3zYNsgUGFHiFSZpzPxg\">reported</a> that Native Americans make up 16% of the state\u2019s Covid-19 related deaths, despite representing only 6% of the state\u2019s population. In <a href=\"http://nmindepth.com/2020/04/12/native-americans-make-up-31-of-new-mexico-covid-19-cases/\">New Mexico</a>, Native Americans make up less than 10% of the population but over one-third of coronavirus cases.</p> <p>This week, the health authority for the Navajo Nation, which includes areas of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, reported 1,197 positive coronavirus cases and 44 deaths. If it were a state, it would <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/navajo-nation-coronavirus-per-capita_n_5e94b532c5b6a50d4ae6d7e7\">rank third in the country</a> for confirmed cases per 100,000 population, behind only New York and New Jersey (though the nation is also testing at a <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/04/19/navajo-nation-has-higher/\">far higher rate</a> than most states).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"68469a069144db4bd760ed18c4f3f59ba3e87b00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68469a069144db4bd760ed18c4f3f59ba3e87b00/0_129_2400_1441/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In states that do categorize Native Americans in the demographic results, early data indicates dramatically disproportionate rates of infection and death.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In states that do categorize Native Americans in the demographic results, early data indicates dramatically disproportionate rates of infection and death.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Murphy/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Communities of color are not more susceptible to coronavirus, but because of years of unequal access to healthcare,<strong> </strong>clean water and nutritious food, they are at greater risk of developing complications. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Native Americans experience diabetes<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/aian-diabetes/index.html\"> three times more</a> than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States, and have the <a href=\"https://www.indianz.com/News/archive/000408.asp\">highest rates of asthma</a>. Before the pandemic, the federal health system serving Native Americans was already <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/12/12/569910574/native-americans-feel-invisible-in-u-s-health-care-system\">chronically underfunded</a>.</p> <p>The Guardian found health departments did not include Native Americans in their racial demographic data even in areas with high numbers of Native residents. The majority of Native Americans live in urban areas, with the highest populations in New York City and Los Angeles. But <a href=\"https://abc7.com/los-angeles-county-coronavirus-covid-19-in-the-black-community/6087896/\">neither</a> explicitly include Native Americans in <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-deaths-race-ethnicity-04082020-1.pdf\">the breakdowns of their Covid</a><a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-deaths-race-ethnicity-04082020-1.pdf\">-19 data</a>.</p> <p>The NYC department of health and mental hygiene did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. The Los Angeles county department of public health said it was \u201clooking into getting more accurate information on the race/ethnicity field\u201d and hoped to provide \u201cmore meaningful reports on this in the future\u201d.</p> <p>Half of all American Indian and Alaskan Natives live in just 10 states, <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/c2010br-10.pdf\">according to the US Census Bureau</a>. As of 21 April, all 10 had published some racial demographic data, but four \u2013 Texas, Florida, New York and Michigan \u2013 had not included a breakdown for Native Americans. A spokesperson for the Texas department of state health services said that Native Americans were categorized as \u201cother\u201d because their case numbers were small compared with other groups.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a small population of people because of genocide. No other reason,\u201d said Echo-Hawk. \u201cIf you eliminate us in the data, we don\u2019t exist. We don\u2019t exist for the allocation of resources.\u201d</p> <p>Leaving Native Americans out of public health data is not new in the US. For example in January, the CDC released its most comprehensive study to date on race and maternal mortality rates, but American Indians and Alaskan Natives were not included. When the Urban Indian Health Institute did its own research, it found Native women living in cities were 4.5 times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than white women.</p> <p>Health experts have also warned that local and state health departments that are including Native Americans in their demographic data are still likely to be undercounting Native Covid-19 patients and deaths due to racial misclassification.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f9d69d511796fe054cb9f549ce1820fa5f015597\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9d69d511796fe054cb9f549ce1820fa5f015597/0_0_2400_1614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This week, the health authority for the Navajo Nation, which includes areas of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, reported 1,197 positive coronavirus cases and 44 deaths.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This week, the health authority for the Navajo Nation, which includes areas of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, reported 1,197 positive coronavirus cases and 44 deaths.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Murphy/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to some studies, Native Americans have a 50% chance of being listed as the wrong race on medical records, as well as birth and death certificates. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4545338/\">A 2015 study of hospital discharge records in Oregon</a> found that over half of Native patients had been miscategorized on their file, the majority as white. A separate 2014 <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4035863/\">study</a> found that 30% of Native American patients had been miscategorized on their death certificates.</p> <p>The Indian Health Services (IHS), a chronically underfunded<strong> </strong>federal healthcare system that serves 2.5 million tribal citizens in 37 states, has been <a href=\"https://www.ihs.gov/coronavirus/?CFID=181356580&amp;CFTOKEN=41189442\">publishing testing results daily</a> during the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>While not every Native person accesses healthcare through IHS, the system ought to be best placed to provide a snapshot of the impact of the Covid-19 in Indian country. But IHS cannot track hospitalization or mortality data for most of its patients, because the majority of IHS facilities do not provide intensive care, and so critically ill patients are transferred to non-IHS hospitals.</p> <p>The \u201cIHS may not be notified of deaths\u201d wrote an agency spokesperson. Therefore \u201cto avoid underreporting\u201d, IHS is only publishing testing results, they said.</p> <p>But testing numbers are also incomplete. The IHS includes a network of facilities operated<strong> </strong> by the IHS, tribal health services,<strong> </strong>and urban providers. Only IHS direct service facilities are required to report their data , representing about 17% of the facilities in the system. For all others, data sharing is voluntary. According to an IHS spokesperson, about a third of tribally run and urban facilities have reported their numbers.</p> <p>IHS is also hampered by an electronic record system that was developed in the 1980s. An IHS spokesperson said \u201ca replacement is necessary\u201d but in the meantime, \u201cCovid-19 surveillance data is being collected manually\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHealth disparities are nice words for systematic racism \u2026 it\u2019s the residual effects of the founding of this country,\u201d social demographer Desi Rodriguez-Lonebear (Cheyenne) told the Guardian. </p> <p>But Rodriguez-Lonebear said it was not enough to just include Native Americans in demographic data; the data also needs to include tribal affiliation. For tribal governments, she said, \u201cbeing able to identify who your citizens are in these big data sets is so vital to being able to understand the impact of the virus on your tribe\u201d.</p> <p>Unlike states and counties, tribes cannot rely on healthcare systems to tell them when their citizens are sick or dying and must collect the data themselves. The Guardian asked 15 state and local health departments with high Native populations if they were collecting tribal affiliation. None reported doing so.</p> <p>\u201cWe wish we had the resources to drill down to the tribal affiliation; however, we are not able to at this point,\u201d a spokesperson for Maricopa county, which includes the city of Phoenix, said.</p> <p>The only public national coronavirus database reporting tribal affiliation is being run by the independent Native newspaper, Indian Country Today, whose team of 16 people has been adding the positive Covid-19 cases and deaths they can verify to a <a href=\"https://indiancountrytoday.com/news/indian-country-s-covid-19-syllabus-EiN-p5Q-XkW-smnaebJV6Q\">daily report on their website</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"632b89fefdb7a18f4ac0613dfe5b32a7974af277\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/632b89fefdb7a18f4ac0613dfe5b32a7974af277/0_0_2400_1578/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Hunt gets a hug from her sister after Sophie\u2019s Covid-19 test in their grandparents\u2019 truck, outside of the Monument Valley Health Center in Oljato-Monument Valley in Utah.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophie Hunt gets a hug from her sister after Sophie\u2019s Covid-19 test in their grandparents\u2019 truck, outside of the Monument Valley Health Center in Oljato-Monument Valley in Utah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Murphy/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOften researchers and legislators say there is no data\u201d on health issues affecting Indian country, said Jourdan Bennett-Begay (Navajo), ICT\u2019s Washington editor. But he did not want that to happen after this pandemic. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be forgotten\u201d.</p> <p>ICT\u2019s database is already being used by a team of indigenous researchers at UCLA and the University of Arizona, that includes Rodriguez-Lonebear, to look at characteristics \u2013 such as a lack of access to running water, that might be facilitating the spread of Covid-19 in Indian country and what interventions could potentially slow down a second wave. In Navajo Nation, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/02/navajo-nation-grassroots-self-help-coronavirus\">one in three people do not have access to running water</a> or electricity.</p> <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, both Democrats, joined others to introduce a <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/transcript-warren-remarks-on-press-call-about-her-bill-to-require-release-of-covid-demographic-data_--including-race-and-ethnicity\">bill last week</a> calling for consultation with tribal governments on federal data collection and an additional $3m for Indian Health Services.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fix what you can\u2019t see,\u201d Warren said last week. \u201cIf we want to slow the spread of the virus and ensure our response is robust and equitable, we need comprehensive data on who is getting tested, who is getting treatment, and who is dying.\u201d</p> <p>The bill did not address racial misclassification or data collection on tribal affiliation.</p> <p>However, Echo-Hawk thinks it is already too late to be accurately represented in the data about the current outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cWith what we\u2019re seeing right now, there will absolutely be a gross undercount of the effects of Covid on American Indian and Alaska Native peoples,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have an opportunity to prepare for the next wave.\u201d</p>",

But of those states, almost half did not explicitly include Native Americans in their breakdowns and instead categorized them under the label \u201cother\u201d. \u201cBy including us in the other category it effectively eliminates us in the data,\u201d Abigail Echo-Hawk (Pawnee), director, urban Indian health board and chief research officer, Seattle Indian Health Board, told the Guardian. In states that do categorize Native Americans in the demographic results, early data indicates dramatically disproportionate rates of infection and death. Last week, the Arizona department of health services reported that Native Americans make up 16% of the state\u2019s Covid-19 related deaths, despite representing only 6% of the state\u2019s population. In New Mexico, Native Americans make up less than 10% of the population but over one-third of coronavirus cases. This week, the health authority for the Navajo Nation, which includes areas of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, reported 1,197 positive coronavirus cases and 44 deaths. If it were a state, it would rank third in the country for confirmed cases per 100,000 population, behind only New York and New Jersey (though the nation is also testing at a far higher rate than most states). Communities of color are not more susceptible to coronavirus, but because of years of unequal access to healthcare, clean water and nutritious food, they are at greater risk of developing complications. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Native Americans experience diabetes three times more than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States, and have the highest rates of asthma. Before the pandemic, the federal health system serving Native Americans was already chronically underfunded. The Guardian found health departments did not include Native Americans in their racial demographic data even in areas with high numbers of Native residents. The majority of Native Americans live in urban areas, with the highest populations in New York City and Los Angeles. But neither explicitly include Native Americans in the breakdowns of their Covid-19 data. The NYC department of health and mental hygiene did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. The Los Angeles county department of public health said it was \u201clooking into getting more accurate information on the race/ethnicity field\u201d and hoped to provide \u201cmore meaningful reports on this in the future\u201d. Half of all American Indian and Alaskan Natives live in just 10 states, according to the US Census Bureau. As of 21 April, all 10 had published some racial demographic data, but four \u2013 Texas, Florida, New York and Michigan \u2013 had not included a breakdown for Native Americans. A spokesperson for the Texas department of state health services said that Native Americans were categorized as \u201cother\u201d because their case numbers were small compared with other groups. \u201cWe are a small population of people because of genocide. No other reason,\u201d said Echo-Hawk. \u201cIf you eliminate us in the data, we don\u2019t exist. We don\u2019t exist for the allocation of resources.\u201d Leaving Native Americans out of public health data is not new in the US. For example in January, the CDC released its most comprehensive study to date on race and maternal mortality rates, but American Indians and Alaskan Natives were not included. When the Urban Indian Health Institute did its own research, it found Native women living in cities were 4.5 times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than white women. Health experts have also warned that local and state health departments that are including Native Americans in their demographic data are still likely to be undercounting Native Covid-19 patients and deaths due to racial misclassification. According to some studies, Native Americans have a 50% chance of being listed as the wrong race on medical records, as well as birth and death certificates. A 2015 study of hospital discharge records in Oregon found that over half of Native patients had been miscategorized on their file, the majority as white. A separate 2014 study found that 30% of Native American patients had been miscategorized on their death certificates. The Indian Health Services (IHS), a chronically underfunded federal healthcare system that serves 2.5 million tribal citizens in 37 states, has been publishing testing results daily during the coronavirus outbreak. While not every Native person accesses healthcare through IHS, the system ought to be best placed to provide a snapshot of the impact of the Covid-19 in Indian country. But IHS cannot track hospitalization or mortality data for most of its patients, because the majority of IHS facilities do not provide intensive care, and so critically ill patients are transferred to non-IHS hospitals. The \u201cIHS may not be notified of deaths\u201d wrote an agency spokesperson. Therefore \u201cto avoid underreporting\u201d, IHS is only publishing testing results, they said. But testing numbers are also incomplete. The IHS includes a network of facilities operated by the IHS, tribal health services, and urban providers. Only IHS direct service facilities are required to report their data , representing about 17% of the facilities in the system. For all others, data sharing is voluntary. According to an IHS spokesperson, about a third of tribally run and urban facilities have reported their numbers. IHS is also hampered by an electronic record system that was developed in the 1980s. An IHS spokesperson said \u201ca replacement is necessary\u201d but in the meantime, \u201cCovid-19 surveillance data is being collected manually\u201d. \u201cHealth disparities are nice words for systematic racism \u2026 it\u2019s the residual effects of the founding of this country,\u201d social demographer Desi Rodriguez-Lonebear (Cheyenne) told the Guardian. But Rodriguez-Lonebear said it was not enough to just include Native Americans in demographic data; the data also needs to include tribal affiliation. For tribal governments, she said, \u201cbeing able to identify who your citizens are in these big data sets is so vital to being able to understand the impact of the virus on your tribe\u201d. Unlike states and counties, tribes cannot rely on healthcare systems to tell them when their citizens are sick or dying and must collect the data themselves. The Guardian asked 15 state and local health departments with high Native populations if they were collecting tribal affiliation. None reported doing so. \u201cWe wish we had the resources to drill down to the tribal affiliation; however, we are not able to at this point,\u201d a spokesperson for Maricopa county, which includes the city of Phoenix, said. The only public national coronavirus database reporting tribal affiliation is being run by the independent Native newspaper, Indian Country Today, whose team of 16 people has been adding the positive Covid-19 cases and deaths they can verify to a daily report on their website. \u201cOften researchers and legislators say there is no data\u201d on health issues affecting Indian country, said Jourdan Bennett-Begay (Navajo), ICT\u2019s Washington editor. But he did not want that to happen after this pandemic. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be forgotten\u201d. ICT\u2019s database is already being used by a team of indigenous researchers at UCLA and the University of Arizona, that includes Rodriguez-Lonebear, to look at characteristics \u2013 such as a lack of access to running water, that might be facilitating the spread of Covid-19 in Indian country and what interventions could potentially slow down a second wave. In Navajo Nation, for instance, one in three people do not have access to running water or electricity. Senator Elizabeth Warren and congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, both Democrats, joined others to introduce a bill last week calling for consultation with tribal governments on federal data collection and an additional $3m for Indian Health Services. \u201cYou can\u2019t fix what you can\u2019t see,\u201d Warren said last week. \u201cIf we want to slow the spread of the virus and ensure our response is robust and equitable, we need comprehensive data on who is getting tested, who is getting treatment, and who is dying.\u201d The bill did not address racial misclassification or data collection on tribal affiliation. However, Echo-Hawk thinks it is already too late to be accurately represented in the data about the current outbreak. \u201cWith what we\u2019re seeing right now, there will absolutely be a gross undercount of the effects of Covid on American Indian and Alaska Native peoples,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have an opportunity to prepare for the next wave.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>I\u2019ve never much liked the person I am. Anxiety and depression are still my default settings, even after decades of therapy, and I find it hard to hold on to any good feelings. It\u2019s like constantly watching joy slip through my fingers. But I like still less the person I have become during the coronavirus pandemic because now I view even friends as a possible source of disease and infection. I long to hug and be hugged but I have become overly protective of my personal space and get irritable if any runner gets within 5 metres of me. The only place I really feel safe now is my bedroom.</p> <p>Nor does it help that on a daily basis it becomes more evident that there is no clear plan for navigating our way through the crisis. Ministers are flying blind and the country has effectively been orphaned by the government. One of the less reported side-effects of the pandemic has been the way No 10 has sent out a string of no-mark ministers to do the morning media round, all of whose prime brief appears to have been to know as little as possible about anything. This week we\u2019ve had Oliver Dowden, Simon Clarke, Helen Whately and Brandon Lewis all failing to answerbasic questions. You\u2019d have thought that if you knew you were going to face the media, you\u2019d bother to learn some key facts, such as the number of NHS staff and care home workers who had died, but they couldn\u2019t even manage that. And it\u2019s not as if it was hard to find the answers, as they were all featured in many newspapers\u2019 double page spreads.</p> <p>Equally astonishing has been the rehabilitation of Piers Morgan. After several years of sucking up to Donald Trump, refusing to take anyone with mental health issues seriously and insisting that those who dared to criticise Brexit whining remoaners, he has become the nation\u2019s mouthpiece on Good Morning Britain by asking the tough questions and vocalising many people\u2019s anger at the government\u2019s failures. These really must be extraordinary times.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>The end of each season\u2019s University Challenge feels like a personal loss. I\u2019ve watched every episode without fail for decades now and am sad enough to keep a tally of my own score each week. I award myself one point for each correct answer \u2013 regardless whether it is a starter or bonus question \u2013 and disappear into a shame spiral if I score less than 10.</p> <p>This year\u2019s final promised to be a straight showdown between Imperial\u2019s Brandon and Corpus Christi\u2019s Wang, but in the end it was no contest, with Brandon cruising to victory. About 10 years ago I was able to fulfil a lifetime\u2019s ambition by appearing on one of the Christmas special series and learned the hard way that it\u2019s far more testing in real life than from the comfort of the sofa. It\u2019s not just knowing the answer but being quick enough on the buzzer.</p> <p>During my outing for Exeter against Glasgow, me and the rest of our team went into a blind panic when we realised we were trailing by about 110 points to 20 at the halfway stage. Not just because we didn\u2019t know all the answers but because we couldn\u2019t remember them quickly enough. There was one member of the Glasgow team who was beating us near-single-handedly because he was so much faster to react. So I made a decision that the only way to avoid total humiliation was to start pressing the buzzer even if I was only halfway sure of the answer because then at least we were in with a chance. It proved a mixed blessing as I got some answers embarrassingly wrong \u2013 my kids are gutted they haven\u2019t been able to find the episode on YouTube \u2013 but we did at least claw our way up to 120 and only lost by about 40. Never again.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>It was amazing how difficult parliament found it to adapt to new technology, given that most small businesses and family groups who had never heard of Zoom a month ago can now schedule meetings at will. After a dry run on Tuesday, the House of Commons finally returned to the new normal with an almost empty chamber for prime minister\u2019s questions and a ministerial statement from Matt Hancock.</p> <p>Weirdly the quiet of the chamber seemed to suit Keir Starmer, a QC who is totally at home in a courtroom drama, and he managed to make Dominic Raab look like a struggling pupil barrister. Even the technology by and large held up, though David Mundell couldn\u2019t log in and Peter Bone got cut off near the end. Straight afterwards there were a few conspiracy theories running that Bone had been cut off because he was questioning the conduct of the banks during the pandemic. I rather think the bosses of Barclay\u2019s, Lloyd\u2019s and HSBC have got better things to do than order their IT departments to silence the Bone. It\u2019s far more likely the Bone silenced himself by accidentally pressing the mute button.</p> <p>Much weirder was the presence of Jeremy Corbyn in the chamber, given that he is over 70 and therefore officially classed in the vulnerable category. His question to Matt Hancock could just as easily have been asked by Zoom. Even more bizarrely, Corbyn was later spotted by one of my more happy-go-lucky colleagues, who is still brave enough to go into work, pulling up a chair from a table that had been deliberately kept apart from neighbouring ones to sit and have lunch with a friend. It seems like the guidance on self-isolation hasn\u2019t yet filtered down to everyone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57425f2e942f32325d71d9bbbdfdc27ba27766b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57425f2e942f32325d71d9bbbdfdc27ba27766b7/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn: \u2018I still think I won the argument\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>There are some calls you don\u2019t want to get. I was sitting in the garden having lunch with my wife when my phone rang from a number I didn\u2019t recognise. But I took it anyway. \u201cAm I speaking to Mr Crace?\u201d asked the caller. Yes, she was. \u201cGood, then I was wondering, given your age whether you had given any thought to a full, pre-paid funeral plan.\u201d</p> <p>My first reaction was that this must be a wind-up from a friend and I asked her to repeat what she had just said to check I hadn\u2019t misheard. I hadn\u2019t. This woman was extremely anxious that I might die in the next few weeks and leave no money to pay for my funeral.

      "bodyText": "Monday I\u2019ve never much liked the person I am. Anxiety and depression are still my default settings, even after decades of therapy, and I find it hard to hold on to any good feelings. It\u2019s like constantly watching joy slip through my fingers. But I like still less the person I have become during the coronavirus pandemic because now I view even friends as a possible source of disease and infection. I long to hug and be hugged but I have become overly protective of my personal space and get irritable if any runner gets within 5 metres of me. The only place I really feel safe now is my bedroom. Nor does it help that on a daily basis it becomes more evident that there is no clear plan for navigating our way through the crisis. Ministers are flying blind and the country has effectively been orphaned by the government. One of the less reported side-effects of the pandemic has been the way No 10 has sent out a string of no-mark ministers to do the morning media round, all of whose prime brief appears to have been to know as little as possible about anything. This week we\u2019ve had Oliver Dowden, Simon Clarke, Helen Whately and Brandon Lewis all failing to answerbasic questions. You\u2019d have thought that if you knew you were going to face the media, you\u2019d bother to learn some key facts, such as the number of NHS staff and care home workers who had died, but they couldn\u2019t even manage that. And it\u2019s not as if it was hard to find the answers, as they were all featured in many newspapers\u2019 double page spreads. Equally astonishing has been the rehabilitation of Piers Morgan. After several years of sucking up to Donald Trump, refusing to take anyone with mental health issues seriously and insisting that those who dared to criticise Brexit whining remoaners, he has become the nation\u2019s mouthpiece on Good Morning Britain by asking the tough questions and vocalising many people\u2019s anger at the government\u2019s failures. These really must be extraordinary times. Tuesday The end of each season\u2019s University Challenge feels like a personal loss. I\u2019ve watched every episode without fail for decades now and am sad enough to keep a tally of my own score each week. I award myself one point for each correct answer \u2013 regardless whether it is a starter or bonus question \u2013 and disappear into a shame spiral if I score less than 10. This year\u2019s final promised to be a straight showdown between Imperial\u2019s Brandon and Corpus Christi\u2019s Wang, but in the end it was no contest, with Brandon cruising to victory. About 10 years ago I was able to fulfil a lifetime\u2019s ambition by appearing on one of the Christmas special series and learned the hard way that it\u2019s far more testing in real life than from the comfort of the sofa. It\u2019s not just knowing the answer but being quick enough on the buzzer. During my outing for Exeter against Glasgow, me and the rest of our team went into a blind panic when we realised we were trailing by about 110 points to 20 at the halfway stage. Not just because we didn\u2019t know all the answers but because we couldn\u2019t remember them quickly enough. There was one member of the Glasgow team who was beating us near-single-handedly because he was so much faster to react. So I made a decision that the only way to avoid total humiliation was to start pressing the buzzer even if I was only halfway sure of the answer because then at least we were in with a chance. It proved a mixed blessing as I got some answers embarrassingly wrong \u2013 my kids are gutted they haven\u2019t been able to find the episode on YouTube \u2013 but we did at least claw our way up to 120 and only lost by about 40. Never again. Wednesday It was amazing how difficult parliament found it to adapt to new technology, given that most small businesses and family groups who had never heard of Zoom a month ago can now schedule meetings at will. After a dry run on Tuesday, the House of Commons finally returned to the new normal with an almost empty chamber for prime minister\u2019s questions and a ministerial statement from Matt Hancock. Weirdly the quiet of the chamber seemed to suit Keir Starmer, a QC who is totally at home in a courtroom drama, and he managed to make Dominic Raab look like a struggling pupil barrister. Even the technology by and large held up, though David Mundell couldn\u2019t log in and Peter Bone got cut off near the end. Straight afterwards there were a few conspiracy theories running that Bone had been cut off because he was questioning the conduct of the banks during the pandemic. I rather think the bosses of Barclay\u2019s, Lloyd\u2019s and HSBC have got better things to do than order their IT departments to silence the Bone. It\u2019s far more likely the Bone silenced himself by accidentally pressing the mute button. Much weirder was the presence of Jeremy Corbyn in the chamber, given that he is over 70 and therefore officially classed in the vulnerable category. His question to Matt Hancock could just as easily have been asked by Zoom. Even more bizarrely, Corbyn was later spotted by one of my more happy-go-lucky colleagues, who is still brave enough to go into work, pulling up a chair from a table that had been deliberately kept apart from neighbouring ones to sit and have lunch with a friend. It seems like the guidance on self-isolation hasn\u2019t yet filtered down to everyone. Thursday There are some calls you don\u2019t want to get. I was sitting in the garden having lunch with my wife when my phone rang from a number I didn\u2019t recognise. But I took it anyway. \u201cAm I speaking to Mr Crace?\u201d asked the caller. Yes, she was. \u201cGood, then I was wondering, given your age whether you had given any thought to a full, pre-paid funeral plan.\u201d My first reaction was that this must be a wind-up from a friend and I asked her to repeat what she had just said to check I hadn\u2019t misheard. I hadn\u2019t. This woman was extremely anxious that I might die in the next few weeks and leave no money to pay for my funeral. At which point, I rather lost it. \u201cAre you seriously ringing me up in the middle of a coronavirus crisis to try and flog me a funeral insurance policy?\u201d I said. \u201cBecause right now that\u2019s the last thing I want to think about as I\u2019m rather hoping to survive.\u201d My wife snapped at me, saying I shouldn\u2019t be so rude and that the woman was only reading off a call centre script. If so, the script could do with some fine-tuning, because far from apologising for interrupting my lunch and adding to my morbid ruminations, she doubled down. \u201cThe reason I am calling you now is precisely because of coronavirus,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has never been a better time for people of your age to get their affairs in order.

      "bodyText": "The Czech Republic has opened its borders for outbound foreign travel in a sudden U-turn after official figures showed a decline in the rate of Covid-19 infections. The move, announced by the health minister, Adam Vojt\u011bch, represented a surprise change of course for the country, which had been among the first in Europe to close its borders on 16 March. Officials had insisted until recent days that travel restrictions would remain for the foreseeable future, with the country\u2019s president, Milo\u0161 Zeman, suggesting last weekend that frontiers should stay closed for the next year. Vojt\u011bch announced the reversal in a press conference on Thursday night but indicated the onus would be on travellers to prove they were uninfected on their return. \u201cUpon return, travellers will either have to present confirmation of a negative test for coronavirus, or be forced to spend 14 days in quarantine,\u201d he said. Commuters would also be able to cross the border daily if they presented a negative test for coronavirus every 14 days, Vojt\u011bch said, a move that will affect a relatively small number of people who live in the Czech Republic but work in a neighbouring country, or vice versa. In a further development, the deputy health minister, Roman Prymula, announced that the mandatory wearing of face masks, credited by officials with containing the virus\u2019s spread, would stay in place until at least the end of June. Restrictions are also being lifted on movement within the country, with groups of up to 10 people permitted to gather. Previous rules limited outdoor gatherings to two. There had been growing public pressure for an easing of emergency measures. But there was criticism that the announcement sowed confusion, with no immediate information on when foreign visitors would be allowed to re-enter, which would help Prague\u2019s beleaguered tourism industry. \u201cHas the government opened the borders only for Czech citizens or for foreigners who would like to come to the Czech Republic?\u201d tweeted Ji\u0159\u00ed Pehe, a political analyst and director of New York University in Prague. The announcement came hours after the government had accelerated its timetable for reopening the economy following pressure from Czech trading lobbies. Restaurants and pubs will be allowed to fully reopen on 25 May, two weeks earlier than initially planned in a five-phase restart plan announced last week. Zoos will be allowed to reopen from Monday, a full month earlier than planned. The relaxations came after Prague\u2019s municipal court ruled the government\u2019s restrictions unlawful on Thursday. Officials have hailed better-than-expected results from the coronavirus clampdown. The health ministry confirmed the number of infections at 7,188 on Friday, with 55 new Covid-19 positive tests recorded the previous day, the lowest number since 14 March. There have been 213 deaths.",

Fozia Hanif, started to develop symptoms and tested positive for the disease just before her 29th birthday, resulting in the premature birth of her son, Ayaan, earlier this month. Just six days after giving birth Hanif\u2019s family were given the devastating news that she would not recover and her ventilator would be turned off. The probation service worker, was only ever able to see her newborn son on a photograph printed for her by nurses at Birmingham Heartlands hospital, with her family describing it as a \u201chappy\u201d moment. \u201cShe was really happy, she got the baby photo they (nurses) printed out for her,\u201d her husband of nearly seven years, Wajid Ali, told ITV News. \u201cShe was holding and say \u2018look it\u2019s our baby\u2019 and \u2018we\u2019re going to come home soon\u2019 \u2026 that\u2019s the last time I spoke to her.\u201d Her sister, Sophie Hanif said she would receive texts telling her how excited she was to finally meet her baby. \u201cShe was messaging us saying \u2018oh I haven\u2019t seen the baby yet\u2019 and I said \u2018don\u2019t worry about it, when you come home you\u2019re going to come home together and we\u2019re all going to see him together\u2019,\u201d she said. Initially Hanif who gave birth to her son on 2 April, showed some signs of overcoming the disease and was taken to a recovery ward, but shortly afterwards her condition worsened and she was moved to an intensive care unit (ICU). Hanif, had been going to hospital for check-ups during her pregnancy, when she developed a slight fever in March and hospital staff decided to keep her in for tests. She tested positive for coronavirus but was soon released back home and was able to celebrate her birthday with her family. However, while at home her condition quickly began to deteriorate, and she was taken back to hospital, isolated from her family and put on a ventilator.

      "body": "<p>Welcome to our weekly roundup of developments in the coronavirus pandemic that continues to sweep around the world. As more vaccine trials swung into action and the unequal burden of deaths became clear, governments came under fresh fire to rekindle their ailing economies.</p> \n<p><strong>More vaccine trials start as drug hope fades<br></strong>The first shots of an experimental vaccine from Oxford University were administered to volunteers. The safety trial will run for a month before more participants are recruited to assess the vaccine\u2019s efficacy. The team hopes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/19/uk-drive-develop-coronavirus-vaccine-science\">complete the trials in record time</a>, but as UK infections fall under lockdown, it will become harder to amass the necessary data without expanding into other countries. Elsewhere, German authorities approved a trial of a potential vaccine developed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-live-news-un-warns-of-biblical-famine-as-white-house-prepares-immigration-halt?page=with:block-5ea00f778f085a072d3bcf40#block-5ea00f778f085a072d3bcf40\">BioNTech</a>, while the Netherlands and Australia launched a trial of the BCG tuberculosis vaccine in the hope it may protect against Covid-19. A far more controversial approach to vaccine testing known as a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01179-x\">challenge trial</a> won support from more than 1,000 volunteers. Challenge trials raise ethical issues because people who receive the test vaccine are deliberately infected to assess whether it has worked: it\u2019s risky, but can deliver results fast.</p> \n<p>Among potential antiviral drugs, Gilead\u2019s remdesivir has been considered a frontrunner. But a draft report posted accidentally on the World Health Organization\u2019s clinical trials site revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/high-hopes-drug-for-covid-19-treatment-failed-in-full-trial\">the drug did not help patients</a>.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to our weekly roundup of developments in the coronavirus pandemic that continues to sweep around the world. As more vaccine trials swung into action and the unequal burden of deaths became clear, governments came under fresh fire to rekindle their ailing economies. More vaccine trials start as drug hope fades The first shots of an experimental vaccine from Oxford University were administered to volunteers. The safety trial will run for a month before more participants are recruited to assess the vaccine\u2019s efficacy. The team hopes to complete the trials in record time, but as UK infections fall under lockdown, it will become harder to amass the necessary data without expanding into other countries. Elsewhere, German authorities approved a trial of a potential vaccine developed by BioNTech, while the Netherlands and Australia launched a trial of the BCG tuberculosis vaccine in the hope it may protect against Covid-19. A far more controversial approach to vaccine testing known as a challenge trial won support from more than 1,000 volunteers. Challenge trials raise ethical issues because people who receive the test vaccine are deliberately infected to assess whether it has worked: it\u2019s risky, but can deliver results fast. Among potential antiviral drugs, Gilead\u2019s remdesivir has been considered a frontrunner. But a draft report posted accidentally on the World Health Organization\u2019s clinical trials site revealed the drug did not help patients. The failure came days after Prof Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, warned there was only an \u201cincredibly small\u201d chance of a vaccine or treatment being ready this year. In the last edition of Science Weekly, Hannah Devlin speaks to Dr Miraz Rahman about how to find drugs to treat a new disease like Covid-19, and discusses repurposing old drugs such as the anti-malaria medicine hydroxychloroquine In the US, President Donald Trump\u2019s dangerous musings on injecting people with disinfectant left medical practitioners gobsmacked. \u201cTrump\u2019s briefings are actively endangering the public\u2019s health,\u201d said Robert Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cListen to the experts. And please don\u2019t drink disinfectant.\u201d World faces deep recession More grim warnings came from financial bodies as the enormity of the economic disaster hit home. The ratings agency Fitch said the world was on track for a recession of \u201cunprecedented depth in the post-war period\u201d with global GDP set to tumble 3.9% this year, making it twice as severe as the 2009 financial crash. Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, said eurozone output could fall by 9% in a middle-case scenario and a staggering 15% in the worst case. The Bank of England added its own miserable forecast, with policymaker Jan Vlieghe warning Britain faced a slump that was \u201cfaster and deeper than anything we have seen in the past century, or possibly several centuries\u201d. As planes remained grounded, the multibillionaire owner of the Virgin Group, Sir Richard Branson, who has paid no personal income tax since moving to the tax-free British Virgin Islands 14 years ago, pleaded with the government for a \u00a3500m loan to help save Virgin Atlantic, in the \u201cunprecedented crisis\u201d. Britain edges towards an exit strategy Tories ramped up the pressure on the government to explain how the country will emerge from lockdown, warning that businesses needed transparency to weather the crisis. But ministers refused to be drawn as scientific advisers cautioned that while cases had peaked, loosening the lockdown risked infections taking off again. Prof Whitty said physical distancing would need to be in place until at least the end of the year. After a belated push, the UK\u2019s virus testing capacity reached more than 50,000 a day, but that still leaves the health secretary, Matt Hancock, only one week to achieve his much-publicised target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. With more tests available, about 10 million \u201cessential workers\u201d and their families can now book virus tests if they have symptoms, he announced. Meanwhile, 18,000 people are being recruited and trained for contact tracing duties, leading Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, to declare: \u201cWe have a clear exit route from the current lockdown.\u201d The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, was more forthcoming on exit strategies in a 26-page framework for coping with the \u201cnew normal\u201d. It warns that if new outbreaks spring up, further lockdowns may be triggered at short notice. Group gatherings in pubs and at public events may be off the cards for months, while schools and workplaces could be redesigned to allow physical distancing, she said. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, set out seven key questions that will determine when stay-at-home restrictions can be lifted there. Unequal burden of deaths revealed The World Health Organization said residents in care homes accounted for up to half of all coronavirus deaths in Europe. Hans Kluge, the WHO\u2019s regional director for Europe, said personal protective equipment and testing must be prioritised in care homes where deaths amounted to an \u201cunimaginable human tragedy\u201d.

      "body": "<p>It was lunchtime on Monday when counsellor Rebecca Henderson answered a crisis call from a distraught girl with thoughts about ending her own life.</p> <p>The teenager was locked in the bathroom at home, agitated, and scratching at her arms. She knew that she needed help, but was scared about contracting coronavirus if she went to the hospital.</p> <p>\u201cA young woman with existing problems, isolated in a stressful home situation without support with thoughts of taking her own life \u2026 that\u2019s a high-risk perfect storm,\u201d said Henderson, who works at the <a href=\"https://crisiscenterbham.org/\">Crisis Cent</a><a href=\"https://crisiscenterbham.org/\">er in Birmingham,</a> Alabama, part of the national suicide prevention lifeline network.</p> <p>She\u2019s not the only one. Every aspect of normal life has been turned upside down by the strict physical distancing measures to mitigate the pandemic, which has already claimed almost<em> </em>50,000 lives and 26m jobs in the US<em>. </em>With no end in sight, the mental health consequences of Covid-19 are starting to manifest \u2013 fuelled by the devastating mix of uncertainty, isolation, grief and economic despair.</p> <p>Nationwide, crisis services are trying to deal with the immediate aftermath. But the country\u2019s weak mental health system may not be able to meet rising demand.</p> <p>Counsellors on the <a href=\"https://www.crisistextline.org/topics/get-help-coronavirus/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3_Sww-v86AIVA-DICh3RwAV9EAAYAiAAEgK5C_D_BwE#dealing-with-coronavirus-1\">crisis text line</a><strong>,</strong> a global SMS helpline typically utilized by teens with relationship issues, said they were dealing with a 40% increase in messages in the US. The demographics have changed radically: now, over-35-year-olds are the most frequent users, with those on low incomes accounting for 31% of traffic \u2013 compared with 19% before the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cIn the first wave people were anxious, but now in the second wave people are feeling depressed and isolated, especially very poor people and those in violent situations,\u201d said Nancy Lublin, the CEO and co-founder.</p> <p>In Alabama, calls to the hotline are up 50% since the start of the pandemic, with a big rise in isolated young people and rural dwellers worried about finances. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase in suicidal ideation among people who\u2019ve lost their jobs, worrying about how they\u2019re going to feed their families,\u201d said Meg McGlamery, executive director of the Crisis Center.</p> <p>In California, calls to a disaster distress line more than tripled between February and March, and are on track to rise another 50% this month, according to Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of callers to this national hotline are anxious about Covid-19 .</p> <p>As the economic fallout deepens, mental health advocates<strong> </strong>warn about the potentially devastating impact on millions of Americans. \u201cWe fully expect a jump in calls to the suicide prevention lifeline in the next couple of months as people remain unemployed, lose their homes and can\u2019t pay the bills,\u201d said Lyn Morris, the senior vice-president of clinical operations at <a href=\"https://didihirsch.org/services/suicide-prevention/\">Didi Hirsch.</a></p> <p>There\u2019s precedent for that dire outlook. In the aftermath of the 2007 recession in North America and Europe, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2014/06/11/318885533/suicide-rate-in-u-s-and-europe-climbed-during-great-recession\">about 10,000 more people</a>,<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2014/06/11/318885533/suicide-rate-in-u-s-and-europe-climbed-during-great-recession\"> </a>mostly middle-aged and older men, committed suicide than expected in a two-year span.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just about isolation or financial dire straits \u2013 the pandemic has its own specific victims. The number of Asian Americans using the national crisis text line has doubled, counsellors say, amid a wave of harassment and bullying probably linked to the racist rhetoric spouted by Trump and some of his supporters who blame China for the spread of the virus.</p> <p>Requests for help from domestic violence victims are also up by a third at the crisis text line. The world over, <a href=\"https://time.com/5463069/home-most-dangerous-gender-violence-study-un/\">home is the most dangerous place</a> for women and children \u2013 a grim reality exacerbated by physical distancing and travel restrictions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bcca288b32ed23ebb83ea18c2da8c2ae0af0adc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bcca288b32ed23ebb83ea18c2da8c2ae0af0adc/0_156_4490_2695/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman leans out of her window to smoke in New York earlier this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman leans out of her window to smoke in New York earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Alabama, Henderson recalled a call from a woman desperate to flee a violent partner but who was scared of being arrested if she crossed state lines.

      "bodyText": "It was lunchtime on Monday when counsellor Rebecca Henderson answered a crisis call from a distraught girl with thoughts about ending her own life. The teenager was locked in the bathroom at home, agitated, and scratching at her arms. She knew that she needed help, but was scared about contracting coronavirus if she went to the hospital. \u201cA young woman with existing problems, isolated in a stressful home situation without support with thoughts of taking her own life \u2026 that\u2019s a high-risk perfect storm,\u201d said Henderson, who works at the Crisis Center in Birmingham, Alabama, part of the national suicide prevention lifeline network. She\u2019s not the only one. Every aspect of normal life has been turned upside down by the strict physical distancing measures to mitigate the pandemic, which has already claimed almost 50,000 lives and 26m jobs in the US. With no end in sight, the mental health consequences of Covid-19 are starting to manifest \u2013 fuelled by the devastating mix of uncertainty, isolation, grief and economic despair. Nationwide, crisis services are trying to deal with the immediate aftermath. But the country\u2019s weak mental health system may not be able to meet rising demand. Counsellors on the crisis text line, a global SMS helpline typically utilized by teens with relationship issues, said they were dealing with a 40% increase in messages in the US. The demographics have changed radically: now, over-35-year-olds are the most frequent users, with those on low incomes accounting for 31% of traffic \u2013 compared with 19% before the pandemic. \u201cIn the first wave people were anxious, but now in the second wave people are feeling depressed and isolated, especially very poor people and those in violent situations,\u201d said Nancy Lublin, the CEO and co-founder. In Alabama, calls to the hotline are up 50% since the start of the pandemic, with a big rise in isolated young people and rural dwellers worried about finances. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase in suicidal ideation among people who\u2019ve lost their jobs, worrying about how they\u2019re going to feed their families,\u201d said Meg McGlamery, executive director of the Crisis Center. In California, calls to a disaster distress line more than tripled between February and March, and are on track to rise another 50% this month, according to Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of callers to this national hotline are anxious about Covid-19 . As the economic fallout deepens, mental health advocates warn about the potentially devastating impact on millions of Americans. \u201cWe fully expect a jump in calls to the suicide prevention lifeline in the next couple of months as people remain unemployed, lose their homes and can\u2019t pay the bills,\u201d said Lyn Morris, the senior vice-president of clinical operations at Didi Hirsch. There\u2019s precedent for that dire outlook. In the aftermath of the 2007 recession in North America and Europe, about 10,000 more people, mostly middle-aged and older men, committed suicide than expected in a two-year span. But it\u2019s not just about isolation or financial dire straits \u2013 the pandemic has its own specific victims. The number of Asian Americans using the national crisis text line has doubled, counsellors say, amid a wave of harassment and bullying probably linked to the racist rhetoric spouted by Trump and some of his supporters who blame China for the spread of the virus. Requests for help from domestic violence victims are also up by a third at the crisis text line. The world over, home is the most dangerous place for women and children \u2013 a grim reality exacerbated by physical distancing and travel restrictions. In Alabama, Henderson recalled a call from a woman desperate to flee a violent partner but who was scared of being arrested if she crossed state lines. In another case, the center struggled to find emergency shelter for a rape survivor. Children are often the most vulnerable during public health crises. There is particular concern for those with pre-existing psychological issues, and those cooped up with an abuser or an adult with substance misuse problems, mental health experts said. In order to mitigate the risks, one school counselor in New Jersey told Lisa Athan, a grief specialist, that she holds up a paper sign with \u201ccan you speak freely?\u201d to which the child responds with a nod or shake of the head. Athan said children are struggling to process grief as normal rituals associated with death such as saying goodbye and funerals are almost impossible. \u201cWithout these rituals, deaths don\u2019t feel real, and children feel helpless, anxious, angry and too upset to concentrate on school work,\u201d said Athan, who is trying to teach mindfulness and yoga virtually. \u201cNow they see protesters [on TV] who want businesses reopened while their teachers and grandparents are still dying \u2026 it makes them feel angry, that these people don\u2019t care.\u201d The unresolved grief and trauma from the pandemic, meanwhile, can increase the risk of complex problems such as depression, substance misuse, physical complaints and violence. Crisis services and clinicians have scrambled to adapt by rolling out virtual therapy and telehealth consultations. But the country\u2019s inadequate mental health infrastructure, means this is unlikely to be enough. \u201cThe US mental health system is patchy at best and faces being overwhelmed by the likely substantial increases in anxiety and depression, substance use, domestic violence and child abuse,\u201d said Sandro Galea, the dean of Boston University\u2019s school of public health. In 2018, there were 27.9 million people without health insurance, and record-high unemployment will increase that figure. Recruitment and training of mental heath professionals has also fallen way behind: the Department of Health and Human Services predicts widespread staffing shortfalls by 2025 including up to 57,000 psychologists, 14,000 psychiatrists and 48,000 mental health and substance abuse social workers. Even before the pandemic, half of adults with mental illness did not receive treatment, according to the National Association of Mental Illness (Nami) which has seen calls to its helpline rise by 40% during the pandemic. As the need for mental health services rises, access to adequate and timely help will probably decline \u2013 unless drastic steps are taken now to expand digital outreach, improve surveillance to detect abuse, and fund services, according to Galea. Even then, the repercussions are likely to be felt well after the peak of the pandemic. \u201cThe mental health curve is going to have a long tail,\u201d said Dr Ken Duckworth, the chief medical officer for Nami. \u201cWhen life finally returns to normal, the following year will not be a good one for mental health.\u201d \u2022 If you need mental health support you can find help 24 hours a day: Text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis text line counsellor Call the national suicide prevention lifeline on 1-800-273-8255 Call 1-800-985-5990 for the national disaster distress helpline",

      "body": "<p>Camden might seem like a strange place for a coronavirus outbreak. It\u2019s a small, historic city in central South Carolina \u2013 just over 7,500 people. It\u2019s neither densely packed like New York nor economically decimated like Detroit. One of its main industries is tourism, with people visiting to see Revolutionary War re-enactments and the annual horse race every spring.</p> <p>But on 6 March the first Covid-19 case was confirmed positive \u2013 an elderly woman whose family had visited her after traveling to Europe. Soon after that, Camden had the fastest-growing number of cases, and deaths, in the state. At one point it had the most coronavirus cases per capita in the country.</p> <p>While Camden\u2019s local officials worked relatively quickly to try to contain the virus, experts say it\u2019s not surprising that the city was caught unprepared. The South Carolina government has systematically dismantled public health infrastructure for over a decade \u2013 from reductions to the health budget to diluting a minority health program. The state\u2019s response to the pandemic was one of the slowest in the country.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s an interesting dynamic \u2013 it\u2019s state, local and federal,\u201d said state senator Vincent Sheheen, who represents Kershaw county, where Camden is the seat. \u201cI think that\u2019s where the problems come in: who is responsible for what? That has not been well defined, and it wasn\u2019t well defined before the crisis.\u201d</p> <p>This disconnect was clear starting with the first Covid-19 test. When health workers suspected the Camden woman of having the virus, the state refused to process a swab sample, Sheheen said, because she didn\u2019t meet the criteria. It was days after the patient was admitted to Kershaw Health, the county\u2019s only hospital, that the state\u2019s department of health and environmental control (DHEC) agreed.</p> <p>For a few days, as Camden city officials worked to formulate a plan and shut down public events, people still went out to restaurants and events. An Irish Fest, being held that weekend, took place. So did a funeral, which tracing later linked to <a href=\"https://www.thestate.com/news/coronavirus/article242028041.html?fbclid=IwAR2pt9DCcuf-istDtAUsHJuwx9c4dpGV3qhSlxpWewM6-O-lWMAz3x9aApg\">six deaths</a> in the city.</p> <p>\u201cNo one took it seriously,\u201d said Nyasha Green, a 30-year-old Camden native who now lives half an hour away from her parents in Columbia. \u201cThey should have quarantined people already.\u201d</p> <p>By the next week, however, the city had shut down public gatherings, and was working to close the area\u2019s many churches. Dozens of businesses closed their doors, and city council members urged people to stay home. By 14 March, Camden shut down schools, and some days later, enforced a 10pm curfew.</p> <p>\u201cWe started taking precautions before the state had a chance to lead,\u201d said Mel Pearson, the city manager. \u201cWe knew this was a risky virus.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fad52158360c20efba82f595e2a6d9fd2e07add3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fad52158360c20efba82f595e2a6d9fd2e07add3/0_0_6240_4160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An empty church stands in a rural and economically distressed part of Camden, South Carolina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An empty church stands in a rural and economically distressed part of Camden, South Carolina. \u2018The standard of living is low.

By then, Camden had more than 170 positive coronavirus cases, and a handful of deaths. Neighboring counties, such as Richland, were now faring worse.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We see this combination of higher rates of chronic conditions combined with poor access in the state</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>South Carolina has been a consistently Republican state for decades. It has also become increasingly focused on shrinking the government \u2013 cutting the public sector in favor of privatization \u2013 a key characteristic of America\u2019s fiscally conservative politicians.</p> <p>Governor McMaster is <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/fiscal-policy-report-card-americas-governors-2018\">widely known</a> for curbing taxes and public benefits like pensions for government workers. But cuts to the state health department and infrastructure have left people in poor and rural areas with little access to care because of <a href=\"https://ifs-mpr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=47c9824a5b9e41219bc3f542191ddf81\">physician shortages</a> and hospital closures. </p> <p>\u201cHaley and Sanford have been gutting our state health agency for over 10 years,\u201d Sheheen said of the two former Republican governors. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise doctors are left reusing their masks.\u201d</p> <p>The state\u2019s most recent three leaders, including Governor Nikki Haley, who later joined the Trump administration, chose not to expand the Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act, which would have extended public health insurance to thousands of working-class families.</p> <p>The result was that more people <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/the-coverage-gap-uninsured-poor-adults-in-states-that-do-not-expand-medicaid/\">remained uninsured</a>, and had less access to medical care. In Camden, about 10% of the population <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/camdencitysouthcarolina\">has no</a> health insurance, higher than the national average of <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/number-of-americans-without-insurance-rises-in-2018/\">about</a> 8%.</p> <p>A lack of insurance also means people have gone without treatment and are more likely to have underlying health conditions, said Samantha Artiga, a director of Medicaid and disparities teams at Kaiser Family Foundation, a not-for-profit research organization. South Carolina is <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/states/southcarolina/southcarolina.htm\">among</a> the US states with the highest rates of heart disease, respiratory issues and strokes.</p> <p>\u201cWe see this combination of higher rates of chronic conditions combined with poor access in the state,\u201d Artiga said. \u201cThat leaves a population at higher risk of experiencing complications if they have Covid.\u201d</p> <p>While the government has applauded the expansion of <a href=\"https://www.prismahealth.org/\">private health</a> companies like Prisma Health, at least six rural hospitals have <a href=\"https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/rural-health/rural-hospital-closures/\">closed down</a> since 2010.

      "bodyText": "Camden might seem like a strange place for a coronavirus outbreak. It\u2019s a small, historic city in central South Carolina \u2013 just over 7,500 people. It\u2019s neither densely packed like New York nor economically decimated like Detroit. One of its main industries is tourism, with people visiting to see Revolutionary War re-enactments and the annual horse race every spring. But on 6 March the first Covid-19 case was confirmed positive \u2013 an elderly woman whose family had visited her after traveling to Europe. Soon after that, Camden had the fastest-growing number of cases, and deaths, in the state. At one point it had the most coronavirus cases per capita in the country. While Camden\u2019s local officials worked relatively quickly to try to contain the virus, experts say it\u2019s not surprising that the city was caught unprepared. The South Carolina government has systematically dismantled public health infrastructure for over a decade \u2013 from reductions to the health budget to diluting a minority health program. The state\u2019s response to the pandemic was one of the slowest in the country. \u201cI think it\u2019s an interesting dynamic \u2013 it\u2019s state, local and federal,\u201d said state senator Vincent Sheheen, who represents Kershaw county, where Camden is the seat. \u201cI think that\u2019s where the problems come in: who is responsible for what? That has not been well defined, and it wasn\u2019t well defined before the crisis.\u201d This disconnect was clear starting with the first Covid-19 test. When health workers suspected the Camden woman of having the virus, the state refused to process a swab sample, Sheheen said, because she didn\u2019t meet the criteria. It was days after the patient was admitted to Kershaw Health, the county\u2019s only hospital, that the state\u2019s department of health and environmental control (DHEC) agreed. For a few days, as Camden city officials worked to formulate a plan and shut down public events, people still went out to restaurants and events. An Irish Fest, being held that weekend, took place. So did a funeral, which tracing later linked to six deaths in the city. \u201cNo one took it seriously,\u201d said Nyasha Green, a 30-year-old Camden native who now lives half an hour away from her parents in Columbia. \u201cThey should have quarantined people already.\u201d By the next week, however, the city had shut down public gatherings, and was working to close the area\u2019s many churches. Dozens of businesses closed their doors, and city council members urged people to stay home. By 14 March, Camden shut down schools, and some days later, enforced a 10pm curfew. \u201cWe started taking precautions before the state had a chance to lead,\u201d said Mel Pearson, the city manager. \u201cWe knew this was a risky virus.\u201d As local testing drives began, Sheheen said the state eventually did send health department officials to embed in the hospitals and city government, but made it clear they didn\u2019t have the capacity to investigate the outbreak. \u201cVery early on I was calling other hospitals asking for masks and swabs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a good situation when your state senator is calling around.\u201d It would still be weeks before South Carolina\u2019s governor, Henry McMaster, issued statewide stay-at-home orders on 6 April. By then, Camden had more than 170 positive coronavirus cases, and a handful of deaths. Neighboring counties, such as Richland, were now faring worse. South Carolina has been a consistently Republican state for decades. It has also become increasingly focused on shrinking the government \u2013 cutting the public sector in favor of privatization \u2013 a key characteristic of America\u2019s fiscally conservative politicians. Governor McMaster is widely known for curbing taxes and public benefits like pensions for government workers. But cuts to the state health department and infrastructure have left people in poor and rural areas with little access to care because of physician shortages and hospital closures. \u201cHaley and Sanford have been gutting our state health agency for over 10 years,\u201d Sheheen said of the two former Republican governors. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise doctors are left reusing their masks.\u201d The state\u2019s most recent three leaders, including Governor Nikki Haley, who later joined the Trump administration, chose not to expand the Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act, which would have extended public health insurance to thousands of working-class families. The result was that more people remained uninsured, and had less access to medical care. In Camden, about 10% of the population has no health insurance, higher than the national average of about 8%. A lack of insurance also means people have gone without treatment and are more likely to have underlying health conditions, said Samantha Artiga, a director of Medicaid and disparities teams at Kaiser Family Foundation, a not-for-profit research organization. South Carolina is among the US states with the highest rates of heart disease, respiratory issues and strokes. \u201cWe see this combination of higher rates of chronic conditions combined with poor access in the state,\u201d Artiga said. \u201cThat leaves a population at higher risk of experiencing complications if they have Covid.\u201d While the government has applauded the expansion of private health companies like Prisma Health, at least six rural hospitals have closed down since 2010. And legislators have slashed millions from DHEC - including a $16 million cut in 2018 \u2013 and curbed funds for safety net clinics. Cheryl Armstead, a psychology and public health professor at the University of South Carolina, said the state\u2019s ruthless approach to public health has had tangible consequences on its most vulnerable communities during the pandemic. \u201cCamden is a small town, denoted by the haves and have-nots,\u201d she said. \u201cThe workers that interface with elderly people, or who are caregivers are poor people.\u201d About 14% of residents in the city live in poverty, according to the census, and a disproportionate number of poor people are black. Armstead said black communities are less likely to trust the government, an issue further tested during the Covid-19 crisis. In recent years, South Carolina also weakened a vaccine program previously under the office of minority health. Furthermore, the persistent trauma around the Tuskegee experiment, a racist government project, and the Henrietta Lacks case, where a black woman\u2019s cells were used without consent, still inform people\u2019s decisions around healthcare in the south. Black church leaders have had to step in to relay public health information. \u201cI think a sense of fatalism has occurred,\u201d Armstead said of black people in South Carolina. \u201cThe feeling is that they won\u2019t get equal healthcare.\u201d Across South Carolina, the counties that did not act as quickly as Kershaw are now dealing with an onslaught of cases. The state had 4,300 cases as of 18 April, and other cities are grappling with a shortage of test kits. Hospitals beds are half full in the state so far, and several smaller hospitals have used all of their ventilators, Sheheen said. As of last weekend, Covid-19 rates in Camden seem to be slowly decreasing with just a couple of new cases each day. Pearson, the city manager, said people were still worried, but that local efforts had been largely successful. \u201cIt\u2019s trending down now, which is a good sign,\u201d he said. But the city is still carefully tracking the number of cases before making any plans to reopen. Pearson said he was hoping that eventually, Camden would be able to attract visitors again, drawing tourism to the historic town.

      "body": "<p>Roaring out of the radical 1790s, <em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em> is a founding fable for our time. A fable must by definition revolve around an animal, and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/samuel-taylor-coleridge\">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>\u2019s nightmare the slain albatross hangs around the fated sailor\u2019s neck like a broken cross, an emblem of his sin against nature. It is all too relevant today, as a statement of isolation and despair: \u201cAlone, alone, all, all alone, / Alone on a wide, wide sea!\u201d Yet in that forlorn expression is great power; the power of art to change us.</p> <p>When published in 1798, Coleridge\u2019s poem was seen as the work of \u201ca mad German poet\u201d. His friend Charles Lamb called him \u201ca cracked archangel\u201d, while his fellow drug addict Thomas De Quincey would defend his poetic experimentalism. \u201cWhere is the man who shall be equal to these things?\u201d he said. \u201cIs, indeed, Leviathan so tamed? In that case, the quarantine of the opium-eater might be finished.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aaaccf700c0e3109027122b0784584948f1e0f31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaaccf700c0e3109027122b0784584948f1e0f31/0_0_1787_2048/873.jpg\" alt=\"albatross\" width=\"873\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The slain albatross hangs around the fated sailor\u2019s neck like a broken cross\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Time &amp; Life Pictures/Getty Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is not despite but because of its narcotic wildness that <em>The Rime </em>became one of the most referenced works of poetry ever. From Mary Shelley\u2019s <em>Frankenstein</em> and Herman Melville\u2019s <em>Moby-Dick</em>, to Fleetwood Mac, Iron Maiden and Public Image Ltd\u2019s \u201cAlbatross\u201d \u2013 a screech of post-punk angst <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEToKGfjlmM\">sung by John Lydon</a> \u2013 it is the one poem that almost everyone can quote. Lines including \u201cAll creatures great and small\u201d and \u201cWater, water, everywhere\u201d have become part of the lexicon.</p> <p>Time to resurrect it for a new poetry-hungry audience then, with a free-to-access digital project, the <em><a href=\"https://www.ancientmarinerbigread.com/\">Ancient Mariner Big Read</a> </em>curated by myself and artists Angela Cockayne and Sarah Chapman, and hosted by the University of Plymouth\u2019s Art Institute. Following on from our <em><a href=\"http://www.mobydickbigread.com/\">Moby-Dick Big Read</a></em> of 2012, we split the 150 verses of <em>The Rime</em> into 40 sections, to be read by performers, writers, poets and even <a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp133758/hon-samuel-john-taylor-coleridge\">Samuel Taylor Coleridge himself</a> \u2013 a sixth generation nephew of the poet, whom we recorded in the <a href=\"https://www.otterystmary.org.uk/\">Devon church</a> where the first Sam was baptised by his minister father.</p> <p>Over the three years that it has taken to create the <em>Ancient Mariner Big Read</em>, the project has gained personal significance for its contributors. If you\u2019ve been listening so far you will have heard Jeremy Irons, Jeanette Winterson, Hilary Mantel. There are more surprises to come. Iggy Pop, for instance,in a reading that sounds like an encore from one of his outrageous performances, yet hints at his surprising credentials (<a href=\"https://ibelievethatimayknow.wordpress.com/2016/12/03/caesar-lives-iggy-pop-reflects-on-the-applicability-of-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire/\">Pop\u2019s essay</a> on Edward Gibbon\u2019s <em>The</em> <em>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em> appeared in an academic journal, <em>Classic Ireland</em>). </p> <p>In contrast, Tilda Swinton quietly went to a studio in the Scottish Highlands, near the<a href=\"https://www.classicfm.com/music-news/videos/tilda-swinton-dogs-opera-music-video/\"> beach where she walks her dogs</a>, and delivered the most famous lines from the poem \u2013 \u201cWater, water, everywhere / Nor any drop to drink\u201d \u2013 with a crystalline calm that pulls at the poem\u2019s despair. It\u2019s hard not to think, as you listen, of migrants set adrift on other seas, undertaking on their own desperate voyages.</p> <p>Marianne Faithfull told me it was at school that she first read <em>The Rime</em>. \u201cIt is a true horror poem; the rhyming and the alliteration make your blood run cold,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can never forget it. I heard it the first time when I was 14 years old in my English class at St Joseph convent school, a very strange place to be introduced to this poem, but our English teacher, Mrs Simpson, was a Protestant, and all the nuns in the world weren\u2019t going to stop her!\u201d Ms Faithfull has since contracted coronavirus; happily, she was discharged from hospital this week, and we send her our best wishes. </p> <p>Our youngest contributor, Cyrus Larcombe-Moore, 21, from Tavistock, Devon, is a winner of the <a href=\"https://poems.poetrysociety.org.uk/poems/my-ghost/\">Foyle </a><a href=\"https://poems.poetrysociety.org.uk/poems/my-ghost/\">young poets award</a>. Another poet, Lemn Sissay, who has written evocatively of his lonely childhood, barely needed to look at the text when he read for us in <a href=\"https://www.creativefolkestone.org.uk/folkestone-book-festival/\">Folkestone</a>. \u201cIt is the poem that says everything to me,\u201d he said, \u201cabout life, conflict, inner turmoil and outer peace.\u201d Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, Willem Dafoe delivered a sinister reading of the scene in which the albatross is shot; Dafoe\u2019s recent film with Robert Pattinson, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/19/the-lighthouse-review-robert-pattinson-shines-in-sublime-maritime-nightmare\">The Lighthouse</a></em>, directly draws on <em>The Rime\u2019</em>s watery horror and its \u201cthousand thousand slimy things\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9deead3ec2752ac46eb664e908c41ec7a969b209\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9deead3ec2752ac46eb664e908c41ec7a969b209/0_311_1800_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Williem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson in The Lighthouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watery horror \u2026 Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson in <em>The Lighthouse</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: A24 Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As important to the <em>Ancient Mariner Big Read</em> are the contemporary art works that accompany each reading, from Marina Abramovi\u0107, William Kentridge, Cornelia Parker, George Shaw, Yinka Shonibare and Glenn Brown among others. Linder, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/18/linder-post-punk-artist-retrospective-at-kettles-yard\">punk feminist</a> artist, slices out a collage of an eerie shell/dancer chimera; <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/ellen-gallagher-9553\">Ellen Gallagher</a> and her collaborator, Edgar Cleijne, whose work deals subtly with race and transition, send a cyanotype boat drifting into a swampy blue unknown. Their works speak to the visceral images of the poem.</p> <p>As Robert Macfarlane, another of our readers, notes, Coleridge\u2019s mythic work predicts the Anthropocene and the fatal disconnection between human and nature.

      "bodyText": "Roaring out of the radical 1790s, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is a founding fable for our time. A fable must by definition revolve around an animal, and in Samuel Taylor Coleridge\u2019s nightmare the slain albatross hangs around the fated sailor\u2019s neck like a broken cross, an emblem of his sin against nature. It is all too relevant today, as a statement of isolation and despair: \u201cAlone, alone, all, all alone, / Alone on a wide, wide sea!\u201d Yet in that forlorn expression is great power; the power of art to change us. When published in 1798, Coleridge\u2019s poem was seen as the work of \u201ca mad German poet\u201d. His friend Charles Lamb called him \u201ca cracked archangel\u201d, while his fellow drug addict Thomas De Quincey would defend his poetic experimentalism. \u201cWhere is the man who shall be equal to these things?\u201d he said. \u201cIs, indeed, Leviathan so tamed? In that case, the quarantine of the opium-eater might be finished.\u201d It is not despite but because of its narcotic wildness that The Rime became one of the most referenced works of poetry ever. From Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein and Herman Melville\u2019s Moby-Dick, to Fleetwood Mac, Iron Maiden and Public Image Ltd\u2019s \u201cAlbatross\u201d \u2013 a screech of post-punk angst sung by John Lydon \u2013 it is the one poem that almost everyone can quote. Lines including \u201cAll creatures great and small\u201d and \u201cWater, water, everywhere\u201d have become part of the lexicon. Time to resurrect it for a new poetry-hungry audience then, with a free-to-access digital project, the Ancient Mariner Big Read curated by myself and artists Angela Cockayne and Sarah Chapman, and hosted by the University of Plymouth\u2019s Art Institute. Following on from our Moby-Dick Big Read of 2012, we split the 150 verses of The Rime into 40 sections, to be read by performers, writers, poets and even Samuel Taylor Coleridge himself \u2013 a sixth generation nephew of the poet, whom we recorded in the Devon church where the first Sam was baptised by his minister father. Over the three years that it has taken to create the Ancient Mariner Big Read, the project has gained personal significance for its contributors. If you\u2019ve been listening so far you will have heard Jeremy Irons, Jeanette Winterson, Hilary Mantel. There are more surprises to come. Iggy Pop, for instance,in a reading that sounds like an encore from one of his outrageous performances, yet hints at his surprising credentials (Pop\u2019s essay on Edward Gibbon\u2019s The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire appeared in an academic journal, Classic Ireland). In contrast, Tilda Swinton quietly went to a studio in the Scottish Highlands, near the beach where she walks her dogs, and delivered the most famous lines from the poem \u2013 \u201cWater, water, everywhere / Nor any drop to drink\u201d \u2013 with a crystalline calm that pulls at the poem\u2019s despair. It\u2019s hard not to think, as you listen, of migrants set adrift on other seas, undertaking on their own desperate voyages. Marianne Faithfull told me it was at school that she first read The Rime. \u201cIt is a true horror poem; the rhyming and the alliteration make your blood run cold,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can never forget it. I heard it the first time when I was 14 years old in my English class at St Joseph convent school, a very strange place to be introduced to this poem, but our English teacher, Mrs Simpson, was a Protestant, and all the nuns in the world weren\u2019t going to stop her!\u201d Ms Faithfull has since contracted coronavirus; happily, she was discharged from hospital this week, and we send her our best wishes. Our youngest contributor, Cyrus Larcombe-Moore, 21, from Tavistock, Devon, is a winner of the Foyle young poets award. Another poet, Lemn Sissay, who has written evocatively of his lonely childhood, barely needed to look at the text when he read for us in Folkestone. \u201cIt is the poem that says everything to me,\u201d he said, \u201cabout life, conflict, inner turmoil and outer peace.\u201d Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, Willem Dafoe delivered a sinister reading of the scene in which the albatross is shot; Dafoe\u2019s recent film with Robert Pattinson, The Lighthouse, directly draws on The Rime\u2019s watery horror and its \u201cthousand thousand slimy things\u201d. As important to the Ancient Mariner Big Read are the contemporary art works that accompany each reading, from Marina Abramovi\u0107, William Kentridge, Cornelia Parker, George Shaw, Yinka Shonibare and Glenn Brown among others. Linder, the punk feminist artist, slices out a collage of an eerie shell/dancer chimera; Ellen Gallagher and her collaborator, Edgar Cleijne, whose work deals subtly with race and transition, send a cyanotype boat drifting into a swampy blue unknown. Their works speak to the visceral images of the poem. As Robert Macfarlane, another of our readers, notes, Coleridge\u2019s mythic work predicts the Anthropocene and the fatal disconnection between human and nature. Deeply influenced by Shakespeare, the poem shivers with the storm first stirred by Prospero in The Tempest. The magician, distrusting his own science, says he\u2019ll drown his books. That same sentiment led Extinction Rebellion activists to a meeting of plastics manufacturers last October, wearing emblems of \u201cthe albatrosses round our necks\u201d. And it\u2019s why a teenage girl crouched behind the sofa when the wild-eyed Coleridge came to her parents\u2019 house to recite The Rime in person. The terror Mary Shelley felt that night would be reborn in Frankenstein\u2019s misbegotten Creature, another offence against nature; her novel begins and ends in the polar wastes, just as the Mariner\u2019s deed was done within the bounds of Antarctica, soon to be sighted by Europeans for the first time. So the story spins on, from Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s imaginary Antarctic in The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838) whose humans have needle teeth and red eyes, to Moby-Dick, inspired by a copy of Frankenstein Melville was given in London in 1849, and which he combined with The Rime to create a new fable of abuse, incarnate in the great white whale. Like Moby-Dick, The Rime resounds with human oppression. Coleridge\u2019s scenes of suffering were inspired by the Anglican priest John Newton and his 1750 account of his time as a slave trader. Newton went on, in Mariner-like reparation, to write the hymn \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d, which became a famous spiritual; Coleridge\u2019s modern biographer, Richard Holmes calls The Rime an 18th-century rap. The lyricism of the poem is its battery power. It endures, like the Mariner, telling its story over and over again: in the fated mission of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey and its astronaut\u2019s plunge into infinity; and in Nicolas Roeg\u2019s film The Man Who Fell to Earth, in which David Bowie plays an alien who comes as the herald of our own disaster, only to be imprisoned by the CIA. We always shoot the messenger. The 21st-century Mariner looms out of a downtown doorway, suffering ecocidal PTSD. Danger in The Rime arrives in the shape of \u201cLife-in-Death\u201d and off-screen echoes of slavery and plague ships. Plague masks become bird beaks and now face masks. Albatrosses ingest plastic; humans and marsupials flee the burning bush; migrants are set adrift, and the Mariner\u2019s albatross becomes a pangolin or a bat. Yet at the heart of The Rime is the saving notion that we might yet heed the signs. Albatrosses are the longest-living wild birds, soaring on wingspans up to three metres wide.

It is a sharp increase that appears to dash hopes that the country has reached a plateau in its battle against the virus.

Egypt<strong> </strong>is to ease its coronavirus lockdown by allowing more businesses to reopen and shortening a nighttime curfew. The<strong> </strong>United Arab Emirates<strong> </strong>has cut a nationwide coronavirus curfew by two hours to now run daily from 10pm-6am, instead of from 8pm.</p> <h2>US may extend social distancing until summer</h2> <p>Trump also said he may extend federal social distancing guidelines to the summer. It came as Congress approved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/us-congress-coronavirus-bill-small-business-relief\">a $484bn coronavirus relief package</a>, taking to nearly $3tn the money pledged so far.

The latest update took the total number of deaths to 22,524 from 22,157 the day before, the health ministry said. The overall number of coronavirus cases rose to 219,764 from 213,024 the day before.</p> <h2>No deaths in South Korea in last 24 hours</h2> <p>South Korea reported just six more cases of Covid-19 in the 24 hours before midnight on Friday, raising the total number of infections to 10,708. There were no deaths in the last 24 hours for the first time since 16 March \u2013 39 days.

Some colleagues are working out how to get year 12 back more often than that, maybe 4 or five days out of the week in the early stages but it will depend on the local context and what is working for the students now.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T07:36:23.207Z\">at 8.36am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea28da88f082ab274335e58\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T07:05:49.405Z\">8.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>So it\u2019s been pointed out to me that when the prime minister spoke earlier today about how the four square metre distancing rule didn\u2019t apply to classrooms, this shouldn\u2019t be a huge surprise.</p> \n  <p>Chiefly, <a href=\"https://www.pm.gov.au/media/press-conference-australian-parliament-house-act-16\">because he has said it before </a>\u2013 on 21 April, he said:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On schools, national cabinet was keen to reinforce the point as was made last week that the health advice is not, is not, in relation to schools that a four square metre per person rule be enforced in classrooms.

You can still follow events elsewhere on the Guardian\u2019s global live blog. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow with more live coverage. Here\u2019s a summary of the day: Australia\u2019s death toll from coronavirus rose to 79. Tasmania, Western Australia and New South Wales each announced a death. New case numbers remained low and Tasmania recorded no new cases for the first time in three weeks. Newmarch House in western Sydney announced a fifth death at the aged care facility. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, warned aged care providers to loosen restrictions or face stronger regulation. Testing criteria is being broadened across the country. Community sport could be one of the earliest activities to see restrictions lifted or eased. The national cabinet is working on a set of national principles to allow that to happen. Perth airport blocked four Virgin planes from being moved because the airline owes it $16m in airfield and terminal use fees. Stay safe and thanks again for being with us. Jimmy Barnes took a night off last night, but he\u2019s back with more music from his lounge room. It\u2019s a cover of the 1963 Burt Bacharach and Hal David song (They Long to Be) Close to You, most famously recorded by the Carpenters in 1970. Night has fallen now across the entire continent. Usually hundreds of thousands of Australians would be up before sunrise tomorrow to join Anzac day dawn services and to honour those who serve and have served. But coronavirus means this year will be different. There won\u2019t be any local marches or public services, but people will still be able to watch ceremonies live streamed from state RSL websites and on the ABC and other networks. But you can still take part if you choose to and RSL branches want people to still stand and remember at 6am, either in their homes, on their driveways, in their gardens or anywhere they\u2019re allowed to go. Prof Frank Bongiorno, historian at Australian National University, wrote on the Guardian earlier today that the lack of public ceremony will represent a return to Anzac days of decades long gone. While the day has had its elements of public ritual since 1916, much early Anzac Day commemoration was private rather than public, sometimes conducted at the gravesides of Australian soldiers buried in cemeteries in Britain and Australia. Women were prominent in these efforts, honouring the memories of men they might or might not have known by placing flowers on their tombs. There are other echoes of the past. Anzac Day in 1919 was also disrupted by a major crisis in public health. In New South Wales, where the rate of infection from Spanish influenza was high and the number of deaths \u2013 approaching 1,000 by Anzac Day \u2013 was alarming, the government had banned public meetings. Several key developments emerged from the national cabinet meeting earlier today. Rules around aged care visits, hopes for a restart of community sport, clarification on jobkeeper payments and a repeat of medical advice for school classrooms all made for a busy day. My colleagues Daniel Hurst and Paul Karp have wrapped all the important details here. Australia\u2019s total death toll from Covid-19 is now at 79 with another death confirmed an hour ago at a western Sydney aged care home. We told you about the death of a 96-year-old woman at the Newmarch House aged care facility, who was the third death confirmed today. A 79-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed with Covid-19, died overnight in Tasmania. A man in his 70s died overnight in Western Australia. Here are the daily new case counts as confirmed by states and territories. South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory have seen zero new cases. The ACT recorded 1 new case, Queensland 2, Western Australia 2, Victoria 6 and New South Wales recorded 7. Earlier today Australia\u2019s Therapeutic Goods Administration issued infringement notices of $25,200 to celebrity chef Pete Evans, who claimed a fancy light box \u2013sorry, \u201csubtle energy platform\u201d \u2013 could help treat coronavirus. The BioCharger NG Subtle Energy Platform was yours for just $14,990 from chef Pete. The president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Harry Nespolon, has some comments about the fines. This celebrity chef can carry on all he likes about \u2018activated almonds\u2019 and whatever latest fad excites him but he should steer clear of health advice, particularly when it comes to something as serious as Covid-19. I welcome this decision and I hope that it gives pause for thought for anyone taking advantage of this pandemic to spread false and misleading nonsense on social media. I encourage all Australians to ignore his social media content. Please listen to the experts including your GP, we have your best interests at heart and we are doing all we can. As I have stated previously this \u2018light machine\u2019 doesn\u2019t do anything but drain your wallet. However, the problem is that it may lull people into a false sense of security which means they don\u2019t act as cautiously as they otherwise would on responsibilities such as social distancing. The various interested parties in the world of broadcasting professional rugby league are creeping closer to agreement. NRL broadcasters and the Australian Rugby League Commission have been in talks this afternoon. They\u2019ve agreed the competition will start on 28 may, but AAP reports they still haven\u2019t agreed the structure. From AAP: NRL television broadcasters Channel Nine and Foxtel have agreed to recognise May 28 as the competition recommencement date following extensive meetings. On Friday evening, ARL Commission chairman Peter V\u2019landys confirmed to AAP that the NRL and broadcasters would finalise a competition structure early next week, as both parties want different outcomes. \u201cWe were all united on the 28th May start. But just the competition structure we need a little more time, but we definitely announce it early next week,\u201d he said. A 96-year-old woman who had tested positive for Covid-19 has died at Newmarch House in western Sydney \u2013 the fifth death at the aged care home. Anglicare Sydney has confirmed the sad news in a statement, saying the woman had \u201cmultiple health issues\u201d. Grant Millard, CEO of Anglicare Sydney, said: I am thankful that a close relative was able to visit her last night before she died. We grieve with the family, our staff who have cared for her, other residents who have come to know her, and everyone who has been thinking and praying for us during this difficult time. Please keep everyone in your thoughts and prayers. Schools in NSW go back next week under a model that has students in classrooms for a day a week, starting in week two. Craig Petersen, the acting president of the New South Wales Secondary Principals\u2019 Council, is talking to the ABC. He says last night the NSW chief medical officer Dr Kerry Chant gave a briefing and \u201cit\u2019s quite clear that the transmission rate between children is absolutely negligible\u201d. Petersen said: That is reassuring but we also have staff to consider and we do have a number of staff in schools who are aged or have underlying health conditions so we look how we can maintain that. The logistics of returning to school is something the principals will work hard and how to cater for HSC students .... And the reality is that any staggered return to school is going to be fraught with difficulty. We are really concerned about our HSC students, this is a big year for them and we want to minimise the disruption to their education and get them back on track as soon as we can but not losing track with other students. Some colleagues are working out how to get year 12 back more often than that, maybe 4 or five days out of the week in the early stages but it will depend on the local context and what is working for the students now. So it\u2019s been pointed out to me that when the prime minister spoke earlier today about how the four square metre distancing rule didn\u2019t apply to classrooms, this shouldn\u2019t be a huge surprise. Chiefly, because he has said it before \u2013 on 21 April, he said: On schools, national cabinet was keen to reinforce the point as was made last week that the health advice is not, is not, in relation to schools that a four square metre per person rule be enforced in classrooms. That is not the advice of the medical expert panel and any suggestion that this is a requirement for schools is not the case. To be fair, the PM didn\u2019t mention the 1.5 metre social distancing rule on 21 April, and he did today. But it\u2019s also clear that classrooms haven\u2019t been the subject of the same health advice as other situations for some time. Sydney beaches at Coogee, Maroubra and Clovelly will open on Saturday and Sunday morning for three hours, but only if people are there to exercise. Between 6am and 9am, surfing, swimming and running is in. Hanging out and watching the world go by, isn\u2019t. Randwick City Council said it would would reassess the situation on Monday. In a statement, the council said: All other unpatrolled beaches in Randwick City will remain closed until further notice. These beaches include Gordon\u2019s Bay, Malabar beach, Little Bay beach, Frenchmans beach, Yarra Bay and Congwong beach. Ocean rock pools in Randwick City will remain closed until further notice as they are subject to a public health order to close. Graham Readfearn here taking you through the rest of the day in coronavirus-related news. Earlier today, home affairs minister Peter Dutton had a crack at the Queensland government, saying kids in his state should be back at school. The reason they weren\u2019t, claimed Dutton, was because premier Annastacia Palaszczuk was \u201crunning scared of the militant\u201d Queensland Teachers\u2019 Union. Well, QTU president Kevin Bates has just been talking to the ABC. An announcement earlier today from the national cabinet that the 1.5 metre distancing rule should no longer apply to schools has thrown the union\u2019s position in the air. Bates said that the union \u201chad not formed a position\u201d on whether there could be return to full schooling before the end of this current term, which is finishing its first week today. If you had asked me that question yesterday, I would have potentially given you a different answer, because today the 1.5m social distancing rule has just disappeared. So you know, we\u2019ve got this roller-coaster ride of changing conditions \u2013 we\u2019re not making a decision on this in Queensland until the end of the next fortnight. We would need to look at all of the circumstances that are in play at that time to make a good decision about what the second half of the term would look like. Bates responded to the accusation his union was running the show saying they were only one of \u201calmost 80 people\u201d who were meeting almost daily for stakeholder meetings with the state\u2019s Department of Education We are one of the stakeholders, we are a major stakeholder, we represent 48,000 teachers and principals in Queensland, but our voice is not the only one and the government obviously listens to what we have to say, and then they make their own decisions. We don\u2019t always agree with everything they decide and this is one of those cases. But we are working with the government as we look towards what might happen in the second half of the term. I am now handing over to my colleague, Graham Readfearn, to take you through the evening. Police were forced to break up a protest against 5G in Mullumbimby in NSW due to the coronavirus restrictions on public gatherings. Around 100 people, seemingly unaware of the potential dangers of contracting coronavirus in large gatherings, were incorrectly claiming that 5G can affect immunity. \u201cEspecially in this age of coronavirus, you want to have your immunity as strong as you can,\u201d 7News reported one of the protestors saying. We\u2019ve confirmed, as the prime minister said earlier, that Amazon Web Services will host the data from the app within Australia (Sydney area to be exact). There\u2019s been a lot of people quite concerned about using an American company for this, because of a US law that can force US-based companies to provide data they hold, even if they\u2019re not located there. We\u2019ll have more on that later, but government services minister Stuart Robert has said new laws will be enacted to make it a crime for Amazon to take the data overseas. \u201cKeeping Australian data in Australia will be guaranteed through a determination through the Biosecurity Act and legislation. It will be a criminal offence to transfer data to any country other than Australia. A penalty of imprisonment for five years and/or 300 penalty units ($63,000) could apply to breaches of the direction,\u201d he said. \u201cThe highly secure information storage system keys will be managed through Amazon Web Services\u2019 Key Management System (KMS), a widely used security service that has been previously assessed by the ACSC. \u201cThis is exactly the same way the Australian government already uses AWS for many other agencies, including the work of our intelligence agencies, including ASD, and ensures Australian data stays in Australia.\u201d One point, he said, was that Australia hadn\u2019t signed up to participate in the US Cloud Act yet \u2013 except there is currently legislation before parliament to do just that. So more to come on this. In case you forgot, avid carnivore Pete Evans was recently seen promoting this Tardis console panel-looking device as a potential treatment for coronavirus. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has now fined Evans $25,200 (or roughly the cost of 1.5 of these machines) for claiming it could be used for coronavirus treatment. The TGA found there was \u201cno foundation\u201d to these claims. There were two infringement notices issued. One for the coronavirus claims, and one for the other claims made for this Back to the Future-looking device, including that it could \u201crestore strength, stamina, coordination and mental clarity\u201d. \u201cAs the BioCharger device has been represented by the company as being for therapeutic uses, it is a therapeutic good within the meaning of the act, and is subject to the regulatory framework established under the act and administered by the TGA,\u201d the TGA said. \u201cUnless a specific exemption applies, therapeutic goods must be entered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) before they can be lawfully supplied or advertised in Australia.\u201d The emergency laws that passed Victorian parliament yesterday as part of the state\u2019s response to the coronavirus should be overseen by an independent committee, human rights commissioner Kristen HIlton has said. Hilton, who is the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commissioner, said some of the measures introduced in the Covid-19 Omnibus (Emergency Measures) Act 2020 would have an impact on human rights, particularly changes relating to the management of prisons, the restriction of visitors, and changes to the way court proceedings are carried out. She said those impacts were reasonable but must be closely monitored. \u201cDuring a state of emergency, some limitations on human rights may be unavoidable \u2013 and these are not decisions we can take lightly. Any restriction on human rights must be necessary, justifiable, proportionate and time-bound,\u201d Hilton said. She added: \u201cThe government should establish an independent committee to scrutinise the response, that is informed by human rights expertise and can hear directly from the public. This is critical in maintaining public confidence and transparency.\u201d The Victorian opposition called for the establishment of such a committee, but the deputy Nationals leader, Steph Ryan, said the government refused to establish a committee with a non-government majority. Hilton said the Victorian Government had filed a statement of compatibility, to show that the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities had been carefully considered in the drafting of the laws, but that did not do away with the need for continual monitoring and independent oversight. Perth airport says it has blocked four Virgin planes from being moved because the airline owes it $16m in airfield and terminal use fees. An airport spokeswoman said Qantas has also \u201cunilaterally\u201d refused to pay $20m in fees, although there\u2019s no sign of any bulldozers in front of jets sporting the flying kangaroo yet. The spokeswoman said: \u201cVirgin has significant outstanding invoices from Perth airport for airfield and terminal use charges \u2013 money the airline has already collected from its passengers and the FIFO sector. \u201cWhile Perth airport is working with the Virgin administrators, it also needs to protect its own interests. \u201cPerth airport has taken liens over a number of Virgin aircraft \u2013 a standard practice in these situations.\u201d The terminal Virgin usually uses,T1, is closed and the planes in question aren\u2019t currently in use due to the coronavirus crisis. But Virgin continues to operate charter flights from T2 for the Fifo \u2013 fly-in-fly-out \u2013 workers in Western Australia\u2019s mining industry. Labor leader Anthony Albanese says privacy concerns about the contact tracing app need to be addressed. He says the parliament will also scrutinise the legislation supporting the app. \u201cWe will be scrutinising the legislation carefully that the government has said they will provide it to us in advance and we will be ensuring that privacy concerns are met. It can be, obviously, a very useful tool. The medical experts have said that.\u201d He says the parliamentary committees should have access to the legislation before it hits parliament to speed up the process of passing it in the second week of May. Gilbert ends the interview by saying Australia\u2019s in a very good position in dealing with coronavirus. \u201cBetter than most, let\u2019s keep it that way,\u201d Morrison replies. Morrison won\u2019t be drawn on whether the government will consider broadening or raising the GST as part of the rebound effort post coronavirus pandemic. He says everything should be on the table, but the goal should be jobs, investment and growth. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to put people\u2019s taxes up,\u201d he says. On the contact tracing app, Morrison says people should not be worried about it. \u201cThis has one job and that is to help that health officer sitting in that office in Sydney or Melbourne...\u201d He compares it to the manual contact tracing method (which relies on human memory, not a recorded list of everyone you\u2019ve been around). \u201cWe\u2019ve put the protections in place. You download the app, you\u2019re making yourself safer, you\u2019re making your family safer, and you\u2019re making the community safer.\u201d He says it is up to Australians to get to that 40% uptake, and he says he will be downloading the app himself. The app will be out \u201cvery soon\u201d, he says. \u201cIt is hurting, it is hurting hard,\u201d Morrison says, about the economic impact. Yes there are another three weeks before restrictions will be potentially eased, but states are moving already. He says if they can do it even a day earlier they will, but he doesn\u2019t want to open everything up and then have to close it down again, which would cost more. Good afternoon, everyone. Prime minister Scott Morrison is being interviewed by Sky News\u2019 Kieran Gilbert. Morrison says Australia is in a much better position now than the national cabinet thought we would be when it was first convened. He says it is \u201cpossible\u201d to eliminate coronavirus entirely, but an eradication strategy is \u201ceveryone getting under the doona and not getting out\u201d and you can\u2019t run a country like that. On that note, I will hand you over to Josh Taylor for the next little bit. Thank you again for joining us this week. It means a lot. Stay well this weekend \u2013 and take care of you. Aged care minister Richard Colbeck has put out a statement on the aged care edicts Scott Morrison was talking about: Aged care minister Richard Colbeck says while providers shared a responsibility to protect the wellbeing of senior Australians in care, total lockdowns of facilities were not supported by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) or the national cabinet. It follows calls by Prime Minister Scott Morrison who reminded providers not to impose tougher visitor restrictions. Age care providers that wish to have an exemption from the national arrangements should seek authority through the commonwealth. ... But Minister Colbeck said the call to work to the AHPPC recommendations was not a green light to go back to pre-Covid visitation routines. It is also recommended that all aged care workers and visitors have their flu vaccinations by 1 May. Anthony Albanese will hold his press conference at 3.20pm You may have seen the prime minister and the chief medical officer talk about masks as part of that press conference about an hour or so ago. Labor\u2019s Andrew Leigh says they need to be made available to charities, writing to Greg Hunt to ask the government to provide them: I note recent reports that the government has been able to replenish stockpiles of personal protective equipment. Australian charities are working hard to maintain vital services to vulnerable Australians \u2013 providing, for example, acute mental health support, emergency relief and disability support \u2013 and in many cases are facing increased costs to provide staff and volunteers with appropriate protective equipment. Services provided by frontline charities will have increasing importance to the community as physical distancing measures continue. Yet at a time when demand on many services is increasing, donations and program-based revenue is falling. On top of this financial strain, the need to provide adequate safety equipment has left many charities with a choice of either spending scarce resources to purchase personal protective equipment at a commercial rate in a sellers\u2019 market, or discontinuing services in spite of increased demand. While our healthcare workers rightly have the highest priority claim on the commonwealth\u2019s reserves of personal protective equipment, I urge you to work with representatives in the charity and community sector to create pathways for not-for-profit providers of vital support services to get access to stockpiled equipment. These organisations are playing an important role in keeping vulnerable Australians healthy and socially connected. Supporting expert service providers to stay active in our communities will be beneficial for all. And it is not just charities. Aged care \u201cin house\u201d workers \u2013 who may not be nurses, but take care of the showering and feeding needs, or in some cases go into people\u2019s homes for community care, are also crying out for masks. One of the issues with aged care is the tight margins facilities operate with, so that is not only impacting staffing levels, but also, the equipment being provided. It\u2019s not just Coogee \u2013 Maroubra and Clovelly have been closed again, as well. The restrictions have impacted a lot of people\u2019s lives in ways you wouldn\u2019t think of, until you are experiencing it yourself. Here is another way I know a lot of families are dealing with right now The ACCC says 7-Eleven stores do not have to be trading 7-Eleven (or any other hours) if they don\u2019t want to: 7-Eleven and its franchisees have been granted conditional interim authorisation to discuss potential temporary store closures or reduced trading hours in light of reduced customer demand because of Covid-19 restrictions. 7-Eleven owns and operates stores in competition with its franchisees in some areas and therefore discussions and agreements between them risk breaching the competition laws. \u201cWe recognise that 7-Eleven and its franchisees are facing difficult trading conditions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and believe this cooperation could help the network and individual stores to remain viable,\u201d ACCC Chair Rod Sims said. \u201cImportantly, franchisees are not required to temporarily close or reduce their store hours if they do not wish to. Our decision to grant interim authorisation does not force franchisees to agree to the terms offered by 7-Eleven.\u201d Franchisees that agree to close temporarily will receive an ex-gratia payment from 7-Eleven to cover certain unavoidable operational costs. For franchisees that agree to reduce their hours, the minimum guaranteed income that the franchisee receives from 7-Eleven would be pro-rata adjusted to reflect the temporary reduction in trading hours. The Law Council still has some reservations about the tracing app, and has suggested the government adhere to some principles to make everyone feel a little better about it: With the government\u2019s Covid-19 tracing app in development, the Law Council of Australia is calling for the adoption of core design principles to be included within the legislative framework, designed to govern the operation of the app. Placing the app on legislative foundations will ensure that the parameters for the app\u2019s use are clear, certain, legally effective and not susceptible to removal or amendment by unilateral executive action. ... The series of core principles include clear governing laws and administrative frameworks, adoption of a voluntary \u2018opt-in\u2019 model, limitations on the collection of users\u2019 personal information, a prohibition on any secondary use or disclosure of information collected by the app, security of personal information, and limited use of de-identified information for specified public health purposes amongst others. See the Core Principles document. If you need even more Scott Morrison on your Friday, he will be on Sky News at 3pm. Here is what Coogee beach looked like this morning, before it was closed again. Prof Brendan Murphy barely contained his laughter when asked about this. And then remembered he was on national television The prime minister finishes his press conference by effectively saying he expects everyone to be out on their driveways at dawn, for the Anzac dawn service. Other than that, I will see everyone tomorrow morning at 5.30. I will be at the national War Memorial. Everyone else will be at home. At 6.00 I look forward to the entire nation, on their driveways, lighting up the dawn, remembering our heroes and drawing inspiration from them for the task and challenge we currently face. Thank you very much. Scott Morrison finishes his press conference with a reminder that parliament is returning on 12, 14 and 13 May. I met with the opposition last night, our regular weekly get-together. On the Wednesday of that week, there will also be the Federation Chamber operating in the House of Representatives. The arrangements that we\u2019ve had in place for the other days of sittings will be pursued when we return in more or less the same form, ensuring the chamber operates with the appropriate social distancing. But I anticipate we\u2019ll see a lot more members back in the Parliament House, but obviously they can\u2019t all be in the chamber at the one time. Or, indeed, in the Federation Chamber at the one time. The business of the parliament in that week, it will be the ordinary business of the parliament. The ACT has recorded one new case of Covid-19 in the past 14 hours. Authorities are working out how he contracted the virus. And then the nation gets another dose of guilt about civic duty when it comes to the tracing app, as Scott Morrison talks about how the national cabinet is looking at lifting the restrictions: What we also want to be careful of, and this is why we\u2019re doing it in a very sort of incremental, iterative way as a national cabinet, is what we don\u2019t want to see is a stop-start approach to our road back. This is why getting in place the sentinel testing, the testing regime, the contact tracing, which is very much helped by this app, this health app, a public health app that helps health workers help you, we need this so we can have the protections in place for you, your family, so you can get back to work, so you can get your kids back to school, so you can get back into community sport \u2013 that is what this app helps you do. That\u2019s what it\u2019s designed to do. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been so direct about it and so careful about its construction and the protections that are there. And to have this, as you say in your question, this rapid response that can deal with the condition on the ground, of course there will be outbreaks. I think we can anticipate that. But where you have the response capability and the AUSMAT teams and other quite well-trained and highly qualified people to go and seal off those outbreaks, then you can keep the rest of the country moving at the same time. That is our much preferred position. You know, you don\u2019t want to go on a stop-start basis, and that\u2019s why you\u2019ve gotta be careful when you come to relax some of these restrictions. On why he wants people back in workplaces, Scott Morrison says: I would love to see a return to normal right across the board. Of course we want to see that. And that includes people going to work in offices. And that\u2019s an important part of how our economy functions. I mean, there are some people who can work from home, and for whom this period of time has been less of an inconvenience to them than it has to many others. But I can \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019d know that if you\u2019re a parent at home, trying to work from home and you\u2019ve also got the kids at home, and they\u2019re trying to learn, it\u2019s not working too well for you. And your productivity isn\u2019t doing too well either. And so when we can get back to the point where we can have kids back at school, and we can get people back at work, then I think we\u2019re gonna see that also lift our economy in ways that we very much need. Because we want our economy to support businesses and jobs, not government through subsidies and income support payments and things of that nature. I mean, our social security net will always be there for those who need it. But our preference and priority is always to ensure that our economy is what supports people\u2019s livelihoods. And that\u2019s what we need again. Prof Brendan Murphy is barely holding back incredulous laughter when asked if anyone should follow Donald Trump\u2019s latest brain fart about dealing with the coronavirus \u2013 which was basically injecting disinfectant (kill it with bleach! and yourself!) and blasting yourself with massive amounts of UV light (kill it by giving yourself cancer!). Murphy: Um ... I would not ... I would caution against the injection of disinfection! They could be quite toxic to people. I wasn\u2019t privy to his comments, so I want to be very careful about commenting on something that I didn\u2019t hear myself. And ultraviolet light, look, I don\u2019t know the context in which he said it, so I really would need to study it before I could comment, thank you. My dad used to clean my cuts with Pine-o-cleen because it saved money and he figured one disinfectant was as good as another, but even he would draw the line at injecting it. On the issues with the implementation of the jobkeeper wage subsidy, Scott Morrison says it is something which is being addressed: We\u2019re working closely, as the treasurer is, in particular, as is the tax commissioner, on the implementation issues around jobkeeper. And let\u2019s also remember that where jobkeeper doesn\u2019t apply, jobseeker does kick in. So, these two work together, and that\u2019s always been important. Jobkeeper was never intended to be a catch-all for every Australian worker, or a worker who had their hours significantly reduced or, indeed, was stood down. It was intended to be there as an important element of the income support that we put in place, and the lifeline to businesses and to keep people connected to businesses. But where that can\u2019t be in place because of arrangements that we\u2019ve set to ensure that we manage these issues well, not just administratively but fiscally, then jobseeker is available. As I said, we\u2019re approaching now almost 600,000 claims for jobseeker over these last five or so weeks, which has been quite an effort on their part. And, again, I thank those who have made claims, and those who are still awaiting for their claims to be processed for their patience. Queensland has announced it will look at whether the school restrictions need to be extended beyond the fifth week of term two, which is around mid-May. But anyone who wants to send their child to school, can. They are open. Parents have been advised to talk to principals if they have any concerns. I know, because my sister is a public school teacher in Queensland. And also, because I pay attention to press conferences. In response to this tweet Scott Morrison says the home affairs minister is just \u201cexpressing his opinion as a local\u201d. Well, look, I\u2019d simply say that Peter, of course, is a minister in my government, but he\u2019s also a Queenslander. And these are issues that are being debated and addressed in Queensland. And whether you\u2019re a local member, a minister or just any old Queenslander, then you do get to have the right to have a view as a local. And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s the context in which Peter\u2019s expressed those views. How does the chief medical officer see restrictions being lifted for gatherings, as well as travel? I mean, there may be a situation where a country has effectively eliminated or got very low cases. For example, New Zealand, we might have a situation where it could be relaxed. But if you\u2019re coming from a country where there is significant community transmission, I think that the impact - you\u2019ve seen the graphs. The impact of our quarantine measures on what\u2019s happened in Australia has been huge. Clearly the national cabinet has asked us to come back with a range of potential recommendations for gently, carefully, cautiously relaxing distancing measures. And, of course, the size of gatherings will be in that mix. But I don\u2019t want to pre-empt the decisions of national cabinet. But we will be making recommendations. Similar to those that you\u2019re talking about. And they\u2019ll be coming to national cabinet. It will be their decision. Scott Morrison moves to address some more concerns about the tracing app \u2013 namely where the server will be situated: The server is in Australia and it\u2019s using AWS, who work with Australia on many, many sensitive issues. In terms of Australia\u2019s data management. It\u2019s a nationally encrypted data store. It is illegal - it will be illegal for information to go out of that data store to any other person other than that for whom the whole thing is designed, and that is to support the health worker in the state to be able to undertake the contact tracing, with the data that they access being released by the individual for whom is the subject of the contact tracing. Although people would probably be feeling much more comfortable with the idea of the app if the government hadn\u2019t passed \u201cnational security\u201d legislation which allows the government to force tech companies to build secret backdoors into apps, which can be accessed, without anyone knowing. I am not saying that is happening here, but I am saying trust is low for a reason. A lot of jurisdictions have already done this \u2013 but testing will be extended across the nation, to ensure any community transmission is being picked up, Professor Brendan Murphy says: In particular, national cabinet was informed today that every single jurisdiction has now \u2013 every state and territory has now broadened their testing criteria from today. Some did it earlier. So that anybody with acute respiratory symptoms \u2013 cough, sore throat, runny nose, cold symptoms, flu-like symptoms \u2013 can get tested. This will significantly expand the population of people tested. We\u2019re pretty confident that most of them will be negative, but this will give us a really broad reach of what we call passive surveillance. But we\u2019re also looking at a range of active surveillance mechanisms to test even people without symptoms in a range of frontline occupations and a range of what we call sentinel situations, where we sample the population. National cabinet is very clear that they want to be absolutely confident before relaxing any measures that we are in a position in this country to detect any community transmission of any significance. Scott Morrison then moves to how Australia has moved into the \u201ccommunity phase\u201d of monitoring the spread of Covid-19, where it has to watch for community transmission: We now have to be wary against community transmission, and so we are dealing with that third wave of the virus. We will also be then working towards decisions that we have to make over the next few weeks, getting the key data metrics in place as to how we\u2019ll make decisions on further easing of restrictions. We are, though, I confirm, seeing states and territories individually waiving various parts of the restrictions they have put in place above the baselines. They\u2019re making those announcements almost on a daily basis. We welcome that, whether it\u2019s in schools or in other areas, and we can expect to see that happen over the next few weeks. The national cabinet will meet next Friday again. Sorry for the slight delay - my computer had a slight meltdown. Back to the press conference, Scott Morrison says it is time for aged care facilities to start allowing visits, if they are not already, or face having to get commonwealth permission for changing the arrangements: On aged care, there is a meeting this evening, a webinar, and national cabinet has continued to stress its concern about restrictions that are being put in place in aged care facilities, as I noted earlier this week, beyond the baseline requirements of what national cabinet has agreed, based on the expert medical advice. So, we are flagging \u2013 I am flagging very clearly at a federal level \u2013 that should we not see an improvement in this area, under the voluntary arrangements that we currently have in place, that the commonwealth would be moving to require aged care facilities that wish to have an exemption to those national principles, those national arrangements, then they would need to seek authority to do that from the commonwealth, and we would make such a decision in consultation with the relevant state and territory jurisdiction. Now, there are quite valid reasons why you would have exemptions, particularly as we\u2019ve seen in north-west Tasmania at the moment, or what we\u2019ve seen in western Sydney or in other places. That is entirely sensible as to why you would have restrictions that are greater than the national baseline in those circumstances. Totally reasonable. But more broadly, having people stuck in their rooms, not being able to be visited by their loved ones and carers and other support people, that\u2019s not OK. And so let\u2019s see how the industry goes with that. We would very much like to keep these things on a basis where aged care facilities are exercising their proper discretion. But we are not going to have these as secret places, where people can\u2019t access them. We will see some new modelling during this Meanwhile, as Scott Morrison talks of opening public spaces up once again, Coogee beach is once again closed: On the theme of \u2018national principles\u2019, there are also safe workplace national principles on the way. Scott Morrison: This is all about getting Australians back to work, and ensuring that when they go back to work that they and their families can feel safe in going back to work, and to ensure that there are important principles in place, there are protocols and procedures that, should a Covid case present in a workplace, then the rules that people need to follow... The minister for industrial relations has been working closely with the Covid commission, union representatives and others to ensure we get helpful tools in place. On exercise and training, Scott Morrison says \u201cnational principles\u201d will be released: The first, at the elite and professional level. So, the major sporting codes, our Olympic sports, training arrangements that sit around support for those activities, by elite sportspeople. Secondly, at the community competitive sport level. That is such an important part of our way of life here in Australia, and the principles that can help guide decisions by states and territories in the future. And, thirdly, at the individual passive level of sport and recreation. Activities from everything from - whether it\u2019s in the shire, if you\u2019re going surfing, or if you\u2019re walking in the local national park, or whatever it might happen to be, those set of principles that states and territories can draw on in terms of getting some consistency across the country as we move into this next phase. Scott Morrison on schools: On schools, confirmation \u2013 and this is in the medical expert advice \u2013 the AHPPC\u2019s document being released today \u2013 confirmation that the 4 sq metre rule, and the 1.5m distancing between students during classroom activities is not appropriate and not required. I can\u2019t be more clear than that. The advice cannot be more clear than that. The 1.5m in classrooms and the 4 sq metre rule is not a requirement of the expert medical advice in classrooms. Scott Morrison on wearing of masks: On a couple of quite specific issues, on the wearing of masks, and Brendan Murphy, the professor, will talk a little bit more about this. But on the wearing of masks, the medical expert panel, we accepted their advice that it is not recommended by the expert panel that they are necessary to be worn, and importantly, it\u2019s important to note that the wearing of such a mask does not protect you from an infection, but if you are displaying respiratory symptoms then it is, at best, a measure that prevents you transferring it to others. It\u2019s not about protecting you from infection, but that\u2019s why, when people were leaving airports and things of that nature, they were wearing it to prevent the transmission. The tracing app is on its way. Scott Morrison: There are still some issues we\u2019re working through late in the piece, which is to be expected. We\u2019re not too far away now. Earlier this week, as I indicated to you, it received the in-principle support of the national cabinet and we have been taking that through its final stages in recent days. That will be also an important tool for the country as we seek to manage how we live in a Covid-safe economy and community into the future. And the rapid response to individual outbreaks \u2013 we should be aware, as a community right across the country, that when we take further steps to ease restrictions, of course, we will continue to see outbreaks. That is to be expected. What matters is being able to move on them quickly. The prime minister starts the press conference by passing on the national cabinet\u2019s and the nation\u2019s, condolences to the families of the four Victorian police officers who were killed on Wednesday night, during a traffic stop. The Nine Network\u2019s Charles Croucher had this lovely story last night. I don\u2019t think anyone would be surprised to see the industries which have been hardest hit so far The national cabinet meeting has ended. Scott Morrison will give an update at 1pm. Western Australia authorities have reported a passenger on the Artania cruise ship, who was being treated for Covid-19, died overnight. The man, aged in his 70s, is the eighth person to die in WA and the 78th person to die in Australia, after a Covid-19 diagnosis. We heard yesterday that so far, almost $4bn has been withdrawn from super funds, from people struggling under financial pressure because of the Covid-19 crisis. There will be another round opened up in the next financial year. The average withdrawal has been $8,000. But how much will that cost when you want to retire? The select Senate committee looking at the Covid-19 response will hold another hearing next week. Treasury will be up then. In the meantime, the transcript from yesterday, which featured Prof Brendan Murphy and officials from the health department, is up. Food security in remote Indigenous communities is a problem at the best of times, but it has been exacerbated by the coronavirus, to the point where people have been unable to source essentials for weeks in some communities. A group of 13 Aboriginal organisations from across the Northern Territory this week called on the national cabinet to do more to guarantee food security for remote communities. Minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, convened a second round table of the major supermarkets, the NT government and the community stores, to guarantee supply. Coles announced today it has donated more than 80 pallets, or about 50 tonnes of food and grocery essentials, to remote communities across the Northern Territory this week. The packages include fresh and tinned produce, pasta, rice, biscuits and breakfast cereals. \u201cSpring water, toilet paper, nappies and sanitary items will also be delivered to residents in Darwin, Alice Springs and to many remote communities such as Santa Teresa, Beswick and Elliott, which is 735 km away from a Coles store,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement about the delivery. Sarah Hanson-Young has a bit to say in a statement about the removal of environmental \u201cred tape\u201d during this pandemic: The Morrison government has declared war with the environment with its announcement it plans to cut \u2018green tape\u2019 even before the 10-year review of environmental laws is completed, the Greens say. Greens spokesperson for the environment Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said: \u2018Using the cover of Covid-19 as an excuse to scrap environmental protections is an act of bastardry, and everyday Australians will be appalled. \u2018This anti-environment government has always had cuts to environmental protections in favour of its big business mates on its agenda. \u2018They seem to think Australians are distracted enough by the Covid-19 pandemic they won\u2019t notice this latest attack. But I\u2019ve got news for the environment minister, Australians care about the environment now more than ever and won\u2019t take this lying down. \u2018Trying to cut environmental protections to give big business, who donate to major political parties, easy access to cut down, dig up and trample the environment in the name of economic stimulus after a global pandemic is shameful. \u2018We need stronger environmental laws, not weaker ones. The EPBC Act is already failing in its purpose of protection conservation and biodiversity with flora and fauna continuing to become threatened species and even going extinct. \u2018Fast-tracking applications will do even more damage. As it is, only about 2 per cent of applications under the EPBC Act get knocked back. Federal court judge John Middleton has decided to allow administrators of Virgin Australia to avoid personal liability for the stricken airline\u2019s $1.2bn in aircraft leases for a month. Middleton has also allowed the administrators, Vaughan Strawbridge, Salvatore Algeri, John Greig and Richard Hughes, of accounting firm Deloitte, to hold a meeting of creditors next Thursday by videolink and correspond with creditors by email. At a hearing this morning - itself held by videoline - Middleton said that any interested party that objected to the orders could come to the court and he would hear them on short notice. Middleton said he could himself turn out to be a creditor of Virgin Australia because he has booked flights to be taken in July. He said he also held points in Virgin\u2019s frequent flyer scheme, Velocity, which is not in administration, and was a member of the airline\u2019s lounge club. Got a sniffle and live in NSW? The government would love it if you got tested for Covid. From the NSW health release: The NSW government is urging anyone experiencing symptoms of Covid-19 to be tested in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. Covid-19 symptoms include: \u00b7 Fever; \u00b7 Cough; \u00b7 Tiredness (fatigue); \u00b7 Sore throat; \u00b7 Shortness of breath. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian today announced there is now capacity to double the number of Covid-19 tests from around 4,000 tests per day to 8,000. And within that report The Parliamentary Budget Office has a new report out - this one on unlegislated measures carried forward into budget estimates. It is before any of the Covid measures were in place though, so don\u2019t expect to find that. With all the talk about new ideas for the Australian economy, Anthony Albanese was also pressed on what he thought needed to happen, while on Melbourne radio 3AW this morning. Here is what he came up with: Hydrogen is an industry that can absolutely power steel and can power aluminium. How about we look at, for example, in Gladstone, they\u2019re looking at, Rio Tinto own the aluminium refinery there, what they want to do is to power that up with solar energy in order to operate. They reckon they can double their capacity. ... One of the things that we could look at, for example, is go back to the Henry Tax Review. And one of the things that it said was that when you look at tax, you change behaviour. What sort of behaviour do we want? ... For example, rather than looking at just company tax cuts, I think what makes far more sense is to look at how do we encourage investment in Australia that creates jobs by companies. Neil Mitchell didn\u2019t waste any time with his opening question to Anthony Albanese this morning: Mitchell: Is Scott Morrison doing a good job? Albanese: Look, I think the Australian people are doing a good job. And when the prime minister has got together with the state premiers and territory leaders, it is a good thing that we are getting more cooperation than we have historically in our federation system. I think \u2026 listening to the medical experts has been good. And that engagement has been constructive. I think that it is a good thing, for example, and I met with the prime minister and other senior ministers last night. So we are spending just over $90m on emergency fuel stock and $2.5m on storage for the fuel, to keep it in America, because we have nowhere to store it onshore. Which completely goes against the point of having an emergency fuel store. The point of the store being that if there is a conflict, or supply chains are cut, you have fuel on hand. Which Australia does not. Because it will be in America. baby steps. Mathias Cormann has released the latest spendings: This week I made $94 million in additional funding available to support the government\u2019s purchase of oil stocks and the leasing of storage capacity in the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve by using the Advance to the Finance Minister. One determination of $91.5 million for purchasing oil was made from the Advance which was appropriated by the parliament in the Appropriation Act (No. 6) 2019-2020; and A second determination of $2.5 million for leasing storage was made from the Advance which was appropriated by the parliament in the Appropriation Act (No. 1) 2019-2020. Both determinations were signed yesterday. The determinations were registered on the Federal Register of Legislation, together with an Explanatory Statement (these will be available on legislation.gov.au). Given the writings of former prime ministers are in vogue, here\u2019s the latest from the 28th: This seems pretty to the point: Police in Victoria appear to be continuing the trend of slapping anyone who is out allegedly conducting another crime with a fine for breaching social distancing laws. This seems to be a liberal interpretation of the public health orders unless you want to argue that robbers, like other professionals, should be working from home during this period. In the past 24 hours police have issued 54 on-the-spot fines. Recipients included three men fined for attending a birthday party in Romsey, four men and one woman who were spotted together at Winchelsea football oval, and \u201cmultiple people committing criminal offences, including robberies, vehicle theft and drug related offences\u201d. This is interesting, given that Australia is taking some of the TraceTogether code base for its own app (some, not all): Six more Victorians have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. As we heard about a week ago, a mental health worker had been diagnosed with the virus, which authorities were keeping an eye on, given their contacts. The Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, confirmed a mental health facility (unnamed) had seen a cluster of cases, with 14 people linked to the facility now diagnosed with Covid-19. \u201cFive are patients, five are staff and four are household close contacts,\u201d she said. \u201cFurther testing will be undertaken today to determine if there is any further spread.\u201d During the Sars epidemic, civet cats were thought to be one of the vectors which led to that virus being transmitted to humans. The evidence is very scant when it comes to Covid-19, but the World Health Organisation has previously said that cats don\u2019t seem to be playing a major role in transmission to humans, but can catch the virus from people. Dogs, so far, seem to be OK. It is the first time in about three weeks that Tasmania has recorded no new cases. But given the devastation the virus can cause in that community particularly, Peter Gutwein has decided to extend the strict lockdown restrictions, which have been in place in the north-west, for another week. They had been due to be lifted this weekend. Gutwein says there needs to be more testing done, before they can risk it. That\u2019s why today, following advice from Public Health, we have taken the extremely difficult decision to extend the additional restrictions, the additional retail restrictions that are in place on the north-west coast, out for another week until next Sunday, 3 May. It\u2019s not a decision that is taken lightly. I know many in the north-west will be unhappy about this. But we need to get on top of this. We need to stamp this out. We need to crush this virus. We need to understand right across the community if this virus is there, and importantly to track and trace it aggressively. While there is certainly promising signs that the north-west is coming under control, an additional week of deeper testing will ensure that we have a very clear understanding of what\u2019s occurring right across the coast and it will be our best opportunity to ensure that we have this outbreak completely under control and, importantly, if there are pockets to stamp them out as quickly as we possibly can. I would ask that the people of the north-west bear with us. But Peter Gutwein said there had been no new cases of Covid-19 diagnosed in Tasmania in the last 24 hours. He said that news, combined with the death of another Tasmanian, was conflicting: To the woman\u2019s family, friends and loved ones \u2013 I\u2019m sorry. On behalf of the government, I extend our condolences and sympathies to you all. To lose someone else is just an absolute tragedy. It brings the total to nine lives lost in the state to the virus in past months. As I\u2019ve continually said, there will be bad days. But there will also be better days as well. Today, unfortunately, is another one of those bittersweet moments. To stand here and have to announce that we\u2019ve lost another life is something that gives me deep concern and is, you know, again, something that I must admit troubles me deeply. I find it very difficult to do. However, what it does do, it sharpens my resolve to get on top of this and stamp out this insidious virus. Tasmania has recorded another death, after a 79-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed with Covid-19, passed away overnight. She is the ninth person to have died in Tasmania after contracting Covid-19. Anzac Day is going to look very different tomorrow, from what we have become used to since the Howard years. There will be no flag waving crowds, or thumping displays of nationalism. There will be commemorations and quiet reflections. And, of course, biscuits. The only answer here is chewy. Obviously. Unless you like bad biscuits. In which case, I cannot help you. Of all the sport hub ideas for a post-restrictions Australia, this really seems like a no-brainer: (via AAP) Fremantle coach Justin Longmuir has backed a Victorian push to host a quarantine hub in a bid to restart the AFL season. All states and territories are being considered by the AFL to set-up a hub to ensure the competition resumes amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The AFL is weighing up whether to put together one hub for all 18 clubs, or spreading teams across Australia in multiple locations. Most states, including Western Australia through premier Mark McGowan, have already declared their interest in setting up a hub. But first-year Dockers mentor Longmuir believes Victoria would have an advantage over his home state with 14 days of quarantine required for anyone entering Western Australia. Travel restrictions between states are not in place for Victoria and NSW. In the meantime, I will continue to wish for NRL island to be a thing. Maybe forever. All signs point to schools resuming on-site learning by mid-May: Back on the carbon price, because it is something you are going to hear a lot about in coming months. Don\u2019t expect the final term to include the words \u201ccarbon price\u201d. Anthony Albanese, in his interview with the ABC, said the market had moved beyond what the Gillard-Rudd government had promoted: What I\u2019m saying is that you did need a price signal a decade ago. There has been a change now so that renewables are not just competitive, they are, in fact, the cheapest form of new energy production. And in terms of what you have seen is a bizarre circumstance where by the government have been talking about subsidising a new coal-fired power station in north Queensland and indeed have made a substantial contribution for a company to study themselves whether their project is viable or not. That shows the way that the market itself has changed. The government hasn\u2019t changed its rhetoric, and they need to do so. They need to listen to the science and acknowledge that we do need to act on climate change. We need to drive down our emissions and there are, indeed, advantages for employment in doing that. It is good environmental policy, but it is also good economic policy. While we are talking about the future, Mathias Cormann spoke to Laura Jayes this morning on Sky and repeated what Scott Morrison has been saying \u2013 higher taxes are not on the Coalition\u2019s agenda. So everything is on the table, except that. But in the way things go in Australian politics, we are, of course, talking about ideas which had been dismissed, by one side of politics or the other, for no other reason than a different side of politics once suggested it or tried to enact it. One being, a carbon price. Which Labor is in support of. As are the unions. As are the main business lobby groups. But which the Coalition was very much not in support of. But that could be changing, because it is popping up quite a bit lately, and that is actually a good thing, because maybe, just maybe, there could be a grown up discussion on the issue. Anthony Albanese was also asked about that this morning: One of the things that has happened over recent times of course is that the cost of energy, the cheapest form, is new renewables. What it needs is a government that is prepared to provide certainty in terms of the energy market and providing a policy framework that will drive that investment. We\u2019ve seen investment in 2019 fall off the cliff for renewables but we also need to look at the way that renewables and clean energy can drive advance manufacturing, can add to our industrial growth with new industries and new energy sources such as hydrogen as well can play an important role. There has been a lot of talk lately about whether or not the new bipartisanship and openness to ideas we have been seeing over the last six weeks will extend to a post-Covid Australia, at least politically. Part of it will have to \u2013 the economy is not going to look anything like it has, and pulling Australia through the next years is not going to be easy. Or pretty. But this is Australian politics, so I don\u2019t think anyone is overly hopeful. Anthony Albanese gave his opinions on that this morning, when speaking to the ABC: I would hope that some of the government\u2019s rhetorical changes last beyond the current crisis. They\u2019ve acknowledged that unions play a constructive role in society rather than their previous concentration on attacking the rights of working people and the trade union movement. They have acknowledged that we need to listen to the science and I hope that that translates into other issues beyond medical science, into environmental science, into listening to what the scientists are telling us about the need to act on climate change, and they have acknowledged there is a role for government in providing support for the private sector to operate. We certainly will need a strengthening of the private sector coming out of this crisis but we will also need to acknowledge the vital role the government plays, the contracting out, for example, of Centrelink services meant that we weren\u2019t in a position to actually look after people when it was needed during this crisis. Peter Dutton spoke to the Nine network this morning and said banks that did not pass on bridging finance to businesses which were struggling to pay their staff should be \u201cpublicly shamed\u201d. Australia\u2019s banks have access to some pretty cheap credit at the moment, the idea being that they use those credit lines, which are basically secured by the government, to provide credit lifelines to businesses. Businesses need those credit lines because there was a time gap between when the government\u2019s wage subsidy was announced and when the ATO started paying it out. If you have no one coming in and spending money in your business, you have no way to pay your staff. And round and round it goes. But the banks, which got in massive amounts of trouble in Australia for lending to just about anybody with a pulse and identification not that long ago, are now getting in trouble for not rushing those loans out. Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg held a phone hook-up with the banks yesterday. The morning TV and radio shows will tell you it was a FURIOUS phone call, which means the political spinners can give themselves a pat on the back this morning. Morrison and Frydenberg both spoke about the call yesterday and gave a public warning to the banks to start the credit flowing. This morning it was Dutton\u2019s turn: The banks have got a lot of stepping up to do. There\u2019s been a lot of activity already, where you can point to case where is they have provided significant assistance, but it needs to be more widespread. We want people to remain connected with their businesses. We hope that, over the next few weeks, we can start to see the economy take its first steps back to normality, and that will require the banks to be involved, for credit to be extended, wages need to be paid, and businesses need to be paid, and businesses need to be able to put themselves in a position where they can reopen and re-function. It\u2019s just gone NSW press conference o\u2019clock. Gladys Berejiklian says there were seven new cases in the last 24 hours, but added that the state had increased the amount of testing it was doing. Can I again thank all of you and say the New South Wales government is considering what we can do moving forward to ease everybody\u2019s stress that you are going through and part of that strategy is increasing the number of testing, making that more available to everybody across the state but also making all of us aware that if we do consider going forward in the future with lifting restrictions we also have to be prepared to practice social isolation because we know that cases will go up and people will need hospitals. That is why we have bought ourselves good time in New South Wales and in preparing our health system and other institutions for what the next few months might look like. The Victorian parliament sat to pass its coronavirus legislation yesterday. Its emergency bills passed last night. As AAP reports: The government now plans to borrow $24.5 billion to help the state combat the economic carnage from the virus. The mammoth COVID-19 omnibus also includes temporary changes, including the introduction of judge-alone criminal trials, virtual meetings for state and council politicians, WorkCover extensions and a ban on evictions and rent increases, with a sunset clause of six months. As well, the Victorian government has set up a dedicated taskforce to help keep the state\u2019s building and development industry running through the crisis. It has approved four new projects worth more than $1.5 billion. The state government\u2019s omnibus bill passed with the support of the coalition, despite Opposition Leader Michael O\u2019Brien\u2019s concerns it grants unprecedented powers to the justice system. Karen Andrews was given the job of filling Australia\u2019s manufacturing gaps (there are a lot of them, so it is mostly the most crucial, such as medical PPE which has been the focus) as the government turns towards what broken supply chains would mean for an island nation. There is still no talk of subsidies to reanimate the manufacturing sector in Australia. Instead, there is a lot of talk of \u201cidentifying the gaps\u201d. As you would know, there is no hope of a long-term manufacturing resurgence, without government assistance. That is an issue for another day \u2013 at the moment, Andrews is happy when an Australian company can switch its focus for something the nation needs. The latest? Clets Linen &amp; Co Pty Ltd, which normally specialises in linen and garments for hospitality and other industries, will provide 3,750 disposable isolation gowns to the national medical stockpile in its first production run. Greg Hunt has committed an additional $6m to drug and alcohol addiction support during the pandemic. That includes: \u00b7 $2m to the Alcohol and Drug Foundation to deliver an information and awareness campaign to make Australians aware of the support that is available, and to develop resources specific to the isolation context. \u00b7 $1.5m to Turning Point to scale up treatment episodes provided by Counselling Online, and enable better integration of the service with primary care providers. \u00b7 An additional $1.5m to Hello Sunday Morning\u2019s Daybreak Program. Daybreak is a treatment and early invention mobile app that provides online support to individuals seeking assistance in reducing their alcohol consumption. The service helps Australians reduce risky drinking habits by simultaneously addressing the psychological and relationship issues that can sometimes drive drinking in the first place. \u00b7 $0.4m to SMART Recovery to support adaptation of their service delivery model to an online format. \u00b7 $0.6m to the Matilda Centre to support enhancements to Cracks in the Ice and Positive Choices portals, to target Australians impacted by isolation. Cracks in the ice provides information about crystal methamphetamine for community organisations. Positive Choices is an online portal to help school communities access accurate up-to-date drug education resources and prevention programs. In addition, the National Organisation for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Australia will deliver a Covid-19 Alcohol and Pregnancy campaign addressing increased alcohol consumption leading to unplanned alcohol-exposed pregnancies during the pandemic. The campaign will be implemented largely via social media and target women impacted by Covid-19 restrictions, particularly social isolation and quarantine. The national cabinet will meet today as part of its normal schedule. Australia has just finished the first week of the four-week suppression phase, which I guess would be better described as a holding pattern, so we don\u2019t expect any big changes or announcements from this meeting. Queensland will move to have its changes to funeral restrictions \u2013 from 10 people to 20 \u2013 given the OK by the national cabinet. Scott Morrison will continue to push for schools to be reopen, although that doesn\u2019t look like happening much beyond the fifth or sixth week of term, as the states give parents time to get used to the idea. Basically, everyone is in agreement that if the infection rates stay this low, restrictions can be lifted. But with nations like Singapore, which suppressed the virus only to see a surge when restrictions were lifted, as an example, the national cabinet is taking a softly, softly approach to how it will relax the physical distance rules. The woman speaking here, Sophie, would not be alone. And that is despite Australia\u2019s rates being quite low. As AAP reports: A final-year medical student has been thrown out of her Brisbane share house because a housemate feared she would infect him with coronavirus. The student, identified only as Sophie, has told the ABC she was told to get out because she was on a placement at the Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s hospital. She said one of her housemates had become convinced that she would become infected with the virus and pass it on to him. The student said she picked up on her flatmate\u2019s anxiety and all four housemates sat down to chat about minimising risks, how they\u2019d support each other if any one of them got sick, and how they\u2019d isolate in a shared environment. \u201cI thought the conversation went reasonably well,\u201d she said. \u201cThe next morning I received a message asking me to leave. He said he was sorry things had to be this way, but he was uncomfortable with the risk of me being a medical student and attending placement.\u201d Sophie has since moved in with a friend but says her experience becoming suddenly homeless due to her job in health isn\u2019t rare. \u201cI have friends, personally, who\u2019ve been asked to leave then their landlord has retracted that when it\u2019s become apparent societally that it\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d she said. \u201cOthers have elected to move house to try and isolate themselves from their families if they\u2019re working in a high-risk area, and really struggling to find somewhere to live.\u201d She urged people to consider more than themselves during the coronavirus crisis. \u201cI think we run into trouble when people only consider pandemics and coronavirus in terms of what\u2019s the risk of you giving it to me.\u201d The Ruby Princess has left Port Kembla and the nation is preparing for a very low-key Anzac Day. Other than that, it\u2019s situation stay suppressed as Australia ends another week with a flatter curve. Anzac ceremonies will go virtual this year. Most RSLs have arranged for veterans to pay homage how they can and to ensure there is community support for those who want or need it. Ceremonies will be broadcast for those at home. Winston Peters, the deputy New Zealand prime minister, has been talking about reopening the trans-Tasman borders when possible as a sort of trans-Tasman \u201cbubble\u201d for some time. Yesterday Scott Morrison said it was New Zealand that Australia was looking to \u201creconnect\u201d with as soon as possible. The leaders of both nations have been speaking every week, as usual, with both optimistic their countries can manage to suppress \u2013 or in NZ\u2019s case, almost eliminate \u2013 Covid-19 from their populations ahead of a vaccine. Which means Australia is heading into the \u201csentinel\u201d testing phase \u2013 testing people to ensure that the virus hasn\u2019t spread to more of the community than anticipated. NSW is now opening testing to anyone with symptoms, not just those in the cluster areas. One in 70 people in Victoria are being tested as that state ramps up its procedures as well. We\u2019ll cover all of the day as it happens. Thank you again for joining us. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day. Ready?",

      "body": "<p>Two doctors are launching a legal challenge over government guidance on personal protective equipment which they say exposes them to coronavirus infections.</p> \n<p>Dr Meenal Viz and Dr Nishant Joshi, who are married and expecting their first child, argue the NHS recommendations breach international standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO) as well as domestic legislation on health and safety at work.</p> \n<p>Last week, the NHS asked doctors and nurses to work <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/nhs-staff-to-be-asked-to-treat-coronavirus-patients-without-gowns\">without protective full-length gowns</a> when treating Covid-19 patients, as hospitals came within hours of running out of supplies.</p> \n<p>Dr Viz is a clinical fellow in medicine and Dr Joshi a GP trainee. Both are employed by the NHS and have been working with patients suffering from Covid-19.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There is mounting concern over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/10/uk-coronavirus-deaths-bame-doctors-bma\">the heightened vulnerability</a> of black, Asian and minority ethnic people to Covid-19. The first 10 doctors in the UK named as having died from the virus were all BAME.</p> \n<p>Viz and Joshi said as part of the challenge: \u201cWe are doctors, we are nurses and we are healthcare workers \u2013 we will be there for you in your time of need. We will be there for your family. The government needs to protect us, so that we can protect you.\u201d</p> \n<p>Basmah Sahib, a solicitor at the London law firm Bindmans, who is acting for the couple, has sent Public Health England and the Department of Health and Social Care a formal letter before action seeking a response by next Monday.</p> \n<p>The challenge is against official guidance introduced on 17 April that permitted medical staff to wear flimsy plastic aprons with coveralls when full-length gowns run out.</p> \n<p>The challenge says healthcare workers are being exposed to a greater risk of contracting Covid-19 and maintains that the guidance fails to address the heightened risks faced by BAME healthcare workers.</p> \n<p>The letter also argues the guidance is unclear, has resulted in inconsistent practices across NHS trusts and fails to make clear that healthcare workers have a right to refuse to work without adequate PPE.</p> \n<p>Joshi and Viz added: \u201cIt is the government\u2019s duty to protect its healthcare workers, and there is great anxiety amongst staff with regards to safety protocols that seem to change without rhyme or reason. Every time a healthcare worker becomes hospitalised with Covid-19, it exacts an extraordinary toll on our friends, family and colleagues.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo sedate and ventilate your own colleague takes a mental toll on the entire workforce. The government owes an apology to these bereaved families, many of whom were unable to be with their loved ones in their dying moments.\u201d</p> \n<p>Joshi told the Guardian he hoped his challenge would not have to go to court. He welcomed the latest comments from the health secretary, Matt Hancock, as a first acknowledgment that \u201cthe guidelines are based on resources. There was a shortage [of PPE] and the government has not been transparent about why they engaged British manufacturers.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said he had been contacted by doctors from around the country \u201cwho have been trying to raise concerns [about the lack of PPE] because they feel intimidated by managers in their own NHS trusts.\u201d He said he had talked to an NHS cleaner who felt compelled to work even though she felt unprotected.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have lost count of the number of colleagues who have gone off sick through confirmed or suspected coronavirus. Some have become very unwell and some have ended up in hospital \u2026 Doctors don\u2019t want to go into hpspital [as patients]. There\u2019s an embarrassment of being treated colleagues and they don\u2019t to show [what hey think is] weakeness.\u201d</p> \n<p>Public Heath England said: \u201cThe safety of those working on the frontline in health and social care is our number one priority. The UK guidance, written with NHS leaders and agreed by all four chief medical officers, in consultation with royal and medical colleges, recommends the safest level of personal protective equipment .

      "bodyText": "Two doctors are launching a legal challenge over government guidance on personal protective equipment which they say exposes them to coronavirus infections. Dr Meenal Viz and Dr Nishant Joshi, who are married and expecting their first child, argue the NHS recommendations breach international standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO) as well as domestic legislation on health and safety at work. Last week, the NHS asked doctors and nurses to work without protective full-length gowns when treating Covid-19 patients, as hospitals came within hours of running out of supplies. Dr Viz is a clinical fellow in medicine and Dr Joshi a GP trainee. Both are employed by the NHS and have been working with patients suffering from Covid-19. There is mounting concern over the heightened vulnerability of black, Asian and minority ethnic people to Covid-19. The first 10 doctors in the UK named as having died from the virus were all BAME. Viz and Joshi said as part of the challenge: \u201cWe are doctors, we are nurses and we are healthcare workers \u2013 we will be there for you in your time of need. We will be there for your family. The government needs to protect us, so that we can protect you.\u201d Basmah Sahib, a solicitor at the London law firm Bindmans, who is acting for the couple, has sent Public Health England and the Department of Health and Social Care a formal letter before action seeking a response by next Monday. The challenge is against official guidance introduced on 17 April that permitted medical staff to wear flimsy plastic aprons with coveralls when full-length gowns run out. The challenge says healthcare workers are being exposed to a greater risk of contracting Covid-19 and maintains that the guidance fails to address the heightened risks faced by BAME healthcare workers. The letter also argues the guidance is unclear, has resulted in inconsistent practices across NHS trusts and fails to make clear that healthcare workers have a right to refuse to work without adequate PPE. Joshi and Viz added: \u201cIt is the government\u2019s duty to protect its healthcare workers, and there is great anxiety amongst staff with regards to safety protocols that seem to change without rhyme or reason. Every time a healthcare worker becomes hospitalised with Covid-19, it exacts an extraordinary toll on our friends, family and colleagues. \u201cTo sedate and ventilate your own colleague takes a mental toll on the entire workforce. The government owes an apology to these bereaved families, many of whom were unable to be with their loved ones in their dying moments.\u201d Joshi told the Guardian he hoped his challenge would not have to go to court. He welcomed the latest comments from the health secretary, Matt Hancock, as a first acknowledgment that \u201cthe guidelines are based on resources. There was a shortage [of PPE] and the government has not been transparent about why they engaged British manufacturers.\u201d He said he had been contacted by doctors from around the country \u201cwho have been trying to raise concerns [about the lack of PPE] because they feel intimidated by managers in their own NHS trusts.\u201d He said he had talked to an NHS cleaner who felt compelled to work even though she felt unprotected. \u201cI have lost count of the number of colleagues who have gone off sick through confirmed or suspected coronavirus. Some have become very unwell and some have ended up in hospital \u2026 Doctors don\u2019t want to go into hpspital [as patients]. There\u2019s an embarrassment of being treated colleagues and they don\u2019t to show [what hey think is] weakeness.\u201d Public Heath England said: \u201cThe safety of those working on the frontline in health and social care is our number one priority. The UK guidance, written with NHS leaders and agreed by all four chief medical officers, in consultation with royal and medical colleges, recommends the safest level of personal protective equipment . The WHO has confirmed that UK guidance is consistent with what it recommends for the highest risk procedures.\u201d Sahib said: \u201cThe NHS is the UK\u2019s biggest employer. Almost all of us have a friend or loved one who is putting their life at risk to care for Covid-19 patients. \u201cThe least they deserve is honesty, clear guidance and proper support from the secretary of state to feel safe and protected at work.\u201d The Department for Health has been asked for comment.",

Such cuts are often anathema to the left, but Amlo has cast what he dubs \u201crepublican austerity\u201d as a cornerstone of his political project. \u201cHe\u2019s Mr Scrooge. Not because he\u2019s in the cellar counting coins, but because his first instinct in a tight spot seems to be: slash spending,\u201d said Federico Est\u00e9vez, political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. \u201cFor L\u00f3pez Obrador honest public figures are those living frugally,\u201d said Fernando Dworak, independent political analyst in Mexico City. Now, Amlo\u2019s project has collided with coronavirus. Mexico has confirmed 11,633 Covid-19 cases and 1,069 deaths \u2013 although the country\u2019s health officials admit the true number is much higher. The pandemic could not have come at a worse moment: Mexico\u2019s economy stagnated in 2019 and was already projected to contract in 2020. In response, Amlo has proposed loans for households and business. He also promised to boost social programs and push forward pension payments. In an analysis published on Tuesday, Oxfam Mexico expressed skepticism, saying the social programs Amlo plans to repurpose to help those affected by the Covid-19 crisis \u201care not designed to support that many people in poverty at this time\u201d. Amlo has rejected pleas to mitigate the economic impact of coronavirus with business tax relief or rescue packages, recalling Mexico\u2019s unhappy history of private sector and banking bailouts. He also discarded raising taxes or extra borrowing, calling the crisis \u201ctransitory\u201d. \u201cThe economic recovery plan doesn\u2019t fit the neoliberal model,\u201d Amlo said earlier this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve now broken the mould that was used of applying so-called countercyclical measures, which only deepen inequality and encourage corruption that benefits a few.\u201d In response to the crisis, Amlo has promised to create an additional 2m jobs \u2013 although how he will do that remains unclear \u2013 and has pledged to provide 25,000 pesos ($1,000) in credit for business owners in the informal economy. With a Trumpian flourish, letters to beneficiaries will bear his signature.",

The mayor, Joe Anderson, has commissioned the city\u2019s new public health director, Matthew Ashton, to see if there is any connection after a number of deaths were blamed on the 11 March match between Liverpool and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. The match was attended by 52,000 people, including 3,000 from Madrid, at a time when Spain was already in partial lockdown.

This match took place within clear Public Health England guidance at the time.\u201d Boris Johnson is facing continued criticism for not acting sooner to ban large public gatherings, including football matches, concerts and the Cheltenham horse racing festival. Gloucestershire Live reported claims that leaked data showed that an area neighbouring Cheltenham racecourse had the highest number of coronavirus hospital admissions in the region earlier this month. Anderson told the Liverpool Echo: \u201cI said at the time that the fact that the Madrid fans were unable to attend matches in their home city but could travel to a game in Liverpool was absurd, but the government and Uefa decided the game should go ahead. \u201cWe now want to find out what impact that had in the city.\u201d The mayor of Madrid, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida, said recently that it was a mistake and \u201cdidn\u2019t make any sense\u201d to allow thousands of Atl\u00e9tico fans to attend given the high infection rate in Spain. The latest figures show that 246 people have died from coronavirus in Liverpool\u2019s NHS hospitals. A report on Gloucestershire Live claimed that leaked official data shows the GL52 postcode, which covers areas of north Cheltenham including Pittville, Prestbury and Bishop\u2019s Cleeve, had 27 confirmed hospital admissions of the virus as of 3 April, the highest amount in the county. The data was leaked to the Local Democracy Reporting Service which noted that Gloucestershire was currently the \u201cmost affected county in the least affected region in Great Britain, the south-west, with 989 cases of the virus and 147 deaths in the county as of April 22\u201d. The affected postcode is the one nearest to the racecourse, which is in the centre of the town, and is also one of the more densely populated areas. The government\u2019s deputy chief scientific adviser Angela McLean said recently that it was an \u201cinteresting hypothesis\u201d to suggest a link between the two events and local coronavirus infections. More than 250,000 went to the Cheltenham event between 10 March and 13 March and several high-profile attendees have said they believe they contracted coronavirus, including the Duchess of Cornwall\u2019s ex-husband, Andrew Parker Bowles, the comedian Lee Mack, and Charlie Brooks, a racehorse trainer and husband of News UK\u2019s Rebekah Brooks. The Jockey Club, which organises the event, has rejected suggestions it should have been cancelled and said it had followed public health advice and \u201cwent ahead under government guidance\u201d. Scientists say it will be difficult now to get the data to investigate a causal link between the festival and coronavirus cases but population surveys could assist. Andrew Preston, a reader in microbial pathogenesis from the Milner centre for evolution at the University of Bath, said the lack of community testing and tracing meant it may never be possible to know whether Cheltenham contributed to the spread of Covid-19. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cThere are many factors that could influence the number of cases in a particular area, including population density, age and health profile, and the position of an area on the pandemic curve.

Reports suggest that the advice will be a compromise, with the public allowed to choose to wear scarves or face-coverings rather than medical-grade masks. So why has there been such a divergence on this issue?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/can-a-face-mask-protect-me-from-coronavirus-covid-19-myths-busted\">Can a face mask protect me from coronavirus? Covid-19 myths busted</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most of us would probably ask how well a mask, especially a one made from cloth, may protect us from Covid-19. But the notion of \u201cpersonal protection\u201d misses the major reason why calls for increased use of masks and face-coverings have gained momentum around the world. From February, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5\">data was emerging</a> that, unlike Sars \u2013 where patients were most contagious several days after showing severe symptoms \u2013 people infected by Sars-Cov-2, the cause of Covid-19, were \u201cshedding\u201d most viruses (that could infect someone else)<strong> </strong>just before or at the time symptoms first appeared, often in very mild form. This had two implications: first, efforts to \u201ccontain\u201d coronavirus would be orders of magnitude more difficult than for Sars. Second, and as it has turned out more contentiously, the official World Health Organization and UK government advice that masks should only be worn by members of the public showing symptoms, and members of their immediate households, is probably wrong.</p> <p>In the field of infectious diseases, stopping a contagious patient infecting others is known as source control. For respiratory infections, source control would include wearing a mask when not under isolation. By advising symptomatic individuals to wear a mask, the government was advocating source control. But what if symptomatic individuals were only half the story? When people have been systematically tested for Covid-19, be it <a href=\"https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.2000180\">passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship</a> or <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2009316\">women about to give birth in New York</a>, the number of individuals who test positive but display no symptoms is about half the total number of those who test positive (the range is 20-90%, but most agree it\u2019s 40-60%).</p> <p>So can completely \u201cwell\u201d people transmit Covid-19? We know that even <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2007800\">normal speech can spread droplets</a>, and this is dramatically reduced by the use of cloth masks. And for symptomatic people infected with common-cold coronaviruses and <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/115/5/1081\">influenza</a>, normal breathing also results in shedding of virus, which again, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2\">is blocked</a> by wearing a mask. While we don\u2019t know for sure how contagious a truly asymptomatic Covid-19 patient might be, <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-16-testing\">evidence</a> <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/09/science.abb6936\">suggests</a> that around 40% of cases of transmission arise from people without symptoms.</p> <p>So what are the objections that have been raised against masks in public as policy? There have been repeated statements that the evidence in favour of masks is flimsy and ambiguous. For medics, the \u201cgold standard\u201d of evidence is the randomised controlled trial (some people take the medicine or undergo the intervention, and some don\u2019t, and we look to see if there were benefits or risks). There have been a few trials looking at masks for preventing influenza, and results were disappointing \u2013 although crucially, most of the group meant to wear masks actually didn\u2019t: it turns out we\u2019re just not that scared of catching the flu.</p> <p>But if one looks at the same level of evidence for the other measures strongly advocated by the government, for example hand-washing, studies have been similarly disappointing. And for other advice, such as the two-metre rule, or lockdowns, there have been no trials at all. So masks seem subject to a different standard of evidence than other measures. And while controlled trial data is not available, \u201cnatural experiments\u201d do suggest at least a correlation between mask-wearing and reduced Covid-19 transmission. The city of Jena in Germany introduced mandatory mask-wearing on 31 March and <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/17/no-new-infections-german-city-impose-facemasks/\">recorded no new infections for eight days</a>, while surrounding cities continued to see a rise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/24/uk-coronavirus-live-warning-mass-vaccinations-covid-19-latest-updates\">UK coronavirus live: officials apologise after key workers denied tests on day one of Hancock scheme</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other objections include claims that wearing a mask increases other risky behaviours, such as a relaxed attitude to distancing (comparable to the idea that dangerous driving would increase when seatbelts became law), or that contaminated masks will increase rather than decrease infections.

      "body": "<p>The stakes could hardly be higher; the prize still tantalisingly out of reach. It is no exaggeration to say that the fate of many millions of people rests on the discovery of a vaccine for Covid-19 \u2013 the only sure escape route from the pandemic.</p> <p>Yet the optimism that accompanied the launch of Oxford University\u2019s human trials this week has to be put in context, and the hurdles facing the scientists need to be understood.</p> <p>The vaccine hunters are trying to outwit an invisible enemy so small that a million viral particles could fit inside a human cell, but whose biological ingenuity has brought everyday life to a standstill.</p> <p>So what is the path to success?</p> <h2><strong>How vaccines train our immune system</strong></h2> <p>Traditional vaccines work by creating a weakened version of a virus, similar enough to the original that the immune system will be forearmed if the person is exposed to a full infection in future, helping prevent actual illness.</p> <p>The approach has led to some of our best vaccines, but is also fundamentally risky because there is always a chance that a newly developed attenuated virus won\u2019t be as innocuous as hoped. Clinical trials have to be approached cautiously and slowly \u2013 especially when there are no effective treatments for a disease.</p> <p>A slow approach is not ideal in a pandemic.</p> <p>So it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that only <em>two</em> of the 76 vaccine candidates that the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/novel-coronavirus-landscape-ncov.pdf\">has on its radar</a> have opted for this traditional approach.</p> <p>The rest rely on the fast-track idea that the immune system doesn\u2019t need to see the entire virus to generate the ammunition to fight it off in the future. If the virus is the warship, the theory is that the immune system needs only to see the enemy flag to form an indelible immune memory. In the case of Covid-19, this flag takes the form of prominent protrusions, known as spike proteins, that form a halo or \u201ccorona\u201d around the virus.</p> <p>Advances in genetic engineering have given full flight to scientists\u2019 creativity in developing this defence.</p> <p>Teams around the world have moved at unprecedented pace, going from having the genetic sequence for the spike protein in January to vaccine candidates a matter of weeks later.</p> <p>But many of these technologies are unproven and the success of any trial is far from guaranteed, as this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/high-hopes-drug-for-covid-19-treatment-failed-in-full-trial\">disappointing results for the drug remdesivir show</a>. Ethical questions need to be navigated to ensure the safety of volunteers.</p> <p>And then, potentially the most contentious question of all: if a vaccine is found, who gets it first?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb4796d83bcae0988f754cbedcae7fea5b48bb0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb4796d83bcae0988f754cbedcae7fea5b48bb0f/0_144_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scientist Xinhua Yan works in the lab at Moderna in Cambridge, MA.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scientist Xinhua Yan works in the lab at Moderna in Cambridge, MA.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boston Globe/Boston Globe via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The frontrunners</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/first-participant-us-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-moderna-dose\">First into clinical trials</a>, just eight weeks after the genetic sequence for Covid-19 was published in January, was the US biotech company Moderna, with its RNA vaccine.</p> <p>RNA is a single-stranded messenger molecule that normally delivers genetic instructions from DNA, coiled up inside the nuclei of cells, to the cell\u2019s protein-making factories outside the nucleus.</p> <p>In this case, the RNA instructs the muscle cells to start churning out the harmless spike protein as a warning to the immune system. Imperial College London\u2019s team, this week backed by \u00a322.5m government funding, is also developing an RNA vaccine, but in a form that hasn\u2019t been tested before in people.</p> <p>\u201cSome groups have skipped animal studies because their technology has been used in human studies,\u201d said Prof Robin Shattock, who is leading the Imperial team. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that luxury. It\u2019s probably cost us one or two months, but it\u2019s much better to be cautious and be sure you\u2019ve got something that\u2019s really safe.\u201d</p> <p>Also testing their candidates in human trials are the Chinese vaccine company CanSino Biologics, and a team at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/19/uk-drive-develop-coronavirus-vaccine-science\">Oxford University</a> led by Prof Sarah Gilbert.</p> <p>Both are using harmless viruses that have been disabled so that they don\u2019t replicate once they get inside cells. These delivery vehicles are known as \u201cnon-replicating viral vectors\u201d.</p> <p>These teams had already tried and tested the approach for other diseases, such as Ebola, and had flasks of their vectors sitting in freezers, ready to go. </p> <p>A third approach is that of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/a-second-potential-covid-19-vaccine-backed-by-bill-and-melinda-gates-is-entering-human-testing/\">US biotech company</a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/a-second-potential-covid-19-vaccine-backed-by-bill-and-melinda-gates-is-entering-human-testing/\"> Inovio</a>, a firm that has existed for four decades without developing an approved product, but whose stock soared after it started its trial earlier this month.</p> <p>Its vaccine uses DNA to carry instructions for making the spike protein into cells, which gets transcribed into messenger RNA, which then orders the protein factories to start pumping out the enemy spike protein.</p> <p>This might seem an unnecessarily elaborate cascade, but some think that getting the enemy flag inside cells and not just into the bloodstream could be important .</p> <p>\u201cClearly it is true that there are no approved RNA or DNA vaccines on the market today,\u201d said Joseph Kim, Inovio\u2019s CEO. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, a fourth strategy simply manufactures massive supplies of the spike protein itself, and injects a dose directly into people.</p> <p>This is what the big pharma team-up of Sanofi and GSK are betting on. Sanofi is repurposing a vaccine candidate that was developed for Sars in the early 2000s, while GSK is providing an ingredient, known as an adjuvant, that boosts the immune response, which has also been tried and tested.</p> <p>It\u2019s too early to say which option looks the most promising, according to Richard Hatchett, chief executive officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is funding the development and testing of eight candidates.</p> <p>\u201cSome vaccines are going to be very fast to clinic, others have tremendous potential to scale up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the challenge that we face is that there\u2019s going to be a great deal of urgency and pressure to roll out vaccines quickly for obvious reasons. You\u2019re talking about giving a medical product to someone who is well.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What are the odds they\u2019ll work?</strong></h2> <p>A few candidates will be filtered out in toxicology testing in animals. Others might fail because phase one trials in people produce unexpected side effects.</p> <p>There is a chance none of them will work.</p> <p>For some illnesses, including other circulating coronaviruses, the immune system wages its battle, then a few months later forgets it ever happened. Others, like chicken pox or mumps, trigger lifelong immunity.</p> <p>The truth is we\u2019re not yet sure where on this spectrum Covid-19 lies.</p> <p>\u201cReasonable guesses are that there might be partial protection for close to a year,\u201d according to Marcus Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard, whose team recently predicted that, in the absence of a vaccine, social distancing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-distancing-continue-until-2022-lockdown-pandemic\">may need to continue until 2022</a>. \u201cOn the long end, it might be several years of good protection. It\u2019s really speculative at this point.\u201d</p> <p>On the positive side, Covid-19 appears quite stable genetically, meaning that the spike protein that vaccines are built around should still look the same next winter.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t the case for flu, which shuffles its genes around so rapidly that new vaccines are needed each year.</p> <p>There are also questions around the type of immunity required.</p> <p>The body overcomes illness through antibodies, which see off the virus itself, and killer T-cells, which eliminate cells already infected by the foreign invader. For some illnesses, antibodies do the heavy lifting, but the balance varies depending on pathogen and even across people.</p> <p>\u201cAn ideal vaccine should generate a response in both arms of the immune system - antibodies and T cells,\u201d said Kim. He predicts this could be a weakness of RNA and protein vaccines, which are delivered outside of cells, meaning that killer T-cells are not likely to be recruited.</p> <p>There is also a chance that some trials could grind to a halt, simply because the pandemic has been so well controlled by lockdowns and other measures. \u201cYou need a certain hit rate in the population you\u2019re vaccinating to get the statistics to show your vaccine is having protective ability,\u201d said Miles Carroll, head of research at Public Health England\u2019s National Infection Service at Porton Down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc99c90aad2dd10402feba15b556c9d85f4162fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc99c90aad2dd10402feba15b556c9d85f4162fc/0_172_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson visits a laboratory at the Public Health England National Infection Service in London in early March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson visits a laboratory at the Public Health England National Infection Service in early March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The possibility of \u201cchallenge trials\u201d, in which people are deliberately infected, have been considered, but there are obvious ethical issues with exposing volunteers to a potentially deadly disease. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest in this \u2026 because it would really accelerate vaccine development, but there are some major hurdles to ensure the safety of the volunteers in that setting,\u201d said Prof Andrew Pollard, chief investigator on the Oxford study.</p> <h2><strong>Scaling-up</strong></h2> <p>Vaccine manufacturers talk in terms of yield: how many doses of vaccine do you get out per litre of culture. And there could be significant differences in the ability of teams to produce the number of doses required to make a difference.</p> <p>Shattock believes this will be a strength of Imperial\u2019s RNA vaccine candidate, which has the unique feature of replicating itself thousands of times once inside the body.</p> <p>\u201cWe can make the equivalent of a million doses within a litre of material,\u201d said Shattock. \u201cMany other vaccines would need hundreds or thousands of litres for that. It\u2019s the scalability. Towards the end of the year we\u2019ll be hoping to make tens of millions of doses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf our vaccine were shown to be successful, if everything goes well \u2013 and that\u2019s still a big if \u2013 we could deploy it in the UK this winter,\u201d said Shattock. \u201cAll these smaller approaches will hold the fort until a larger global solution comes.\u201d</p> <p>By September there could be a vaccine \u2013 maybe several \u2013 that appear broadly safe and effective.</p> <p>That\u2019s not enough to get a vaccine licensed, but governments are already talking about the potential for rolling out such candidates to high-risk groups, potentially including millions of health workers, under \u201cemergency use\u201d rules in the absence of this ultimate seal of approval.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>There are precedents for this \u2013 in the 2018 Ebola outbreak, more than 200,000 people in Democratic Republic of Congo received the Merck vaccine before it was licensed in 2019.</p> <p>\u201cThat might be enough if you are an intensive care nurse or living in an old people\u2019s home, to say that for you, because you have the most to gain from being vaccinated, the risk-benefit balance is favourable,\u201d said Sandy Douglas, an Oxford vaccine researcher.</p> <p>But very rare side-effects cannot be ruled out. And there have been vaccine calamities in the past \u2013 recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/10/boy-wins-120000-damages-narcolepsy-swine-flu-vaccine-glaxosmithkline\">the GSK vaccine Pandemrix</a>, given to millions during the swine flu pandemic of 2009, which was linked to narcolepsy in one in every 55,000 jabs.</p> <p>The principle of transparent informed consent will be critical, Douglas added. \u201cIn this case, that would include the fact that if you\u2019re being offered a vaccine in October that didn\u2019t exist in April, there will not yet be long-term safety follow-up experience, although we do have longer term experience with several similar vaccines.\u201d</p> <p>Individuals could be faced with tough choices \u2013 take an experimental vaccine or leave themselves at risk of infection.</p> <h2><strong>Global solution</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfb868265e8e7689732af72e9fa16782da3b1041\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfb868265e8e7689732af72e9fa16782da3b1041/0_224_3582_2149/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman in Tokyo wearing a mask to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman in Tokyo wearing a mask to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eugene Hoshiko/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the moment, many teams are trying all sorts of ways to develop a vaccine, but there is no coherent solution for the whole planet. Some are banking on big pharma swooping in with a blockbuster product. Sanofi and GSK, as a joint force, are unique in having the ability to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses without relying on external support.</p> <p>But multinationals are not built for speed and their reputations depend on absolute safety, so there is no prospect of this team making its vaccine widely available before mid to late-2021.</p> <p>Others urge a unified approach; governments, the UN, the World Bank and the WHO need to agree a way forward before a lead candidate emerges.</p> <p>National governments are already making advance purchase agreements and looking to secure their own supply chains.</p> <p>\u201cIf vaccine nationalism asserts itself, you could end up having a limitation of a vaccine to one specific population,\u201d said Hatchett. \u201cIt\u2019s an understandable response of a leader who is elected by a particular population to protect that population. [But] you can\u2019t protect your people and your economy until the global pandemic is brought under control. We really can\u2019t deal with this one country at a time.\u201d</p> <p>Hatchett and others are arguing for a global commitment of tens of billions of dollars to ensure that any successful vaccine is distributed globally and according to need. \u201cIn global health terms that\u2019s a very big number,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if your point of reference is the global impact that this pandemic is having on the economy, then that\u2019s a very small number. If you buy into the idea that the vaccine is the escape route from the pandemic then that\u2019s a really good investment.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 April 2020 to clarify that RNA delivers genetic instructions from DNA within the cell, rather than outside the cell as originally suggested in \u201cThe frontrunners\u201d section.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The stakes could hardly be higher; the prize still tantalisingly out of reach. It is no exaggeration to say that the fate of many millions of people rests on the discovery of a vaccine for Covid-19 \u2013 the only sure escape route from the pandemic. Yet the optimism that accompanied the launch of Oxford University\u2019s human trials this week has to be put in context, and the hurdles facing the scientists need to be understood. The vaccine hunters are trying to outwit an invisible enemy so small that a million viral particles could fit inside a human cell, but whose biological ingenuity has brought everyday life to a standstill. So what is the path to success? How vaccines train our immune system Traditional vaccines work by creating a weakened version of a virus, similar enough to the original that the immune system will be forearmed if the person is exposed to a full infection in future, helping prevent actual illness. The approach has led to some of our best vaccines, but is also fundamentally risky because there is always a chance that a newly developed attenuated virus won\u2019t be as innocuous as hoped. Clinical trials have to be approached cautiously and slowly \u2013 especially when there are no effective treatments for a disease. A slow approach is not ideal in a pandemic. So it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that only two of the 76 vaccine candidates that the World Health Organization has on its radar have opted for this traditional approach. The rest rely on the fast-track idea that the immune system doesn\u2019t need to see the entire virus to generate the ammunition to fight it off in the future. If the virus is the warship, the theory is that the immune system needs only to see the enemy flag to form an indelible immune memory. In the case of Covid-19, this flag takes the form of prominent protrusions, known as spike proteins, that form a halo or \u201ccorona\u201d around the virus. Advances in genetic engineering have given full flight to scientists\u2019 creativity in developing this defence. Teams around the world have moved at unprecedented pace, going from having the genetic sequence for the spike protein in January to vaccine candidates a matter of weeks later. But many of these technologies are unproven and the success of any trial is far from guaranteed, as this week\u2019s disappointing results for the drug remdesivir show. Ethical questions need to be navigated to ensure the safety of volunteers. And then, potentially the most contentious question of all: if a vaccine is found, who gets it first? The frontrunners First into clinical trials, just eight weeks after the genetic sequence for Covid-19 was published in January, was the US biotech company Moderna, with its RNA vaccine. RNA is a single-stranded messenger molecule that normally delivers genetic instructions from DNA, coiled up inside the nuclei of cells, to the cell\u2019s protein-making factories outside the nucleus. In this case, the RNA instructs the muscle cells to start churning out the harmless spike protein as a warning to the immune system. Imperial College London\u2019s team, this week backed by \u00a322.5m government funding, is also developing an RNA vaccine, but in a form that hasn\u2019t been tested before in people. \u201cSome groups have skipped animal studies because their technology has been used in human studies,\u201d said Prof Robin Shattock, who is leading the Imperial team. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that luxury. It\u2019s probably cost us one or two months, but it\u2019s much better to be cautious and be sure you\u2019ve got something that\u2019s really safe.\u201d Also testing their candidates in human trials are the Chinese vaccine company CanSino Biologics, and a team at Oxford University led by Prof Sarah Gilbert. Both are using harmless viruses that have been disabled so that they don\u2019t replicate once they get inside cells. These delivery vehicles are known as \u201cnon-replicating viral vectors\u201d. These teams had already tried and tested the approach for other diseases, such as Ebola, and had flasks of their vectors sitting in freezers, ready to go. A third approach is that of the US biotech company Inovio, a firm that has existed for four decades without developing an approved product, but whose stock soared after it started its trial earlier this month. Its vaccine uses DNA to carry instructions for making the spike protein into cells, which gets transcribed into messenger RNA, which then orders the protein factories to start pumping out the enemy spike protein. This might seem an unnecessarily elaborate cascade, but some think that getting the enemy flag inside cells and not just into the bloodstream could be important . \u201cClearly it is true that there are no approved RNA or DNA vaccines on the market today,\u201d said Joseph Kim, Inovio\u2019s CEO. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d Finally, a fourth strategy simply manufactures massive supplies of the spike protein itself, and injects a dose directly into people. This is what the big pharma team-up of Sanofi and GSK are betting on. Sanofi is repurposing a vaccine candidate that was developed for Sars in the early 2000s, while GSK is providing an ingredient, known as an adjuvant, that boosts the immune response, which has also been tried and tested. It\u2019s too early to say which option looks the most promising, according to Richard Hatchett, chief executive officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is funding the development and testing of eight candidates. \u201cSome vaccines are going to be very fast to clinic, others have tremendous potential to scale up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the challenge that we face is that there\u2019s going to be a great deal of urgency and pressure to roll out vaccines quickly for obvious reasons. You\u2019re talking about giving a medical product to someone who is well.\u201d What are the odds they\u2019ll work? A few candidates will be filtered out in toxicology testing in animals. Others might fail because phase one trials in people produce unexpected side effects. There is a chance none of them will work. For some illnesses, including other circulating coronaviruses, the immune system wages its battle, then a few months later forgets it ever happened. Others, like chicken pox or mumps, trigger lifelong immunity. The truth is we\u2019re not yet sure where on this spectrum Covid-19 lies. \u201cReasonable guesses are that there might be partial protection for close to a year,\u201d according to Marcus Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard, whose team recently predicted that, in the absence of a vaccine, social distancing may need to continue until 2022. \u201cOn the long end, it might be several years of good protection. It\u2019s really speculative at this point.\u201d On the positive side, Covid-19 appears quite stable genetically, meaning that the spike protein that vaccines are built around should still look the same next winter. This isn\u2019t the case for flu, which shuffles its genes around so rapidly that new vaccines are needed each year. There are also questions around the type of immunity required. The body overcomes illness through antibodies, which see off the virus itself, and killer T-cells, which eliminate cells already infected by the foreign invader. For some illnesses, antibodies do the heavy lifting, but the balance varies depending on pathogen and even across people. \u201cAn ideal vaccine should generate a response in both arms of the immune system - antibodies and T cells,\u201d said Kim. He predicts this could be a weakness of RNA and protein vaccines, which are delivered outside of cells, meaning that killer T-cells are not likely to be recruited. There is also a chance that some trials could grind to a halt, simply because the pandemic has been so well controlled by lockdowns and other measures. \u201cYou need a certain hit rate in the population you\u2019re vaccinating to get the statistics to show your vaccine is having protective ability,\u201d said Miles Carroll, head of research at Public Health England\u2019s National Infection Service at Porton Down. The possibility of \u201cchallenge trials\u201d, in which people are deliberately infected, have been considered, but there are obvious ethical issues with exposing volunteers to a potentially deadly disease. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest in this \u2026 because it would really accelerate vaccine development, but there are some major hurdles to ensure the safety of the volunteers in that setting,\u201d said Prof Andrew Pollard, chief investigator on the Oxford study. Scaling-up Vaccine manufacturers talk in terms of yield: how many doses of vaccine do you get out per litre of culture. And there could be significant differences in the ability of teams to produce the number of doses required to make a difference. Shattock believes this will be a strength of Imperial\u2019s RNA vaccine candidate, which has the unique feature of replicating itself thousands of times once inside the body. \u201cWe can make the equivalent of a million doses within a litre of material,\u201d said Shattock. \u201cMany other vaccines would need hundreds or thousands of litres for that. It\u2019s the scalability. Towards the end of the year we\u2019ll be hoping to make tens of millions of doses.\u201d \u201cIf our vaccine were shown to be successful, if everything goes well \u2013 and that\u2019s still a big if \u2013 we could deploy it in the UK this winter,\u201d said Shattock. \u201cAll these smaller approaches will hold the fort until a larger global solution comes.\u201d By September there could be a vaccine \u2013 maybe several \u2013 that appear broadly safe and effective. That\u2019s not enough to get a vaccine licensed, but governments are already talking about the potential for rolling out such candidates to high-risk groups, potentially including millions of health workers, under \u201cemergency use\u201d rules in the absence of this ultimate seal of approval. There are precedents for this \u2013 in the 2018 Ebola outbreak, more than 200,000 people in Democratic Republic of Congo received the Merck vaccine before it was licensed in 2019. \u201cThat might be enough if you are an intensive care nurse or living in an old people\u2019s home, to say that for you, because you have the most to gain from being vaccinated, the risk-benefit balance is favourable,\u201d said Sandy Douglas, an Oxford vaccine researcher. But very rare side-effects cannot be ruled out. And there have been vaccine calamities in the past \u2013 recently the GSK vaccine Pandemrix, given to millions during the swine flu pandemic of 2009, which was linked to narcolepsy in one in every 55,000 jabs. The principle of transparent informed consent will be critical, Douglas added. \u201cIn this case, that would include the fact that if you\u2019re being offered a vaccine in October that didn\u2019t exist in April, there will not yet be long-term safety follow-up experience, although we do have longer term experience with several similar vaccines.\u201d Individuals could be faced with tough choices \u2013 take an experimental vaccine or leave themselves at risk of infection. Global solution At the moment, many teams are trying all sorts of ways to develop a vaccine, but there is no coherent solution for the whole planet. Some are banking on big pharma swooping in with a blockbuster product. Sanofi and GSK, as a joint force, are unique in having the ability to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses without relying on external support. But multinationals are not built for speed and their reputations depend on absolute safety, so there is no prospect of this team making its vaccine widely available before mid to late-2021. Others urge a unified approach; governments, the UN, the World Bank and the WHO need to agree a way forward before a lead candidate emerges. National governments are already making advance purchase agreements and looking to secure their own supply chains. \u201cIf vaccine nationalism asserts itself, you could end up having a limitation of a vaccine to one specific population,\u201d said Hatchett. \u201cIt\u2019s an understandable response of a leader who is elected by a particular population to protect that population. [But] you can\u2019t protect your people and your economy until the global pandemic is brought under control. We really can\u2019t deal with this one country at a time.\u201d Hatchett and others are arguing for a global commitment of tens of billions of dollars to ensure that any successful vaccine is distributed globally and according to need. \u201cIn global health terms that\u2019s a very big number,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if your point of reference is the global impact that this pandemic is having on the economy, then that\u2019s a very small number. If you buy into the idea that the vaccine is the escape route from the pandemic then that\u2019s a really good investment.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 28 April 2020 to clarify that RNA delivers genetic instructions from DNA within the cell, rather than outside the cell as originally suggested in \u201cThe frontrunners\u201d section.",

      "body": "<p>If you\u2019ve ever been at a festival on a Monday morning and thought it was something that might happen at the end of the world, you might have some sympathy for performers and crew at the Tribal Gathering in Panama. The British-run festival \u2013 which takes place on the country\u2019s northern coast and brings together indigenous peoples with DJs, artists and performers from around the world for cultural exchange and a three-week beach party \u2013 was supposed to end on 16 March. But then came lockdown, in this case enforced by armed police.</p> <p>The festival has now been turned into a makeshift camp, with many of its attendees unable to return home and complaining of insufficient flights and strained discussions with embassies. The UK Foreign Office <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/lockdown-leaves-festivalgoers-stranded-on-beach-with-sewage-problem\">told a Guardian reporter</a> that they were \u201cin regular contact\u201d with festivalgoers, who are scattered between the festival and Panama City.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been camping on a beach for 80 days!\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dfranciscoart/\">Doug Francisco</a>, a circus performer and artist from Bristol. Francisco, who designed and led the Extinction Rebellion red brigades at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/15/thousands-expected-in-london-for-extinction-rebellion-protest\">last year\u2019s protests in London</a>, got to the site at the beginning of February. \u201cWhile the festival was still going on, the police came in and tried to shut it down,\u201d he told me over the phone from the beach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"01a94963bba96a85fab73124d2e4f5661d6000ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01a94963bba96a85fab73124d2e4f5661d6000ef/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Tribal Gathering site.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Tribal Gathering site.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Acosta/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The organisers persuaded the police to allow the festival to finish. After it was over, the battle became how to leave the site. Confused and conflicting orders were given by the authorities, festivalgoers report. A busload of travellers was held for 12 hours near the site and those without confirmed flights were turned back. But many flights had been cancelled. Embassies became involved with mixed results. \u201cThe British embassy sent a bus, but they just took people to the airport,\u201d says Francisco. \u201cThere were no flights and they just left them there. They didn\u2019t sort them out flights or anything. That was when it was all kicking off. I was like, I\u2019m not getting on the bus if I don\u2019t have a flight.\u201d He remained at the festival site, where he has a four-metre bell tent.</p> <p>British festivals such as Glastonbury cancelled, but at Tribal Gathering the show went on, of a sort. About 300 crew, performers and public were still on site days after it was supposed to have ended. \u201cPeople were dealing with it pretty well,\u201d says Francisco. Because they had been quarantined, they were safe from the threat of coronavirus and could avoid the restrictions the rest of the world was enduring. \u201cThis might be the last show on Earth. I did my one-man show the other night to the kitchen crew. We had a drag queen party with cocktails on the beach.\u201d</p> <p>Some of those who managed to leave the festival are still stranded in Panama City. One who got back to the UK was Barry Rees, a tree surgeon from Anglesey. He had gone to Panama to work on the build, turning the wild jungle beach, with its spiders, snakes and rampaging monkeys, into a safe festival site. When it was time to leave, he found his flight had been cancelled. Nevertheless, he managed to get past the armed guards. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I did it,\u201d he told me down the line from north Wales. \u201cI put on my pirate hat, that might have helped.\u201d After borrowing \u00a31,000 from his brother, almost being stranded in Miami and taking four international flights in three days, Rees finally got home. \u201cI was really jetlagged, had diarrhoea, couldn\u2019t really go anywhere. I was thinking, why did I leave paradise? But I didn\u2019t have much money and I didn\u2019t want to be a charity case.\u201d</p> <p>Those who remained got on with the festival takedown, \u201cmore slowly and methodically than usual\u201d, says Francisco. The organisers kept the food deliveries coming long after they were meant to have stopped. \u201cThey looked after everybody at the hell of a cost for food,\u201d says Rees. The festival has <a href=\"https://crackmagazine.net/2020/04/ravers-panama-city-tribal-gathering-festival/\">reportedly</a> taken out a $160,000 loan and is also <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/let039s-get-our-tribes-back-home-safely-and-quickly\">crowdfunding via GoFundMe</a>.</p> <p>\u201cMoving anywhere in the country is complicated \u2013 you need permissions, there\u2019s lots of checkpoints,\u201d says Francisco. \u201cThere\u2019s all this anticipation trying to leave, we\u2019re gonna go, we\u2019re gonna go, and then it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s no flights, we can\u2019t go. Well, OK, I\u2019ll stay here rather than getting stuck in a hostel.\u201d Rees says some of the crew managed to get put up for a month in a mansion, but it had nothing in it, not even tables and chairs, and no internet. \u201cThey were going out of their minds,\u201d he says. Even now, it may be six weeks before anybody can leave Panama.</p> <p>At the festival, a feeling of unreality was persistent. \u201cThere\u2019s a strange sense of this whole coronavirus thing happening that you\u2019re not connected with, which would sound like a dream scenario but is quite weird. And the idea that when we leave here we\u2019re going into a really difficult situation is daunting,\u201d says Francisco. \u201cIt\u2019s weird because the whole world\u2019s gone mental and we\u2019re stuck in the old days. We can still hang out and do stuff together, which is a real luxury, but you feel disconnected from what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f321b021cbc4c4e560e77e9f931e2e27bc773fe2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f321b021cbc4c4e560e77e9f931e2e27bc773fe2/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Panama health worker checks the temperature of an attendee of the Tribal Gathering festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Panama health worker checks the temperature of an attendee of the Tribal Gathering festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Acosta/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And even paradise can wear thin. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna get much sympathy for being trapped on a beach, but it\u2019s quite an intense environment.

The money will be donated to the Burberry Foundation Covid-19 Community Fund, to help support communities struggling with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic by supplying personal protective equipment (PPE) and food banks. \u201cSince the outbreak of Covid-19, our priority has been the safety and wellbeing of our employees, our customers and our communities,\u201d Gobbetti said. \u201cWhile we continue to take mitigating actions to contain our costs and protect our financial position, we are also committed to safeguarding jobs and supporting the relief efforts during this global health emergency.\u201d Burberry has retooled its factory in Castleford, West Yorkshire, from making its famous trench coats into manufacturing PPE for medical and care workers. \u201cWe are also sourcing surgical masks through our supply chain and supplying them to the NHS and charities such as Marie Curie, which provides nursing care for families living with terminal illness in the UK,\u201d the company said. \u201cTo date, we have donated more than 100,000 pieces of PPE.\u201d The group, which warned last month its fourth-quarter sales would be 30% lower because of the pandemic, said it was continuing to look hard at its cost base, reducing spend on non-essential areas. While many UK companies have utilised the government\u2019s furlough scheme, which pays employees 80% of their salary, Burberry said it would not rely on government support in the UK, where more than a third of its workers are based. The workers who cant work are being paid in full by Burberry. The business employs around 10,000 people worldwide. All Burberry\u2019s UK stores are closed as part of the country\u2019s lockdown to stem the spread of the virus.",

In that incident, according to the New York Times, millions of mobile phone and social media accounts were bombarded with fake messages in March, including one saying the Trump administration was about to deploy troops to enforce a lockdown. While Russia and China have been the focus of scrutiny for some of the attacks, others have originated in the US and mirror misinformation and untruths propagated by Donald Trump and some of his most prominent supporters in the US media. The EU report examined material published in nine languages and found that even fact checkers were being fooled by false or highly misleading content that was reaching millions of people on social media. EU officials cited the fact that a third of UK citizens believe that vodka can be used as hand sanitiser as an example of the effectiveness of the disinformation.

The WHO and its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, have been among the main targets for digital attacks since the outbreak began. The attacks have included racial abuse and the publication of cartoons of Tedros, an Ethiopian microbiologist and diplomat, as a dog on a lead being held by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Earlier this month, Tedros said he had been subjected to racism and death threats and said many of the attacks had originated in Taiwan, which has complained of being excluded from critical WHO deliberations. Tedros noted that Taiwan\u2019s foreign ministry had not disassociated itself from the attacks, an observation Taipei rejected as \u201cslander\u201d. The attacks appear to have gathered momentum since Trump began blaming the WHO for the slow US response to the pandemic. First Draft, a nonprofit coalition investigating internet disinformation, carried out an analysis of 15,000 tweets in the week beginning 14 April which used the hashtags #tedrosresign and #tedrosliedpeopledied. About a sixth of a sample of 1,200 accounts contained the tag #maga, associated with Trump supporters. \u201cAround 10% of accounts using hashtags attacking the director general were created in the last six months, the majority of those in 2020,\u201d First Draft said.

So, nights off are the safest option, but what to drink instead?</p> <p>Since I last <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/10/non-alcoholic-drinks-wine-spirits-dry-january-fiona-beckett\">wrote about the subject in January</a>, I\u2019ve still not found an alcohol-free wine I like (the relatively decent Sangre de Toro range in Majestic \u2013 see panel below \u2013 comes closest to it), so it\u2019s all about whatever cocktails you can concoct from what you\u2019ve got available. The most obvious option being a G&amp;T equivalent, assuming you can get the tonic. I tried to make my own from cinchona bark when I was researching my latest book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-to-drink-without-drinking-9780857836151.html\">How to Drink without Drinking</a>, but it was pretty disgusting and also now scarce since it was (questionably) <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/no-cinchona-bark-is-not-a-cure-for-coronavirus-134947\">touted as a cure for coronavirus</a>) Where it was once mildly annoying that products such as <a href=\"https://seedlipdrinks.com/uk/\">Seedlip</a> were much the same price as regular gin, it\u2019s now a cause for quiet fury. It\u2019s ironic, is it not, that alcohol-free spirits are so much dearer than wine? Anyway, <a href=\"https://groceries.asda.com/shelf/drinks/no-low-alcohol/no-low-alcohol-spirits/no-low-alcohol-spirits/669942176\">Asda has the cheapest options</a> at the moment.</p> <p>As I write, fruit juices are still widely available, but I find them a bit viscous and syrupy to drink with food, and there\u2019s only so much OJ you can put up with in self-isolation. The answer, I find, is to dilute it with water or, better still, water kefir (plus a few drops of orange flower water, if you have some). Or use juices to make cocktails such as a sea breeze (pink grapefruit juice, cranberry juice and lime) or the summery \u201ccroquet\u201d I invented for the book: 50ml each of a light gin substitute such as Ceder\u2019s (see panel below) and cloudy apple juice and 100ml cucumber tonic water.

In total, the government is backing up to \u20ac300bn of bank loans, with state guarantees ranging from 70-90%, depending on the size of the business. The loans are available to all firms, regardless of size, and are usually worth up to three months of the company\u2019s revenues in 2019 and do not have to be repaid for up to 12 months. Like the UK, business are also being supported though a deferred tax payment arrangements and the government is also providing state subsidies for worker wages through employers during the lockdown. The French government has said it is willing to nationalise French companies if necessary. Germany Businesses have been able to apply for loans of up to \u20ac1bn, which are 80% and 100% guaranteed by the state depending on the size of the firm. The loans, which come with interest rates as low as 1%, are available to struggling companies that were viable before the Covid-19 outbreak. Depending on their size and creditworthiness, companies can access up to \u20ac1bn in emergency funding. While the process was working well for small businesses borrowing up to \u20ac3m, reports suggested there were initial difficulties in getting some loans out to larger firms. However, those hiccups seem to have been temporary. Authorities have also had to deal with fraudsters trying to exploit the generous programme, which has forced some German states such as North Rhine-Westphalia to temporarily suspend payouts. The total number of state-backed loans now approved in Germany \u2013 including between startups, medium-sized businesses and large companies \u2013 has reached 17,906 with \u20ac10.3bn (\u00a39bn) granted to date, according to the German economic ministry. About 18,170 business have applied for emergency financing to date.",

In most of central Europe, coronavirus numbers are still much lower than in countries further west, but there is concern here too that care homes are vulnerable and could quickly lead to rising numbers. Hungary\u2019s far-right government and the liberal mayor of Budapest have been locked in a blame game over one care home in the city which has recorded 223 residents and 19 workers as being infected, about 10% of the country\u2019s total coronavirus cases. Neighbouring Slovakia has some of the lowest numbers in Europe, and until last week, just two people had died from the virus. However, seven people have since died after an outbreak in a nursing home in the town of Pezinok, and the government has promised to embark on widespread testing in homes across the country. Variations in counting of Covid-19 deaths, different testing strategies and lockdown policies make international comparisons a minefield. \u201cA comparison between [EU] member states is difficult and should be done with extreme caution,\u201d said a spokesperson at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the EU agency to tackle infectious diseases. The agency is urging governments to count everyone who dies of coronavirus, irrespective of whether they die in hospital, a care home or private residence, as well as recording deaths where Covid-19 was \u201cthe main or contributing cause\u201d. Data for France, Spain and central Europe was collected on 21 April; data for the Netherlands, the UK and ECDC statistics on 23 April, and for Belgium on 24 April. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 April 2020. The data was collected on various dates in April, as above, not during March as a previous version said. This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "Doubts have been cast on Boris Johnson\u2019s rumoured return to frontline politics on Monday, with Downing Street saying he is yet to work on his \u201cred box\u201d of official papers as usual and is being guided by his medical team. However in a sign the prime minister is easing back into work, his official spokesman said he was regularly receiving updates to the coronavirus response and had calls with the first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, and the health secretary, Matt Hancock. On Johnson returning to frontline work next week, the spokesman said: \u201cHe is speaking with colleagues and he is receiving regular updates, but in terms of when he is actually able to get back to work in No 10, he will take the advice of his medical team on that. \u201cHe is receiving updates on the response and he has been taking part in the call with the president and had his audience with Her Majesty but he\u2019s not doing red box in the usual way, no.\u201d Donald Trump had said Johnson sounded \u201cincredible\u201d in a phone call with him following his discharge from hospital, sparking speculation the prime minister was set to return to work. The US president revealed details of their conversation at one of his regular press conferences in which he claimed Johnson, who was in intensive care with coronavirus earlier this month, sounded \u201cready to go\u201d. A report in the Daily Telegraph suggested Johnson could return to work on Monday. He has been recuperating at Chequers after being released from hospital on 12 April. The health secretary told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme Johnson was \u201con the mend in a big way\u201d but that his return to work was a matter for the doctors. Hancock described Johnson as \u201cebullient\u201d while recovering at his country retreat, where he is said not to be doing official work. The prime minister is said to have told aides to start scheduling catch-up meetings with individual cabinet ministers next week as he retakes the reins of the UK\u2019s coronavirus response, and he may chair the cabinet meeting himself. Raab, who is also foreign secretary, has been deputising for Johnson since he fell ill. This has involved him leading cabinet meetings as well as taking prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday. According to the Telegraph, Johnson has spent the past week increasing his workload in anticipation of his return and has spoken to Raab on a daily basis. He is said to have been studying government papers and closely following parliamentary proceedings. The phone call with Trump involved a discussion on a UK-US trade deal. How the UK will leave the lockdown and the way that will be communicated to the public will be among of his most pressing issues. Trump told reporters in the US: \u201cHe was ready to go. I am very surprised to tell you this. It\u2019s like the old Boris. Tremendous energy, tremendous drive. He called me pretty close to when he got out the hospital. I think he\u2019s doing great.

      "body": "<p>A recording spread around the world at the end of March, purportedly featuring a former Vodafone executive claiming to let the public in on a secret that the coronavirus pandemic is cover for a global plot to install 5G mobile phone masts, track the world\u2019s population through vaccines, and then destroy human society as we know it.</p> \n<p>In reality, the Guardian can reveal, the voice on the tape making the baseless claims is an evangelical pastor from Luton who recently tried to convince Zimbabweans to use cryptocurrency in their economy.</p> \n<p>Jonathon James, who regularly preached at churches in Bedfordshire, is the previously unidentified individual who reached millions of people with his detailed but nonsense claims that Covid-19 is a fake disease covering for the impact of 5G.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with biological warfare but is our bodies reacting to radiofrequency radiation,\u201d he told listeners to the 38-minute recording, claiming the real cause of global deaths was new mobile technology causing cell poisoning. \u201cThey are using coronavirus to try to hide the fact that people are dying from the 5G frequency.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although James was not the first individual to attempt to connect the pandemic and 5G, the popularity of his recording grew at the end of last month, just as people believing the conspiracy theory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/how-false-claims-about-5g-health-risks-spread-into-the-mainstream\">began to burn down phone equipment</a> and harass telecoms engineers.</p> \n<p>In the recording he suggests that Bill Gates is involved in a plot to produce coronavirus vaccinations that will contain computer chips to track individuals, a move he claims will ultimately herald the destruction of society.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe coronavirus is not what\u2019s killing people, it is clearly, categorically, unequivocally proven that the radio frequencies we are being exposed to are killing the people,\u201d he told his audience without any evidence. \u201cGod has blessed me with the ability to bring disparate pieces of information together that puts the puzzle together and makes sense of it.\u201d</p> \n<p> Although many copies of the recording have been deleted by YouTube for breaching its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/youtube-to-suppress-content-spreading-coronavirus-5g-conspiracy-theory\">policy on dangerous disinformation</a>, new uploads continue to be available. Delivered in the form of a sermon, it has also racked up millions of views across other networks and continues to circulate on WhatsApp. But until now the originator\u2019s identity has been unknown.</p> \n<p>Much of the audio clip\u2019s claims to credibility rely on James\u2019s assertion that he is the former head of the largest business unit at Vodafone, supposedly giving him the inside track on new technologies at one of the world\u2019s biggest telecoms companies.</p> \n<p>Vodafone insiders told the Guardian that while James had worked for the company, he was hired for a sales position in 2014 at a time when 5G was not a priority for the company and was unlikely to be in his remit. They said he ultimately left Vodafone after less than a year.</p> \n<p>Despite this, many of the leading online anti-5G groups repeatedly refer to the supposed censoring of a \u201cformer Vodafone boss\u201d as a key source backing up their beliefs, with the recording spreading out of the UK and reaching large audiences in the US and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@amy.duru/the-relativity-of-truth-covid-19-vs-conspiracy-theorists-8df2cca80a9f\">Nigeria</a>.</p> \n<p>International radiation watchdogs have cleared 5G as safe, while NHS bosses have called on people to stop spreading rumours linking the pandemic to 5G and threatening vital infrastructure.</p> \n<p>James\u2019s identity was ultimately pieced together by researchers at the <a href=\"https://www.logically.co.uk/\">fact-checking </a><a href=\"https://www.logically.co.uk/\">start</a><a href=\"https://www.logically.co.uk/\">up Logically</a>, working in conjunction with the Guardian.

      "bodyText": "A recording spread around the world at the end of March, purportedly featuring a former Vodafone executive claiming to let the public in on a secret that the coronavirus pandemic is cover for a global plot to install 5G mobile phone masts, track the world\u2019s population through vaccines, and then destroy human society as we know it. In reality, the Guardian can reveal, the voice on the tape making the baseless claims is an evangelical pastor from Luton who recently tried to convince Zimbabweans to use cryptocurrency in their economy. Jonathon James, who regularly preached at churches in Bedfordshire, is the previously unidentified individual who reached millions of people with his detailed but nonsense claims that Covid-19 is a fake disease covering for the impact of 5G. \u201cIt has nothing to do with biological warfare but is our bodies reacting to radiofrequency radiation,\u201d he told listeners to the 38-minute recording, claiming the real cause of global deaths was new mobile technology causing cell poisoning. \u201cThey are using coronavirus to try to hide the fact that people are dying from the 5G frequency.\u201d Although James was not the first individual to attempt to connect the pandemic and 5G, the popularity of his recording grew at the end of last month, just as people believing the conspiracy theory began to burn down phone equipment and harass telecoms engineers. In the recording he suggests that Bill Gates is involved in a plot to produce coronavirus vaccinations that will contain computer chips to track individuals, a move he claims will ultimately herald the destruction of society. \u201cThe coronavirus is not what\u2019s killing people, it is clearly, categorically, unequivocally proven that the radio frequencies we are being exposed to are killing the people,\u201d he told his audience without any evidence. \u201cGod has blessed me with the ability to bring disparate pieces of information together that puts the puzzle together and makes sense of it.\u201d Although many copies of the recording have been deleted by YouTube for breaching its policy on dangerous disinformation, new uploads continue to be available. Delivered in the form of a sermon, it has also racked up millions of views across other networks and continues to circulate on WhatsApp. But until now the originator\u2019s identity has been unknown. Much of the audio clip\u2019s claims to credibility rely on James\u2019s assertion that he is the former head of the largest business unit at Vodafone, supposedly giving him the inside track on new technologies at one of the world\u2019s biggest telecoms companies. Vodafone insiders told the Guardian that while James had worked for the company, he was hired for a sales position in 2014 at a time when 5G was not a priority for the company and was unlikely to be in his remit. They said he ultimately left Vodafone after less than a year. Despite this, many of the leading online anti-5G groups repeatedly refer to the supposed censoring of a \u201cformer Vodafone boss\u201d as a key source backing up their beliefs, with the recording spreading out of the UK and reaching large audiences in the US and Nigeria. International radiation watchdogs have cleared 5G as safe, while NHS bosses have called on people to stop spreading rumours linking the pandemic to 5G and threatening vital infrastructure. James\u2019s identity was ultimately pieced together by researchers at the fact-checking startup Logically, working in conjunction with the Guardian. When the preacher was contacted he said he \u201cwas absolutely shocked that [a] somewhat \u2018private message\u2019 to a dedicated small community went viral and [was] ubiquitously covered [on] various social media platforms\u201d. The preacher, whose WhatsApp profile picture shows him relaxing on a private jet wearing a monogrammed shirt, said: \u201cFor the record, I certainly wasn\u2019t trying to vilify, incriminate or implicate any mobile network operator for their commercial endeavours to roll out their unified telecoms and next generation of mobile topologies in this regard. \u201cHad I known my voice note would have gone to a wider audience I certainly would have contextualised my thoughts, been more specific on what I was sharing citing references, and far less explicit. I was simply trying to summarise what the \u2018perceived truth\u2019 was behind this bizarre pandemic in the interest of serving my community.\u201d James, who regularly preaches at the Light City Christian Ministries in Luton, has apparently had a varied career since his time at Vodafone. He claims to have at one point advised central bankers in \u201cthe Congo\u201d and Bangladesh on cryptocurrencies and he has posed with the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa. In 2018 he was working as an economic adviser for a Zimbabwean opposition party, urging it to save the economy using Bitcoin-type products pegged to diamond deposits through blockchain technology. Asked if he had any final comment, James said he was unable to reply as he \u201chad some rather pressing head of state engagement necessitating my full attention and time [for the] last 48 hours\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Emergency crews rushing to respond after reports of gunfire in a quiet Nova Scotia town were taken aback when they encountered thick clouds of smoke at the scene. \u201cIs there also a structure fire out this way?\u201d one first responder asked his dispatcher. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing huge flames and smoke.\u201d Soon afterwards, when a number of gunshot victims were found, an emergency worker asked if the gunman had been detained. \u201cNo, not for sure,\u201d the dispatcher replied. \u201cThey don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve caught him.\u201d Audio recordings from the night of 18 April capture the atmosphere of chaos and uncertainty as emergency teams grappled with the Nova Scotia mass shooting. The confusion partially explains how a dental technician named Gabriel Wortman was able kill at least 22 people, including a police officer, firefighter, nurse and teacher. For more than 12 hours, the gunman evaded police, traveling across the province before he was shot dead outside a gas station. As Canada reels from the worst mass shooting in its history, new details of the slaughter and its aftermath have emerged \u2013 raising fresh questions about the shooting and the response of the emergency services. Among the revelations is the fact that for nearly seven hours, authorities did not realize the murderer was disguised as a police officer and driving a replica police cruiser. Clinton Ellison and his brother, Corrie, were staying at their father\u2019s home in Portapique when they heard a single gunshot on Saturday evening. Heading outside to investigate, the brothers spotted a large fire up the road. Corrie walked ahead, but he soon called his brother and told him to contact the fire department. When Corrie failed to return home, Clinton followed his path towards the smoke and found his brother\u2019s body in the road. \u201cI shut my flashlight off, I turned around \u2013 and I ran for my life in the dark,\u201d Clinton told CBC News. Sprinting as fast as possible, Ellison turned up the driveway of a cottage. \u201cI turned around and looked towards the road I had just run from to see a little flashlight flashing around, looking for me,\u201d he said. Realizing the gunman was searching for him, Ellison ran blindly into the woods. For nearly four hours he hid among the trees \u2013 praying for help amid bursts of gunfire and explosions from the fires \u2013 before officers led him to safety. \u201cTo walk up and find my brother dead, and to be hunted by this fella that killed all these people, I\u2019ll be traumatized for the rest of my life,\u201d he said. Police have not yet identified the first victims, but a number of news outlets reported on Friday that it was his longtime girlfriend, who he assaulted and handcuffed following an argument. The woman, who has not yet been identified, survived his attack and managed to escape, hiding in the woods for hours as gunshots rang out in the dark, before finally emerging and contacting police. It was then that authorities received their most critical tip: the woman told authorities that their suspect in the shootings was dressed as a police officer and driving a replica police vehicle. She provided the RCMP a photograph of the car, kicking off the frantic, hours-long search across the province for Wortman. The head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Brenda Lucki, has said that several of the victims were known to the gunman \u2013 but that he later simply opened fire at anyone in his path. Late on Saturday night, an officer in tactical equipment arrived at Nathan Staples\u2019 house to check on the Glenholme resident. \u201cHe came to apologize. He said: \u2018We\u2019re sorry we couldn\u2019t have been there quicker.\u2019 That\u2019s when I got angry,\u201d Staples told the Globe and Mail, uncertain why he was being visited by police. On Friday, the RCMP said that a number of people had been approached by officers who they believed might have been in danger. \u201cWe were contacting individuals who we believed could have been on a list or were potentially at risk,\u201d RCMP superintendent Darren Campbell told reporters on Friday. \u201cWe were contacting them, we were bringing them to safety and we were interviewing them at that time.\u201d During the manhunt, two officers discharged their weapons at a fire station in the town of Lower Onslow, leaving a string of bullet holes in the facade. Several people were inside the building but the suspect was not known to be in the area at the time. The serious incident response team \u2013 an independent body that intervenes after police shootings \u2013 is investigating. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what they were firing at,\u201d the SIRT director, Pat Curran, told the Toronto Star. Nearly 12 hours after police received their first 911 call, the murder spree came to an end at a gas station outside the town of Enfield, more than 50 miles from where the first victims were found. Jonathan Heffernan, a firefighter at the Halifax international airport, had pulled in to refill his truck. Thanks to the coronavirus lockdown, the station \u2013 usually bustling on a Sunday morning \u2013 was largely empty, but the quiet was soon punctured by an exchange of gunfire. \u201cI had no idea what was going on,\u201d Heffernan told the Guardian. \u201cA guy was running around the corner of the building. He yelled to me that someone was shooting. We both hid behind my truck. We still had no idea what was happening. \u201cI\u2019ve been a firefighter for 14 years. Absolutely the most terrified I have ever been.\u201d The two hid behind Heffernan\u2019s truck as heavily armed police swarmed the area and helicopters circled overhead. Ten minutes later, the two men were told they could safely come out of hiding. It wasn\u2019t until later that Heffernan realised that he knew one of the victims: Tom Bagley, a volunteer firefighter whose generosity and unflinching kindness were praised by friends and colleagues. \u201cLearning that a former member of our fire family was also killed just added to the emotion,\u201d said Heffernan. The maritime province has been deeply shaken by the killings. \u201cThere are just so many pieces left to pick up before people can even begin to start grieving,\u201d said Tiff Ward, a lifelong resident of the region who knew several of the victims. Police believe Wortman acted alone \u2013 although they are investigating whether he was helped in obtaining firearms and the police uniform. The RCMP said Wortman did not appear to have a firearms licence. Because the coronavirus pandemic has prevented mass gatherings, community members have a planned an online vigil for Friday evening, said Ward. \u201cEverybody\u2019s dropped their work and they\u2019re bringing their very best self too,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we need this. We need a really big light to shine up into the biggest darkness imaginable.\u201d",

But I\u2019m, like, a person that has a good you-know-what.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/newspapers-journalists-coronavirus-press-democracy\">Newspapers are enjoying a surge in popularity, but they're struggling to survive | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There we are, then. In the lockdown era, we\u2019ve all been making do with long-forgotten tinned food and whatnot that we\u2019ve found around the house. So it makes sense that the United States president would be coming up with the sort of stuff that Sauron or<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2020/jan/16/do-not-adjust-your-set-gwyneth-paltrow-is-spreading-goop-all-over-tv\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2020/jan/16/do-not-adjust-your-set-gwyneth-paltrow-is-spreading-goop-all-over-tv\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2020/jan/16/do-not-adjust-your-set-gwyneth-paltrow-is-spreading-goop-all-over-tv\"> </a>would pull if they only had access to the cupboard under their kitchen sink.</p> \n<p>Even so, it is increasingly impossible to see Trump himself as anything other than a diagnostic agent, a sort of barium meal run through the system to test the strength of the US checks and balances. They are \u2026 how to put this sufficiently plainly? \u2026 failing. Indeed, the word failing itself feels like it\u2019s failing, given the sheer weight of deficiency and dereliction it is currently being required to bear.</p> \n<p>On Twitter, the platform to which Trump\u2019s you-know-what is fused, the news is panned daily for suggestions that someone \u2013 anyone \u2013 in anything approaching a position of power gets this. Every day brings another series of clips of public health officials, whose thousand-yard stares are turning into million-yard stares, and who are presumably too busy trying to protect a pandemic-stricken nation from the attentions of a quarterwit to source a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28330605\">Claus </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28330605\">von Stauffenberg</a> costume. The Republican establishment \u2013 many of whom would have something serviceable already hanging in their locked closet \u2013 have long preferred to wear the mark of Cain.</p> \n<p>As have certain Trump media cheerleaders, who were apparently fine with all the racism and the pussy-grabbing, but today seem to have judged the Dettol chronicles the bit that might finally cause blowback to their own personages. I\u2019m afraid all we can say to this is: DO ME A FAVOUR. Only grifters who spent years going \u201cTrump will surprise people\u201d are surprised by this. This is on them, too. Change sides now, by all means \u2013 better late than never \u2013 but do be aware that the historical record is always very clear on such switcheroos. Or to put it another way: Mussolini was, at all stages on his journey, a complete shit. You\u2019re Mussolini.</p> \n<p>In any case, Trump\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 crisis was always predictable pathologically. You\u2019re asking a man who got to the Oval Office by going viral to disavow a virus. It\u2019s not very surprising that Trump can\u2019t bring himself to. You have to think he recognises something of a kindred spirit in the disease, which is indifferent to all human suffering, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/britain-ignorant-health-inequalities-coronavirus-black-people-dying\">impacts disproportionately on ethnic minorities</a> and is horrifyingly resistant to therapy.</p> \n<p>In terms of behavioural science, then, perhaps the best way to encourage Trump to defeat the virus would be to make him professionally jealous of it. At present he just regards it as a supporting cast member, occupying the Apprentice boardroom-sidekick chair once held by that other disease particle, <a href=\"https://www.eonline.com/uk/news/922284/donald-trump-jr-s-conflicted-world-how-his-parents-divorce-drama-and-his-relationship-with-dad-shaped-his-life\">Don Jr</a>. Or as the president put it this week in reference to his nightly press conferences that should ideally be guiding Americans on how not to die: \u201cI\u2019ve had great \u2018ratings\u2019 my whole life, there\u2019s nothing unusual about that for me. The White House News Conference ratings are \u2018through the roof\u2019 (Monday Night Football, Bachelor Finale) \u2026\u201d Congratulations to the star, showrunner and executive producer for having the vision to deliver this thing. Then again, shows with high body counts have always rated highly on US TV.</p> \n<p>Back on our own shores, meanwhile, the one useful moment in the Trump press conference was the bit where he imparted some \u2013 any \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/24/boris-johnson-sounds-incredible-ready-to-go-says-donald-trump\">information about Boris Johnson</a>, who remains off games. As you may recall, Britain has not had a working prime minister for some weeks now, in a moment of maximum crisis. But there is a sense \u2013 fostered by some of the most obnoxious people on Earth \u2013 that it would somehow be uncouth to dwell on how or even if decisions are being made. Instead, we are led by a cabinet <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/04/the-rat-king-or-roi-de-rats-is-a-very-creepy-conjoined-creature.html\">rat king</a>, with Dominic Raab\u2019s tail entwined with those of Matt Hancock, Michael Gove and Rishi Sunak. Eventually one of them \u2013 probably Sunak \u2013 will manage to bite off their own appendage to set themselves free. For now, the factions nip at each other off the record \u2013 and sometimes, at Johnson. \u201cThe prime minister is in a funny place,\u201d ran <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11443302/boris-frightened-coronavirus-hit-hard/\">one kindly monstering</a> a few days ago. \u201cI think he\u2019s quite frightened.\u201d I bet you do.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/24/uk-coronavirus-live-warning-mass-vaccinations-covid-19-latest-updates\">UK coronavirus live: officials apologise after key workers denied tests on day one of Hancock scheme</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The one entity everyone wants you to think is in charge, though, is The Science. Of all the seven phrases of magnetic fridge poetry that are rearranged each day to fashion a 5pm briefing, the most ominous is surely \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/scientists-criticise-uk-government-over-following-the-science\">We have, at all times, been led by the science</a>.\u201d This is untrue, no matter how many times they say it. We have, at all times, been led by the government, whose job it is to take the scientific advice and make political decisions based on it. The ministers do not, in fact, all work for \u201cThe Science\u201d, the most suspiciously shadowy overlord since <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/14/entertainment/usual-suspects-movie-keyser-soze-feat/index.html\">Keyser S\u00f6ze</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Science\u201d is not some monolithic stone tablet that gets handed to Raab to read out to the masses \u2013 and all scientists themselves know this. The claim that government would be \u201cled by the science\u201d was reassuring many weeks ago, at the start of all this. But now, through suspicious overuse to the exclusion of all other considerations, it has become troubling. Whenever some politician standing next to him says it these days, my overactive imagination fancies it sees a flicker behind the eyes of Chris Whitty. Is he realising that they are fitting him up to be the guy who needs at least 36 changes of shirt for the inevitable public inquiry? This week, some scientists advising the government <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/coronavirus-uk-scientists-human-shields\">told Buzzfeed</a> they feared they will be used by ministers as \u201chuman shields\u201d at such an event.</p> \n<p>Will they? You certainly wouldn\u2019t rule out Dominic Cummings\u2019s Downing Street believing they\u2019ve alighted on the perfect way to insulate themselves from blame \u2013 using scientists as a prophylactic. Call it a nerd immunity strategy, and pour yourself a celebratory disinfectant.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p>",

For now, though, let\u2019s just include the presidential caveat. Pointing to his head, Trump went on: \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor. But I\u2019m, like, a person that has a good you-know-what.\u201d There we are, then. In the lockdown era, we\u2019ve all been making do with long-forgotten tinned food and whatnot that we\u2019ve found around the house. So it makes sense that the United States president would be coming up with the sort of stuff that Sauron or Gwyneth Paltrow would pull if they only had access to the cupboard under their kitchen sink. Even so, it is increasingly impossible to see Trump himself as anything other than a diagnostic agent, a sort of barium meal run through the system to test the strength of the US checks and balances. They are \u2026 how to put this sufficiently plainly? \u2026 failing. Indeed, the word failing itself feels like it\u2019s failing, given the sheer weight of deficiency and dereliction it is currently being required to bear. On Twitter, the platform to which Trump\u2019s you-know-what is fused, the news is panned daily for suggestions that someone \u2013 anyone \u2013 in anything approaching a position of power gets this. Every day brings another series of clips of public health officials, whose thousand-yard stares are turning into million-yard stares, and who are presumably too busy trying to protect a pandemic-stricken nation from the attentions of a quarterwit to source a Claus von Stauffenberg costume. The Republican establishment \u2013 many of whom would have something serviceable already hanging in their locked closet \u2013 have long preferred to wear the mark of Cain. As have certain Trump media cheerleaders, who were apparently fine with all the racism and the pussy-grabbing, but today seem to have judged the Dettol chronicles the bit that might finally cause blowback to their own personages. I\u2019m afraid all we can say to this is: DO ME A FAVOUR. Only grifters who spent years going \u201cTrump will surprise people\u201d are surprised by this. This is on them, too. Change sides now, by all means \u2013 better late than never \u2013 but do be aware that the historical record is always very clear on such switcheroos. Or to put it another way: Mussolini was, at all stages on his journey, a complete shit. You\u2019re Mussolini. In any case, Trump\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 crisis was always predictable pathologically. You\u2019re asking a man who got to the Oval Office by going viral to disavow a virus. It\u2019s not very surprising that Trump can\u2019t bring himself to. You have to think he recognises something of a kindred spirit in the disease, which is indifferent to all human suffering, impacts disproportionately on ethnic minorities and is horrifyingly resistant to therapy. In terms of behavioural science, then, perhaps the best way to encourage Trump to defeat the virus would be to make him professionally jealous of it. At present he just regards it as a supporting cast member, occupying the Apprentice boardroom-sidekick chair once held by that other disease particle, Don Jr. Or as the president put it this week in reference to his nightly press conferences that should ideally be guiding Americans on how not to die: \u201cI\u2019ve had great \u2018ratings\u2019 my whole life, there\u2019s nothing unusual about that for me. The White House News Conference ratings are \u2018through the roof\u2019 (Monday Night Football, Bachelor Finale) \u2026\u201d Congratulations to the star, showrunner and executive producer for having the vision to deliver this thing. Then again, shows with high body counts have always rated highly on US TV. Back on our own shores, meanwhile, the one useful moment in the Trump press conference was the bit where he imparted some \u2013 any \u2013 information about Boris Johnson, who remains off games. As you may recall, Britain has not had a working prime minister for some weeks now, in a moment of maximum crisis. But there is a sense \u2013 fostered by some of the most obnoxious people on Earth \u2013 that it would somehow be uncouth to dwell on how or even if decisions are being made. Instead, we are led by a cabinet rat king, with Dominic Raab\u2019s tail entwined with those of Matt Hancock, Michael Gove and Rishi Sunak. Eventually one of them \u2013 probably Sunak \u2013 will manage to bite off their own appendage to set themselves free. For now, the factions nip at each other off the record \u2013 and sometimes, at Johnson. \u201cThe prime minister is in a funny place,\u201d ran one kindly monstering a few days ago. \u201cI think he\u2019s quite frightened.\u201d I bet you do. The one entity everyone wants you to think is in charge, though, is The Science. Of all the seven phrases of magnetic fridge poetry that are rearranged each day to fashion a 5pm briefing, the most ominous is surely \u201cWe have, at all times, been led by the science.\u201d This is untrue, no matter how many times they say it. We have, at all times, been led by the government, whose job it is to take the scientific advice and make political decisions based on it. The ministers do not, in fact, all work for \u201cThe Science\u201d, the most suspiciously shadowy overlord since Keyser S\u00f6ze. \u201cThe Science\u201d is not some monolithic stone tablet that gets handed to Raab to read out to the masses \u2013 and all scientists themselves know this. The claim that government would be \u201cled by the science\u201d was reassuring many weeks ago, at the start of all this. But now, through suspicious overuse to the exclusion of all other considerations, it has become troubling. Whenever some politician standing next to him says it these days, my overactive imagination fancies it sees a flicker behind the eyes of Chris Whitty. Is he realising that they are fitting him up to be the guy who needs at least 36 changes of shirt for the inevitable public inquiry? This week, some scientists advising the government told Buzzfeed they feared they will be used by ministers as \u201chuman shields\u201d at such an event. Will they? You certainly wouldn\u2019t rule out Dominic Cummings\u2019s Downing Street believing they\u2019ve alighted on the perfect way to insulate themselves from blame \u2013 using scientists as a prophylactic. Call it a nerd immunity strategy, and pour yourself a celebratory disinfectant. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>With coronavirus making going to the cinema, a gig or the theatre a distant memory, there is one area of culture that is more accessible than ever: television. Live viewing has soared by 17% since the lockdown began, with the BBC and Channel 4 reporting huge increases in ratings. In March, ITV recorded its highest ever numbers for an entertainment show, when 11 million tuned into Ant and Dec\u2019s first Saturday Night Takeaway without a studio audience.</p> <p>But while most people are tuning into more shows than ever, millions around the world are still struggling to access them \u2013 including those with visual impairments. This frustration is felt by many, not least blind viewers in Wales, who were reported in February to be <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-51481740\">feeling like \u201csecond-class citizens\u201d</a> over the lack of audio-described original programming in the country.</p> <p>Robert Kingett is a Chicago-based journalist who has been blind since childhood due to retinopathy of prematurity. As well as consuming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/19/apocalypse-thrillers-and-afrofuturistic-epics-2019s-best-dramatic-podcasts\">fiction podcasts</a> and audiobooks, he is an avid TV-watcher. However, the audio description he relies on to fully understand shows is often frustratingly irregular,<strong> </strong>depending on the channel or the streaming service. \u201cVery little gets reported on in terms of the state and history of these accessibility matters,\u201d he says, despite the fact that they could have benefits for sighted audiences, too. \u201cYou can listen to a movie while driving. You can listen to a movie at the gym or when you have eye fatigue, or if you don\u2019t like reading subtitles.\u201d</p> <p>Sonali Rai is the audio description manager<strong> </strong>at the Royal National Institute of Blind People. She outlines how awareness has improved over the past decade. \u201cAfter an RNIB campaign in 2010, BBC, Channel 4, Sky and ITV made a public commitment to broadcast a minimum of 20% of their programming with audio description, with the others still required to do at least 10%,\u201d she explains. \u201cHowever, if you look at the latest <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/multi-sector-research/accessibility-research/television-access-services-report-jan-jul-2019\">Ofcom access services report</a>, most broadcasters seem to be achieving more than the legal requirement.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this, she says that online catchup and streaming services need to make serious improvements. \u201cSome are performing really well, but most are still trying to find a way to standardise the delivery of the audio-description tracks on their apps across different platforms. We would like to see content providers consider accessibility when they start designing their services, so they are not trying to retrofit it later.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30704e2670e9b48967310ad8e0816c5c609d1e7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30704e2670e9b48967310ad8e0816c5c609d1e7e/0_0_1700_1020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Channel 4\u2019s First Dates, which Craig Reekie has to get his girlfriend to relay to him.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Channel 4\u2019s First Dates, which Craig Reekie has to get his girlfriend to relay to him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Mcnamara/CHANNEL 4 PICTURE PUBLICITY</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Take Netflix, for example. The streaming giant offers more than 500 audio-described series and films \u2013 including original content such as House of Cards \u2013 although it can often seem that there is<strong> </strong>no consistency to its approach, as became clear when the fifth series of Black Mirror was released. \u201cWhen it dropped, there was no audio description,\u201d says Kingett. \u201cThere are no regulations that say streaming companies have to be accessible \u2013 there\u2019s no standard, so things are nowhere near as organised or even reliable.\u201d</p> <p>It is not just providing audio description that is the issue, however. Often the hardware itself can prove prohibitive. Despite devices such as the latest Sky remote control, which allows for full voice control, there are still limitations, such as unreadable electronic programme guides. One deep frustration is that the level of care and attention given to the technology varies wildly between streaming services.<strong> </strong>Kingett speaks highly of Microsoft and Apple\u2019s accessibility policies, but they are exceptions rather than the rule. \u201cApple made its entire Apple TV+ platform accessible \u2013 and no other company has audio description in multiple languages.\u201d</p> <p>Craig Reekie, 34, lives in Glasgow. He started to lose his sight a few years ago and finds voice remotes particularly beneficial. \u201cWith Amazon Prime Video [unlike many other services], you can adjust the subtitles so they\u2019re really large or in inverted colours,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For Reekie, there is a catalogue of seemingly small things that could be solved with even cursory attention. Audio description has improved, he says, but it is still laughably spotty. \u201cI have to ask my girlfriend what happened in the epilogue on First Dates, when there could be a voiceover.\u201d For many, it can also be an alienating experience, and means being excluded from the everyday cultural conversations that form the backdrop to our lives. \u201cI also think blind people are missing out on so many foreign films or TV shows that could easily be dubbed,\u201d he adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e303e4e120d5798f2105066cc2860c8fd9cafdd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e303e4e120d5798f2105066cc2860c8fd9cafdd4/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marvel\u2019s Daredevil, which was originally released without audio description.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marvel\u2019s Daredevil, which was originally released without audio description.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Harbron/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The greatest irony Kingett has encountered was with Daredevil, the Netflix <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/10/daredevil-tv-emo-superhero\">show about the blind Marvel superhero</a>, which was released without audio description.

Restaurants and pubs can fully reopen on 25 May, two weeks earlier than initially planned. In further developments: The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said China might have known of the coronavirus as early as November. South Korea reported just six more cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. Austria said it would start to reopen school classes from 4 May in a staggered return for pupils lasting until the end of the month. German business morale fell in April to its lowest level since reunification. Medical experts have widely condemned Donald Trump\u2019s musings about whether disinfectant and UV rays could be used on people to fight the virus. Russia reported nearly 6,000 new cases and 60 more deaths in 24 hours, scotching hopes it was reaching a plateau.",

Sector resilience plans, including planning for absence of key workers, need enforcing.</p> <h2>Multiple waves</h2> <p>It is predicted that an influenza pandemic would come in multiple waves.</p> <p>This means that recovery from one wave could be hampered by the arrival of a subsequent wave. Even after the end of a pandemic, it is likely that it would take months, or even years, for health and social care services to recover, although an exact timescale cannot be predicted. It is likely the economic impact would be felt for years.</p> <p>The reasonable worst case scenario (RWCS) assumes that the pandemic will come in multiple waves (up to three), each approximately 15 weeks long.</p> <p>For example, in the RWCS, 9,840,000 people would require assessment by health services (30% of those who are symptomatic), of which 1,312,000 people would require hospital treatment and 328,000 the highest level of critical care. Using the estimated UK population for 2016, this RWCS could result in 820,000 fatalities.</p> <p>Besides very severe levels of stress on the NHS, the level of excess deaths would stretch capacity within organisations involved in the management of deaths, including coroners and burial services. This would be felt on a national scale, with local capacity likely to be overwhelmed during the peak of the pandemic.</p> <p>\u2022 The pandemic would present in one or more waves. Each wave is expected to lasting 15 weeks, with the peak weeks occurring at weeks six and seven in each wave.</p> <p>\u2022 Ffity per cent of the population would be infected and experience symptoms of pandemic influenza during the one or more waves. The actual number of people infected would be higher than this, as there would be a number of asymptomatic cases.</p> <p>\u2022 A case fatality ratio of 2.5%, meaning 2.5% of those with symptoms could die as a result of the influenza virus. Four per cent of symptomatic patients would require hospital care, 25% of whom are expected to need the highest level of critical care (level three).</p> <p>\u2022 Peak illness rates of about 10-12% (measured in new clinical cases per week as a proportion of the population) are expected in each of the weeks in the peak fortnight (weeks six and seven).</p> <p>\u2022 Workplace absence rates for illness will be reaching 17-20% in the peak weeks.</p> <h2>On vaccines</h2> <p>There are no known markers that herald the start of a new pandemic. Based on most current vaccine technologies, it is likely to take at least four to six months after a novel virus has been identified and isolated for an effective pandemic influenza vaccine to become available from manufacturers in large quantity.</p> <p>This means that the first pandemic wave will not be vaccine-preventable; it will not be possible to contain a novel pandemic virus in its country of origin or on arrival in the UK.</p> <p>The expectation must be that the virus will spread rapidly to the UK (a major global transport hub) and that any local measures taken to disrupt or reduce the spread are likely to have very limited or partial success at national level and cannot be relied on as a way to \u201cbuy time\u201d.</p> <p>The UK has an advanced purchase agreement for pandemic vaccine, which can be triggered in response to a pandemic threat.

The performance of the health and care system is likely to contribute to the public outrage, especially if provision of the remaining services is seen as unevenly distributed.

Based on most current vaccine technologies, it is likely to take at least four to six months after a novel virus has been identified and isolated for an effective pandemic influenza vaccine to become available from manufacturers in large quantity. This means that the first pandemic wave will not be vaccine-preventable; it will not be possible to contain a novel pandemic virus in its country of origin or on arrival in the UK. The expectation must be that the virus will spread rapidly to the UK (a major global transport hub) and that any local measures taken to disrupt or reduce the spread are likely to have very limited or partial success at national level and cannot be relied on as a way to \u201cbuy time\u201d. The UK has an advanced purchase agreement for pandemic vaccine, which can be triggered in response to a pandemic threat. Even after the end of the pandemic it is likely that it would take months, or even years, for the health and social care services to recover, although an exact timescale cannot be predicted. On deaths \u2013 moderate viral pandemic This variation models a moderate pandemic, based on the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. The annual likelihood of a pandemic with the characteristics described below is 2%. The specific assumptions of this scenario are listed below. About 32% (21,320,000) of the population would be infected and experience symptoms of pandemic influenza. A case fatality ratio of 0.2%, resulting in 65,600 deaths. Of symptomatic patients, 0.55% (117,260) would require hospital care, 25% (29,315) of whom would be expected to require the highest level of critical care (level three). Peak illness rates of about 6.5-8% (measured in new clinical cases per week as a proportion of the population) would be expected in each of the weeks in the peak fortnight (weeks six and seven). This scenario would still have a significant impact on health and social care systems as well as death management systems. There would also be higher than usual absence from work. On lockdown Public health measures such as school closures and social distancing may be partially successful in delaying the peak of a pandemic wave by a few weeks at most, and might reduce the overall size of a pandemic wave. However these measures are disruptive, with known secondary consequences (eg closing schools would reduce the availability of healthcare workers), and the limited evidence available suggests that such measures have maximum effect when implemented early and simultaneously. For the RWCS, it is assumed that schools have not been closed. Global travel, particularly commercial airlines, will have an impact on the spread of the disease. Although the strain was mild, the pandemic in 2009 showed that a rapid global spread was possible.

Economic impact Total cost: \u00a32,354,738,558,884 Economic impacts \u2013 confidence assessment. To put that figure in context, \u00a32.35tn is the equivalent of 131% of GDP. It is worth noting that a large proportion (\u00a31.5tn) of the economic impact comes from the social value of deaths. Emerging infectious diseases Response capability requirements The capability requirements include disease surveillance systems, staff trained in enhanced infection control practices, adequate access to personalised protective equipment, adequate access to public health staff for contact tracing and follow-up, and excess death management capabilities (including potential infectious material). Decontamination services need to be available. Appropriate specialist healthcare services eg, high level-isolation units must be accessible, as well as appropriate facilities for quarantine.",

The NSRA sets out a series of potential reasonable worst case scenarios (RWCS) for the spread of a flu-like viral pandemic, which emergency planning experts regard as the benchmark for its preparedness in the current crisis. It also included predictions that offer insights into how planners believe a crisis like this current emergency might evolve. The document said: \u2022 A pandemic would play out in up to \u201cthree waves\u201d, with each wave expected to last 15 weeks \u2026 \u201cwith the peak weeks occurring at weeks 6 and 7 in each wave\u201d. \u2022 50% of the population would be infected and experience symptoms of pandemic influenza during the one or more waves.

Whitehall sources concede that turning \u201cplans on the page to real life\u201d was always proving a challenge, but said that in some respects the Brexit planning had helped. The government spokesman said its response to the emergency had protected lives and businesses: \u201cOur response has ensured that the NHS has been given all the support it needs to ensure everyone requiring treatment has received it, as well as providing protection to businesses and reassurance to workers.\u201d But political pressure is mounting on the government.

So if that 30% starts to budge, things could move really quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Within seconds of Moro\u2019s announcement there were already signs support for Bolsonaro was slipping with deafening pot-banging protests erupting in major Brazilian cities, including in strongly pro-Bolsonaro areas of Rio de Janeiro.</p> <p><em>\u201cFora Bolsonaro!

If he doesn\u2019t resign, impeachment proceedings should begin.

On Thursday a record 407 deaths were reported.</p> <p>Speaking before Moro\u2019s resignation, the author and commentator Pedro Doria said he feared there would be a high human price to pay for the political chaos consuming Brazil.</p> <p>\u201cEvery single person in government should be totally focused on Covid-19,\u201d Doria said.</p> <p>\u201cThe only real result of all this is that a lot of people will die.\u201d</p>",

Moro \u2013 a hero for much of the Brazilian right and a hate figure for many on the left \u2013 announced his decision on Friday after clashing with the president over Bolsonaro\u2019s sacking of the head of Brazil\u2019s federal police. \u201cI have to protect my biography and above all the commitment I took on \u2026 that we would stand firm against corruption, organized crime and violent crime,\u201d said Moro, a 47-year-old judge who became a household name for leading the \u201cCar Wash\u201d corruption investigation and jailing former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva ahead of the 2018 presidential election. With Lula sidelined, Bolsonaro won a landslide victory by pledging to combat corruption and appointed Moro just days later as a potent symbol of his supposed intentions. Brian Winter, the editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly, said Moro\u2019s exit could have huge implications for Brazil\u2019s leader by eating away at his support base of about 30% of voters \u2013 which some believe could pave the way for impeachment. \u201cI think it\u2019s devastating for Bolsonaro,\u201d Winter said. \u201cI think Moro\u2019s departure will cause a real crisis of conscience for some Bolsonaro voters who will ask themselves: \u2018Is this government really the change that I voted for?\u2019\u201d Winter added: \u201cHistory tells us impeachment is always lurking in the background for Brazilian presidents. The fire has been nipping at Bolsonaro\u2019s heels for a couple of months now \u2026 and congress has always hated Bolsonaro. So if that 30% starts to budge, things could move really quickly.\u201d Within seconds of Moro\u2019s announcement there were already signs support for Bolsonaro was slipping with deafening pot-banging protests erupting in major Brazilian cities, including in strongly pro-Bolsonaro areas of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cFora Bolsonaro! Fora Bolsonaro!\u201d (\u201cBolsonaro out!\u201d), dissenters cried from their windows and balconies as they pounded their saucepans. A commentary in the conservative O Antagonista website said: \u201cIf he has any honour, Bolsonaro should resign. If he doesn\u2019t resign, impeachment proceedings should begin. In any case, the government is finished.\u201d The immediate trigger for Moro\u2019s resignation was reportedly Bolsonaro\u2019s decision to remove one of the minister\u2019s closest associates, Maur\u00edcio Valeixo, from his job as head of the federal police. Since reports of Valeixo\u2019s impending firing emerged on Thursday, Brazilian newspapers have filled with speculation about why Bolsonaro would be so keen to remove him. A report in one major newspaper, the Correio Braziliense, claimed Bolsonaro\u2019s discomfort stemmed from the fact that a federal police investigation into the dissemination of fake news and promotion of anti-democracy protests was closing in on a highly sensitive target: the president\u2019s own son, Carlos Bolsonaro. Carlos Bolsonaro denied those claims in a pair of offensive tweets aimed at the broadsheet. \u201cYou scum never stop lying,\u201d one said. Another read: \u201cYourarse [sic].\u201d In his explosive 40-minute resignation speech, Moro claimed he was leaving government because of what he called Bolsonaro\u2019s unacceptable and inappropriate political interference in Brazil\u2019s federal police. Moro claimed Bolsonaro had told him he wanted a federal police director he knew and could call up in order to have access to police intelligence reports. But Winter, who knows Moro and had questioned his decision to enter politics, claimed other factors had also played a role \u2013 including Bolsonaro\u2019s anti-scientific handling of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cHe has been deeply frustrated by a number of things including the government\u2019s response to Covid-19,\u201d Winter said, claiming Moro had been part of a group of ministers \u201cconstantly lobbying Bolsonaro to take the pandemic more seriously and adopt a science-based response\u201d. Winter said Moro, who last year resisted calls to resign after leaked documents prompted claims he had improperly plotted to jail Lula, also sensed political pressure on Bolsonaro was growing and that the coming months would represent \u201can existential threat for the presidency itself\u201d. Moro, who rejected the allegations against him as \u201csensationalist\u201d smears, is the second top minister to leave Bolsonaro\u2019s administration in just over a week. Last Thursday, Bolsonaro fired his popular health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, after he publicly challenged the president\u2019s coronavirus response. Bolsonaro continues to play down the crisis and undermine social distancing measures despite Covid-19 now having claimed more than 3,300 lives. On Thursday a record 407 deaths were reported. Speaking before Moro\u2019s resignation, the author and commentator Pedro Doria said he feared there would be a high human price to pay for the political chaos consuming Brazil. \u201cEvery single person in government should be totally focused on Covid-19,\u201d Doria said. \u201cThe only real result of all this is that a lot of people will die.\u201d",

And yet April is on course to be if not the cruellest month, then unexpectedly the shortest.</p> <p>Strictly speaking, none of that makes sense. There were 31 days in March, as always, and there will be 30 in April, as always. And yet, coronavirus has not just upended space, reshaping the landscape around us so that once-crammed city centres now lie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/20/uk-becomes-deserted-as-coronavirus-advice-bites-in-pictures\">empty and deserted</a> \u2013 it has also messed with time. Tell people that Monday will mark the start of week six of lockdown and they stare back in disbelief. Really? How did that happen?</p> <p>\u201cThe weeks seem to pass surprisingly quickly,\u201d texts one friend. \u201cYet the days seem to last an eternity.\u201d Strange things are happening with time, and stranger things could happen still.</p> <p>When Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/23/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-boris-johnson-minister-condemns-people-ignoring-two-metre-distance-rule-in-parks-as-very-selfish\">announced the lockdown</a> on 23 March, the talk \u2013 the hopeful assumption \u2013 was that it would last three weeks. A review was scheduled. But the date for that came and went, and people began to adjust to the idea that maybe this would stretch deep into the summer. And then on Wednesday, the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/uk-will-need-social-distancing-until-at-least-end-of-year-says-whitty\">warned </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/uk-will-need-social-distancing-until-at-least-end-of-year-says-whitty\"> that</a> \u201chighly disruptive\u201d social distancing measures were likely to be in place until 2021.</p> <p>That is a very different prospect, and it requires us to adjust our clocks. The sober, uber-rational health correspondent of the New York Times, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5wb2R0cmFjLmNvbS96S3E2V1paTFRsYk0&amp;episode=Z2lkOi8vYXJ0MTktZXBpc29kZS1sb2NhdG9yL1YwL0hRM0pOMVdicWNiZEhBWTI2dUtwdm11bEtvRHRNMl9jN3hacUZQODlkRFU&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;ved=2ahUKEwibnrDmjYHpAhXSa8AKHQKsD2AQieUEegQIDxAM&amp;ep=6\">Donald McNeil, suggests </a>an easing by the end of the year is optimistic, given how long it will take to produce either a vaccine or effective treatment for Covid-19. He spoke of how he is expecting a grandchild in June \u2013 and is coming to terms with the possibility that he might not meet that child until he or she is two years old.</p> <p>For everyone, this is a challenge of a different order. A sustained, long-run lockdown means that a vast stretch of undifferentiated time is unfurling ahead of us, stripped bare of the usual divisions and markers.

      "bodyText": "It was a long March, perhaps the longest any of us can remember. And yet April is on course to be if not the cruellest month, then unexpectedly the shortest. Strictly speaking, none of that makes sense. There were 31 days in March, as always, and there will be 30 in April, as always. And yet, coronavirus has not just upended space, reshaping the landscape around us so that once-crammed city centres now lie empty and deserted \u2013 it has also messed with time. Tell people that Monday will mark the start of week six of lockdown and they stare back in disbelief. Really? How did that happen? \u201cThe weeks seem to pass surprisingly quickly,\u201d texts one friend. \u201cYet the days seem to last an eternity.\u201d Strange things are happening with time, and stranger things could happen still. When Boris Johnson announced the lockdown on 23 March, the talk \u2013 the hopeful assumption \u2013 was that it would last three weeks. A review was scheduled. But the date for that came and went, and people began to adjust to the idea that maybe this would stretch deep into the summer. And then on Wednesday, the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, warned that \u201chighly disruptive\u201d social distancing measures were likely to be in place until 2021. That is a very different prospect, and it requires us to adjust our clocks. The sober, uber-rational health correspondent of the New York Times, Donald McNeil, suggests an easing by the end of the year is optimistic, given how long it will take to produce either a vaccine or effective treatment for Covid-19. He spoke of how he is expecting a grandchild in June \u2013 and is coming to terms with the possibility that he might not meet that child until he or she is two years old. For everyone, this is a challenge of a different order. A sustained, long-run lockdown means that a vast stretch of undifferentiated time is unfurling ahead of us, stripped bare of the usual divisions and markers. We are facing a form of confinement that will not be brief. Tentatively, I called up Erwin James, who served 20 years of a life sentence for murder and for several years wrote a column for the Guardian called A Life Inside. I say tentatively because I wasn\u2019t sure a former prisoner would have much patience for comparisons between the kind of lockdown we are enduring \u2013 in our own homes, sometimes with a garden, often with family, permitted to go to the shops or the park \u2013 and the incarceration that he experienced. And yet, if anyone knows about the tricks restriction can play with time, it\u2019s a former inmate. It turns out I needn\u2019t have hesitated. \u201cThere are so many resonances with prison,\u201d James tells me. So much so that the letters page of the paper he edits for prisoners and detainees \u2013 called, fittingly enough, Inside Time \u2013 has been filled with little else.

His face is red and he barely finishes a sentence before he is tripping over the next.</p> <p>\u201cThis was totally unexpected,\u201d says DiBitetto about the virality of his video, but, he adds: \u201cObviously I struck a nerve.\u201d</p> <p>DiBitetto, a comedian from Brooklyn, decided to film the clip in his car because he didn\u2019t want to upset his wife: he knows he has a propensity to curse and spit when he is angry. He had to cancel all of his shows due to the Covid-19 pandemic and, with no money coming in, he has been relying on his wife to pay the bills.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand we have to [stay home] \u2013 quarantine, safe distance \u2013 saves lives.

He knows the American working class is hurting right now, which spurs him. He says one woman contacted him from her death bed, to say the video hit the nail on the head.

      "bodyText": "Vic DiBitetto is a performer, so he\u2019s used to drawing in big crowd \u2013 but he didn\u2019t quite expect that a recent video he made would be viewed over 10m times. The near five-minute rant about the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus shows DiBitetto, a New Yorker, enunciating so much that spit flies around him in the car. His face is red and he barely finishes a sentence before he is tripping over the next. \u201cThis was totally unexpected,\u201d says DiBitetto about the virality of his video, but, he adds: \u201cObviously I struck a nerve.\u201d DiBitetto, a comedian from Brooklyn, decided to film the clip in his car because he didn\u2019t want to upset his wife: he knows he has a propensity to curse and spit when he is angry. He had to cancel all of his shows due to the Covid-19 pandemic and, with no money coming in, he has been relying on his wife to pay the bills. \u201cWe understand we have to [stay home] \u2013 quarantine, safe distance \u2013 saves lives. But I am not working, I have no income coming in. [They are offering] $1,200 \u2013 what does that do? There\u2019s gotta be a better plan for this,\u201d he says. DiBitetto describes himself as working class (\u201cI\u2019m not Ivy League, I was born in Brooklyn, I was raised in the streets,\u201d he says when I mention all the love his strong New York accent got online). He knows the American working class is hurting right now, which spurs him. He says one woman contacted him from her death bed, to say the video hit the nail on the head. Others, he says, think he should run for president. \u201cDo you know how frustrating it is to see the government bailing out banks and airlines? Here we are saving for a rainy day, how come they didn\u2019t save for a rainy day? Now we gotta bail them out with our tax money?\u201d he says. Does he believe that there isn\u2019t enough to go around? \u201cThere\u2019s money out there but it\u2019s going to the wrong people,\u201d he says. DiBitetto believes that the video resonated because people could see the raw anger and emotion throughout. But was it prepared in advance? He did knock around some ideas with his manager before he recorded the video, but he wants people to know that it wasn\u2019t an act. \u201cThat video isn\u2019t an act, that\u2019s coming from the heart and soul. It resonated with working people because we have no voice in this country,\u201d he says.",

All I\u2019m being offered is an alternative flight or vouchers. Is this legal?</b></p>\n    <p>No. But that hasn\u2019t stopped a number of airlines doing exactly that. All flights on EU carriers within, or into the EU, and all flights leaving from an EU airport, are protected by the EU\u2019s \u201cdenied boarding\u201d rules, which require a full refund in seven days when flights are cancelled.</p>\n    <p>The problem for consumers is that enforcing these rights is proving very difficult. After initially promising to refund passengers within 20 working days, Ryanair has now said passengers should accept vouchers valid for 12 months, or wait until the Covid-19 pandemic is over for a refund.</p>\n    <p>Refunds at British Airways are only being processed by customer services which, of course, is impossible to contact. easyJet, initially only offered refunds through customer services but now has a web portal to request refunds.</p>\n    <p>Note: the EU cancellation rules do not apply to non-EU carriers where the flight started outside the EU \u2013 for example, a Korean Air flight from Seoul to London.</p>\n    <p><b>In the face of a no-refund policy, what should I do</b>?</p>\n    <p>Taking the offer of replacement vouchers in the current climate is highly risky given the airline may not be around in six months. While some will be happy to accept vouchers, many will not.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Coby Benson of the specialist flight compensation lawyers, Bott&nbsp;and Co, advises passengers to submit their refund request in writing, using the following text:</p>\n    <p><i>I understand that my flight [fight number] on [flight date] has been cancelled and I therefore request a full refund pursuant to articles 5(1)(a) and 8(1)(a) of EC Regulation No.261/2004. You are reminded that the refund must be made within seven days. For the avoidance of doubt, I do not accept a travel voucher.</i></p>\n    <p>If the airline does not respond or does not agree then the passenger can either issue court proceedings or use <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alternative-dispute-resolution-for-consumers/alternative-dispute-resolution-for-consumers\">Alternative Dispute Resolution</a>.</p>\n    <p>If your flight cost more than \u00a3100 and was booked using a credit card, you can hold the card provider jointly liable. When things calm down we suspect many passengers will be forced down this route.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>My flight operated as scheduled but I was unable to go on it. What then?</b><br></p>\n    <p>The fact that the government advised against all but essential travel means travel insurance policies should pay foreign trip cancellation claims provided you bought your policy before the pandemic was declared on 11 March.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Miles Brignall</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe taskforce is looking closely at these practices \u2013 with a focus on sectors and individual businesses that have been the subject of a high volume of complaints \u2013 and next steps will be announced next week,\u201d the CMA said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe CMA will not hesitate to take enforcement action if there is evidence that businesses have breached competition or consumer protection law.\u201d</p> \n<p>The proposed action comes after the consumer group Which? claimed that 20 of the UK\u2019s largest airline operators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/22/big-uk-airlines-and-travel-firms-denying-refunds-which-coronavirus\">were illegally withholding refunds </a>that should be paid within 14 days.</p> \n<p>Which? also found that 10 of the UK\u2019s biggest travel companies, including Love Holidays and Tui, were not offering full refunds within the legal time limit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email sign-up\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The CMA taskforce has received 21,000 complaints about coronavirus-related issues <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/20/new-uk-taskforce-to-crack-down-on-coronavirus-profiteers\">since its launch last month</a>.

      "bodyText": "Dyson will not supply medical ventilators to help the NHS treat Covid-19 patients after the government told the engineering firm that its services were no longer required. Sir James Dyson, the company\u2019s billionaire founder, said the company had already spent around \u00a320m on the project but would not be seeking any public money to cover its costs. The government had lodged a provisional order with the company for 10,000 of a prototype ventilator called the CoVent, which the company designed in a fortnight. The order was conditional on the device receiving regulatory approval from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). While the MHRA is not thought to have rejected the CoVent, approval was expected to take some time and the NHS\u2019 need for ventilators has so far proved lower than the 18,000 that health secretary Matt Hancock said might be required. \u201c[Our] people welcomed the government\u2019s challenge,\u201d said Dyson, after the Daily Telegraph reported his company had been told to stand down. \u201cMercifully they are not required, but we don\u2019t regret our contribution to the national effort for one moment. I have some hope that our ventilator we may yet help the response in other countries, but that requires further time and investigation. \u201cThe team have worked 24/7 to design and manufacture a sophisticated ventilator in a short timeframe \u2013 I hope they can spend this weekend with their families who will not have seen them for weeks.\u201d A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \u201cA number of devices are [\u2026] going through the necessary tests for regulatory approval. No decisions have been made on those devices and we will provide an update in due course.\u201d The government commissioned several companies to supply 10,000 brand new ventilators each, awarding contracts to Dyson, defence company Babcock and a Cambridge-based group called Sagentia, a subsidiary of Science Group. But none of the companies has so far received regulatory approval for new devices. Dyson\u2019s is the second project to be abandoned, after an effort involving the Renault and Aston Martin Red Bull Formula One teams was stood down due to a change in the specifications set by the government for new devices. The only group to have secured regulatory approval and supplied ventilators to the NHS in significant numbers is Ventilator Challenge UK, a consortium of manufacturers that focused on scaling up production of proven devices, rather than building new ones. The consortium has delivered more than 250 to the NHS, expects to reach production of 1,500 by early May and could supply up to 20,000 devices made by Oxfordshire specialist Penlon and Luton-based Smiths Medical.",

Professors of AI at the Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica and \u201ctwo of the most important scientists in Europe\u201d according to Granero, they and he worked with a network of data analysts, doctors and scientists to fine-tune their models.</p> <p>\u201cThe principal error in descriptive analysis is that it doesn\u2019t respond to the question the club is actually asking,\u201d Granero says. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at a player to sign, I\u2019m not so interested in what he did last year as asking: \u2018Look, if I sign this player, how will he work here, in my context?\u2019 And that answer can only be provided by artificial intelligence.</p> <p>\u201cPeople tend to think of AI as a kind of magic; it\u2019s not, it\u2019s analysis. It\u2019s not a rejection of intuitive, \u2018inside\u2019 football knowledge, either. Or machine over man. Quite the opposite. You need intuition, understanding, to even identify the variables to be measured. The role of the expert is primordial, defining the analysis you need.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, you might ask: \u2018How can we get <em>this</em> player in <em>this</em> area of the pitch and generate a chance in fewer than three passes?\u2019 You can measure that, analyse it, and generate statistics on a descriptive level but also measure that as a predictive variable, enabling you to identify players who can perform that role. Applying the data in a predictive manner is the big leap.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call football mechanised but everything you do is susceptible to being converted into data, although there are intangibles, chance. What we do is build the tools that strengthen an expert\u2019s ability: a sporting director, say, or a doctor preventing injuries. In the same way a mathematician uses a calculator, we provide the tool that facilitates the process. We always say that human and machine working together are much stronger than either on their own.</p> <p>\u201cUncertainty can never be zero. These are models of probability, not deterministic. It\u2019s not a crystal ball. What it can tell you scientifically is that there is a certain type of player in the third division in Holland, say, that if you sign him there\u2019s a 95% chance he will score between 12 and 15 goals.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"950ae184bfcb4123c211156e62feb9a7bdb7f7da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/950ae184bfcb4123c211156e62feb9a7bdb7f7da/0_94_3324_2170/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Esteban Granero playing for QPR against Chelsea 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Esteban Granero playing for QPR against Chelsea 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked how often the model is right, Granero replies: \u201cThe normal thing is for it to get it right. Lots, lots, lots of players finish with the numbers predicted. At most you\u2019re talking one or two off. The prediction models are tested, validated, held against reality. It\u2019s not an easy process: some time ago these models didn\u2019t exist and we have worked at this, getting it right. When you see it works, the results are powerful. With so much in play and with these tools now available to help you take decisions better, bloody hell, it\u2019s your responsibility to do so.\u201d</p> <p>There is far more in play now and the responsibility is greater. \u201cI got a call from a friend of mine who had created a platform called Stop Corona, asking if we wanted to help predict the evolution of the virus,\u201d Granero says. \u201cWe thought we had the tools to help and that it was our responsibility to contribute.

European leaders are divided about the size of the financial package. There are even deeper divisions over what portion of the scheme will be grants, and what portion will be loans. Broadly speaking, southern European economies are calling for grants, while the northern members are keen on loans. The lingering division is hanging over sentiment.</p> <p>Hopes for a potential Covid-19 treatment were running high this day last week, as Remdesivir, an antiviral drug produced by Gilead Sciences, was reported to have helped patients with fever and respiratory problems. Those hopes were dashed when a medical trial in China said the drug was unsuccessful. When it comes to the pharma industry, there is usually a lot of trial and error, so I doubt we have heard the last about a potential treatment for the coronavirus. </p> </blockquote> <p>Indeed.

      "bodyText": "Finally, European stock markets have all closed lower tonight, as investors continue to worry about the scale of the Covid-19 lockdown. A late flurry of selling has sent all the indices deeper into the red, with the Stoxx 600 losing 1.3% today -- leaving it down 1.2% for the week. Here\u2019s the damage: FTSE 100: down 75 points at 5752 German DAX: down 177 points or 1.7% at 10,336 French CAC: down 57 points or 1.3% at 4,393 There are plenty of reasons for pessimism today, including that: UK retail sales fell at their fastest ever monthly pace in March German business confidence has hit a record low US durable goods orders have tanked, due to a slump in aircraft demand US consumer confidence has dropped sharply And with Gatwick airport warning that travel won\u2019t fully recover for four years, and boardroom pay cuts at Burberry and JD Sports, the crisis has a long way to run. Traders are also disappointed by the overnight news that Gilead\u2019s Remdesiver drug did not perform well in its first trial (although that test data did vanish as it\u2019s not been fully reviewed yet, apparently). David Madden of CMC Markets says Europe\u2019s struggle to agree a rescue deal to combat the Covid-19 downturn is also weighing on markets: Stocks markets are in the red as traders are a little downbeat on account of the lack of progress in relation to an EU rescue package, as well as the disappointing results for a potential Covid-19 treatment. European leaders are divided about the size of the financial package. There are even deeper divisions over what portion of the scheme will be grants, and what portion will be loans. Broadly speaking, southern European economies are calling for grants, while the northern members are keen on loans. The lingering division is hanging over sentiment. Hopes for a potential Covid-19 treatment were running high this day last week, as Remdesivir, an antiviral drug produced by Gilead Sciences, was reported to have helped patients with fever and respiratory problems. Those hopes were dashed when a medical trial in China said the drug was unsuccessful. When it comes to the pharma industry, there is usually a lot of trial and error, so I doubt we have heard the last about a potential treatment for the coronavirus. Indeed. On that note, have a lovely weekend (don\u2019t go too far!). GW In another example of retail gloom, Debenhams is to permanently close four more stores with the loss of 239 jobs after failing to reach agreements with landlords. It is understood that the stores in Swindon, Kidderminster, Borehamwood and Southampton, which were closed last month under the government\u2019s coronavirus restrictions on non-essential retailers, will not reopen when the lockdown is eased. The department store, which collapsed into administration last week, has reached agreement on 120 sites which are expected to continue to operate the future of 11 more hang in the balance. It emerged last week that seven stores, including Salisbury, Westfield in west London, Leamington Spa, and South Shields, would permanently close after more than 20 closed in the previous few months. On Friday Mark Gifford, the new chairman of Debenhams, wrote to the Welsh government saying that the group\u2019s stores in Wales were also at risk because the regional government has decided not to offer a business rates holiday on sites with a rateable value over \u00a3500,000. About half the group\u2019s nine Welsh stores are thought to be in that bracket paying more than \u00a32m a year total in rates between them. Behind the charts, graphs and numbers which make up economic data are real stories of human misery. And that includes the sad news that more than 200 Oasis and Warehouse head office staff have been left struggling for cash after being laid off a fortnight before pay day. The design, buying and merchandising staff who had not been furloughed under the government job protection scheme and had been working on producing the two brands\u2019 fashion collections for next year, have been told they will have to apply for government assistance to cover back pay owed as well as holiday pay and redundancy pay outs. Oasis and Warehouse last week called in administrators from advisory firm Deloitte after owner Kaupthing, the Iceland bank, failed to find a buyer for the retail businesses. More than 1,800 retail store staff have been put on furlough under the government\u2019s job protection scheme but only about 40 head office staff remain in post. One former Warehouse staff member is worried about how she would pay her mortgage. She says: \u201cI felt complete shock. We had no idea the company was in financial difficulties. We had hoped we might be furloughed. We\u2019re all in a tricky situation. There are no jobs for us to go to and some people were on maternity leave or pregnant so they are really stuck.\u201d There\u2019s time for some late pessimism too. Barclays has slashed its economic forecasts for the UK. It now expects the economy to shrink by 8% this year, which would be the worst recession in decades. More alarmingly, its economists reckon growth will only recover slowly, and that unemployment will soon hit 9% (from just 4% in the last quarter). A longer lock down, policy frictions and a less favourable global backdrop lead us to cut our forecasts for the UK. We now expect 2020 GDP to drop 8% and remain 4% below pre-virus trend by end 2021. We see unemployment peaking near 9% in Q2 20, the budget deficit ballooning to 10.8% of GDP and the debt-GDP ratio above 100%. Some late UK news... high street chain JD Sports has decided not to pay a final dividend to shareholders this year, due to the Covid-19 crisis. Its board and senior management team are all taking voluntary pay cuts of at least 25% \u201cfor the current period of disruption\u201d, with executive chairman Peter Cowgill giving up 75%. More here. Today\u2019s fall means that US consumer confidence is now around its lowest since the end of 2011: The bad economic news keeps coming today. The latest blow is that US consumer sentiment has fallen sharply this month, for the third month running. The University of Michigan\u2019s index of morale has dropped to 71.8 for April, down from 89.1 in March. The \u2018current conditions index\u2019 (asking people how they doing right now) tumbled from 103.7 to 74.4. The \u2018consumer expectations index\u2019 (measuring optimism for the future) fell too, from 79.7 to 70.1. Alarmingly, the slump in US durable goods orders last month is worse than during the 2008-09 crisis. Back in the UK, the competition watchdog has warned it will set out measures to tackle concerns about refunds and cancellations in the travel industry after a surge in complaints. The Competition and Markets Authority said four in five complaints to its coronavirus taskforce related to refunds and cancellations. It said it was \u201cparticularly concerned\u201d about firms refusing refunds and \u201cintroducing unnecessary complexity into the process of obtaining refunds; charging high administration or cancellation fees; and pressuring consumers into accepting vouchers instead of cash refunds.\u201d The taskforce has received 21,000 complaints about coronavirus-related issues since its launch last month. It has sent advisory or warning letters to 187 firms after receiving 2,500 complaints about large price rises on food and personal hygiene products, such as hand sanitiser. The largest price increases were on hand sanitiser, with an average 367% rise reported. Wall Street is shrugging off today\u2019s hotpot of dire economic data. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 0.4% in early trading, up 102 points at 23,617. This is the worst slump in US durable goods orders since 2014. It\u2019s mainly due to a huge drop in demand for civilian aircraft. According to Bloomberg, civilian aircraft maker recorded negative orders of $16.3 billion, a drop of around 300%. That, I think, means the number of cancelled orders far exceeded any new orders, as the airline industry grounds its fleets. Newsflash: Orders for US durable goods have tumbled sharply, adding to the growing chorus of grim economic news. Orders for heavy-duty machinery, electronics devices, transport equipment and the like fell by 14.4% in March, new figures from the Commerce Department show. That\u2019s down from a 1.1% rise in February, and even worse than the 12% drop expected. Strip out defence orders, and it\u2019s a 15.8% decline, showing a sharp drop in economic demand. It\u2019s an early sign of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the US economy. Falling orders ultimately mean lower production, so the knock-on impact will be felt in the coming months. Bloomberg reckons Germany\u2019s economic gloom will continue for some time, judging by today\u2019s tumble in confidence: The Ifo Institute\u2019s index dropped to a record-low 74.3, well below economists\u2019 median estimate. Reduced spending power from millions of furloughed workers and the persistence of the coronavirus pandemic in some of Germany\u2019s largest trading destinations are set to weigh on business for some time to come -- with a gauge for expectations down more than 10 points. As lunch approaches, Europe\u2019s stock markets are still slightly lower today. FTSE 100: down 33 points or 0.5% at 5793 German DAX: down 44 points or 0.4% at 10,469 French CAC: down 15 points or 0.35% at 4,435 As things stand, through, the FTSE 100 is on track to end the week broadly unchanged. It fell sharply on Tuesday after oil prices buckled, but recovered on Wednesday. This welcome drop in volatility shows that investors have stopped panicking about the pandemic - but are now trying to assess how long it will last, and how quickly companiy earnings will recover. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says: The FTSE 100 is down 23.8% so far this year. Across the index, 41 stocks have managed to outperform the market, eight of whom have actually delivered positive returns this year. These include precious metals miner Polymetal up 42.7% and grocery expert Ocado up 26.5%. \u201cInvesting in gold, food, water, medicine and household goods seem to have been the winning trades through this crisis,\u201d McDonald is helping the UK\u2019s drive to get essential workers tested for Covid-19. The fast food chain has handed over use of its drive thru restaurant in Meridian Business Park in Leicester for use by DHU Healthcare to test NHS workers for the virus. McDonalds stores have been closed for the last month, under the lockdown, so it\u2019s nice to see one being put to good use. The testing system certainly needs help. Earlier today the Department of Health and Social Care apologised after the website set up for key workers to book Covid-19 tests stopped accepting applications due to high demand. Here\u2019s a handy chart showing how Germany business confidence took an almighty tumble today: One German government source has told Reuters that they expect GDP to shrink by 6% during 2020 - which would be the worst since the second world war. Reuters explains: The economy will rebound from the coronavirus pandemic in 2021 with growth of more than 5%, the source added. Spiegel magazine reported the figures first, citing an Economy Ministry forecast to be unveiled next week. An Economy Ministry spokeswoman said there were no final growth forecasts yet. London Gatwick says it does not expect passengers to come back to pre-Covid levels for another four years. Chief executive Stewart Wingate said the airport, which mainly serves leisure routes for holidaymakers in the south east, still had \u201cconfidence in the medium and longer term\u201d and could survive even if flights did not resume this summer. Around 2,000 staff have been furloughed and more than 500 employees have been let go altogether. The airport has secured a \u00a3300m loan as it burns through cash at the rate of \u00a325-30m a month. Some 600 staff remain at work. Wingate said the predictions were modelled on the aftermath of the financial crisis and Sars, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re determined to keep Gatwick open so as and when airlines can fly again we can immediately ramp up.\u201d At its peak Gatwick handled 55 flights an hour. Now the airport has closed its north terminal and operates only for a short window each day. Apart from some repatriation flights and the occasional humanitarian flight with medical supplies, there are now just three regular scheduled flights \u2013 one of which is a thrice-weekly Belavia service to Minsk. With less being spent in the shops, restaurants and cinemas closed, and sporting events on hold, some people are going to inadvertently end up saving money. So says the CEBR thinktank today. It has calculated that household spending will fall by 30% during the lockdown. So even allowing for wage cuts to furloughed workers, and a rise in job cuts, savings will rise. Josie Dent, a senior economist at CEBR, explains: \u201cAs shown in today\u2019s retail sales figures, many people are cutting back on their spending amid the coronavirus crisis, due to shops being closed as well as economic uncertainty prompting many to save. Cebr has estimated that during the lockdown, total household spending will be 30% lower than what it was before the crisis. Therefore, despite falling incomes due to wage cuts and rising unemployment, the amount households save each month is expected to be 130% higher under lockdown than before the crisis.\u201d The CEBR has also calculated that household disposable incomes will fall by an average of \u00a3515 per week during the lockdown, as some families are squeezed badly. Here\u2019s our full story on drop in retail sales, despite that strong demand for food and alcohol. Economists have been chewing through today\u2019s UK retail sales report. The CBI\u2019s Alpesh Paleja shows how food shops have been busier than ever, but non-food shops were rocked by the lockdown: Simon French of Panmure Gordon reckons online retailers will enjoy a long-term boost, now more people have signed up with them. IFO have also warned that Germany faces its toughest economic challenge since reunification 30 years ago. They don\u2019t expect a V-shaped recovery either. Business optimism in Germany has suffered a record slump, as the coronavirus pandemic rocks Europe\u2019s largest economy. The monthly IFO survey of German business morale has slumped to 74.3, from 85.9 in March. That\u2019s a record low, and also the biggest monthly fall on record. Companies reported that their current economic situation has deteriorated alarmingly, and that they\u2019re extremely worried about the future. IFO President Clemens Fuest called the drop in sentiment \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d adding that: \u201cThe coronavirus crisis is striking the German economy with full fury.\u201d Karen Johnson, head of retail &amp; wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, sees some green shoots amid the slump in UK retail sales. \u201cMarch was a watershed month for UK retail. As the lockdown came into full effect and many high street businesses closed their doors to customers, sales were down across the board \u2013 with the second half of March showing a particularly sharp drop. \u201cAlthough the headline figures were expected, there have been some glimmers of hope amongst the shutdown, with spend on food and drink a notable (if not unexpected) area of success. Whilst most \u2018bricks and mortar\u2019 retailers have seen walk-in demand disappear, early indications are that online spending has also performed better than predicted \u2013 showing that consumer spend has not closed down entirely.\u201d The City may agree. Ocado, the online grocer, is currently leading the FTSE 100 risers - up 1%. Sainsbury are up 0.7%, defying the wider gloomy mood this morning. With demand for luxury clothing down, Burberry has turned its hand to producing personal protective equipment for NHS staff. It told shareholders this morning that it has produced more than 100,000 piece of PPE kit, at a time when NHS staff are running dangerously short. Burberry, which has temporarily closed its retail outlets, says: Our trench coat factory in Castleford is now manufacturing non-surgical gowns and supplying them to the UK National Health Service. We are also sourcing surgical masks through our supply chain and supplying them to the NHS and charities such as Marie Curie, which provides nursing care for families living with terminal illness in the UK. To date, we have donated more than 100,000 pieces of PPE. Burberry is also keeping paying its staff in full, rather than furloughing them. Seniot managers are taking a 20% pay cut from April to June. UK housebuilder Persimmon says it will resume work next week, a month after suspending operations to comply with the lockdown. It says it has \u201cdeveloped and tested a range of new site protocols\u201d to enable work to restart next week, telling shareholders: The Group is therefore announcing today that it will begin a phased re-opening of its construction sites from the morning of Monday 27 April 2020 which will allow us to support our customers by completing the construction of the new homes they have purchased in a safe and responsible manner. Persimmon argues that it\u2019s acting \u201cin response to the UK Government\u2019s objective of getting the construction sector back to work\u201d. The tumble in retail sales last month is another reminder of the economic cost of the lockdown. Yesterday we learned that activity at Britain\u2019s factories and offices is shrinking extremely fast, with the Bank of England warning of the worst contraction in at least a century. But the health secretary, Matt Hancock, insists that the lockdown will continue until it\u2019s safe to proceed. He told Radio 4 a few minutes ago: \u201cI will not allow for changes to be made that are unsafe. We\u2019ve got to keep the public safe. And I understand the economic pressures, that is my background and I care deeply about that. \u201cI understand those voices who are saying that we should move sooner, but that is not something we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019re going to move when it is safe to do so.\u201d Hancock also points out that lifting the lockdown too early, triggering a second spike of cases, would cause more economic damage. Our UK-focused coronavirus liveblog has more details: Away from retail, Pearson is to pay its \u00a3100m final dividend for 2019 to investors and says it will not need to furlough any staff as the global learning company weathers the coronavirus. John Fallon, the outgoing chief executive of the FTSE100 company, said that the company\u2019s transition to e-learning meant that it was well-positioned for a post-coronavirus world with increased social distancing and remote learning. He told shareholders this morning: \u201cWhen the threat of the pandemic eventually eases, it will be even clearer that the future of learning is increasingly digital.\u201d The company, which reported a 5% fall in global revenues for the first quarter, is losing \u00a320m to \u00a330m a month as its test centres remain shut. However, the company has identified \u00a350m in savings this year, and has about \u00a3800m in financial facilities at its disposal. \u201cWe are in a strong financial position with a healthy balance sheet, low net debt and good liquidity,\u201d said Fallon, who is taking a temporary 25% pay cut. Pearson also announced it is to launch UK Learns, an online portal which contains free, digital, skills-based courses to help those whose jobs have been impacted by coronavirus. European stock markets have dropped opened lower, with the FTSE 100 shedding 77 points or 1.3% to 5748. Disappointment that Gilead\u2019s Remdesivir drug has apparently failed a Covid-19 test has dampened investors\u2019 mood, with the European-wide Stoxx 600 index down 1%. Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that corovavirus patients could be injected with disinfectant or bathed in ultraviolet light (no, it\u2019s not April 1st) has not helped the mood in the markets either. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management explains: Economists are dealing with three levels of uncertainty. Uncertainty about the virus. Uncertainty about the policy response. Uncertainty about the economic response to the virus and to policy. Changes in any one of those change economic outcomes. Reports of poor test results for a possible treatment weakened risk markets somewhat. US President Trump\u2019s suggestion that injecting disinfectant or bright lights be investigated did not reverse that weakness. Although online shopping hit a record high last month (as a share of all shopping), it still only made up less than a quarter of spending (22.3%). Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, reckons retailers are struggling to cope with demand (a familiar tale for anyone who tried to book a supermarket delivery slot): With the high street locked down in the second half of the month, online sales did make up some of the slack with growth of 12.5% compared to last March. However, with only a 20% rise in online grocery sales despite the Prime Minister encouraging us to \u2018use food delivery services where you can\u2019, this suggests that operators are hampered by limited capacity in the face of increased demand, and this number could have been even higher. The record drop in UK retail sales last month shows that consumption is falling fast under the lockdown, says Thomas Pugh of Capital Economics: At one end, there were clear signs the pandemic was keeping consumers away from the high street, non-food sales excluding petrol and online sales were down by 19.4% m/m, with an especially sharp 34.8% m/m fall in clothing sales. And petrol sales declined by 18.9% m/m. Department store sales did rise by 2.8% m/m, but appears to be due to purchases of food and other items online. On the other hand, food &amp; drink sales were up 10.4% m/m (within that alcohol 31.4%!) and online sales (non-department store) rose by 5.9% m/m, as consumers were locked down at home. Alan Custis, head of UK equities at Lazard Asset Management, says the lockdown misery is continuing for most, but not all, retailers: \u201cThe March retail sales data shows a sharp decline month on month. However, the real story will be seen in April\u2019s figures when the lock-down will be fully felt by retailers. Here we expect to see dire numbers, but it must be balanced up by very strong online sales, which we expect will be showing growth in excess of 50% year on year. There have been clear winners and losers and we think this will only become more apparent the longer the crisis continues.\u201d Ayush Ansal, chief investment officer at hedge fund Crimson Black Capital, says UK shops are already facing \u201cretail armageddon\u201d. \u201cWhile the January retail sales data showed signs of the Boris Bounce, the March data reflected the Covid-19 collapse. \u201cUnsurprisingly, food stores performed well in March and more people than ever started to buy online. \u201cThe rise in alcohol sales is particularly pronounced and will not go unnoticed. \u201cAs catastrophic as it is, this data will have been priced in by markets. Everyone saw it coming.\u201d The record tumble in UK retail sales last month is clearly visible in this chart: But supermarkets, and specialist food and alcohol stores, bucked this trend with double-digit sales growth: Retail sales across the UK have fallen at a record pace under the lockdown, but demand for alcohol has soared. The latest retail sales figures, just released, show that monthly retail sales volume fell by 5.1% in March. That\u2019s the largest monthly fall since the series began, and shows the impact of shutting non-essential stores last month. The Office for National Statistics reports that sales at clothing stores tumbled nearly 35% during the month. But supermarket stores posted a 10.3% jump in sales volumes - as people tried to stockpile goods as the lockdown began. Alcohol stores were even busier, with sales soaring 31.4% in volume terms. Anecdotal reports that Brits have been drinking their way through the lockdown, now they can\u2019t go to the local pub, appear to have some weight..... The ONS explains: Comments from food store retailers suggested that panic buying, or stockpiling during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, was a big factor in the increased sales, particularly for supermarkets (Table 3). Store closures were a reason provided by smaller food stores for reduced sales, although a small number did diversify with delivery-only orders. And...more shoppers than ever before tried to order goods online last month, as they tried to avoid catching Covid-19. Online sales as a proportion of all retailing reached a record high of 22.3% in March 2020 as consumers switched to online purchasing following the pandemic. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets are ending the week on the back foot as pessimism over the coronavirus outbreak rises. Overnight, one of the drugs seen as a good prospect for treating Covid-19 has failed a trial. Tests of Remdesivir did not show any benefits, according to a preliminary report on the World Health Organization clinical trials database (before vanishing). That\u2019s a blow to hopes that Remdesivir could address the pandemic -- as Donald Trump has been arguing. Shares in Gilead, which makes Remdesivir, fell 4% yesterday, as traders reacted to the report. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, Senior Analyst at Swissquote Bank, says: The US stock markets closed Thursday\u2019s session flat, while Gilead shares tumbled past 4% after the company\u2019s Covid-19 drug remdesivir gave poor clinical results in a Chinese trial according to the Financial Times report based on accidentally released draft documents by the World Health Organization. New cases in Europe seem to be on a falling trend as attention turns toward the winding down of the economic shutdowns across the continent. But news is mixed in the US, with reports pointing at significantly higher contagion numbers in New York compared with the official counts. Fatalities in California rose the most during the last 24 hours. European stock markets are expected to open lower, with the FTSE 100 down over 1% in pre-market trading: A new survey from the Economist Intelligence Unit has shown that chief executives across the globe are extremely pessimistic about the pandemic. It reports: Sentiment about the global economy over the next three months registered at -39.2 on a scale of -50 (much worse) to +50 (much better). Executives tend to be less pessimistic about prospects for their own industry (-22.0) and company (-17.8) over the same period. No industry will be spared from the impact of covid-19 but nearly all respondents do not see revenue or profitability cratering. New consumer confidence figures from Germany and the US could add to the gloom, with US durable goods orders also expected to have fallen last month. The agenda 9am BST: IFO survey of German business confidence 1.30pm BST: US durable goods orders in March - expected to fall 12% 3pm BST: University of Michigan\u2019s survey of US consumer confidence - expected to drop to 67.9 from 71 5pm BST: The Baker Hughes weekly count of US oil rigs",

      "bodyText": "No checks will be made on whether those requesting coronavirus tests are genuinely essential workers, the government has admitted, after demand for home kits ran out in two minutes and appointments for drive-through tests were filled within three hours. Ministers said they were trusting the public to be honest about applying for essential worker tests. This leaves the system open to abuse, with one man who successfully applied for a drive-in test minutes after the scheme opened saying \u201cany Tom, Dick or Harry\u201d can get a test. The government insisted there was no evidence that high demand for tests was linked to fraudulent applications. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, promised on Thursday that up to 10 million essential workers and their families would be able to apply for a drive-in test or home-testing kit from 6am on Friday. Within two minutes, all the 5,000 available kits had been ordered. The government was forced to apologise after high demand for the drive-through appointments ran out before 8.30am. There was also a \u201ctechnical problem\u201d with the government website shortly after 8am. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said during the daily press conference later that 16,000 testing slots had been booked on Friday and dismissed suggestions that the website allowing critical workers to book tests had crashed: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in the last few days this difference between the capacity available (I think the last figure I saw was 51,000) and the number of tests done (28,000 yesterday), and how important it is to make sure we\u2019re using that available capacity, people being able to book online directly \u2013 that\u2019s all the critical workers, 10.72 million people with their families, are those who are able now to use that site. \u201cI can tell you, 16,000 of those [tests] were booked during the first period of that being online and the site has actually been brought back up around now for more people to go and book tests.

Applications for a fresh batch of kits and drive-through appointments will reopen at 8am on Saturday. A spokesman said the government was relying on the public to be honest. \u201cAs with many aspects of the coronavirus response, we would expect the public to respond in good faith and that is what they have done with other aspects of the scheme and I think we would expect it to be the same here,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>The Dutch government has announced measures including huge cuts to coal use, garden greening and limits on livestock herds as part of its plan to lower emissions to comply with a supreme court ruling.</p> <p>Climate litigation activists described the move as \u201can enormous win\u201d. The small non-profit Urgenda Foundation, which filed the initial legal challenge in 2013, said this and earlier compliance measures totalled about \u20ac3bn euros, which confirms the impact of the world\u2019s most successful climate lawsuit to date.</p> <p>Under the new package, coal-fired power stations will have to scale back or close completely , cattle and pig herds will be reduced, subsidies will be provided to home owners to use less concrete and more plants in their gardens, and industry will have to find alternatives for several polluting processes.</p> <p>\u201cThat is an enormous win,\u201d said Marjan Minnesma, the director of Urgenda, which has 15-staff and operates out of two former school classrooms. \u201cFor many people this will give hope that it is possible to use the law as a strategic instrument for change.\u201d</p> <p>After a seven-year legal battle, the supreme court in the Hague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/20/dutch-supreme-court-upholds-landmark-ruling-demanding-climate-action\">ordered the government</a> in December to reduce emissions by 15 megatonnes in 2020. The judges accepted Urgenda\u2019s argument that climate change posed a dangerous threat to human rights and the Netherlands needed to accelerate its actions to meet its international commitment of a 25% cut compared with 1990.</p> <p>To comply, the government has adopted 30 of the proposals in Urgenda\u2019s \u201c54 Climate Solutions Plan\u201d, which was drawn up in collaboration with 800 civil society groups and other organisations.</p> <p>The headline change is a 75% reduction in capacity at the country\u2019s three coal-fired power stations, all of which have been opened in the past five years. The government is also reportedly in negotiations to close one of these plants.</p> <p>In addition, it will provide about \u20ac400m for household energy saving measures such as double glazing, \u20ac360m to compensate farmers for livestock reductions, and \u20ac30m for LED lighting in greenhouses.</p> <p>Along with earlier steps \u2013 including lower speed limits to control emissions of nitrogen dioxide, \u20ac2bn for rooftop solar and other forms of renewable energy, solar panels on all school rooftops, more sustainable forestry and changes in the use of concrete, the measures are expected to save 8 megatonnes of emissions this year and provide extra benefits in terms of air quality and wildlife habitat.</p> <p>Minnesma said this should be seen as a \u201cpromising start\u201d because the government is still about 4 megatonnes short of its obligations. She said the coronavirus lockdown should not be used as an excuse to backpedal.</p> <p>The package was presented to parliament on Friday afternoon. The government said the measures would provide an economic stimulus and also help to reduce<strong> </strong>nitrogen pollution, which has been the subject of other legal actions.</p> <p>MPs said the package should inspire activists across the world to pursue litigation against governments that drag their feet.</p> <p>\u201cWithout a doubt this should encourage climate lawsuits in other countries. It\u2019s a shining example,\u201d said Green party politician Tom van der Lee. \u201cThis package wouldn\u2019t be there without an order from the highest court. Without that verdict, the government would have chosen a slower trajectory.\u201d</p> <p>The environmental law charity ClientEarth said the result was unprecedented in Europe and testament to the impact of climate litigation, which is spreading around the world. \u201cThe Urgenda case should be considered a groundbreaking success, not just legally, but for driving real world action on climate change,\u201d Sophie Marjanac, a ClientEarth lawyer.</p> <p>The Dutch legal system\u2019s ease of access and political independence of judges helped to make the case possible. If Urgenda had lost, they would only have had to pay \u20ac18,000 rather than the government\u2019s extensive costs.</p> <p>The Urgenda case has been closely watched around the world. While climate activists have welcomed the outcome, they urge the Netherlands to raise ambition beyond 2020 compliance with the orders of the supreme court. \u201cThe Netherlands now needs to lay out a strategy to reach net zero by around the middle of this century,\u201d said Bob Ward, policy and communications director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Dutch government has announced measures including huge cuts to coal use, garden greening and limits on livestock herds as part of its plan to lower emissions to comply with a supreme court ruling. Climate litigation activists described the move as \u201can enormous win\u201d. The small non-profit Urgenda Foundation, which filed the initial legal challenge in 2013, said this and earlier compliance measures totalled about \u20ac3bn euros, which confirms the impact of the world\u2019s most successful climate lawsuit to date. Under the new package, coal-fired power stations will have to scale back or close completely , cattle and pig herds will be reduced, subsidies will be provided to home owners to use less concrete and more plants in their gardens, and industry will have to find alternatives for several polluting processes. \u201cThat is an enormous win,\u201d said Marjan Minnesma, the director of Urgenda, which has 15-staff and operates out of two former school classrooms. \u201cFor many people this will give hope that it is possible to use the law as a strategic instrument for change.\u201d After a seven-year legal battle, the supreme court in the Hague ordered the government in December to reduce emissions by 15 megatonnes in 2020. The judges accepted Urgenda\u2019s argument that climate change posed a dangerous threat to human rights and the Netherlands needed to accelerate its actions to meet its international commitment of a 25% cut compared with 1990. To comply, the government has adopted 30 of the proposals in Urgenda\u2019s \u201c54 Climate Solutions Plan\u201d, which was drawn up in collaboration with 800 civil society groups and other organisations. The headline change is a 75% reduction in capacity at the country\u2019s three coal-fired power stations, all of which have been opened in the past five years. The government is also reportedly in negotiations to close one of these plants. In addition, it will provide about \u20ac400m for household energy saving measures such as double glazing, \u20ac360m to compensate farmers for livestock reductions, and \u20ac30m for LED lighting in greenhouses. Along with earlier steps \u2013 including lower speed limits to control emissions of nitrogen dioxide, \u20ac2bn for rooftop solar and other forms of renewable energy, solar panels on all school rooftops, more sustainable forestry and changes in the use of concrete, the measures are expected to save 8 megatonnes of emissions this year and provide extra benefits in terms of air quality and wildlife habitat. Minnesma said this should be seen as a \u201cpromising start\u201d because the government is still about 4 megatonnes short of its obligations. She said the coronavirus lockdown should not be used as an excuse to backpedal. The package was presented to parliament on Friday afternoon. The government said the measures would provide an economic stimulus and also help to reduce nitrogen pollution, which has been the subject of other legal actions. MPs said the package should inspire activists across the world to pursue litigation against governments that drag their feet. \u201cWithout a doubt this should encourage climate lawsuits in other countries. It\u2019s a shining example,\u201d said Green party politician Tom van der Lee. \u201cThis package wouldn\u2019t be there without an order from the highest court. Without that verdict, the government would have chosen a slower trajectory.\u201d The environmental law charity ClientEarth said the result was unprecedented in Europe and testament to the impact of climate litigation, which is spreading around the world. \u201cThe Urgenda case should be considered a groundbreaking success, not just legally, but for driving real world action on climate change,\u201d Sophie Marjanac, a ClientEarth lawyer. The Dutch legal system\u2019s ease of access and political independence of judges helped to make the case possible. If Urgenda had lost, they would only have had to pay \u20ac18,000 rather than the government\u2019s extensive costs. The Urgenda case has been closely watched around the world. While climate activists have welcomed the outcome, they urge the Netherlands to raise ambition beyond 2020 compliance with the orders of the supreme court. \u201cThe Netherlands now needs to lay out a strategy to reach net zero by around the middle of this century,\u201d said Bob Ward, policy and communications director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.",

Brexit uncertainty, which dampened consumer confidence, had also hit sales of \u201cbig ticket items\u201d such as cars.</p> \n<p>Last month the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced a raft of measures to protect businesses from the worst of the Covid-19 fallout, including a business rates holiday. On Friday, the government banned commercial landlords from \u201caggressive rent collection\u201d. This should help many retailers that have fallen behind with payments over recent months.</p> \n<p>But the measures are not expected to prevent a further decline in the number of businesses on the high street after the lockdown is lifted.

      "bodyText": "UK retail sales in recorded their largest fall on record in March as consumers were forced to restrict their shopping trips under the government lockdown. Amid concerns the economy could experience its biggest contraction in several centuries, the fall in retail sales of 5.1% compared with the previous month exceeded the already downbeat expectations of City analysts, who forecast a 4% slide for March. Only panic-buying of food and freezers before the lockdown and household goods purchased bought online prevented a bigger slump, leading to predictions of a fall of up to 30% in April when the full impact of the government\u2019s restriction measures will be felt. The Office for National Statistics said store closures had hit sales of furniture and home furnishings and especially clothing, which dived by 35% month on month. Petrol sales declined by 19% month on month. The latest blow to high street sales came after a torrid 12 months in which many chains have gone to the wall and others shut stores in towns across the country. Before the lockdown, retailers\u2019 profit margins had been hit by a combination of competition, rising business rates and escalating rents. Brexit uncertainty, which dampened consumer confidence, had also hit sales of \u201cbig ticket items\u201d such as cars. Last month the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced a raft of measures to protect businesses from the worst of the Covid-19 fallout, including a business rates holiday. On Friday, the government banned commercial landlords from \u201caggressive rent collection\u201d. This should help many retailers that have fallen behind with payments over recent months. But the measures are not expected to prevent a further decline in the number of businesses on the high street after the lockdown is lifted. Shoppers, who have become used to shopping online, may continue to maintain deliveries of food and other items instead of visiting bricks and mortar shops. Revealing a strong divergence in sales, food, household goods and other non-food items all increased sales by value on the month by 15.3%, 18% and 16.4% respectively, the ONS said. Supermarkets reported a strong increase in volume sales, at 10.3%, while off-licence sales of alcohol soared 31.4% in volume terms. Online sales jumped to more than 22% of all sales, compared with an average of 18% over the last year. Department store sales rose by 2.8% month on month, though the increase appeared to be due to purchases of food and other items online. The ONS said: \u201cComments from food store retailers suggested that panic-buying, or stockpiling during the coronavirus pandemic, was a big factor in the increased sales, particularly for supermarkets.\u201d The ONS also confirmed that April was likely to bring even bigger falls. It said retailers responded to its survey between 1 March and 4 April 2020, meaning that two weeks of the five-week trading period were under physical distancing measures introduced before the lockdown. Thomas Pugh, an economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cWith widespread lockdowns only beginning around the middle of March, retail spending looks like it will fall by much more in April, perhaps around 20-30% month on month. \u201cClearly there is huge uncertainty as to how deep the downturn proves and how long restrictions remain in place, a fall in the region of 25% in GDP over the next few months seems likely.\u201d \ufeffIan Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte, said that while a rush to remote working fuelled sales of home office equipment, and consumers bought home gym equipment, the situation was dire for many retailers. \u201cThe combination of a UK-wide lockdown, closure of many physical stores, and consumer confidence at a historic low, has posed a significant challenge to all retailers, albeit with differing consequences across retail sectors. \u201cThose trading in essential goods, particularly food, have seen sales increase by 3.9%, month-on-month, while the non-food category has seen the greatest decline as lockdown measures pressed an indefinite pause on the UK high street.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Global leaders have pledged to accelerate cooperation on a coronavirus vaccine and to share research, treatment and medicines across the globe. But the United States did not take part in the World Health Organization initiative, in a sign of Donald Trump\u2019s increasing isolation on the global stage. The cooperation pledge, made at a virtual meeting, was designed to show that wealthy countries will not keep the results of research from developing countries. The meeting also represented a symbolic endorsement of the United Nations body in the face of Trump\u2019s decision to suspend US payments and condemn its leaders as subordinates of the Chinese Communist party. China and the US have accused each other of bullying and disinformation over the coronavirus outbreak, damaging efforts to secure cooperation at the G20, the natural international institution to handle global health outside the UN. Instead an ad hoc grouping of 20 world leaders and global health figures were on the call, including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the American philanthropist Bill Gates. Britain will co-chair a joint coronavirus global response summit on 4 May aimed at raising funds for vaccine research, treatments and tests. Macron told the meeting: \u201cWe will continue now to mobilise all G7 and G20 countries so they get behind this initiative. And I hope we will be able to reconcile around this joint initiative both China and the US, because this is about saying the fight against Covid-19 is a common human good and there should be no division in order to win this battle.\u201d The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: \u201cWe are facing a common threat that we can only defeat with a common approach. Experience has told us that even when tools are available they have not been equally available to all. We cannot allow that to happen.\u201d More than 100 potential vaccines are being developed, including six already in clinical trials, according to Seth Berkley, the chief executive of the Gavi vaccine alliance, a public-private partnership that leads immunisation campaigns in poor countries. Berkley said it was critical that there was not a repeat of the experience in 2009, when the H1N1 vaccine did not reach developing countries until very late. The US mission in Geneva confirmed there would be no official US participation, but said it looked forward to the outcome of the WHO meeting. Five pledges were agreed on the call: Provide access to new treatments, technologies and vaccines across the world. Commit to an unprecedented level of international partnership on research and coordinate efforts to tackle the pandemic and reduce infections. Reach collective decisions on responding to the pandemic, recognising that the virus\u2019s spread in one country can affect all countries. Learn from experience and adapt the global response. Be accountable, to the most vulnerable communities and the whole world. The heavily multilateral tone of the pledges contrasts with many countries\u2019 immediate reaction to the outbreak, when countries banned the export of their medical equipment, closed borders and even tried to steal equipment from one another. The degree of cooperation over the vaccine research has also been patchy at best. The meeting also agreed to appoint two new special envoys to lead global cooperation on vaccine research and to help ensure equal access to any successful vaccines.

The Metropolitan police, which covers London, said its officers are arresting an average of 100 people a day for domestic violence offences during the Covid-19 lockdown. Commander Sue Williams said charges and cautions were up 24% from 9 March, when people with coronavirus symptoms were asked to self-isolate, compared with last year. She said domestic incidents, which can include family rows not recorded as crimes, were up 3% year on year and 9% between 9 March and 19 April, although offences were up just 2% in the Covid-19 period. \u201cWe are seeing a rise, there\u2019s no doubt about that, and we welcome that because we will take positive action against any perpetrators,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe are arresting about 100 people a day for domestic offences, which I think is pretty amazing, even given all the challenges we have in London.\u201d Charities said reports to them are up by around a quarter and Williams said policing around the country expects a rush of reports of domestic violence once lockdown is lifted, which is what happened in other countries when restrictions were eased. This gap between the large rise reported to charities compared with the small increase reported to police has caused concern that victims are unable or unwilling to come forward. Williams said charities the Met works with said some victims can fear police arresting the breadwinner in their household will leave them and the children with no money during a lockdown when jobs are disappearing: \u201cThere may be a reluctance to arrest someone who brings in the money,\u201d adding: \u201cIn this current climate it becomes a hidden crime.\u201d She said that when other countries relaxed lockdown measures, reports to police of domestic violence and abuse increased, and she expected that would happen in the UK.

In one case in east London a woman called police but did not want to support a prosecution. Officers used their body-worn video to record a statement and that was enough to gain a \u201cvictimless\u201d prosecution. Williams said there were two homicides in London linked to domestic violence but it was not yet known if either was linked to the lockdown. The Met is working with other agencies and charities to find temporary housing for suspects so women and their children don\u2019t have to move home during the lockdown. Williams said: \u201cIf we can arrest the perpetrator we give the victim some time to think about what they want to do.\u201d She urged neighbours to listen out for heated arguments or screams and said victims could also send text messages to friends or family and they could call police for help.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is facing pressure to make a speedy return to work, as fresh data suggests the onset of lockdown fatigue, and as senior police officers argue over rules on movement. Warnings for the public to continue respecting lockdown rules were sounded at Friday\u2019s Downing Street briefing, where data showed that there had been an increase of between 2% and 3% in transport use over the past week. While driving and journeys on public transport have remained consistently low, data from Apple reflecting requests for directions also suggested that there had been an uptick over the past week in terms of people venturing out on foot in London. On Wednesday, the government\u2019s own figures had shown that the UK\u2019s vehicle traffic levels this week were at their highest since the country\u2019s lockdown began. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, added that the country had \u201cdone incredibly well\u201d but warned: \u201cThere is a danger as we go into another warm sunny weekend that people think that the peak is over \u2013 but it is not over. We are riding perhaps, we hope, a downward trend but it is by no means established yet.\u201d The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said: \u201cOn the whole, as we have just seen, most of the public are really complying and really do support [social distancing]. That becomes increasingly difficult as we go through.\u201d The data on transport use came as a senior police chief criticised national police guidance on exercise rules as hundreds of people in south-west England flouted lockdown restrictions to enjoy 20C sunshine. While updated guidance from the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council stated that driving to the countryside and walking was considered a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d for people to leave their homes in England, it was criticised by the Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall police, Shaun Sawyer, who said people should not drive to go exercising, dog walking or surfing. \u201cThe National Police Chiefs\u2019 guidance, which I think is some of the poorest guidance I have seen for a long time sadly, would allow people from outside the force [region] access to come in, the very thing that our communities don\u2019t want,\u201d he added. His comments came as calls for the prime minister to return to the helm of government grew louder on Conservative backbenches. Andrew Bridgen, the MP for North West Leicestershire, said: \u201cThere are huge decisions that are going to have to be made in the near future and that can only be done by the prime minister. Boris can carry the public with him, he is the leader of the party with a huge election victory.\u201d Bridgen said detail on easing lockdown restrictions for businesses and more information on when schools might go back would be top of Johnson\u2019s in-tray. Another Tory backbencher said Johnson\u2019s absence had put significant strain on the government and lead to people taking the daily press conferences who did not have his skills. \u201cThere is a sense that people do want him back mainly because the people who have stepped in have maybe not performed as well as he could have done,\u201d they said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of the press conference [of the business secretary] Alok Sharma took, and Priti Patel\u2019s [home secretary].

      "bodyText": "The prime minister\u2019s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, and a data scientist he worked with on the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit are on the secret scientific group advising the government on the coronavirus pandemic, according to a list leaked to the Guardian. It reveals that both Cummings and Ben Warner were among 23 attendees present at a crucial convening of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on 23 March, the day Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown in a televised address. Multiple attendees of Sage told the Guardian that both Cummings and Warner had been taking part in meetings of the group as far back as February. The inclusion of Downing Street advisers on Sage will raise questions about the independence of its scientific advice. There has been growing pressure on Downing Street in recent days to disclose more details about the group, which provides scientific advice to the upper echelons of government during emergencies. Both the membership of Sage and its advice to ministers on the Covid-19 outbreak is being kept secret. Warner, a data scientist, was reportedly recruited to Downing Street last year by Cummings after running the Conservative party\u2019s general election campaign model. He is also said to have worked closely with Cummings on the data modelling used in the Vote Leave campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. The government\u2019s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King said he was \u201cshocked\u201d to discover there were political advisers on Sage. \u201cIf you are giving science advice, your advice should be free of any political bias,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is just so critically important.\u201d Told that Cummings was in the 23 March meeting, King replied: \u201cOh my goodness.

Other former members of Sage also said they could not recall political appointees being on previous committees. David Lidington, a former Cabinet Office minister and de facto deputy to Theresa May when she was prime minister, said: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any minister or special adviser, certainly not in Theresa May\u2019s time, ever having been involved in the scientific advisory panels.\u201d In a statement provided by Downing Street, a government spokesperson said: \u201cExpert participants often vary for each meeting according to which expertise is required.

Asked if in the current climate revealing the names of who was on the group would boost public confidence in the scientific advice being given, Whitty replied: \u201cYes.\u201d Several members on Sage, as well as scientists on its advisory subcommittees, are known to be frustrated at what they view as a culture of secrecy that risks straining public trust in the government\u2019s response to Covid-19. Since the outbreak, ministers have stuck to the script that their policies are guided by scientific advice, while declining to reveal where the advice is coming from or what exactly it contains. Other countries have been more open about the scientific evidence behind their decisions, and the UK\u2019s approach has raised eyebrows overseas. The New York Times reported on Thursday that Sage operates in \u201ca virtual black box\u201d. \u201cIts list of members is secret, its meetings are closed, its recommendations are private and the minutes of its deliberations are published much later, if at all.\u201d The Guardian understands that Sage first met for a precautionary meeting to discuss Covid-19 on 22 January, then again on 28 January. It met a further nine times in February, and 10 times in March. It is currently meeting around twice a week. It understood that while the chief medical officers and chief scientific advisers of the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been allowed to listen in on Sage meetings, they have been doing so as observers. Unlike Cummings and Warner, they were not allowed to ask questions, having to instead submit them in writing in advance. While core members of the committee, such as Whitty, attend all meetings, other clinical experts, scientists and epidemiologists do not attend every meeting, but can be asked in on a rotating basis to provide specific advice. Sage tends to be guided by specific questions that they are asked to consider by the Cabinet Office\u2019s emergency Cobra meetings. Other Sage participants at the 23 March meeting included Sharon Peacock, the director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England, and Ian Diamond, the head of the Government Statistical Service. Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College epidemiologist whose models have been central to government decision\u2013making, was also present, along with fellow infectious disease specialists, Graham Medley and John Edmunds. Others attendees included Brooke Rogers, a professor of behavioural science at King\u2019s College \u2013 who also chairs the Cabinet Office\u2019s National Risk Assessment Behavioural Science Advisory Group \u2013 and James Rubin, also at King\u2019s, who chairs a Sage subcommittee that provides specific advice on behavioural science. However it is the inclusion of two Downing Street political advisers that will raise questions over whether the structure of the government\u2019s scientific advisory process is free from political interference. A source in Downing Street said that in March Cummings was playing a commanding role in responding to the Covid-19 outbreak. Cummings is understood to be close to Warner, whose brother, Marc, runs Faculty, an artificial intelligence company that the Guardian revealed is involved in an \u201cunprecedented\u201d data-mining operation as part of the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak. An accomplished data scientist, Ben Warner previously worked at his brother\u2019s AI company, which has teamed up with Palantir, the US data firm founded by the rightwing billionaire Peter Thiel, to consolidate UK government databases to help ministers respond to the pandemic.",

He became a Muslim after stumbling on a copy of the Qur\u2019an in 1989. He changed his name and settled in Birmingham, married a primary school teacher from a Pakistani background, and started a degree in social work. Since 2010 he had worked for Birmingham Children\u2019s Trust, helping young people leaving care. Its chief executive, Andy Couldrick, said he died after suffering with Covid-19 for a few weeks. He said: \u201cMuhammad was a well respected, well liked and highly valued member of our care leavers team who supported many young people in Birmingham.\u201d Ruth Allen, chief executive of the British Association of Social Workers, said: \u201cSocial workers continue to work tirelessly, knocking on doors, delivering vital services out in communities.\u201d The death of an 88-year-old woman in south Wales highlights the lack of protection against the virus in hospices, according to her family. John Hunt suspects that his mother, Elsie Hunt, contracted the virus in a hospice before she died earlier this month in Singleton hospital, Swansea. He said: \u201cAlready gravely ill, Covid-19 robbed her of being consoled by her family in her last days. In the hospice, no one wore masks. Even when Mum developed a classic dry cough and fever \u2013 and was moved to a single room \u2013 staff only wore simple paper masks, and no eye protection.\u201d He said he could see his mother in her final days via FaceTime.",

The 600-page Cabinet Office document warned that even a mild pandemic could cost tens of thousands of lives and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/leaked-cabinet-office-briefing-on-uk-pandemic-threat-the-key-points\">included recommendations</a> such as the need to stockpile PPE and organised advanced purchase agreements for other essential supplies.

With multiple attendees of Sage disclosing to the Guardian that both Cummings and Warner had been taking part in meetings of the group as far back as February, the inclusion of Downing Street advisers on Sage will raise questions about the independence of its scientific advice. Despite growing pressure on the government to make public more details about the group, both its membership and its advice to ministers on Covid-19 is being kept secret. </li> \n   <li>The government\u2019s expansion of testing for key workers and their families suffered a setback after all 5,000 home test kits for key workers ran out within two minutes this morning. And the Department for Health and Social Care apologised after the website for booking tests online stopped accepting applications due to high demand.</li> \n   <li>The Welsh government became the latest devolved administration to publish a plan for easing lockdown restrictions and learning to live alongside Covid-19, amid mounting pressure on the UK government to do the same. </li> \n   <li>The UK\u2019s hospital death toll rose by 684 to 19,506. <br></li> \n   <li>Transport for London announced it would furlough 7,000 workers \u2013 around a quarter of its workforce \u2013 from Monday for an initial period of three weeks.

He said he would not allow for changes to be made that are unsafe and that keeping the number of cases down is also the best thing for the economy. There is no prospect of easing the lockdown yet, he added.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>And that\u2019s it for today.

Data has to be robust, recording of ethnicity both by country of origin or ethnic group is hugely complex.

Early in the pandemic, we quarantined people coming back from high-risk areas, she says. Once the disease is more prevalent, this becomes a less effective mechanism, she adds.</p> \n  <p>Once our rates are very tightly controlled, even then it isn\u2019t so simple, she says, due to variations in reliability in recording temperature and the likelihood in catching somebody during the incubation period. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea3140b8f08e05690dc418a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T16:35:03.891Z\">5.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q.

He added:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Coronavirus is not going to disappear \u2013 it is likely it will be with us for a long time. We will need to have some sort of restrictions in place for some time yet to continue to control the spread of the virus and reduce community transmission. This framework will help us determine what is right for Wales.</p> \n   <p>There is a long road ahead of us towards recovery to pre-pandemic levels, but if we continue to work together, I hope we will be able to make changes to the restrictions and see a gradual return to something resembling normal life.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Dr Atherton said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> Action to ease the lockdown restrictions will need to be supported by a comprehensive public health response, which will need to be developed quickly and at scale.</p> \n   <p>We are now working

the lockdown depends on the speed at which the number of new cases of Covid-19 falls and that is as yet \u201cunknown\u201d, the health secretary, <strong>Matt Hancock,</strong> has said.</p> \n  <p>The number of new cases is being tracked through hospital admissions, through a new testing study in the community announced on Wednesday, and data that will be gathered from people coming forward for tests under an expansion of the programme.</p> \n  <p>However, he added that there was no prospect of easing the lockdown yet, and that cases needed to drop substantially before the next phase of isolating infected people and their contacts could be truly effective.</p> \n  <p>Through a process of mass testing and by isolating infected people and their contacts, ministers hope that future localised outbreaks of coronavirus can be kept under control.</p> \n  <p>Hancock told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Now that we\u2019re at the peak, and we very much hope that things will start to slow down and, if and when they do, then the speed with which the number of new cases reduces will, frankly, determine how long we need to keep the measures on, and that is as yet unknown.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He said contact tracing worked better when the number of infections was pushed right down.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The truth is that we need to get the number of new cases down, right down, and the lower you go, the more effective contact tracing is because the more resources you can put into each individual case that gets a positive test.</p> \n   <p>You can really make sure you can get hold of all of their contacts and get them, in many cases, to self-isolate.</p> \n   <p>The smaller the number of new cases, the more effective the test, track and trace system will be.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Physical distancing was driving down the numbers, Hancock said, adding that the contact tracing operation would be functioning in a \u201cmatter of weeks\u201d.</p> \n  <p>He said mass testing, contact tracing and a new contact tracing app were \u201cso crucial to holding down the rate and level of transmission of the disease\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T11:15:50.120Z\">at 12.15pm BST</time></p>

      "bodyText": "UK ministers were warned last year that the UK needed a robust plan to deal with a pandemic and its economic and social consequences, the Guardian revealed. The 600-page Cabinet Office document warned that even a mild pandemic could cost tens of thousands of lives and included recommendations such as the need to stockpile PPE and organised advanced purchase agreements for other essential supplies. It comes as the government continues to face accusations that it has reacted too slowly to to the coronavirus outbreak. Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, and data scientist Ben Warner, who worked on the Vote Leave campaign, are on the secret scientific group advising the government on its response to the coronavirus pandemic, the Guardian revealed. With multiple attendees of Sage disclosing to the Guardian that both Cummings and Warner had been taking part in meetings of the group as far back as February, the inclusion of Downing Street advisers on Sage will raise questions about the independence of its scientific advice. Despite growing pressure on the government to make public more details about the group, both its membership and its advice to ministers on Covid-19 is being kept secret. The government\u2019s expansion of testing for key workers and their families suffered a setback after all 5,000 home test kits for key workers ran out within two minutes this morning. And the Department for Health and Social Care apologised after the website for booking tests online stopped accepting applications due to high demand. The Welsh government became the latest devolved administration to publish a plan for easing lockdown restrictions and learning to live alongside Covid-19, amid mounting pressure on the UK government to do the same. The UK\u2019s hospital death toll rose by 684 to 19,506. Transport for London announced it would furlough 7,000 workers \u2013 around a quarter of its workforce \u2013 from Monday for an initial period of three weeks. The move followed TfL recording a 90% revenue loss during the lockdown and is expected to save the network \u00a315.8m every four weeks. The lockdown will be lifted when it\u2019s \u201csafe to do so\u201d and this depends on the number of new infections falling, the health secretary Matt Hancock said. He said he would not allow for changes to be made that are unsafe and that keeping the number of cases down is also the best thing for the economy. There is no prospect of easing the lockdown yet, he added. And that\u2019s it for today. From the UK side, thank you so much to everybody who got in touch throughout the day, keeping me going with tips and stories, comments and suggestions, jokes and music videos. I couldn\u2019t do this without you! If you\u2019d like to continue following the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the pandemic, head over to our global live blog. The prime minister\u2019s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, and a data scientist he worked with on the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit are on the secret scientific group advising the government on the coronavirus pandemic, according to a list leaked to the Guardian. It reveals both Cummings and Ben Warner were among 23 attendees present at a crucial convening of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on 23 March, the day Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown in a televised address. Multiple attendees of Sage told the Guardian that both Cummings and Warner had been taking part in meetings of the group as far back as February. The inclusion of Downing Street advisers on Sage will raise questions about the independence of its scientific advice. There has been growing pressure on Downing Street in recent days to disclose more details about the group, which provides scientific advice to the upper echelons of government during emergencies. Both the membership of Sage and its advice to ministers on the Covid-19 outbreak is being kept secret. Here is the full story. The increase in confirmed cases of Covid-19 among prisoners continues to slow, a daily update from the Ministry of Justice shows. The number of infected prisoners rose by just 1% in 24 hours to 304 inmates across 69 prisons as at 5pm on Thursday, the lowest increase by percentage since lockdown conditions were imposed. There are 81,100 prisoners in England and Wales across 117 prisons. The number of confirmed cases among prison staff rose by 8% to 257 workers across 59 prisons in the same period. The figures reflect the total number of recorded positive cases \u2013 not the number of live cases - of Covid-19, and include individuals who have recovered. The Department for Education said it plans to pump more than \u00a312m into 14 projects across England to tackle the increased risks faced by some children and young people as they stay at home to reduce the spread of coronavirus. The additional funding comes after the DfE\u2019s figures revealed that only around 5% of pupils identified as vulnerable were attending school during the lockdown despite being eligible to do so, including around 500,000 children with assigned social workers and children in care. The DfE said the funding would pay for individual support for families at risk of domestic abuse, community volunteers to work with families, and continued support for teenagers at risk of exploitation. Vicky Ford, the children and families minister, said: We are working hand in hand with all the professionals supporting these children to prioritise their wellbeing during these unprecedented times. These new projects will prevent children suffering from isolation or exploitation as the country continues to respond to Covid-19. Q. When will we reach the prime minister\u2019s previous target of 250,000 tests per day, and how and when will testing capacity open up beyond key workers and their families? Shapps says capacity has been rising \u201cpretty fast\u201d. The problem, he says, is that there hasn\u2019t been sufficient numbers of people coming forward to get tested. The 250,000 \u201cmentioned by the PM\u201d was \u201can ambition without a particular timetable\u201d, he adds. Q. Re contact tracing, are we expecting to follow a similar model to South Korea, ie following movements using GPS signal? Shapps says his understanding is that the NHS app users anonymously check who has been in range of the bluetooth that may have symptoms. Harries adds that the ambition is to digitalise some of the process to help bring us out of some of the lockdown measures. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Q. How much funding can tram systems in the regions expect to receive? Shapps doesn\u2019t have an actual figure as discussions are ongoing with the different light rail services. More details soon, he adds. Q. Do we know why people from BAME backgrounds are dying in disproportionately high numbers amid the pandemic, what work is taking place to try to find out? Harries says this is a hugely important and complex subject. With disease prevalence and severity, there are several elements. Data has to be robust, recording of ethnicity both by country of origin or ethnic group is hugely complex. The death certificate might give country of origin, for example, but this does not tell us anything about cultural background, community and lifestyle, she says. She says it is still \u201cpotentially\u201d an issue as we need clearer data. Public Health England will do a review into this. It\u2019s also about increased risks associated with certain ethnic groups, for instance high blood pressure and hypertension is linked to poor outcomes in Covid-19 and is more prevalent in some ethnic groups. The disease is more likely to transmit more in close communities and will have a different impact across different socio-economic statuses. She adds that there is very high representation in the NHS and frontline care services of minority ethnic groups. All these things must be considered, she says. Q. Should the transition period for Brexit be extended given the current crisis? Shapps says it remains the case that [the government] \u201cwill not entertain an extension to the transition period\u201d. It will end at the end of the year, he adds, to provide certainty to businesses. Q. Are you confident that tests will be reliable and what is the failure rate for self-administered tests? Harries says tests can fail for several reasons including specificity, storage and sensitivity. This makes it hard to put a number on failure, she says. In piloting the tests, she says, tests have been run in parallel using trained and non-trained persons to trial tests. Q. Do you have a message to Donald Trump about the dangers of spreading misinformation? Harries says that clearly from a medical, professional perspective, people must use evidence-based and properly trialled treatments. Nobody should be injecting anything, she adds. Q. Did you over-promise on testing for over 10 million key workers and their families when there were only 5,000 home testing kits and 15,000 drive-through appointments? And will you bring in checks to determine eligibility? Shapps says there is no point taking a test unless you have symptoms or if you suspect you already had it. He says capacity has been rising fast and a clearer idea of demand will become clear in the coming days. Harries adds this is a \u2018have you got it now\u2019 test. She encourages those who have symptoms, or those who have a member of the household displaying symptoms, to take a test. That will allow those people to get back to work. Q. How will you make it easier for critical workers who do shift work to book these appointments? Shapps says the goal is to have 48 testing centres and home tests are being trialled to hopefully be expanded. Harries adds that if you\u2019re symptomatic and needing a test, you should not still be going to work. Q. P&amp;O Ferries has said it needs \u00a3150m to stay afloat, will they also received government funding? Shapps says this is included in the package he announced earlier. Q. The chief executive of Heathrow Airport has called on the government for passengers to be screened for Covid-19 as they come into the country, why is this not currently being done? Shapps says air travel is \u201cdown massively\u201d and many of those returning have been British nationals. He says the requirements for incoming passengers are to stay in one place and not leave for any reason. He says countries who have taken such measures have not necessarily weathered the pandemic better. Harries adds that \u201cscreening\u201d can be reassuring and helpful to the public. Early in the pandemic, we quarantined people coming back from high-risk areas, she says. Once the disease is more prevalent, this becomes a less effective mechanism, she adds. Once our rates are very tightly controlled, even then it isn\u2019t so simple, she says, due to variations in reliability in recording temperature and the likelihood in catching somebody during the incubation period. Q. Is it possible to manage people\u2019s expectations about how much longer the lockdown might go on? Shapps says that going into another warm, sunny weekend, people need to understand that the peak is \u201cby no means\u201d over and a downward trend has not yet been established. The more people adhere to physical distancing, the faster decisions about easing restrictions can be made, but they will ultimately be determined by the science. Harries adds that people flouting the rules is not the answer. She encourages everybody to comply lest we lose all the progress that has been made. Q. How soon will funds for trams come through and how long will it take? Shapps says the amount will be \u201csubstantial\u201d but doesn\u2019t give a figure. He says he will be discussing the issue with regional mayors over the weekend. They are taking questions from the media now. Q. What assurances can you give about future demand for testing kits for key workers being met and how much will capacity go up over the next few days? Shapps says the website didn\u2019t crash; the slots for today were just taken up. He says 16,000 online tests were booked and the site has been brought back up online now and more tests will become available tomorrow and the days after. He says \u201cit looks like the demand is there\u201d and the capacity for the target of 100,000 tests per day is there. Shapps says we don\u2019t know how many people want to be tested. He emphasises this test will only tell you if you currently have Covid-19, not if you have had it. Dr Jenny Harries is speaking now. Transport use has risen 2-3% in the last week, she says. She reinforces that we need to keep reducing travel as this has contributed significantly to reducing transmission of the disease. The total number of new cases has risen, but there is fluctuation related to reporting. The curve is flattening, she says, which indicates a reduction in transmissions, but a caveat is that increased numbers of tests means we expect to see an increase in cases due to an increase in detection. Hospitalisation rates have fallen \u201cremarkably\u201d in London, she says. The number of inpatients diagnosed with Covid-19 has fallen below 1,000 \u201cfor the first time in many, many weeks\u201d. This is a \u201creal success\u201d, she adds. Critical care bed use has significantly fallen and capacity continues to increase, she says. Confirmed hospital deaths are expected to gradually decline. Shapps says there are no more British holidaymakers stranded on cruise ships anywhere in the world. Shapps adds the government has made funding available to keep England\u2019s trams running. This will help light rail networks in Greater Manchester, Sheffield, Nottingham, the West Midlands, and Tyne and Wear to keep operating. He doesn\u2019t specify how much funding has been made available for this. Shapps says he has also given the green light to fast-track trial the use of drones to deliver medical supplies, beginning next week on the Isle of Wight. Rail and freight transport is critical to our resilience as a country, Shapps says. He says the government has secured a trilateral agreement with the French and Irish governments which commits to keeping freight routes open throughout the crisis, bringing in medicines and other essential goods. He adds ferry routes are being protected between Great Britain and Northern Ireland with funding of up to \u00a317m. \u00a310.5m will also go towards links to the Isle of Wight and the Isles of Scilly so critical freight can continue to reach those places, he says. And air links to Belfast, Derry and Londonderry continue, as they are key for critical workers. Shapps says there are \u201ctentative\u201d signs we are making progress. By respecting physical distancing, the whole country is slowing the spread of the virus, he says. The transport secretary Grant Shapps is delivering the government\u2019s daily press briefing. He is joined by Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England. The stakes could hardly be higher. It is no exaggeration to say that the fate of many millions of people rest on the discovery of a vaccine for Covid-19 \u2013 the only sure escape route from a pandemic that has brought everyday life to a standstill. Yet the optimism that accompanied the launch of Oxford University\u2019s human trials this week has to be put in context \u2013 and the hurdles facing the scientists need to be understood. So what is the path to success? Read the full story from my colleague, the Guardian\u2019s science correspondent, Hannah Devlin, here: A quick note on the latest UK death toll figures, which several readers have been in touch about. The difference between today\u2019s and yesterday\u2019s total number of deaths is 84 higher than the daily increase of 684 because Wales has revised its historic data. This was because one health board reported its data too late for yesterday\u2019s daily update. So while today\u2019s daily toll of 684 is correct, this meant the cumulative total went up by 768 to 19,506. Government ministers were warned last year the UK must have a robust plan to deal with a pandemic virus and its potentially catastrophic social and economic consequences, the Guardian can reveal. A confidential 600-page Cabinet Office document warned that even a mild pandemic could cost tens of thousands of lives, and set out the must-have \u201ccapability requirements\u201d to mitigate the risks to the country, as well as the potential damage of not doing so. The recommendations within it included the need to stockpile PPE, organise advanced purchase agreements for other essential kit, establish procedures for disease surveillance and contact tracing, and draw up plans to manage a surge in excess deaths. Having plans for helping British nationals abroad and repatriating them to the UK was also flagged as a priority. All of these areas have come under relentless scrutiny since the start of the pandemic, with the government accused of being too slow to react to the crisis. It comes as the UK\u2019s hospital death toll approached 20,000 on Friday. Less than a month ago, the medical director at NHS England, Prof Stephen Powis, said the country would \u201chave done very well\u201d to stay below this grim milestone. A source told the Guardian: There was a national plan for dealing with a pandemic that should have been implemented. But who took control of that? And who was responsible for making sure that plans were being made at a local level? The truth is, I am not sure anyone was doing this. Firefighters can now make protective face shields for frontline health and social care staff after an agreement was reached between the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC), and fire service national employers. Under the agreement, firefighters, who are already driving ambulances in parts of the country, will also now begin transferring both Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients from Nightingale hospitals. The agreement is temporary and for the duration of the coronavirus emergency. Matt Wrack, the FBU general secretary, said: After a decade of damage from austerity, public services can only get through this crisis by pulling together, and our members are proud to step up to help. This pandemic is further proof that properly resourced public services are not only the foundations on which society is built but also the first line of defence when crises like this arrive. We hope these new areas of work will go further to help our fellow emergency services through this unprecedented crisis. Thank you so much to everybody who has been in touch throughout the day with news tips and stories. I love going through them all, particularly the ones thanking the Guardian for its coverage. Please do continue to send me your suggestions via the usual channels (below) and apologies if I can\u2019t reply to you all individually. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ In today\u2019s daily update, the Department of Health and Social Care announced that 612,031 tests had concluded, with 28,532 tests on 23 April. The number of people tested stood at 444,222, of whom 143,464 tested positive. As of 5pm on 23 April, of those admitted to hospital in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus, 19,506 had died, an increase of 684 on the previous day. The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a multibillion-pound \u201ccall to action\u201d for a global response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Its director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the Access to Covid Tools (ACT) Accelerator programme would call on international experts and governments to unite and speed up access to safe, affordable and universally available vaccines and therapeutics. The programme and its \u20ac7.5bn (\u00a36.5bn) fundraising effort will be officially launched on 4 May. Ghebreyesus said: Past experience has taught us that even when tools are available, they have been not been equally available to all 7 \u2013 but we cannot allow that to happen. Today, the WHO is proud to be uniting with many partners to launch the Access to Covid Tools Accelerator. This is a landmark collaboration to accelerate the development, production and equitable distribution of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics for Covid-19. Dr Ghebreyesus said the programme was designed to harness the \u201cpower of several organisations\u201d around the world to \u201cwork with speed and scale\u201d. The WHO said it would commit to \u201can unprecedented level of partnership\u201d to create \u201ca strong, unified voice\u201d to maximise the impact of tackling the coronavirus pandemic on a global scale. World leaders including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, were among those supporting the ACT Accelerator at a virtual press conference. Chris Whitty is among the medical advisers currently being questioned at the science select committee hearing which is being streamed live on YouTube. Michael McBride, Frank Atherton and Gregor Smith are also speaking. Whitty described the importance of having a \u201ccentral view\u201d when giving advice to the public. But he said: \u201cSome of the critical bits of information we still don\u2019t have the answers to.\u201d A recording spread around the world at the end of March, purportedly featuring a former Vodafone executive claiming to let the public in on a secret that the coronavirus pandemic is cover for a global plot to install 5G mobile phone masts, track the world\u2019s population through vaccines, and then destroy human society as we know it. In reality, the Guardian can reveal, the voice on the tape making the baseless claims is actually an evangelical pastor from Luton who recently tried to convince Zimbabweans to use cryptocurrency in their economy. Jonathon James, who regularly preached at churches in Bedfordshire, is the previously unidentified individual who reached millions of people with his detailed but nonsense claims that Covid-19 is a fake disease covering for the impact of 5G. The full exclusive story is here: Coronavirus has been detected on particles of air pollution by scientists investigating whether this could enable it to be carried over longer distances and increase the number of people infected. The work is preliminary and it is not yet known if the virus remains viable on pollution particles and in sufficient quantity to cause disease. The Italian scientists used standard techniques to collect outdoor air pollution samples at one urban and one industrial site in Bergamo province and identified a gene highly specific to Covid-19 in multiple samples. The detection was confirmed by blind testing at an independent laboratory. Leonardo Setti at the University of Bologna in Italy, who led the work, said it was important to investigate if the virus could be carried more widely by air pollution. I am a scientist and I am worried when I don\u2019t know,. If we know, we can find a solution. But if we don\u2019t know, we can only suffer the consequences. Trnsmt, Scotland\u2019s biggest music festival, has been cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak, my colleague Ben Beaumont-Thomas reports. In a statement, organisers said they were \u2018\u201cabsolutely gutted\u201d but were taking the decision in light of the announcement by Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, that social distancing measures could be in place for the rest of the year and possibly beyond. Public Health Wales said a further 243 people had tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 8,601. On Thursday, 1,027 tests were carried out taking the total to 29,931. There is current capacity for 1,800 tests daily. Dr Robin Howe, from Public Health Wales, said: Based on the new case numbers there is emerging evidence suggesting a levelling off in the number of new cases of Covid-19 in Wales, which may be an indication of the effectiveness of lockdown measures. However, it is still too early to tell for sure, and it is too soon to end the current social distancing rules. Public Health Wales continues to fully support the extension of lockdown measures, which is essential to avoid reversing the gains we have made in slowing the spread of this virus, protecting our NHS, and saving lives. One of Northern Ireland\u2019s leading cancer surgeons has appealed to anyone displaying \u201cred flag\u201d symptoms for the disease to report to their GP, health clinic or even A&amp;E despite the coronavirus pandemic. Andrew Kennedy, who also sits on the committee of the charity Oesophaegael and Stomach Cancer Support NI, has called on people with such symptoms \u201cnot to sit at home\u201d. Kennedy said there was some anecdotal evidence that public fears of contracting the virus and not wanting to burden the NHS had dissuaded some people who had developed serious conditions from reporting their symptoms. \u201cThere has been one case recently in Belfast where a patient who was suffering symptoms of appendicitis was reluctant to go to their doctor or report to hospital. As a result, when that patient was eventually rushed in there were complications with damage to their colon and, which is unusual in most appendicitis operations, a stoma had to be attached to his body after surgery. \u201cOur message is that if you are passing blood, being unable to swallow, suffering from severe vomiting and so on then do not sit at home because you are worried about coronavirus or being a burden on the health service. \u201cSpeak to your doctor, even if that is over the phone, or in extreme pain go to A&amp;E. Don\u2019t hesitate as early detection is the key.\u201d Some diagnostic cancer services were suspended in recent weeks as nursing staff and some surgeons were redeployed to units treating Covid-19 patients, he said. However, staff and the charity are expecting a new surge in patients reporting cancer symptoms within the next three to four weeks as the rate of coronavirus deaths drops and specialist teams return to cancer care. Kennedy added that he wanted to reassure the public that although there had been delays in people being diagnosed, \u201cmost cancer is slow growing\u201d and a delay of up to three months will not adversely impact on new patients coming forward. The race director of the London Marathon has refused to rule out staging the event as an elite-only race in the autumn if social distancing rules make it impossible to run as normal. Hugh Brasher told the Guardian that while organisers still hoped to hold the event with 45,000 mass participants on 4 October, they were now scenario-planning other options because of the pandemic. He said a decision would be made \u201cby the back end of August at the latest\u201d. A further 26 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19 in Wales, bringing the total there to 751. This is a big increase from the numbers reported yesterday (641) due to the inclusion of 84 retrospective deaths following a delay in the reporting process, Public Health Wales said. With mortality suddenly confronting all of us, the latest episode of Anywhere But Westminster looks at how the coronavirus crisis is hitting those most vulnerable to the disease. While the government stands accused of failing to protect them, people in at-risk categories are taking matters into their own hands. Celebrities including Naomie Harris, Craig David and Stephen Graham have joined forces with the Prince\u2019s Trust to encourage young people to seek help, support and advice during the pandemic. Metropolitan police officers are arresting an average of 100 people a day for domestic violence offences during the Covid-19 lockdown, the force has revealed. Commander Sue Williams said charges and cautions from 9 March, when people with coronavirus symptoms were asked to self-isolate, were 24% higher than last year. She said domestic incidents, which can include family disputes not recorded as crimes, were up 3% year-on-year and 9% between 9 March and 19 April, although offences were up just 2% in the Covid-19 period. There have been two domestic-related murders recorded in London as police continue to warn of an increased risk of abuse during the lockdown. Williams said police officers were finding it \u201cmuch easier\u201d to arrest suspects, who are either at home during the coronavirus lockdown or with family members or friends. As we reported earlier (see 12.51), Wales is the latest devolved administration to publish its strategy for lifting the lockdown amid continuing pressure on the UK government to do the same. In a press conference in Cardiff, the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the decision to outline its plan for easing the restrictions was about \u201cstrengthening the UK-wide approach, certainly not undermining it\u201d. England remains the only nation that has not published a plan to ease restrictions after Scotland\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon did so yesterday and Northern Ireland\u2019s Arlene Foster suggested she could lift its measures at a different pace from the rest of the UK. Drakeford said he remains committed to a four-nation approach to tackling the pandemic and that publishing Wales\u2019s plan was about sharing information with neighbouring countries. However, it will inevitably add urgency to the pressure on Westminster to set out a whole-UK approach just two weeks before the proposed end of the current lockdown measures. There will also be questions about how this approach \u2013 where differing restrictions could be in force in Wales and England \u2013 affects those living near the border, who may live in one country and work in the other. Drakeford said Wales\u2019s plan was \u201ca contribution to crafting that UK approach but sharing with one another our thinking, by being open about the issues we think will matter in different parts of the United Kingdom. I think that will help us to craft a way forward in which we all understand what one another are doing and we come to a common set of ideas and a common timetable for going about them.\u201d Separately, the first minister was asked about Donald Trump\u2019s mind-boggling \u2013 and overwhelmingly rebuked \u2013 suggestion that people could inject disinfectant to cure the coronavirus. He said: At her daily media briefing, Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, confirmed that the new system announced by Matt Hancock allowing coronavirus tests for all essential workers and their families will apply to Scotland. She said that, while the Scottish government was considering many options, it was looking at what has been described as the \u201cBelgian bubble\u201d option: Some countries are looking at how people could slightly more widely define their households ... could you expand that to one friend or a couple of friends, particularly if you live on your own? In response to the inevitable question about Donald Trump, Sturgeon said: It is clearly not the case that ingesting disinfectant in any shape or form is a good idea. She added: All of us as leaders are finding ourselves in uncharted territory \u2026 and all of us will get things wrong, but there is a big responsibility on our shoulders to apply our own judgment, and [that includes] not standing up at a podium and coming out with something that you have half-heard and possibly misunderstood.\u201d The number of home testing kits available ran out in only two minutes after the government opened Covid-19 testing to all key workers and their families. No 10 said 5,000 home testing kits \u2013 the total amount on offer \u2013 were ordered online on Friday morning. Another 15,000 tests are anticipated to take place at drive-through centres on Friday, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. The spokesman added the government hoped to have 18,000 daily home testing kits available for key workers by the \u201cend of next week\u201d. Downing Street also confirmed that in the 24 hours up to 9am on Thursday, 23,560 tests for coronavirus were carried out and total capacity for testing now stands at 51,121 per day. The number of NHS care workers and relatives tested has reached 119,333, with absence rates due to coronavirus among doctors at 4.1% and 8.2% for nurses in the NHS in England. That compares with 6.6% for doctors and 9.5% for nurses on 4 April. A second world war veteran with a long-standing lung condition has been given the all-clear to go home after spending six days in hospital with Covid-19. Douglas Moore, 98, was admitted to Kettering general hospital on 15 April after having a fall as well as having a high temperature and a cough. Moore, from Wellingborough in Northamptonshire, said he felt \u201cvery special\u201d after nurses gave him a round of applause as he was discharged on Wednesday. They were very good to me in hospital and I felt very special when they gave me a clap and a cheer when I left today. I think they are all absolutely wonderful and the hospital is wonderful too. The veteran served in the 8th Army as a signaller, and was one of the pioneers in the use of radar in Egypt where it was used to spot enemy planes, boats and mines. His grandson Lee Tuffin said: My granddad is just an amazing man. He is always worried more about everyone else than himself. His memory is surprisingly good for his age and everyone who meets him loves him, and they can\u2019t get over the fact he is 98. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has published a framework to help determine when Wales will begin to relax lockdown restrictions and learn to \u201clive and work alongside coronavirus\u201d. The move echoes similar steps taken by the Scottish government on Thursday, when the first minister Nicola Sturgeon published her government\u2019s planning for moving beyond current restrictions there and accepting the new normal of living and working alongside Covid-19. The Welsh government said a Wales-wide programme of surveillance, case identification, and contact tracing is being developed through the office of the chief medical officer, Dr Frank Atherton. It will highlight the importance of community testing and support the containment of emerging coronavirus infections as and when restrictions are eased. The framework and the seven questions below will help determine when the time is right to relax some of the lockdown regulations, it added. The seven questions are: Would easing a restriction have a negative effect on containing the virus? Does a particular measure pose a low risk of further infection? How can it be monitored and enforced? Can it be reversed quickly if it creates unintended consequences? Does it have a positive economic benefit? Does it have a positive impact on people\u2019s wellbeing? Does it have a positive impact on equality? Drakeford said that while the unprecedented steps taken to enact the lockdown have helped the NHS and saved many lives, it has come with its own cost to people\u2019s wider health and wellbeing and long-term costs to the economy. He added: Coronavirus is not going to disappear \u2013 it is likely it will be with us for a long time. We will need to have some sort of restrictions in place for some time yet to continue to control the spread of the virus and reduce community transmission. This framework will help us determine what is right for Wales. There is a long road ahead of us towards recovery to pre-pandemic levels, but if we continue to work together, I hope we will be able to make changes to the restrictions and see a gradual return to something resembling normal life. Dr Atherton said: Action to ease the lockdown restrictions will need to be supported by a comprehensive public health response, which will need to be developed quickly and at scale. We are now working towards a new recovery phase to lead us out of the pandemic but only when the conditions are right. More details on this to follow. The number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 in Scotland is 9,697, an increase of 288, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told reporters at her daily briefing. She added that reductions in numbers in hospital and intensive care give \u201creal and growing cause of optimism\u201d \u2013 there were 1,710 people in hospital as a result of coronavirus, a decrease of 38, and 141 in intensive care, a decrease of seven. She also announced that, since 5 March, 2,271 people who had been in hospital as a result of the virus had been discharged. Finally, she said a further 64 deaths had occurred overnight, taking the total to 1,184. A new online ordering system needs to be up and running immediately to stop vital supplies of protective equipment for frontline care workers from running out, the government has been warned. The Local Government Association (LGA) said social care workers and council service staff were risking their lives keeping services going during the coronavirus outbreak due to a \u201cchronic\u201d lack of personal protective equipment. It said dwindling supplies would run out in days and called for councils to be given an urgent guarantee that emergency supplies would reach them while they waited for the government\u2019s \u201cClipper service\u201d to be fully operational. The Clipper system is intended to provide a central hub for the supply and distribution of PPE but has faced delays, the LGA said, adding that it could take at least another three weeks for it to get up to speed. The government has faced mounting criticism over its failure to ensure NHS staff treating coronavirus patients and care home workers have the PPE they need. Based on feedback from councils, the LGA said local areas could each need access to millions of pieces of PPE including masks, aprons and gloves each week. Ian Hudspeth, chairman of its community wellbeing board, said that social care staff could not afford any more delays in getting critical PPE, adding that while emergency supplies had been \u201chelpful\u201d they had also been \u201csporadic and inconsistent\u201d and not always enough to meet local demand. Councils recognise that starting a new supply and distribution system from scratch is a huge undertaking, but we cannot afford any more delays. The government\u2019s online ordering system needs to be fully operational as soon as possible, so that councils and care providers can directly request that critical PPE gets to the frontline where it is desperately needed. The LGA said councils were having to appeal to local businesses, manufacturers and other organisations to see if they can help supply unused items or produce any new PPE such as gloves, aprons, goggles and masks. The government has pledged it will support the light rail systems in cities around England, after mayors and transport authorities warned that services might have to close down due to falling revenues during lockdown. Vital urban transport systems such as Manchester\u2019s Metrolink, the Tyne and Wear Metro, the West Midlands Metro, and Sheffield and Nottingham\u2019s trams will get additional help to stay open for essential journeys, the government said. Weeks of talks have still not produced a firm plan of action but the Department for Transport said it \u201cconfirmed it will support\u201d them with funding. DfT has also announced a \u00a317.5m fund to keep freight routes, mainly ferries, running. Some \u00a328m will cover routes between Britain and Northern Ireland, while another \u00a310m will back boats to the Scilly Isles and the Isle of Wight. Further, unspecified funding will also be used to protect ferry routes to mainland Europe. Some of the UK\u2019s largest charities are to help the developers of a Covid-19 symptom tracker app get over-70s to use it. So far more than 2.5 million participants have downloaded the NHS-endorsed app created by King\u2019s College London and health science company ZOE. But since its launch on 24 March, developers have found fewer older people logging in. App designers want more over-70s and people with pre-existing health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes and asthma, to sign up as they are considered most at risk from Covid-19 and symptoms may be different. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and charities including Age UK, the British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research UK and Diabetes UK will use their social media and networks to help promote the app. Study leader Claire Steves, clinical senior lecturer at King\u2019s, said they would help developers \u201ccapture more data from people who may be less able to use an app\u201d. Through updates to what she called a \u201ccitizen science project\u201d, people can now use the same phone to report their symptoms daily on the app and, with permission, those of someone they care for who may not have access to their own smartphone. Steves added: [Over-70s and those with underlying conditions] seem to present slightly differently from the usual cough and fever. They might present with other things, like a confusional state or maybe diarrhoea, abdominal symptoms. If we can really prove that and know that and share that with everybody then potentially that could be really important in reducing spread from the virus. Anyone can join the study by downloading the app from covid.joinzoe.com and answering a few questions about their health and medications. Tech giants Facebook, Google and Twitter are to face questions from MPs over the spread of coronavirus disinformation. Senior executives from the three companies are to appear before the digital, culture, media and sport committee next Thursday. Social media and internet platforms have come under scrutiny over the ability of disinformation and false claims relating to Covid-19 to spread online. The committee said it would ask the companies about the measures put in place to stop the spread of false narratives, including conspiracy theories around 5G being linked to the outbreak, and false Twitter accounts posing as NHS hospitals and staff. The companies will be asked how they plan to slow the \u201cinfodemic\u201d of false claims appearing online. Earlier this week, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, told the committee the Cabinet Office was rebutting around 70 false narratives about the pandemic every week, as part of a cross-government disinformation unit. He praised social media companies for \u201chow they have stepped up to the plate\u201d, but said DCMS had spoken to them about how they could \u201cbeef up\u201d their systems, as well as addressing the speed of action and working out of hours. The biggest thing that struck me is just the need for speed of response. If misinformation is out there, you know it\u2019s a bit of a cliche, but it can be round the world in moments, so the need to not sort of say, \u2018we\u2019ll look into this and come back to it\u2019 ... we need fast action to nip this kind of stuff in the bud. Southeastern employees taking part in the weekly Clap for Carers event last night. Easing the lockdown depends on the speed at which the number of new cases of Covid-19 falls and that is as yet \u201cunknown\u201d, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said. The number of new cases is being tracked through hospital admissions, through a new testing study in the community announced on Wednesday, and data that will be gathered from people coming forward for tests under an expansion of the programme. However, he added that there was no prospect of easing the lockdown yet, and that cases needed to drop substantially before the next phase of isolating infected people and their contacts could be truly effective. Through a process of mass testing and by isolating infected people and their contacts, ministers hope that future localised outbreaks of coronavirus can be kept under control. Hancock told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: Now that we\u2019re at the peak, and we very much hope that things will start to slow down and, if and when they do, then the speed with which the number of new cases reduces will, frankly, determine how long we need to keep the measures on, and that is as yet unknown. He said contact tracing worked better when the number of infections was pushed right down. The truth is that we need to get the number of new cases down, right down, and the lower you go, the more effective contact tracing is because the more resources you can put into each individual case that gets a positive test. You can really make sure you can get hold of all of their contacts and get them, in many cases, to self-isolate. The smaller the number of new cases, the more effective the test, track and trace system will be. Physical distancing was driving down the numbers, Hancock said, adding that the contact tracing operation would be functioning in a \u201cmatter of weeks\u201d. He said mass testing, contact tracing and a new contact tracing app were \u201cso crucial to holding down the rate and level of transmission of the disease\u201d. The Department of Health and Social Care has apologised after the website set up for key workers to book Covid-19 tests stopped accepting applications due to high demand. The part of the gov.uk website set up for key workers to book coronavirus tests was not accepting new applications by mid-morning on Friday. The website, which enables people to book tests at a drive through centre or register for a home test, said: Coronavirus test: applications closed. You can\u2019t currently register for a Covid-19 test. Please check back here later. The DHSC tweeted: London Gatwick says it does not expect passenger numbers to come back to pre-Covid levels for another four years. Its chief executive, Stewart Wingate, said the airport, which mainly serves leisure routes for holidaymakers in the south-east, still had \u201cconfidence in the medium and longer term\u201d and could survive even if flights did not resume this summer. Around 2,000 staff have been furloughed and more than 500 employees have been let go altogether, and the airport has secured a \u00a3300m loan as it burns through cash at the rate of \u00a325-30m a month. Around 600 remain at work. Wingate said the predictions were modelled on the aftermath of the financial crisis and Sars, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re determined to keep Gatwick open so as and when airlines can fly again we can immediately ramp up.\u201d At its peak Gatwick handled 55 flights an hour. Now the airport has closed one terminal and operates only for a short window each day. Apart from some repatriation flights and the occasional humanitarian flight with medical supplies, there are now just three regular scheduled flights \u2013 one of which is a thrice-weekly Belavia service to Minsk. Thousands of transport workers in London are to be furloughed under moves to address the huge financial impact of the lockdown. Transport for London (TfL) said 7,000 staff \u2013 around a quarter of its workforce \u2013 whose work had been reduced or paused would be affected from Monday for an initial period of three weeks. TfL will be able to access funding from the government\u2019s job retention scheme, saving the organisation an estimated \u00a315.8m every four weeks. Tube journeys have fallen by 95% and bus use by 85% since last month\u2019s lockdown, with people urged only to make essential journeys. TfL said its main source of income had almost \u201cdisappeared\u201d. The government\u2019s scheme means TfL can access funding for 80% of the salary of furloughed staff up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month, with the organisation making up the rest of salaries and continuing to pay pension contributions. London\u2019s transport commissioner, Mike Brown, said: We have significantly cut our costs over recent years but nevertheless the success of encouraging the vast majority of people to stay at home has seen our main revenue, fares, reduce by 90%. We are now taking steps to use the government\u2019s job retention scheme to further reduce our costs where work has been paused because of the virus, while at the same time supporting our staff financially. Our work with the government about the support that we need are ongoing and are constructive. We hope for an urgent agreement so that we can continue to provide the city with the vital transport it needs now and going forward. A woman has died from coronavirus just days after giving birth, without ever being able to hold her newborn son. Fozia Hanif, started to develop symptoms and tested positive for the disease just before her 29th birthday, resulting in the premature birth of her son Ayaan earlier this month. Just six days after she gave birth, Hanif\u2019s family were given the devastating news that she would not recover and her ventilator would be turned off. The probation service worker was only ever able to see her newborn son on a photograph printed for her by nurses at Birmingham Heartlands hospital, with her family describing it as a \u201chappy\u201d moment. Her husband of nearly seven years, Wajid Ali, told ITV News: She was really happy, she got the baby photo they (nurses) printed out for her. She was holding it and saying \u2018look it\u2019s our baby\u2019 and \u2018we\u2019re going to come home soon\u2019 \u2026 that\u2019s the last time I spoke to her. This is from the Press Association\u2019s Alan Jones In this thought-provoking video, three Uber drivers who believe they caught coronavirus from passengers before the UK lockdown started share their experiences of the illness, pay tribute to drivers who have died, and call for better safety standards for drivers in London.

Thanks so much. Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Twitter: @sloumarsh Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com A third of coronavirus-related deaths in Northern Ireland are happening in care homes, new figures have indicated. The latest weekly update from the Northern Ireland Statistical and Research Agency (Nisra) records 276 deaths involving Covid-19 in the region up to April 17. Of these, 60.1% occurred in hospitals, 33.7% in care homes, 5.1% at private addresses and 1.1% at hospices. Police in Scotland have arrested 78 people and issued 1,637 fines for breaching the country\u2019s strict lockdown and social distancing rules, as well as taking 111 people home \u201cusing reasonable force\u201d over the last month. The detailed statistics published on Friday morning by Police Scotland show its officers have dealt with a total of 7,814 people for breaching lockdown laws, with the majority accepting police advice and moving voluntarily. The force said 4,640 people had dispersed after getting police advice and 1,348 did so \u201cafter being instructed\u201d. Fixed penalty notice fines under these powers are \u00a360, reduced to \u00a330 if paid within 28 days. Its data showed its busiest patch was Greater Glasgow, with 15 arrests, 311 fines and 2,328 people being moved on by the police. Police Scotland has appointed John Scott QC, a senior human rights lawyer, to independently review its use of the powers. Deputy chief constable Malcolm Graham said the force had cancelled non-essential training and redeployed officers on to street patrols to increase visible policing. \u201cOn the small number of occasions where officers have taken enforcement action, this has largely been in response to house parties or public gatherings, while a small minority of irresponsible and selfish people who repeatedly and wilfully break the law, have now received multiple fixed penalty notices. \u201c[For] generations, successful policing in Scotland has relied on the consent of the communities we serve, and I am grateful for the very high levels of support and co-operation we have seen thus far.\u201d Dwindling supplies of vital life-saving personal protective equipment for frontline care workers will run out within days, council leaders have said. Their warning comes as the rollout of the government\u2019s new supply website is delayed. The government\u2019s \u201cClipper\u201d system is supposed to provide a central hub for the supply and distribution of PPE but is not fully up and running and could take at least another three weeks to get up to speed. The Local Government Association suggests that councils and local areas could each need access to millions of pieces of PPE, including masks, aprons and gloves each week, based on feedback from councils. It said shortages of PPE were hampering efforts to combat the coronavirus and called for councils to be given an urgent guarantee that emergency supplies would reach them and their partners while they waited for the Clipper service to be fully operational. Ian Hudspeth, chairman of the LGA\u2019s community wellbeing board, said: Social care staff and all those working in frontline roles are doing an incredible and dangerous job in challenging circumstances, given the chronic national shortfall of PPE. We must make sure our vital social care workers have all the protection and equipment they need to look after our most elderly and vulnerable. Emergency drops have been helpful, but they have been sporadic and inconsistent, with some supplies not always enough to meet local demand. Councils recognise that starting a new supply and distribution system from scratch is a huge undertaking, but we cannot afford any more delays. The government\u2019s online ordering system needs to be fully operational as soon as possible, so that councils and care providers can directly request that critical PPE gets to the frontline where it is desperately needed. The England and Wales Cricket Board has been forced to further delay the start of the season, but a decision over whether to mothball The Hundred for 12 months has been pushed back to next week. In a statement issued on Friday morning, following a board meeting the evening before, the ECB confirmed that no professional matches would take place before 1 July due to the Covid-19 pandemic as it continues to wait for a green light from the government. The health secretary has said a new online booking system will be key as the government scrambles to meet its 100,000-a-day coronavirus testing target by the end of the month. The government announced a major expansion of eligibility for testing \u2013 less than a week before a self-imposed deadline \u2013 after it was criticised for a low uptake of tests, with the latest daily figure of 23,000 still less than half the total capacity, which has risen to 51,000. All key workers will now be able to get a test if they or their employers request one, announced Matt Hancock, as he said widespread testing and tracing of those coming into contact with confirmed cases was the only way to ease physical distancing measures. Read more here. Responding to the government\u2019s coronavirus contact tracing strategy, Ian Hudspeth, chairman of the Local Government Association\u2019s community wellbeing board, said: Any national plans by government to track and trace coronavirus needs to be complemented by making use of existing local knowledge and skills on the ground. Councils want to play their full part in the national effort to defeat this disease. Directors of public health working in councils, alongside a range of other local services such as environmental health, public health including sexual health services, and infection control nurses already have the experience of testing and contact tracing in their communities. They have the necessary skills to work with government on this, to scale up the system at pace and shape this at a local level. Some of these workers may need to be supported by recent graduates, retired staff, trainees and other civil servants to help meet demand, monitor compliance with government advice and enforce health protection regulations. This extra demand on existing services would need to be met by additional resources and funding, if councils are to help test, trace and isolate those with Covid-19. Company directors are calling for changes to the coronavirus loan scheme, saying many businesses are reluctant to engage in the current system. The Institute of Directors said the scheme should be improved and widened in scope to make finance more easily available to small and medium-sized firms (SMEs). Almost half of 900 SME business leaders surveyed said the current loan system is not suitable for their organisation. A further 25% feel they are not eligible for the loans, and around 14% have directly engaged with the system - including 2% that have had their application rejected. The business leaders polled said application procedures are complex, such as needing to provide detailed forecasts, with lengthy processing times, often taking weeks rather than days. Those surveyed said they are more likely to reduce operational costs or make redundancies first, rather than take on external finance if they have to improve their financial situation, said the IoD. First Minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster said there could be a recognition that some parts of the UK should be allowed to emerge out of the coronavirus restrictions earlier than others. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I heard Matt (Hancock) saying \u2018It is my preference we should work together\u2019 and of course it is my preference absolutely as well. We have been working together as four nations, continuing to decide what is the best way forward. But the two positions are not mutually exclusive because the point I\u2019ve been making is that we may decide, as a United Kingdom, on criteria which will mean that different regions will move at different times. And just to be clear, I wasn\u2019t suggesting that Northern Ireland would be the first mover - we\u2019re not out of the woods, we are not making a dash for the exit, not in any way. What I was suggesting was that we may, as a country, decide that there are different regions that will move at different times. Morning all. I will be bringing you updates for the next few hours. Please do get in touch with me via any of the channels below to share any insight, news tips, comments or more. It\u2019s always helpful and very nice to hear from readers. Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Twitter: @sloumarsh Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Sir Keir Starmer has asked Doreen Lawrence to lead a review into the impact of coronavirus on black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. The Labour leader also appointed Lady Lawrence, the mother of Stephen Lawrence, who was stabbed to death in a racist attack 27 years ago this week, as race relations adviser. Starmer said: \u201cDoreen Lawrence has spent almost three decades campaigning against injustice. I have seen first-hand her drive and determination, and was proud to stand beside her in fighting for justice for Stephen. \u201cHer achievements embody Labour\u2019s values and our historic mission to create a fairer, more equal society. \u201cIt is extremely concerning to see the disproportionate toll coronavirus is taking on our BAME communities. We cannot afford to treat this as an issue to investigate once the crisis is over. We must address it now.\u201d Nurse Katy Davis, 38 has died from coronavirus. Davis, aged 38, had tested positive for the virus on admission to hospital. She had an underlying health condition and had been unwell for some time prior to her admission. She died on the evening of Tuesday 21 April at Southampton general hospital. Paula Head, chief executive at University Hospital Southampton NHS foundation trust, said: \u201cI want to pay tribute to Katy who sadly passed away on Tuesday. Katy has been described by her colleagues where she worked in child health as a nurse people would aspire to be like and that nursing was more than just a job to her. \u201cOn behalf of everyone here at UHS, including our patients and the communities we serve, I would like to offer our sincere condolences to her family.\u201d The Guardian has been tracking all health worker deaths here. Health secretary Matt Hancock said he would not be listening to calls, some of which have come from the Conservative backbenches, to \u201cmove sooner\u201d on lifting the lockdown. He told the BBC: \u201cI will not allow for changes to be made that are unsafe. We have got to keep the public safe. I understand the economic pressures and that is my background and I care deeply about that.\u201d He added: \u201cThe point is, the improvement in people\u2019s health from getting the number of new cases down, and getting it right down, is also the best thing for the economy. \u201cBecause the worst thing for the economy would be a second spike and, instead, if you get the number of new cases right down, then you can hold it down through testing, tracking and tracing and that allows you to release more of the measures. \u201cI understand those voices who are saying we should move sooner but that is not something we are going to do. \u201cWe are going to move when it is safe to do so.\u201d Testing was \u201cslow at the beginning of the month\u201d, Hancock admitted, but said the government was \u201cahead\u201d of its plan to be able to test 100,000 people per day by May. \u201cThe reason why the increase was pretty slow at the start of the month is because we have been building these systems to automate the testing, automate the labs and the IT systems that are needed,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cWe are ahead of our internal plan for where we expected the amount of capacity to be and we have got a week left to hit that goal.\u201d Asked if he thought the 100,000 daily target would be met, he replied: \u201cI do, yes, but nothing is guaranteed in life.\u201d Another NHS doctor has died, as the number of health workers losing their lives to coronavirus grows. Dr Vishna Rasiah, known to all his friends as Vish, was a consultant neonatologist at Birmingham women\u2019s hospital and was highly regarded across the Midlands as part of his role as clinical lead for the regional neonatal network. Sarah-Jane Marsh, chief executive of Birmingham women\u2019s and children\u2019s hospital foundation trust, said: \u201cVish was an amazing doctor, leader, colleague and friend passionate about the care of babies and their families. Losing him in such a cruel and unfair way will be too much to bear for many of us, in particular anyone involved in neonatal care, and of course his beautiful wife and daughter. \u201cAs our tears flow, we must always remember the values that Vish stood for, and hold his vision, courage and compassion in our hearts. God bless you, Vish, and may you rest in peace.\u201d Dr Fiona Reynolds, the trust\u2019s medical director, said: \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking that we have lost someone as talented, dedicated and respected as Vish. His loss will not only be felt by his friends and colleagues at our hospital, but by many across the Midlands who worked alongside him for so long. \u201cVish touched the lives of many families during his time as a neonatal consultant in Birmingham, and will be sadly missed.\u201d Vish was a proud husband and father. His wife, Liza, said: \u201cWe\u2019re devastated at losing our beloved Vish. He was such a loving husband and father to our beautiful daughter, Katelyn, and much-loved son and brother to our family in Malaysia and Trinidad. His whole family meant the world to him, and he absolutely doted on Katelyn. \u201cVish loved his work; to him it was so much more than a job, and his colleagues are part of our family too. He treated every patient and family he cared for as his own; I couldn\u2019t have been prouder of him. \u201cI would like to thank the staff at Worcestershire royal hospital for the kindness, compassion and the care that they have provided to us over an incredibly difficult past few weeks.\u201d Staying at home has led to a notable reduction in the hum of ground vibrations in the UK generated by human activities such as air and road traffic and industrial work, geoscientists have said. Experts said that compared to noise levels before lockdown, signals from seismometers across the country show ambient noise caused by people going about their daily lives has dropped between 20% and 50% in the last five weeks. Seismometers are normally used to record earthquakes and volcanic activity, but they also track the vibrations in the planet\u2019s upper crust, or seismic noise, caused by humans. Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the British Geological Survey in Nottingham, told the PA news agency: \u201cWe have got a network of around 100 sensors all across the UK measuring seismic activity. \u201cWhat we have since lockdown is that noise levels at nearly all of our stations have gone down by somewhere between 20% to 50%.\u201d Hancock was fairly dismissive of the Scottish government\u2019s 26-page document on moving out of lockdown when interviewed on Today, arguing it was a \u201creiteration\u201d of his own oral statement of five tests and stating his preference is for easing restrictions \u201cas one\u201d across the UK. Hancock may well have been irritated by Tory reaction reported overnight which praised Sturgeon\u2019s framework and called on the UK government to be similarly open about plans. The document discussed easing restrictions on schools, businesses and outdoor activities, part of her pledge to treat the Scottish public \u201clike grown-ups\u201d, As we reported yesterday, within the first five hours of being available online, the PDF of the document was requested 170,000 times. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the contact tracing operation would be functioning in a \u201cmatter of weeks\u201d. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: It will be up and running in a matter of weeks and the 18,000 we plan to recruit is really just the start. Because the combination of mass testing and contact tracing alongside it, both with people doing the contact tracing and with technology, a new app that will help to identify who people have been close to \u2013 these things are so crucial to holding down the rate and level of transmission of the disease. They work far better when there are fewer new cases but, if they work as they have done in other countries, then they will be able to hold down the number of new cases with fewer social distancing restrictions, which is why they are so important to get in place in large scale. Our digital editor, Claire Phipps, has noticed that all the home tests for key workers have already gone. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the new online booking system will be key to the government reaching its target of 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of the month. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: \u201cNot as many people have been coming for (a test) as we had expected.\u201d I am working on a memorial article to pay tribute to NHS workers who have died due to coronavirus. Please help me by sharing any new names with me, this is the best way to get in touch. We are trying to make it as comprehensive as possible and your support in doing this would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks in advance. Hello to everyone waking up this morning. Below is a summary of the latest updates. Please get in touch this morning to share your thoughts, comments and news tips. \u2022 The US president, Donald Trump, said Boris Johnson sounded \u201cready to go\u201d when they spoke on the phone this week, following reports in the Telegraph that the prime minister is preparing to return to work on Monday. \u2022 The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the new online booking system will be key to the government reaching its target of 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of the month. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: \u201cNot as many people have been coming for (a test) as we had expected.\u201d \u2022 An NHS doctor who died of Covid-19 had reportedly pleaded with his hospital to provide protective equipment (PPE) in the days before he caught the disease. Dr Peter Tun died aged 62 at his own workplace, the Royal Berkshire hospital, on 13 April after testing positive for the coronavirus a week earlier. \u2022 The first human tests of a potential coronavirus vaccine have begun. However, the scientist leading the programme has warned that a mass vaccination programme is still many months away. So far, only two volunteers have been injected \u2013 one with a coronavirus vaccine candidate and one with a meningitis vaccine acting as a control. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said there should be a \u201cpublic debate\u201d about how the UK could lift the Covid-19 restriction. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, the Labour MP said: The government needs to be open about its approach to the different options for easing the lockdown, to be transparent about how the different options are going to be considered and how they are going to be evaluated. We then can of course look at which sectors are most likely to see restrictions lifted. What I would like to see then is a real public debate, looking at the public health options, looking at the economic impact. This is so important because the British public are making great sacrifices every day and deserve a government that is open about its future plans.\u201d He said UK government was becoming an \u201coutlier in this\u201d following Scotland\u2019s move to publish plans about how to come out of the lockdown and with the Welsh government expect to follow suit. The chief executive of a hospital trust has criticised a company for \u201coutrageous profiteering\u201d by raising the price of a single item of PPE from \u00a32 to \u00a316.50. Nick Hulme, of the East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust, wrote on Twitter: \u201cJust had a company contact me to offer coveralls at \u00a316.50 each. \u201cTwo months ago they were selling them for \u00a32.00 each. Outrageous profiteering.\u201d Ipswich MP Tom Hunt wrote in reply: \u201cVery depressing that any business would act in such a disgraceful fashion during a national emergency.\u201d Hancock said results of the Covid-19 test for most people would be available within 24 hours, but for some it would take a little longer. He said the government was also introducing home test kits that are then collected by a courier to prevent people having to travel long distances. \u201cThey will start in small numbers but that service will grow, and I think that will be a popular service as it increasingly becomes available.\u201d Hello everyone, and welcome to the UK coronavirus live blog. I will be bringing you updates this morning. Please do get in touch with me via any of the channels below to share any insight, news tips, comments or more. It\u2019s always immensely helpful. Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Twitter: @sloumarsh Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the new online booking system will be key to the government reaching its target of 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of the month. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: \u201cNot as many people have been coming for (a test) as we had expected. \u201cOf course that was a problem but its a good problem because it means we\u2019ve been able to expand who can get a test faster than we had planned.\u201d Gatwick Airport has said it expects it will take up to four years for passenger numbers to return to recent levels once the coronavirus pandemic recedes. It has secured a \u00a3300m loan with a consortium of banks and will not be paying a dividend in 2020, as part of measures \u201cto enable a quick recovery of the business\u201d. The government is being urged to give formal backing to a minute\u2019s silence next week to remember all health, care and other key workers who have lost their lives to coronavirus. Unison, the Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Midwives, who between them represent more than a million NHS and public service workers including porters, refuse collectors and care staff, launched a campaign earlier this week for the nation to take a moment to honour frontline staff who have died during the Covid-19 crisis. Unison general secretary Dave Prentis has written to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urging the Government to back the tribute, at 11am next Tuesday, April 28, which is International Workers\u2019 Memorial Day. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the prime minister was \u201con the mend\u201d but any return to work was a matter for Boris Johnson and his doctors. He told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: \u201cI spoke to the Prime Minister yesterday. He\u2019s definitely in good spirits and getting much better and so that is very good news. \u201cI\u2019m sure the whole country looks forward to him coming out of his isolation.\u201d Asked whether there was pressure on Johnson to return earlier than he was ready, Hancock added: \u201cI hope not. By his nature he is an extremely enthusiastic and hard working guy and he doesn\u2019t like slouching. \u201cOf course, this is an unprecedented crisis. However, having said that, he has followed his doctors\u2019 advice and it is down to a conversation between the Prime Minister and his doctors as to exactly when he comes back. \u201cThe good news is he is clearly very much on the mend. He has spoken to the President of the United States, he has spoken to Her Majesty and he has been talking to those of us in Cabinet who are involved in the response.\u201d An NHS doctor who died of Covid-19 had reportedly pleaded with his hospital to provide protective equipment (PPE) in the days before he caught the disease. Dr Peter Tun died aged 62 at his own workplace, the Royal Berkshire Hospital, on April 13 after testing positive for the coronavirus a week earlier. On March 23 he sent emails to hospital managers pleading for protective equipment, but was told that with PPE in short supply his neuro-rehabilitation ward ranked lower than others that also needed protective kit. Dr Tun was told his team could not even have surgical masks, since there were no suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19 in his ward, even though two members of his team were self-isolating. In one email, published by The Guardian, Dr Tun said: \u201cWe do not have any basic surgical masks for Caversham ward neuro-rehab medical team. The ward stock has been taken by ICU (intensive care), according to a staff nurse ... we do not have eye protection kits, gowns nor scrubs.\u201d One manager had emailed back to refuse his requests, saying: \u201cThese supplies are not widely available and need to be used sensibly... this is the Trust position at the moment and I do not have any powers to influence this.\u201d US president Donald Trump said Boris Johnson sounded \u201cready to go\u201d when they spoke on the phone this week, following reports in the Telegraph that the prime minister is preparing to return to work on Monday. Trump indicated his ally Mr Johnson was sounding better during a phone call this week following his three-night stint in intensive care with coronavirus symptoms. He told a White House briefing on Thursday: \u201cHe sounded incredible, I was actually surprised. \u201cHe was ready to go. I\u2019m very surprised to tell you this. He\u2019s like the old Boris - tremendous energy, tremendous drive.\u201d Hospitals are having to conserve life-saving dialysis fluid in the coming days because of national shortages, as it has been revealed that 28% of coronavirus patients in intensive care who need significant help to breathe also need kidney support. The shortages have forced NHS England to send out emergency guidance to trusts telling them to conserve supplies and lend fluids to each other where needed. The guidance advises a new strategy, including limiting trusts to four days\u2019 supply and advising equipment to connect the patient to dialysis machines can be used for longer than previous guidance stated. The letter said: \u201cThe revised strategy should be to conserve both fluids and sets [equipment used to connect the patient to a dialysis machine] used in CVVH [a form of dialysis] and it is recommended that the following actions are taken. In contrast to previous guidance, sets should be used for 24-48 hours. If the supply of machines allows, the use of the set may continue longer up to the recommended time permitted,\u201d said James Palmer, the national medical director of specialised services at NHS England, in a letter. Read the full article here The first human tests of a potential coronavirus vaccine have begun. However, the scientist leading the programme has warned that a mass vaccination programme is still many months away. So far, only two volunteers have been injected \u2013 one with a coronavirus vaccine candidate and one with a meningitis vaccine acting as a control. Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said: \u201cThe reason we stuck with two volunteers is to make sure there are no unintended effects and we will monitor them very closely over the first few days. \u201cThen we will move on to some larger groups of individuals over the next few weeks.\u201d Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said the scientists didn\u2019t expect to see an immune response for the next 10 days or two weeks after the vaccine has been administered. Pollard said the volunteers that have been injected with the vaccine will not be deliberately exposed to the virus but will instead wait until they come across it in the community. \u201cOf course there isn\u2019t very much virus around in the community at the moment - the lockdown has had a big impact on transmission,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it is difficult to predict exactly when they will meet the virus and it may be some months before that happens.\u201d He said unlike other diseases, there is not yet a \u201chuman model\u201d for Covid-19, meaning scientists do not know what is a safe dose to give volunteers in vaccine trials.

The survey also found that 41% of people who bet had opened a new online account since the pandemic took hold.

The survey was commissioned by Clean Up Gambling, formed this month by Matt Zarb-Cousin, a recovering gambling addict and former Labour party communications adviser, and backed by a former professional poker player, Derek Webb.

      "body": "<p>The leader of the most prominent group in the US peddling potentially lethal industrial bleach as a \u201cmiracle cure\u201d for coronavirus wrote to Donald Trump at the White House this week.</p> \n<p>In his letter, Mark Grenon told Trump that chlorine dioxide \u2013 a powerful bleach used in industrial processes such as textile manufacturing that can have fatal side-effects when drunk \u2013 is \u201ca wonderful detox that can kill 99% of the pathogens in the body\u201d. He added that it \u201ccan rid the body of Covid-19\u201d.</p> \n<p>A few days after Grenon dispatched his letter, Trump went on national TV at his daily coronavirus briefing at the White House on Thursday and promoted the idea that disinfectant could be used as a treatment for the virus. To the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant\">astonishment of medical experts</a>, the US president said that disinfectant \u201cknocks it out in a minute. One minute!\u201d</p> \n<p>He went on to say: \u201cIs there a way we can do something, by an injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it\u2019d be interesting to check that.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ad6c83b5-067f-4fb6-983e-2764c3175db2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BalDN6iGYpE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump did not specify where the idea of using disinfectant as a possible remedy for Covid-19 came from, and the source for his notion remains obscure. But the Guardian has learned that peddlers of chlorine dioxide \u2013 industrial bleach \u2013 have been making direct approaches to the White House in recent days.</p> \n<p>Grenon styles himself as \u201carchbishop\u201d of Genesis II \u2013 a Florida-based outfit that claims to be a church but which in fact is the largest producer and distributor of chlorine dioxide bleach as a \u201cmiracle cure\u201d in the US. He brands the chemical as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/19/church-group-to-hold-washington-event-despite-fda-warnings-against-miracle-cure\">MMS</a>, \u201cmiracle mineral solution\u201d, and claims fraudulently that it can cure 99% of all illnesses including cancer, malaria, HIV/Aids as well as autism.</p> \n<p>Since the start of the pandemic, Genesis II has been marketing MMS as a cure to coronavirus. It advises users, including children, to mix three to six drops of bleach in water and drink it.</p> \n<p>In his weekly televised radio show, <a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/aedb4e1b-3a47-434f-8548-7efe585a1cf1?fbclid=IwAR3iLyvkChEDLLv1_6gwu6A9ky2Zc93Ih0nBhiCPi5DoZQG2VjXarnIkmdw\">posted online</a> on Sunday, Grenon read out the letter he wrote to Trump. He said it began: \u201cDear Mr President, I am praying you read this letter and intervene.\u201d</p> \n<p>Grenon said that 30 of his supporters have also written in the past few days to Trump at the White House urging him to take action to protect Genesis II in its bleach-peddling activities which they claim can cure coronavirus.</p> \n<p>On Friday, hours after Trump talked about disinfectant on live TV, Grenon went further in a post on his <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mark.grenon\">Facebook page</a>. He claimed that MMS had actually been sent to the White House. He wrote: \u201cTrump has got the MMS and all the info!!! Things are happening folks! Lord help others to see the Truth!\u201d</p> \n<p>Paradoxically, Trump\u2019s outburst about the possible value of an \u201cinjection\u201d of disinfectant into the lungs of Covid-19 sufferers came just days after a leading agency within the president\u2019s own administration took action to shut down the peddling of bleach as a coronavirus cure around the US.</p> \n<p>Last week the US Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/bleach-coronavirus-us-orders-group-stop-selling\">obtained a federal court order</a> barring Genesis II from selling what was described as \u201can unproven and potentially harmful treatment for Covid-19\u201d. The FDA also ordered a disciple of Genesis II, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mms-bleach-advocates-telegram-photos-child-injuries-2020-4\">Kerri Rivera</a>, to remove claims that MMS cured coronavirus from her website.</p> \n<p>Last August the FDA issued an urgent warning urging Americans not to buy or drink MMS, which it said was a \u201cdangerous bleach which has caused serious and potentially life-threatening side effects\u201d. Drinking MMS can cause nausea, diarrhea and severe dehydration that can lead to death, the federal agency said.</p> \n<p>The Guardian contacted the White House asking whether Grenon\u2019s letter had influenced Trump\u2019s comments on disinfectant, but did not immediately receive a response. </p> \n<p>Another advocate of bleach as a miracle cure who has been seeking to interest Trump in the treatment is Alan Keyes. He is a former ambassador and adviser to Ronald Reagan who ran unsuccessfully as a Republican candidate for the US Senate and on three occasions for the US presidency.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"29ae219a-db38-4e74-b8e0-effde9cb787b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1bX8kEHTbug?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Keyes has featured Genesis II bleach products as a miracle cure on his online conservative TV show, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=373915986891765&amp;ref=watch_permalink\">Let\u2019s Talk America</a>.</p> \n<p>It is not known whether Keyes has discussed MMS with Trump.

      "bodyText": "The leader of the most prominent group in the US peddling potentially lethal industrial bleach as a \u201cmiracle cure\u201d for coronavirus wrote to Donald Trump at the White House this week. In his letter, Mark Grenon told Trump that chlorine dioxide \u2013 a powerful bleach used in industrial processes such as textile manufacturing that can have fatal side-effects when drunk \u2013 is \u201ca wonderful detox that can kill 99% of the pathogens in the body\u201d. He added that it \u201ccan rid the body of Covid-19\u201d. A few days after Grenon dispatched his letter, Trump went on national TV at his daily coronavirus briefing at the White House on Thursday and promoted the idea that disinfectant could be used as a treatment for the virus. To the astonishment of medical experts, the US president said that disinfectant \u201cknocks it out in a minute. One minute!\u201d He went on to say: \u201cIs there a way we can do something, by an injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it\u2019d be interesting to check that.\u201d Trump did not specify where the idea of using disinfectant as a possible remedy for Covid-19 came from, and the source for his notion remains obscure. But the Guardian has learned that peddlers of chlorine dioxide \u2013 industrial bleach \u2013 have been making direct approaches to the White House in recent days. Grenon styles himself as \u201carchbishop\u201d of Genesis II \u2013 a Florida-based outfit that claims to be a church but which in fact is the largest producer and distributor of chlorine dioxide bleach as a \u201cmiracle cure\u201d in the US. He brands the chemical as MMS, \u201cmiracle mineral solution\u201d, and claims fraudulently that it can cure 99% of all illnesses including cancer, malaria, HIV/Aids as well as autism. Since the start of the pandemic, Genesis II has been marketing MMS as a cure to coronavirus. It advises users, including children, to mix three to six drops of bleach in water and drink it. In his weekly televised radio show, posted online on Sunday, Grenon read out the letter he wrote to Trump. He said it began: \u201cDear Mr President, I am praying you read this letter and intervene.\u201d Grenon said that 30 of his supporters have also written in the past few days to Trump at the White House urging him to take action to protect Genesis II in its bleach-peddling activities which they claim can cure coronavirus. On Friday, hours after Trump talked about disinfectant on live TV, Grenon went further in a post on his Facebook page. He claimed that MMS had actually been sent to the White House. He wrote: \u201cTrump has got the MMS and all the info!!! Things are happening folks! Lord help others to see the Truth!\u201d Paradoxically, Trump\u2019s outburst about the possible value of an \u201cinjection\u201d of disinfectant into the lungs of Covid-19 sufferers came just days after a leading agency within the president\u2019s own administration took action to shut down the peddling of bleach as a coronavirus cure around the US. Last week the US Food and Drug Administration obtained a federal court order barring Genesis II from selling what was described as \u201can unproven and potentially harmful treatment for Covid-19\u201d. The FDA also ordered a disciple of Genesis II, Kerri Rivera, to remove claims that MMS cured coronavirus from her website. Last August the FDA issued an urgent warning urging Americans not to buy or drink MMS, which it said was a \u201cdangerous bleach which has caused serious and potentially life-threatening side effects\u201d. Drinking MMS can cause nausea, diarrhea and severe dehydration that can lead to death, the federal agency said. The Guardian contacted the White House asking whether Grenon\u2019s letter had influenced Trump\u2019s comments on disinfectant, but did not immediately receive a response. Another advocate of bleach as a miracle cure who has been seeking to interest Trump in the treatment is Alan Keyes. He is a former ambassador and adviser to Ronald Reagan who ran unsuccessfully as a Republican candidate for the US Senate and on three occasions for the US presidency. Keyes has featured Genesis II bleach products as a miracle cure on his online conservative TV show, Let\u2019s Talk America. It is not known whether Keyes has discussed MMS with Trump. But the two men have overlapping interests. Not only have they both featured in Republican party and presidential politics, but they were both leading proponents of the Birther conspiracy theory that wrongfully suggested Barack Obama was born outside America. Keyes\u2019s TV show is hosted on IAMtv, a rightwing web-based channel. IAMtv\u2019s other leading anchor is Bob Sisson, who has also advertised Genesis II bleach products on air. In one of his shows, first reported by the Daily Beast, Sisson held up two bottles of Genesis II MMS and said: \u201cGonna meet Trump, it\u2019s only a matter of time. President Trump\u2019s gonna invite us up there, when he finds out about this stuff.\u201d On Friday Trump claimed he was being \u201csarcastic\u201d in his remarks but there is no evidence to back up that claim and he appeared entirely serious as he made them.",

The quiet warnings to limit the technology came after the cabinet had used Zoom to hold a well-publicised meeting at the end of March, a decision that was defended at the time as necessary in \u201cunprecedented circumstances\u201d. Parliament was advised last week by the National Cyber Security Centre, part of intelligence agency GCHQ, that Zoom should only be used for public business. A parliamentary source said those involved were advised Zoom ought not be used for classified business and there was an explicit warning from NCSC \u201cnot use it to talk about things detrimental to the interests of China\u201d. But the warning was only shown to people directly engaged in the negotiations, and not shared more widely with MPs, including members of the foreign or other select committees who may want to conduct inquiries into China-related matters. Senior parliamentary figures were also told that Zoom was safe to use for public business, and the technology was this week used as part of the proceedings in the House of Commons, including at prime minister\u2019s questions. Zoom has exploded in popularity during the coronavirus lockdown as a tool for communication for both social and business purposes, and is now used globally by an estimated 300 million people a day.

There is as yet no drug that has been shown to be effective against the coronavirus, which has killed more than 180,000 people worldwide.</p> \n<p>The limited evidence around hydroxychloroquine so far has come in a steady stream of scientific studies, often as soon as they are posted online as \u201cpreprints\u201d \u2013 ie before they have gone through the rigorous vetting process known as peer review. None of the studies that have been released meet the gold standard for demonstrating a drug\u2019s effectiveness \u2013 a large-scale, double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT), though multiple trials of that kind are under way.</p> \n<p>While the world awaits those results, here\u2019s a guide to some of the studies released thus far:</p> \n<h2>In vitro v in vivo</h2> \n<p>In early February, the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0282-0?fbclid=IwAR3c5iy9h65X1cnkrL6i6fJcWwi0ygN1LtI67SkcgREM4DyxxAcPauRuf5w\">Cell Research</a> published a letter to the editor by Chinese scientists reporting the results of their experiments looking at whether existing drugs might be effective against the coronavirus. The scientists tested five drugs in vitro \u2013 meaning on cells infected with the virus in a laboratory rather than in humans \u2013 and found promising results for two: remdesivir and chloroquine. (Chloroquine is a close relative to hydroxychloroquine, which is considered safer.)</p> \n<p><strong>Caveats:</strong> There is a big difference between a drug showing promise in a laboratory and working in patients. Scientists have gotten similarly promising results with hydroxychloroquine against various viruses in <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(20)30089-8/fulltext\">past in vitro studies</a>, including against the first Sars, but have yet to show its effectiveness against any virus in RCTs.</p> \n<h2>The controversial French study</h2> \n<p>Much of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">media hype</a> around hydroxychloroquine stems from a French study of the drug which purported to show significant reduction in viral load for patients treated with a combination of HCQ and azithromycin, a common antibiotic. The study was a clinical trial, meaning it involved actual patients, and underwent peer review before <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996?via%3Dihub\">publication</a> in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents (IJAA).</p> \n<p><strong>Caveats:</strong> There are numerous problems with this study\u2019s design and the way its results were reported. The researchers downplayed the clinical outcomes \u2013 ie whether or not the patient improved, got worse or died \u2013 and instead based their analysis on measuring how long a patient was shedding the virus \u2013 ie whether the researchers were able to detect its presence from a nasal swab. All of the four patients with clear bad outcomes (three went to the ICU and one died) received the HCQ but were excluded from the viral shedding analysis. The researchers said that the remaining patients who received the drug shed virus for a shorter duration. This opened the door for people promoting the drug to <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/over-three-days-week-fox-news-promoted-antimalarial-drug-treatment-coronavirus-over-100\">mischaracterize</a> their results and say they showed a \u201c100% cure rate\u201d.</p> \n<p>The professional association affiliated with the IJAA has <a href=\"https://www.isac.world/news-and-publications/official-isac-statement\">said</a> the article \u201cdoes not meet the society\u2019s expected standard\u201d, and the publisher has initiated <a href=\"https://www.isac.world/news-and-publications/isac-elsevier-statement\">additional independent peer review</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e299a7f3-c36b-4565-aeb3-0f89c8c5cbf5\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZTXpRNIDpy0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Meanwhile, the group of French scientists has continued to publish <a href=\"https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/pre-prints-ihu/\">preprints</a> reporting results on their continued use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on patients in Marseille, without any control group.</p> \n<h2><strong>A small Chinese clinical trial</strong></h2> \n<p>In early April, Chinese scientists published a <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758v3.full.pdf\">study</a> looking at 62 patients with mild cases of Covid-19. Unlike the French trial, the study was randomized and the treatment and control groups were comparable.

      "bodyText": "With endorsements from a controversial French physician, Fox News and Donald Trump, hydroxychloroquine \u2013 an old anti-malarial drug that is today more commonly used to treat lupus \u2013 has received a disproportionate amount of attention as a potential treatment for Covid-19. It has also become another partisan political wedge issue in the US: conservative politicians and media figures have hyped studies that support the theory that the drug is a potential treatment. And on Wednesday, Rick Bright, the head of a US government agency charged with investing in treatments and responses for pandemics, said he was forced out of his job over his resistance to the administration\u2019s \u201cmisguided directives\u201d promoting \u201cbroad use\u201d of the drug, which he said \u201cclearly lack scientific merit\u201d. The hype around hydroxychloroquine is irresponsible, but the hope is understandable. There is as yet no drug that has been shown to be effective against the coronavirus, which has killed more than 180,000 people worldwide. The limited evidence around hydroxychloroquine so far has come in a steady stream of scientific studies, often as soon as they are posted online as \u201cpreprints\u201d \u2013 ie before they have gone through the rigorous vetting process known as peer review. None of the studies that have been released meet the gold standard for demonstrating a drug\u2019s effectiveness \u2013 a large-scale, double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT), though multiple trials of that kind are under way. While the world awaits those results, here\u2019s a guide to some of the studies released thus far: In vitro v in vivo In early February, the journal Cell Research published a letter to the editor by Chinese scientists reporting the results of their experiments looking at whether existing drugs might be effective against the coronavirus. The scientists tested five drugs in vitro \u2013 meaning on cells infected with the virus in a laboratory rather than in humans \u2013 and found promising results for two: remdesivir and chloroquine. (Chloroquine is a close relative to hydroxychloroquine, which is considered safer.) Caveats: There is a big difference between a drug showing promise in a laboratory and working in patients. Scientists have gotten similarly promising results with hydroxychloroquine against various viruses in past in vitro studies, including against the first Sars, but have yet to show its effectiveness against any virus in RCTs. The controversial French study Much of the media hype around hydroxychloroquine stems from a French study of the drug which purported to show significant reduction in viral load for patients treated with a combination of HCQ and azithromycin, a common antibiotic. The study was a clinical trial, meaning it involved actual patients, and underwent peer review before publication in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents (IJAA). Caveats: There are numerous problems with this study\u2019s design and the way its results were reported. The researchers downplayed the clinical outcomes \u2013 ie whether or not the patient improved, got worse or died \u2013 and instead based their analysis on measuring how long a patient was shedding the virus \u2013 ie whether the researchers were able to detect its presence from a nasal swab. All of the four patients with clear bad outcomes (three went to the ICU and one died) received the HCQ but were excluded from the viral shedding analysis. The researchers said that the remaining patients who received the drug shed virus for a shorter duration. This opened the door for people promoting the drug to mischaracterize their results and say they showed a \u201c100% cure rate\u201d. The professional association affiliated with the IJAA has said the article \u201cdoes not meet the society\u2019s expected standard\u201d, and the publisher has initiated additional independent peer review. Meanwhile, the group of French scientists has continued to publish preprints reporting results on their continued use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on patients in Marseille, without any control group. A small Chinese clinical trial In early April, Chinese scientists published a study looking at 62 patients with mild cases of Covid-19. Unlike the French trial, the study was randomized and the treatment and control groups were comparable. The study found a statistically significant difference in the time it took the two groups to recover, with patients who received HCQ showing shorter periods of fever and cough. Caveats: The number of patients involved was very small, and the researchers did not include any patients with severe or critical illness. This paper has not yet been peer-reviewed. The study authors concluded that their results \u201cpartially confirmed\u201d the potential of HCQ as a treatment, but they said large-scale trials were still needed, as well as basic research to understand the mechanism by which the drug is affecting people. A retrospective analysis of patient data from France While awaiting the results of large-scale clinical trials, some scientists have performed retrospective analyses of real-life patients to emulate a clinical trial. This works by selecting a cohort of patients who received the drug and an equivalent cohort who did not and then comparing their outcomes. In a French retrospective analysis posted as a preprint in mid-April, researchers found \u201cno evidence\u201d that HCQ was an effective treatment when comparing 84 patients who received the drug and 97 who did not. Caveats: Retrospective analyses are not a substitute for RCTs. One clear confounding factor is that researchers do not know why physicians decided to treat some patients with HCQ and others not. The paper has also not yet been peer-reviewed. Red flags in an aborted Brazilian trial While chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are considered safe for their approved uses, they do have side-effects, including increasing the risk of heart arrhythmias in some people. In mid-April, a group of researchers in Brazil posted a preprint revealing that they had called a halt to a clinical trial of chloroquine at high doses after they observed high rates of arrhythmias and a large number of deaths. The paper was published on 24 April by Jama Network Open following peer review, with the authors\u2019 recommendation that the high dose of chloroquine \u201cshould not be recommended\u201d for patients with severe Covid-19 due to the safety concerns. An accompanying editorial by three American physicians advised that the results \u201cshould prompt some degree of skepticism toward the enthusiastic claims about chloroquine and perhaps serve to curb the exuberant use\u201d. Caveats: The Brazilian trial was designed to compare the efficacy of two different doses of chloroquine, and it did not include a control group that only received a placebo. Researchers found the higher dose, which they chose because it was recommended by Chinese authorities, to be unsafe, but they are continuing to test the efficacy of a lower dose.

However, the panel recommended against the use of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin due to the risk of cardiac arrhythmia. On 24 April, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a \u201cdrug safety communication\u201d warning against the use of either hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine outside a hospital setting or clinical trial due to reports of \u201cserious heart rhythm problems\u201d. \u201cHydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing Covid-19,\u201d the communication stated. This article has been updated to correct the version of the drug that was used in the Brazilian trial. It was chloroquine, not hydroxychloroquine.

      "bodyText": "A Brazilian study investigating whether the anti-malaria drug chloroquine was effective in treating patients with Covid-19 was halted on safety concerns, after a high dose of the drug proved lethal for some patients. Chloroquine, and a related drug, hydroxychloroquine, in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin, has been touted as a potential treatment for coronavirus by Donald Trump despite a lack of evidence. The findings were published as a letter in the journal Nature raised alarm about serious heart risks associated with Covid-19 patients taking the drugs and the US Food and Drug Administration warned of serious heart complications. Donald Trump has previously urged Americans to take hydroxychloroquine, although he has apparently backed away from the drug in recent days, and on Thursday even suggested that injections of disinfectant could cure Covid-19 \u2013 an idea that was swiftly refuted by experts, who warned the public \u201cplease don\u2019t inject bleach\u201d. The Brazilian study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Network Open (Jama), was halted by a safety monitoring board before even one-quarter of the planned 440 patients were enrolled. Eighty-one patients with Covid-19 or suspected Covid-19 were given a daily regimen of chloroquine. The randomized clinical trial separated the patients into a high-dose and a low-dose group. Researchers planned to assess their outcomes after 28 days. But after 13 days, six of 40 patients in the low-dose group had died, compared with 16 of 41 patients in the high-dose group. Furthermore, five patients in the high-dose group had underlying heart disease, three of whom died. \u201cDespite these discouraging findings, several other observations prevent concluding categorically that high-dose chloroquine was toxic,\u201d authors of a comment article said. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in combination with azithromycin were first put forward as potential treatments for Covid-19 in a French study described as \u201cmeaningless\u201d. The journal later said the study did not meet standards for publication. But by the time the journal disavowed the study\u2019s flawed design, media outlets had already promoted the unproven and risky drug combination. The treatment was tweeted by the tech billionaire Elon Musk and picked up by Fox News. It was then touted by Trump as a potential \u201cgame-changer\u201d despite serious risks and lack of safety and efficacy data. At least one man has died and a woman was hospitalized after taking chloroquine. The letter published in Nature warned of serious heart problems and risk of \u201csudden cardiac death\u201d in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. In the letter, which unlike a study is not peer-reviewed, a New York City doctor described 84 Covid-19 patients\u2019 reaction to a five-day, twice-daily regimen of the drugs. The patients were monitored on electrocardiogram. Both drugs have independently been shown to increase patients\u2019 risk of \u201cdrug-induced sudden cardiac death\u201d. Among the 84 patients, nine showed signs of potentially severe heart \u201cmalignant arrhythmia\u201d which could increase risk of cardiac arrest, although none had heart attacks. At the end of the study, four patients had died of multi-organ failure, 16 patients were discharged and another 64 remained in hospital. The authors concluded patients on the regimen need to be \u201cconstantly monitored\u201d for heart problems. Despite the lack of evidence that it is an effective treatment for Covid-19, some American hospitals have used hydroxychloroquine to treat seriously ill patients in the hope of some benefit. However, scientists have repeatedly urged caution. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of American have both called for the drug to be used only in clinical trials. In clinical guidelines to doctors, Dr Kevin C Wilson, chief of documents and patient education at the ATS, said that while some lab results showed antiviral effects against the virus, they have yet to be replicated with patients. \u201cThus, the bottom line is, whether hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine confer benefits to patients with Covid-19 are unanswered questions.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison faces calls from within government ranks to extend the increase to unemployment benefits until at least next year amid fears the outlook for jobseekers will remain bleak on the other side of the coronavirus crisis. While the prime minister has insisted a raft of crisis-related economic support measures will \u201csnap back\u201d to their old arrangements to avoid an ongoing budget drain, social welfare advocates argue the jobseeker allowance can never revert to just $40 a day. The Nationals MP for Cowper in NSW, Pat Conaghan, said the effective doubling of the allowance formerly known as Newstart should continue well beyond the six-month deadline. \u201cMy priority is to ensure all people during this challenging time who are losing hours of work or losing jobs have support and I would like to see the coronavirus supplement extended for a further six months to do this,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people who weren\u2019t previously on Newstart and who have lost their job due to the effects of Covid-19 may still struggle to find a job in the six to 12 months after the pandemic, so I would like the coronavirus supplement safety-net extended.\u201d After that, Conaghan said, jobseeker may have to be reduced to begin the task of budget repair but not to its previous levels. He suggested that the weekly rate should be about $75 to $95 above the old rate of $280 per week. The coronavirus supplement that tops up certain income support payments is due to begin flowing from next week. The government has so far processed more than 587,000 jobseeker and related applications since mid-March, more than it normally handles in a year, Morrison said this week. But when asked whether the government was open to considering an increased payment for jobseekers for longer than the six months, the prime minister said: \u201cWe\u2019ve put a Covid supplement in place for the period of the pandemic and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve budgeted for and that\u2019s what our policy is.\u201d That was despite his comments in the context of economic reform that policy ideas needed to be looked at with \u201cfresh eyes\u201d once the crisis subsided. Former prime minister Tony Abbott joined the fray on Friday, arguing it would be politically difficult for the government to wind back the increased jobseeker allowance, \u201cespecially when recipients will be able to say it was government policy that threw them out of work\u201d. Writing an op-ed in The Australian, Abbott suggested turning the payment into \u201ca wage subsidy for older people and a part-time environmental job with local government for younger people\u201d. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said the Coalition had increased the jobseeker amount because it admitted $40 a day wasn\u2019t enough to live on. He said: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t enough to live on two months ago, when these changes were made, why will it be enough to live on in six months\u2019 time?\u201d Labor\u2019s social services spokesperson, Linda Burney, said the government should take the opportunity to set a higher, fairer base rate as it was \u201cunrealistic to think income support can go back to its $40 a day rate without causing hardship to the hundreds of thousands of Australians out of work\u201d. Cassandra Goldie, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service, said one of the best ways to support the recovery would be to continue to provide income support and cash stimulus to people who needed it, as people on low incomes would spend the money in the real economy. \u201cNow is the time for us to come together behind people hit hardest by this crisis, with so many now unemployed, and give them confidence that they will be supported with decency, and for as long as it takes,\u201d she said.

One is the insidious, invisible nature of the disease, in comparison to other natural disasters like floods and bushfires; the pandemic was not a sudden dramatic event like these disasters, no traditional heroes emerged, and it did not leave a visible legacy of destruction \u2013 except, of course death, and rises in the number of single parents and orphans. </p> <p>As the <a href=\"https://www.rahs.org.au/an-intimate-pandemic-the-community-impact-of-influenza-in-1919/\">Royal Australian Historical Society</a> notes of the Spanish flu pandemic, \u201cAfter the emergency was declared over in September 1919, individuals, families and communities recovered and focused on building a post-war world. Unlike the numerous [Australian] memorials to the Anzacs who served and died over 1914\u201318, however, there are relatively few monuments to the victims and volunteers of 1919.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile, historian <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/100-years-later-why-dont-we-commemorate-the-victims-and-heroes-of-spanish-flu-109885\">Peter Hobbins writes</a>, \u201cCompared with the Anzac memorials that peppered our towns and suburbs in the decades after the Great War, few monuments mark the impact of pneumonic influenza ... Nevertheless, its stories of suffering and sacrifice have been perpetuated in other ways, especially within family and community memories. A century later, these stories deserve to be researched and commemorated.\u201d</p> <p>There are fewer than a dozen public Australian monuments to the dead of that pandemic. It is overshadowed in historiography by obsession with Anzac.</p> <p>Patrick Hodgson, whose <a href=\"https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/52042/1/52042-hodgson-2017-thesis.pdf\">doctoral thesis</a> considers the pandemic\u2019s impact in Queensland, also contemplates a national \u201cforgetting\u201d of the Spanish flu. </p> <p>\u201cDespite the Australian authorities\u2019 penchant for military sacrifice as the defining symbol of nationhood, public memorialisation of civilians \u2013 even those who sacrificed their lives in helping others during the pandemic \u2013 has long been regarded as lacking sufficient worthiness\u201d, he writes.</p> <p>\u201cAt a time when the devastation of World War One was being rewritten into a myth of glorious sacrifice on which a nation could at last stand proud, Australia\u2019s 13,000 to perhaps 20,000 influenza deaths and the many more who were incapacitated by the 1918-1920 pandemic, or who heard their state\u2019s call to a mission of mercy, have left virtually no mark on the Australian landscape or in public memory.\u201d</p> <p>In Queensland there is, Hodgson points out, only one recorded memorial to a flu victim. The monument at Tambo is <a href=\"http://monumentaustralia.org.au/\">dedicated to Reginald Barry</a> \u201cwho worked unceasingly to save those people in Tambo stricken with pneumonic influenza and by the end of the epidemic contracted the disease himself and died\u201d. </p> <p>Some 3,000 civilian nurses volunteered during the first world war at field and base hospitals in Australia and elsewhere. About 2,500 were in the Australian Army Nursing Service and about 154 were mentioned in official despatches, seven were awarded the Military Medal for gallantry and 25 died, all from illness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2019/apr/25/australias-leaders-its-media-and-some-historians-persist-in-talking-up-the-big-anzac-game\">Australia\u2019s leaders, its media and some historians persist in talking up the big Anzac game | Paul Daley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hodgson recounts the experience of nurse Rosa O\u2019Kane of Charters Towers. She died of influenza in 1919 and \u201cwas eulogised for her \u2018heroic bravery in the time of danger\u2019 ... [and] considered to be on \u2018active service\u2019 whilst tending to the influenza ravaged soldiers at the Woodman Point Quarantine Station in Western Australia when she succumbed to the disease. The eulogising of O\u2019Kane was not so much for her self-sacrifice during a civil emergency but for her fighting, in a gender-appropriate way, for King and Country. Considered a war death, she was buried with full military honours and her story quietly written into the Anzac mythology.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Kane\u2019s story reminds us of the discretionary power of Anzac mythology to cherry-pick from history and human experience, and of the enormous public resources that support it. (On that score, and in this time of such national austerity, never has there been a more apt moment to abandon the federal government\u2019s absurd decision to spend another $500m on an unnecessary expansion of the <a href=\"http://honesthistory.net.au/wp/coronavirus-slows-momentum-of-498m-war-memorial-extension-project-and-should-allow-another-look/\">Australian War Memorial</a>).</p> <p>By all means we should remember the dead of Anzac. But the commemorations shouldn\u2019t overshadow the contributions of more worthy contributors or be conflated with the experience of those who are today stoically, without grandiosity, helping to stave off a civil health and economic emergency.</p> <p>This is not wartime.</p> <p>\u2022 Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist</p>",

They are nurses, doctors, police, ambos, orderlies, cleaners, delivery drivers, supermarket workers and public servants. Today, as they did 100 years ago when the world was in the grip of the Spanish flu (killing 50 million globally including some 13,000 Australians), they work for the national interest, many putting their lives at risk. How will we remember them? Hopefully with more respect and dignity than Australia did under Billy Hughes, hell-bent on forging a white Australian story of national genesis out of the ashes of the first world war despite having so much other continental history, Indigenous and other, to drawn on. The Australian landscape is dotted with monuments to Anzac\u2019s 62,000 dead. \u201cSacred places,\u201d historian Ken Inglis called them. But where are the memorials to the dead of the last big pandemic, to those who saved so many and died in the process? Eclipsed by proximity of the pandemic to the end of the first world war and by the nationalist fervour to narrate a foundation myth from blood \u201csacrifice\u201d (Hughes had urged men to \u201cfight for White Australia\u201d) the pandemic\u2019s dead were neither commemorated nor memorialised. Battlefield death, for all its inflated, airbrushed \u201cglory\u201d, and its undeniable waste, found a rarefied embrace in national narrative where pandemic stoicism, bravery and death were relegated as prosaic and unworthy of commemoration. Mary Sheehan, nurse and historian of Spanish flu, says, \u201cI\u2019ve also thought that other factors besides the war were worth considering to explain the collective memory loss [about Spanish flu]. One is the insidious, invisible nature of the disease, in comparison to other natural disasters like floods and bushfires; the pandemic was not a sudden dramatic event like these disasters, no traditional heroes emerged, and it did not leave a visible legacy of destruction \u2013 except, of course death, and rises in the number of single parents and orphans. As the Royal Australian Historical Society notes of the Spanish flu pandemic, \u201cAfter the emergency was declared over in September 1919, individuals, families and communities recovered and focused on building a post-war world. Unlike the numerous [Australian] memorials to the Anzacs who served and died over 1914\u201318, however, there are relatively few monuments to the victims and volunteers of 1919.\u201d Meanwhile, historian Peter Hobbins writes, \u201cCompared with the Anzac memorials that peppered our towns and suburbs in the decades after the Great War, few monuments mark the impact of pneumonic influenza ... Nevertheless, its stories of suffering and sacrifice have been perpetuated in other ways, especially within family and community memories. A century later, these stories deserve to be researched and commemorated.\u201d There are fewer than a dozen public Australian monuments to the dead of that pandemic. It is overshadowed in historiography by obsession with Anzac. Patrick Hodgson, whose doctoral thesis considers the pandemic\u2019s impact in Queensland, also contemplates a national \u201cforgetting\u201d of the Spanish flu. \u201cDespite the Australian authorities\u2019 penchant for military sacrifice as the defining symbol of nationhood, public memorialisation of civilians \u2013 even those who sacrificed their lives in helping others during the pandemic \u2013 has long been regarded as lacking sufficient worthiness\u201d, he writes. \u201cAt a time when the devastation of World War One was being rewritten into a myth of glorious sacrifice on which a nation could at last stand proud, Australia\u2019s 13,000 to perhaps 20,000 influenza deaths and the many more who were incapacitated by the 1918-1920 pandemic, or who heard their state\u2019s call to a mission of mercy, have left virtually no mark on the Australian landscape or in public memory.\u201d In Queensland there is, Hodgson points out, only one recorded memorial to a flu victim. The monument at Tambo is dedicated to Reginald Barry \u201cwho worked unceasingly to save those people in Tambo stricken with pneumonic influenza and by the end of the epidemic contracted the disease himself and died\u201d. Some 3,000 civilian nurses volunteered during the first world war at field and base hospitals in Australia and elsewhere. About 2,500 were in the Australian Army Nursing Service and about 154 were mentioned in official despatches, seven were awarded the Military Medal for gallantry and 25 died, all from illness. Hodgson recounts the experience of nurse Rosa O\u2019Kane of Charters Towers. She died of influenza in 1919 and \u201cwas eulogised for her \u2018heroic bravery in the time of danger\u2019 ... [and] considered to be on \u2018active service\u2019 whilst tending to the influenza ravaged soldiers at the Woodman Point Quarantine Station in Western Australia when she succumbed to the disease. The eulogising of O\u2019Kane was not so much for her self-sacrifice during a civil emergency but for her fighting, in a gender-appropriate way, for King and Country. Considered a war death, she was buried with full military honours and her story quietly written into the Anzac mythology.\u201d O\u2019Kane\u2019s story reminds us of the discretionary power of Anzac mythology to cherry-pick from history and human experience, and of the enormous public resources that support it. (On that score, and in this time of such national austerity, never has there been a more apt moment to abandon the federal government\u2019s absurd decision to spend another $500m on an unnecessary expansion of the Australian War Memorial). By all means we should remember the dead of Anzac. But the commemorations shouldn\u2019t overshadow the contributions of more worthy contributors or be conflated with the experience of those who are today stoically, without grandiosity, helping to stave off a civil health and economic emergency. This is not wartime. \u2022 Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "The government is trying to blame the banks for flaws in its jobkeeper program, but the real problem lies closer to home. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is reportedly \u201cfurious\u201d with the banks for not lending businesses enough money to tide them through the month or so until the jobkeeper payments kick in. But businesses say the fundamental problem with the jobkeeper scheme is that it\u2019s paid in arrears. In other words, businesses have to front the money to pay their workers for each month, and then claim it back through the tax office. This has left many businesses, particularly in the sectors worst hit such as hospitality, with an unbridgeable gap of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars that they need to pay now to get into the program, but just don\u2019t have. None of this is the fault of Australia\u2019s banks \u2013 it is instead a fundamental flaw in the way the program was designed by Morrison and his treasurer, Josh Frydenberg. And expecting businesses that are already broke to borrow more money is also pretty rich. Banks have so far loaned $700m to businesses to help them get through the crisis \u2013 which sounds like a lot but really isn\u2019t anywhere near enough. Guardian Australia understands about half has come from Australia\u2019s biggest bank, the Commonwealth, and reports from businesses suggest smaller banks have struggled to get their systems up to scratch quickly. But the big problem with going to the bank is that businesses are borrowing to get behind. This is, once again, because the jobkeeper payment is made after the fact. If you borrow $100,000 to meet this month\u2019s payroll, you will be able to pay it back next month \u2026 and have to immediately borrow the money again to meet the next month\u2019s payroll. While banks are offering an interest deferral for six months, that just means interest payments are quietly compounding in the background, ready to mug business owners when the crisis is over and they\u2019re expected to resume making payments. As a result, many businesses have done the sums and closed their doors rather than get further into hock. For the Liberal party, which is supposed to be the champion of small business, a failure to understand the basics of cashflow seems mind-boggling. But the Morrison government made two design decisions that made this problem inevitable. First, they decided not to pay workers directly, as the UK does \u2013 asked about this, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, has previously claimed this \u201cwould not work\u201d in Australia. He\u2019s never really explained why, given that the Rudd government was able to use ATO systems to put government money in people\u2019s bank accounts during the global financial crisis. Once the government decided to use the business tax system to make the payments, they made the second decision that ensured things would go wrong: to pay in arrears. One of the attractions of using the business tax system to make payments is that tax boffins have a very good idea of the finances of every business in Australia because of a system called single touch payroll, which requires businesses to send wages, super and tax information to the ATO at the same time as they do their regular payroll run. This means the ATO will be able to check that correct jobkeeper payments have been made. But it also means that payments could also be made in advance, and then checked against the actual payroll. Perhaps there were technical reasons why this couldn\u2019t happen, or perhaps the risk of fraud was judged too great. But this was never explained. The jobkeeper debacle also points to a wider problem with the Morrison government\u2019s response to the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Right from the start, in the long-forgotten first stimulus package, it insisted on funnelling everything through the business tax system. Back then \u2013 it was only six weeks, but it feels like a year ago \u2013 Morrison and Frydenberg reckoned they could get economic activity going by offering tax breaks for spending on capital works. But, as I said back then: \u201cIf, as seems likely, major events are cancelled, people are working from home and your restaurant is shut, why would you buy a new kitchen?\u201d The rolling series of exponentially larger spending packages rolled out over the weeks following that first announcement at least indicate that the government realised it needed to do a lot more than offer a few tax lollies to small businesses. And Morrison is now trying to patch jobkeeper up by getting the big four banks to set up a hotline for small businesses who need an urgent loan. But the failure to design packages such as jobkeeper properly in the first place will have cost tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of jobs, throwing people on to the unemployment line. And even if businesses can now get a concessional loan to start making payments, four to six crucial weeks of income for workers who desperately need the money has been ripped away. This will inevitably ripple through the economy, although we won\u2019t be able to see the full effect for months. The whole thing is an inexplicable policy failure, compounded by the impulse to blame an easy target \u2013 the banks \u2013 rather than own up and fix it.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve published a bunch of articles about how the coronavirus crisis has impacted the Australian arts industry. The damage was compounded this month when 49 organisations missed out on Australia Council funding \u2013 and compounded again last week, when the federal government denied changes to jobkeeper legislation that would make the benefits more accessible to casual workers and those on short-term contracts (AKA most arts and entertainment workers). But there are small things you can do. It\u2019s an imperfect solution, as highlighted this week, but streaming Australian music can help. Each week, in partnership with Sounds Australia, Guardian Australia will add some 15 brand new songs to a playlist for you to put on repeat. \u201cAustralian music needs all the help it can get right now,\u201d says Dom Alessio from Sounds Australia, who chose the songs for this playlist from artists who\u2019ve played Sound Australia\u2019s events. \u201cStreaming an Australian song might seem like a really small and insignificant thing to do, but artists get paid when you listen to them, and cumulatively it can have a big impact.\u201d",

Gavin Newsom, the governor, said he did not want to have to report a surge in cases due to residents being irresponsible in the warm weather, with weekend temperatures expected to climb above 90F (32C) in some areas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/22/california-coronavirus-testing-bolinas\">'We hope to be a model': the California town testing every resident for coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPeople are prone to want to go to the beaches, parks, playgrounds and go on a hike,\u201d Newsom said in a news briefing on Thursday after announcing that California had suffered its <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/23/coronavirus-californias-deadliest-day-yet-since-covid-19-outbreak-began/\">deadliest day</a> since the start of the outbreak. \u201cIf it is open, just abide by social distancing.\u201d</p> <p>The policies vary widely across regions. In Ventura county, north of LA, officials have <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-22/coronavirus-ventura-city-beach-park-pier-open-ease-stay-at-home-order\">relaxed beach closure rules</a>, saying residents can now visit and walk on the sand or pier but should not sit down or fish.</p> <p>In San Clemente, Orange county, the local council <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-23/san-clemente-beaches-reopen-residents-only\">voted to reopen the beach</a> for recreational activity such as walking, running, swimming and surfing, but it also said residents should not bring a blanket and hang out. The city is attempting to limit access to local residents by keeping parking lots closed, and other Orange county officials have <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-23/orange-county-keeps-beaches-open-but-tells-outsiders-to-stay-away-during-heat-wave\">urged out-of-town residents not to visit</a> the beaches and parks that remain open.</p> <p>In LA, popular beach and park spots remain largely closed, including the world-famous pier and boardwalk at Venice Beach.</p> <p>The question of beach closures has sparked intense debate across the US, which is likely to become more contentious if various lockdowns and restrictions continue into the summer. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/18/florida-beaches-hundreds-coronavirus\">reopening of the beaches in Florida</a> last week led to backlash from some who feared early moves to ease restrictions could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-us-infection-public-health-experts\">fuel a second wave of Covid-19</a>.</p> <p>Some experts, however, have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1251710115700490241\">argued</a> that governments should find ways to allow people to visit beaches while strongly encouraging distancing, mask-wearing and other safety measures. Getting outside can benefit people\u2019s health, and there are concerns that overly broad restrictions on public spaces could result in people gathering indoors, which would be more dangerous.</p> <p>\u201cOutdoor access has strongly proven links to mental health, emotional wellness, physical health,\u201d said Lucas Zucker, policy director for Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy, an environmental justice group in California. \u201cWe certainly trust the expertise of public health officials. But like so many other social and economic disparities, access to open space was an issue of huge inequality before the crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Zucker was wary of rules that tried to limit beach access to residents of the municipalities on the coast, noting that the population of those cities, such as Santa Monica and Venice, is generally wealthier and less diverse.</p> <p>In southern California, the surfing community has also been divided on the beach rules, with an informal poll by the Surfer publication finding that many surfers believed they could practice safe social distancing while on the water and were <a href=\"https://www.surfer.com/features/covid-19-surfing-ban-poll/\">opposed to restrictions</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing surfers getting a kind of itch that they are not familiar with,\u201d said Todd Prodanovich, editor of Surfer, noting that there was no precedent for this kind of indefinite shutdown of so many beaches.</p> <p>But Prodanovich also said he had no interest in trying to protest against government orders: \u201cDo I miss surfing? Yes. Do I think a lot of surfers could do this safely? Yes. Do I think it\u2019s so important for us to surf right now that public health officials should be accommodating us over whatever larger plan they have? No. We\u2019re just having fun in the ocean.\u201d</p>",

While many Los Angeles area beaches remain closed to the public due to Covid-19, a handful will allow visitors in a limited capacity while adopting a wide range of restrictions, enforcement plans and recommendations. California ordered one of the earliest lockdowns in the country last month and has made some progress in slowing the spread of the virus. Gavin Newsom, the governor, said he did not want to have to report a surge in cases due to residents being irresponsible in the warm weather, with weekend temperatures expected to climb above 90F (32C) in some areas. \u201cPeople are prone to want to go to the beaches, parks, playgrounds and go on a hike,\u201d Newsom said in a news briefing on Thursday after announcing that California had suffered its deadliest day since the start of the outbreak. \u201cIf it is open, just abide by social distancing.\u201d The policies vary widely across regions. In Ventura county, north of LA, officials have relaxed beach closure rules, saying residents can now visit and walk on the sand or pier but should not sit down or fish. In San Clemente, Orange county, the local council voted to reopen the beach for recreational activity such as walking, running, swimming and surfing, but it also said residents should not bring a blanket and hang out. The city is attempting to limit access to local residents by keeping parking lots closed, and other Orange county officials have urged out-of-town residents not to visit the beaches and parks that remain open. In LA, popular beach and park spots remain largely closed, including the world-famous pier and boardwalk at Venice Beach. The question of beach closures has sparked intense debate across the US, which is likely to become more contentious if various lockdowns and restrictions continue into the summer. The reopening of the beaches in Florida last week led to backlash from some who feared early moves to ease restrictions could fuel a second wave of Covid-19. Some experts, however, have argued that governments should find ways to allow people to visit beaches while strongly encouraging distancing, mask-wearing and other safety measures. Getting outside can benefit people\u2019s health, and there are concerns that overly broad restrictions on public spaces could result in people gathering indoors, which would be more dangerous. \u201cOutdoor access has strongly proven links to mental health, emotional wellness, physical health,\u201d said Lucas Zucker, policy director for Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy, an environmental justice group in California. \u201cWe certainly trust the expertise of public health officials. But like so many other social and economic disparities, access to open space was an issue of huge inequality before the crisis.\u201d Zucker was wary of rules that tried to limit beach access to residents of the municipalities on the coast, noting that the population of those cities, such as Santa Monica and Venice, is generally wealthier and less diverse. In southern California, the surfing community has also been divided on the beach rules, with an informal poll by the Surfer publication finding that many surfers believed they could practice safe social distancing while on the water and were opposed to restrictions. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing surfers getting a kind of itch that they are not familiar with,\u201d said Todd Prodanovich, editor of Surfer, noting that there was no precedent for this kind of indefinite shutdown of so many beaches. But Prodanovich also said he had no interest in trying to protest against government orders: \u201cDo I miss surfing? Yes. Do I think a lot of surfers could do this safely? Yes. Do I think it\u2019s so important for us to surf right now that public health officials should be accommodating us over whatever larger plan they have? No. We\u2019re just having fun in the ocean.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Raheem Sterling believes he is 15 goals away from his target for the season, with the Manchester City forward having scored 20 times when the campaign was postponed six weeks ago due to coronavirus. The 25-year-old registered a career-best 25 last season with a further six for England. While Sterling has also managed four international goals in 2019-20, 35 is his ideal tally for Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, having failed to add to the 20 in his last 12 appearances. \u201cI would say probably I\u2019m about 15 goals off where I want to be,\u201d Sterling said. \u201cThose are the targets, to try and create good numbers but at the same time not just have numbers to have numbers. \u201cYou want to have trophies to back up the season because 10 years from now you can score a lot of goals, but if I can\u2019t look back on those goals as being important for my team and having a great value then those goals were pointless. It is [about] trying to contribute as much as I can but at the end of the season have some medals to show for it.\u201d Sterling joined from Liverpool in summer 2015. \u201cDuring my time at City, the most important thing I have learned is the value of winning,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore it was, if I won a game then it was good and if I lost a game, I was disappointed, but it doesn\u2019t burn you as much. Now, if we lose one game in 15 at City you wouldn\u2019t like to be in the dressing room, it is like the worst thing in the world has happened. \u201cI think that is a great surrounding and thing to be in, that nobody wants to lose or accepts losing. That is the biggest thing I have learned since I have been there and is something that I carry with me, not just in football but in anything I do, just that winning mentality and to constantly not take defeat for an answer.\u201d City are the reigning champions and have claimed six of the last seven available domestic trophies. Yet Sterling believes they can still improve. \u201cIt is a team where there is not a lot of egos, even on the pitch everyone wants to do their best,\u201d Sterling said. \u201cCollectively we have the same ambitions, to win competitions and win as many as we can, so it reflects on what the manager [Pep Guardiola] is trying to do and the players are taking it on board superbly well. I think we still have another level to go.\u201d",

In a rambling televised address late on Friday, Brazil\u2019s embattled president denied claims from his outgoing justice minister S\u00e9rgio Moro that he had sought to appoint a new federal police chief in order to gain access to secret intelligence reports \u2013 for reasons that remain murky. \u201cSorry Mr Minister, you won\u2019t make a liar of me,\u201d Bolsonaro declared, flanked by an almost entirely male group of backers, including his politician son Eduardo. Moro\u2019s bombshell allegations sparked pot-banging protests and an immediate outcry among Brazil\u2019s political class, with Brazil\u2019s prosecutor-general Augusto Aras requesting supreme court permission to launch an investigation. \u201cMoro\u2019s testimony \u2026 constitutes strong evidence for an impeachment process,\u201d tweeted Fl\u00e1vio Dino, the leftist governor of the northeastern state of Maranh\u00e3o. Senator Simone Tebet, head of the Senate\u2019s Constitution, Justice and Citizenship committee, tweeted that, if proven, the accusations represented a \u201ccrime of responsibility\u201d \u2013 the same impeachable offence under which leftist president Dilma Rousseff was controversially ousted in 2016. Moro \u2013 who became a hero to conservative Brazilians for jailing the rich and powerful during a sweeping graft investigation called Operation Car Wash \u2013 alleged Bolsonaro had sacked the head of Brazil\u2019s federal police \u2013 its answer to the FBI \u2013 in order to replace him with someone prepared to share secret intelligence reports. \u201cHe wanted someone he had personal contact with, who he could call, gather information from [and] collect intelligence reports from,\u201d Moro said. Amid a looming coronavirus crisis, and just a week after Bolsonaro sacked his popular health minister, the explosive accusations left many wondering how long Bolsonaro\u2019s beleaguered government could survive. \u201cThe president is digging his own grave. He should resign [and] save us from a long impeachment process,\u201d tweeted Brazil\u2019s former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper reported that military officers who form an important bloc in Bolsonaro\u2019s cabinet were considering abandoning the government \u2013 a potentially devastating blow for the president, a former army captain. Speculation has been rife over Bolsonaro\u2019s possible motives for replacing Maur\u00edcio Valeixo, the head of the country\u2019s federal police. A report in one major newspaper, the Correio Braziliense, claimed that the move was in part prompted by a federal police investigation into fake news attacks on the Congress and supreme court that was focusing on the president\u2019s own son, Carlos Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro denied those suggestions on Friday afternoon. \u201cThe insinuations that I wanted to know about ongoing investigations are not true,\u201d he said, claiming there was nothing wrong with his wanting to be in regular contact with the new federal police chief. Moro\u2019s exit has dismayed even Bolsonaro voters, many of whom were already shaken by his dismissive attitude towards the coronavirus pandemic. Brazil now has nearly 53,000 confirmed cases and 3,670 deaths. As a judge, Moro led the \u201cCar Wash\u201d corruption investigation and jailed former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2013 removing Bolsonaro\u2019s main rival in the 2018 election. Moro has remained popular even when his role in the corruption probe was discredited by leaked documents that suggested he had acted improperly \u2013 claims he denies. Losing such a popular minister is a major blow to Bolsonaro. \u201cBolsonaro faces the most decisive moment in his chaotic first term,\u201d said Diego Escosteguy, editor of political news-site Vortex. But Escosteguy cautioned that Congress would still need to approve any impeachment process \u2013 and was only likely to do so after mass demonstrations, as happened before Rousseff was controversially ousted. \u201cIronically, social distancing is Bolsonaro\u2019s ally right now,\u201d Escosteguy said.",

The decision to postpone the tour came as the result of the uncertainty surrounding the safe resumption of the sport in Britain as well as international air travel. \u201cWe continue to be in regular dialogue with the ECB on when and how we might be able to rearrange the Test series,\u201d said the CWI chief executive, Johnny Grave. \u201cClearly playing in June is now not possible and we will continue our discussions with the ECB and other Internationals Boards on trying to find new dates.

I\u2019d like to see this extend throughout the country,\u201d she said. The report and data collected by the children\u2019s commissioner found huge variations among local authorities in different categories of deprivation and vulnerability throughout England. The DfE said local authorities were receiving additional funding of \u00a33.2bn to cope with pressures caused by the coronavirus lockdown, including in children\u2019s social care, and that it had set up teams around the country to improve its information on the risks facing vulnerable children. \u201cSchools and early years settings remain open for vulnerable children, who are encouraged to attend where it is appropriate for them to do so. We thank social workers and everyone involved in keeping these children safe at this time for their hard work, including continuing to conduct risk assessments and home visits where needed,\u201d the DfE said. But Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, said the government could not ignore Longfield\u2019s warnings of the heightened risks. \u201cYesterday, the government significantly relaxed statutory duties on local authorities to protect vulnerable children. In light of this report, it is even more urgent that the government guarantees these changes will not adversely impact children in need and commits to reversing them if there is any evidence they are doing so. \u201cMinisters must also alleviate the financial pressures on families which may be making the situation even worse, including ensuring urgent access to food where the free school meal voucher scheme is failing,\u201d Long-Bailey said.",

The figures are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale of the pandemic due to suspected under-reporting and differing testing regimes. Political adviser attends independent scientific advisory meetings Questions are being raised about political interference as it emerges that the UK prime minister\u2019s chief political aide has been participating in meetings of the government\u2019s group of independent scientific advisers; membership of which Downing Street had insisted on keeping secret until the list was leaked to the Guardian. After the news emerged, No 10 acknowledged that, while Dominic Cummings and another adviser have been attending and participating in the committee\u2019s meetings, they are not members of the committee. US authorities warn doctors against prescribing hydroxychloroquine The US Food and Drug Administration warned doctors against prescribing the malaria drug Donald Trump has been touting, citing reports of sometimes fatal heart side effects among patients. The warning excluded hospital and research studies. Chinese delegation goes to North Korean leader\u2019s aid \u2013 report China has dispatched a team to North Korea that includes medical experts to advise on the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, according to a Reuters report. The news agency cites three people familiar with the situation. The trip by the Chinese doctors and officials comes amid conflicting reports about the health of the North Korean leader. There was no indication of what, if anything, it signalled in terms of Kim\u2019s health. Air France to get state backing The airline will receive a \u20ac7bn (\u00a36.1bn) loan package backed by the French government to avert a cash crisis brought on by the pandemic, the country\u2019s finance minister Bruno Le Maire announces. France will issue \u20ac3bn in direct loans and guarantees on another \u20ac4bn in bank lending to the carrier, part of airline group Air France-KLM, Le Maire said. US navy captain should be reinstated, say officials Senior officials recommend the reinstatement of the commander of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, who was fired after he pleaded for help with a coronavirus outbreak onboard. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, officials told the Reuters news agency the recommendation to reinstate Captain Brett Crozier was made during a meeting on Friday between the US defence secretary, Mark Esper, and navy leaders. UK records 684 more hospital deaths The Department for Health and Social Care reports 684 more deaths in UK hospitals, bringing the death toll to 19,506. Friday\u2019s update also showed an increase of 5,386 confirmed cases, bringing the UK total to at least 143,464. Recoveries outstrip infections in Spain Authorities in Spain, which has seen the second largest number of confirmed cases in the world, pointed out that more people are being diagnosed as cured than are falling sick for the first time since the beginning of the outbreak. On Friday, there were 2,796 new infections confirmed while 3,105 overcame the infection. \u201cWith all the effort that we have done, the evolution of the epidemic is obviously beginning to be where it should be,\u201d said Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the ministry\u2019s health emergency centre coordinator. Italy to ease lockdown, local media report Newspapers in Italy are reporting that the country\u2019s lockdown, the longest and toughest in Europe, is to be eased over the next four weeks.
