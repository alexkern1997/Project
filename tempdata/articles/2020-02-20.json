\n   <li><strong>Mike Bloomberg </strong>and <strong>Trump </strong>traded insults over Twitter as the former New York mayor prepares for his first debate performance tonight.</li> \n   <li>Bloomberg also attracted criticism from some of his Democratic rivals, including <strong>Bernie Sanders </strong>and <strong>Joe Biden. </strong>Sanders attacked Bloomberg for previously suggesting changes to Social Security and Medicare, while Biden criticized Bloomberg for incorporating <strong>Barack Obama </strong>into his ads even though he did not endorse Obama in 2008.</li> \n   <li>Bloomberg\u2019s campaign criticized Sanders\u2019 press secretary for falsely claiming that Bloomberg had previously suffered heart attacks, as Sanders faces renewed scrutiny over his health following his own heart attack in the fall.</li> \n   <li>The White House denied a claim from <strong>Julian Assange\u2019s </strong>lawyer that the WikiLeaks founder was offered a pardon if he denied Russian involvement in the 2016 leaking of Democratic emails.</li> \n   <li><strong>John Rood, </strong>a senior official at the Pentagon who raised concerns about the freeze on Ukraine\u2019s military assistance, resigned, saying his departure was \u201crequested\u201d by the president.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Kari will have more coming up, and the Guardian\u2019s west coast team will later be blogging from the Las Vegas

Please turn to our separate live blog of tonight\u2019s Democratic debate, headed by politics reporter Maanvi Singh who is on the ground in Las Vegas. Before you go, here are the top stories of the night: The hashtag #AskBloomberg was trending on Twitter throughout the day ahead of tonight\u2019s debate, calling into question the former New York City mayor\u2019s past alleged personal digressions and policy choices. Former Elle magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll announced on Twitter Wednesday that she was fired from her previous job following intense backlash for revealing she was sexually assaulted by Donald Trump in the mid 1990s. A super PAC has been formed to support Elizabeth Warren. The Trump administration sided with software firm Oracle in an explosive copyright case against Google, shortly after its co-founder held a fundraiser for Donald Trump. Nevada Democrats will not say whether the caucus results will be released the day of the elections this week. Pop group TLC is performing at a Tom Steyer rally on Friday. Bernie Sanders denies he ever wanted to run against Barack Obama in 2012, despite a previous Atlantic story saying so. That\u2019s all, everyone! Again, follow Maanvi Singh for updates on tonight\u2019s debate. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign team is now staunchly denying a previous story that said the Senator attempted to challenge Barack Obama for the 2012 Democratic presidential nomination. An earlier report from the Atlantic\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere said Sanders was so seriously considering a run in 2012 that he had to be talked out of it by Senator Harry Reid. Reid is now saying he will not comment on the issue but that \u201cBernie was running for re-election in 2012. He would\u2019ve been a fool to run against Obama and Bernie\u2019s no fool\u201d. Ari Rabin Havt, campaign manager for Sanders, said the conversation never happened, and that it never \u201ccrossed his mind to challenge Obama\u201d. Today in unexpected celebrity presidential candidate endorsements: TLC is performing at a Tom Steyer rally this week in Nevada. Yes, that TLC, and yes, that Tom Steyer. The bestselling group known for 1990s hit singles including \u201cCreep\u201d, \u201cWaterfalls\u201d, and \u201cNo Scrubs\u201d will perform on Friday ahead of the Nevada caucuses. Despite the 2003 death of one of the three members, Lisa \u2018Left Eye\u2019 Lopes, the group still performs today, having come out with its most recent album in 2017. Want to know who wins Saturday\u2019s Nevada caucuses? Don\u2019t hold your breath. Democrats in the state have refused to commit to releasing results on the same day as the election following the disaster in Iowa\u2019s caucuses earlier this month. Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee told the Associated Press that in this vote they will take care to emphasize accuracy over speed, so to avoid the struggles faced in Iowa, wherein an app malfunction delayed the results by days. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best to release results as soon as possible, but our North Star, again, is accuracy,\u201d he said late Tuesday after touring an early voting site in Las Vegas. He said that high turnout, early voting, and other factors could make it more difficult to quickly tally all votes. Like Iowa, Nevada is for the first time reporting three stages of caucus votes rather than only the final vote. The Democratic party in Nevada had previously planned to use the same app used in Iowa to report votes, but abandoned the technology due to its failure in the first state to hold elections this year. It remains to be seen how Nevada\u2019s backup technology will work, and from the sounds of it, it may be slow going. The Trump administration is siding with software company Oracle in an ongoing copyright battle which major implications for tech giants. What has been referred to as \u201cthe copyright case of the decade\u201d will determine whether it is possible to copyright the computer code known as an application programming interface, or API, which allows software products to communicate with one another. In a Wednesday filing by the Department of Justice, the Trump administration said the Supreme court should rule in favor of Oracle, which claims that Google violated copyright law by copying 11,500 of the company\u2019s code more than a decade ago. The administration\u2019s support could have major consequences in the case. From the Hill: Google, backed by a broad swath of the tech industry, has argued that software developers and innovators rely on open APIs in order to create products that work together and build on one another. But Oracle, in a case that has bounced through lower courts for more than a decade, has alleged that Google exploitatively stole its code while building Android, which is today the world\u2019s most popular operating system. The Trump administration, including U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Joseph Hunt, the assistant attorney general of the DOJ\u2019s Civil Division, argued that \u201ccomputer programs are copyrightable\u201d and Oracle \u201cholds a valid copyright\u201d over the code in question. The Trump administration filed the brief in favor of Oracle just hours after the company\u2019s executive chairman Larry Ellison hosted a fundraiser for Donald Trump at his golf course in California. Oracle employees are planning a walk out in response to their executive\u2019s actions. A super PAC has formed to support presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, a noted critic of super PACs. Warren has frequently criticized the influence of big spending in politics, much of which is facilitated by PACS that are allowed to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to support a candidate. This PAC, called Persist PAC, filed papers on Tuesday and has already launched a pro-Warren ad in Nevada ahead of the debates there on Wednesday. Warren\u2019s campaign told the Washington Post her position on PACs has still not changed. \u201cSince day one of this campaign, she has made clear that she thinks all of the candidates should lock arms together and say we don\u2019t want super pacs and billionaires to be deciding our Democratic nominee,\u201d the campaign said. Former ELLE magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll, who in 2019 accused Donald Trump of raping her in the mid 1990s, said on Wednesday she was fired from her editorial position over backlash to coming forward. \u201cBecause Trump ridiculed my reputation, laughed at my looks, &amp; dragged me through the mud, after 26 years, ELLE fired me,\u201d Carroll wrote on Twitter. \u201cI don\u2019t blame Elle. It was the great honor of my life writing \u2018Ask E. Jean.\u2019\u201d The 76 year old revealed she had been sexually assaulted by the president in an excerpt from her 2019 book \u201cWhat Do We Need Men For?\u201d published by New York magazine. From NBC News: Trump has not only repeatedly denied the allegation, but has also denied ever meeting Carroll. When presented with a picture in which they were both photographed at a 1987 party alongside Carroll\u2019s former husband, John Johnson, Trump maintained that he had \u201cno idea\u201d who Carroll is. Carroll sued Trump for defamation in New York State Court in November, after which her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, had the black wool dress Carroll was wearing at the time of the alleged attack tested for DNA. Last month, Carroll\u2019s counsel served notice to Trump\u2019s lawyers for the president to submit a DNA sample by March 2 to see if he matched the unidentified male DNA found on the outfit. Yet, earlier this month, Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that Carroll\u2019s defamation suit should be delayed until New York\u2019s highest court rules on whether former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant Summer Zervos, who has also accused Trump of assault and defamation, can proceed with a somewhat similar suit. Trump has denied Zervos\u2019 allegations. Ahead of his first debate in the race to the 2020 presidential elections, Michael Bloomberg is under fire over past statements, behavior, and policies as New York City mayor. The hashtag #AskBloomberg trended on Twitter on Wednesday, encouraging moderators to inquire into the candidate\u2019s past transphobic and sexist remarks, allegations of sexual misconduct, his support of the Iraq war, and policies affecting minority populations implemented while he was mayor of New York City. Hashtags were not Bloomberg\u2019s only problem on Twitter on Wednesday: he also exchanged insults with Donald Trump and rival candidate Joe Biden. The trend on Twitter represented a grassroots response to Bloomberg\u2019s extensive media campaign as he pursues the presidential office, on which he has already spent millions of dollars in advertising. Hello readers, Kari Paul in San Francisco here, taking over the blog from the West Coast. Stay tuned for more updates soon. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Kari Paul, will take over the blog for a few hours before we begin our special debate coverage from Las Vegas. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Mike Bloomberg and Trump traded insults over Twitter as the former New York mayor prepares for his first debate performance tonight. Bloomberg also attracted criticism from some of his Democratic rivals, including Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. Sanders attacked Bloomberg for previously suggesting changes to Social Security and Medicare, while Biden criticized Bloomberg for incorporating Barack Obama into his ads even though he did not endorse Obama in 2008. Bloomberg\u2019s campaign criticized Sanders\u2019 press secretary for falsely claiming that Bloomberg had previously suffered heart attacks, as Sanders faces renewed scrutiny over his health following his own heart attack in the fall. The White House denied a claim from Julian Assange\u2019s lawyer that the WikiLeaks founder was offered a pardon if he denied Russian involvement in the 2016 leaking of Democratic emails. John Rood, a senior official at the Pentagon who raised concerns about the freeze on Ukraine\u2019s military assistance, resigned, saying his departure was \u201crequested\u201d by the president. Kari will have more coming up, and the Guardian\u2019s west coast team will later be blogging from the Las Vegas debate, so stay tuned. The next debate is just a few hours away, but CBS News has announced the moderators for the tenth Democratic debate, which the outlet will host next Tuesday. \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d anchor Norah O\u2019Donnell and \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d co-host Gayle King will moderate the debate, alongside \u201cFace the Nation\u201d moderator Margaret Brennan and chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett. The debate will take place next Tuesday in Charleston, South Carolina, and it will be the final debate before the South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday. The six candidates participating tonight have already qualified, and billionaire activist Tom Steyer hopes he can meet the delegate or polling requirements by the deadline. Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign said the candidate would not be standing on anything to boost his height during tonight\u2019s debate, despite Trump\u2019s claims to the contrary. The president has repeatedly referred to Bloomberg as \u201cMini Mike\u201d in tweets to mock the former New York mayor for his height. (But as the AP has pointed out, Bloomberg is not quite as short as Trump has claimed.) Bloomberg fired back at Trump last week, saying during a campaign event in North Carolina, \u201cHe calls me Little Mike and the answer is, \u2018Donald, where I come from we measure your height from your neck up.\u2019\u201d The White House said that Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke over the phone yesterday. \u201cThe two leaders discussed the importance of NATO, French and United States counterterrorism efforts in the Sahel, and other bilateral issues,\u201d the readout says. France said earlier this month that it would increase its troop presence in Africa\u2019s Sahel region, and during the Munich Security Conference this weekend, some congressional Republicans tried to convince defense secretary Mark Esper not to withdraw US forces from the region. Bernie Sanders may also be asked about this during tonight\u2019s debate: the Atlantic is reporting that the Vermont senator considered challenging Barack Obama for the 2012 Democratic nomination. The Atlantic reports: Bernie Sanders got so close to running a primary challenge to President Barack Obama that Senator Harry Reid had to intervene to stop him. It took Reid two conversations over the summer of 2011 to get Sanders to scrap the idea, according to multiple people who remember the incident, which has not been previously reported. That summer, Sanders privately discussed a potential primary challenge to Obama with several people, including Patrick Leahy, his fellow Vermont senator. Leahy, alarmed, warned Jim Messina, Obama\u2019s presidential reelection-campaign manager. ... Messina called Reid, then the Senate majority leader, who had built a strong relationship with Sanders but was also fiercely defensive of Obama. What could you be thinking? Reid asked Sanders, according to multiple people who remember the conversations. You need to stop. Some of Sanders\u2019 critics will likely point to the potential Obama challenge to resurrect questions about the Vermont senator\u2019s loyalty to the Democratic party, although Sanders\u2019 allies have dismissed those concerns by pointing to the fact that the independent lawmaker has consistently caucused with Democrats. It seems like all of Mike Bloomberg\u2019s opponents are joining in on attacking him before his first debate appearance tonight. Bernie Sanders tweeted a video criticizing the former New York mayor for previously suggesting changes to benefits programs like Social Security and Medicare. Bloomberg will likely come under fire from each of his five opponents on the debate stage tonight, but Sanders may also be trying to deflect some of the criticism away from himself. As the clear frontrunner in the race, Sanders is also likely to attract criticism from fellow candidates. A new poll of South Carolina Democrats shows Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders statistically tied in the early voting state. According to the UMass-Lowell/YouGov poll, Biden is attracting the support of 23% of South Carolina Democrats, putting him 2 points ahead of Bernie Sanders, which is well within the poll\u2019s 7.5-point margin of error. After disappointing performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, Biden is counting on strong showings in Nevada and especially South Carolina to regain some of his lost support. If he cannot pull off a win in South Carolina, before he goes on to the Super Tuesday states where he will have to face Mike Bloomberg, it could doom his candidacy. Tom Steyer, who will not be on the Democratic debate stage tonight but remains in the race, will start running an ad next week spotlighting Mike Bloomberg\u2019s controversial stop and frisk policy. The policy, which Bloomberg supported while he was mayor of New York, has been accused of unfairly targeting young men of color. In the ad, a narrator describes the policy, along with Bloomberg\u2019s comments about redlining, as \u201cracist.\u201d Steyer, who like Bloomberg is using his personal fortune to bankroll his candidacy, said the ad would run as part of a seven-figure buy across Super Tuesday states starting Monday. There\u2019s some reason to doubt the White House\u2019s claim that Trump \u201cbarely knows Dana Rohrabacher,\u201d the former Republican congressman who allegedly offered a pardon to WikiLeaks Julian Assange. Assange\u2019s lawyer said Rohrabacher offered him a pardon \u201con instructions from the president\u201d if Assange denied Russian involvement with the 2016 leaking of Democratic emails. Trump\u2019s press secretary called that claim a \u201ccomplete fabrication and a total lie.\u201d \u201cThe President barely knows Dana Rohrabacher other than he\u2019s an ex-congressman,\u201d said Stephanie Grisham. But Trump and Rohrabacher had a 45-minute meeting in 2017, and the president congratulated the infamously pro-Russia congressman on his primary victory the next year. Joe Biden and Mike Bloomberg continue to attack each other over Twitter, likely previewing a contentious debate later tonight. Biden reacted to a video from Bloomberg featuring a glowing speech the former vice president gave about him in 2013 by calling out Bloomberg\u2019s past party affiliation as a Republican. Biden made similar comments moments ago while campaigning in Nevada, criticizing Bloomberg for including Barack Obama in his campaign ads when he refused to endorse Obama in 2008. The White House has denied a report that Trump offered a pardon to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange if he said Russia was not involved in the leaking of Democratic emails. According to Assange\u2019s lawyer, the former Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher extended the offer during a 2017 visit with Assange. Assange\u2019s lawyer said in a statement that Rohrabacher made clear he was offering a pardon to Assange, who is now fighting efforts to extradite him to the US, \u201con instructions from the president\u201d. But the White House called this story \u201ca complete fabrication and a total lie\u201d in a statement. \u201cThe President barely knows Dana Rohrabacher other than he\u2019s an ex-congressman,\u201d said the press secretary, Stephanie Grisham. \u201cHe\u2019s never spoken to him on this subject or almost any subject. It is is a complete fabrication and a total lie.\u201d An alum of Cambridge Analytica, the firm accused of improperly handling Facebook data, is reportedly now helping lead the Trump campaign\u2019s data program. Politico reports: Matt Oczkowski, who served as head of product at Cambridge before it went bankrupt and shut down in 2018, is helping oversee the Trump campaign\u2019s data program, according to two people familiar with the hire. Cambridge gained notoriety for its work on psychological voter profiling and because it allegedly improperly obtained the personal information of tens of millions of Facebook users. The hiring of Oczkowski will likely intensify Democrats\u2019 fears about the online tactics Trump\u2019s campaign will deploy this year, although the president\u2019s advisers have claimed they did not use Cambridge data during the 2016 race. Democratic presidential candidates are previewing their strategies for tonight\u2019s debate on social media. After Joe Biden released a video earlier today criticizing Mike Bloomberg for opposing some of the Obama administration\u2019s policies, Bloomberg is now out with an ad attacking Biden. The video includes footage from a 2013 speech Biden gave praising Bloomberg\u2019s initiatives on gun control and climate change as mayor of New York. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone in my career \u2013 and I\u2019ve been hanging around a long time \u2013 who does more to create the future than you, Mike,\u201d Biden says in the ad. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump and Mike Bloomberg traded insults over Twitter, as the former New York mayor prepares for his first debate performance tonight. Advisers for Bloomberg and Bernie Sanders also sparred after Sanders\u2019 press secretary falsely claimed that Bloomberg had previously suffered a heart attack. Sanders has surged to the top of national polls, taking a double-digit lead over Bloomberg, who is also gaining steam. Trump continues to tweet about the justice department, despite reports that the attorney general, William Barr, is considering quitting over the president\u2019s Twitter activity. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump defended Rod Blagojevich in a tweet, saying the former Illinois governor did not sell a US Senate seat. But Blagojevich, who was commuted by Trump yesterday, was rather infamously recorded trying to sell the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama when he became president. \u201cI\u2019ve got this thing and it\u2019s fucking golden,\u201d Blagojevich was recorded saying. \u201cI\u2019m just not giving it up for fuckin\u2019 nothing. I\u2019m not gonna do it.\u201d Former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich profusely thanked Trump for commuting his prison sentence in a press conference today. \u201cWe want to express our most profound and everlasting gratitude to President Trump,\u201d said Blagojevich, appearing alongside his family. \u201cHow do you properly thank someone who\u2019s given you back the freedom that was stolen from you?\u201d The former Democratic governor praised Trump\u2019s \u201ckind heart\u201d and said he would vote for the president if he can, calling himself a \u201cTrumpocrat\u201d. But others are less thrilled about Blagojevich\u2019s commutation, considering he was caught on tape trying to sell a Senate seat. A group of House Republicans from Illinois released a statement yesterday calling Blagojevich \u201cthe face of public corruption\u201d in the state and saying they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Trump\u2019s decision. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo condemned China for expelling three Wall Street Journal reporters over a critical op-ed published by the newspaper. The Journal has more on the reporters\u2019 expulsion: China revoked the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters based in Beijing, the first time in the post-Mao era that the Chinese government has expelled multiple journalists from one international news organization at the same time. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the move Wednesday was punishment for a recent opinion piece published by the Journal. Deputy Bureau Chief Josh Chin and reporter Chao Deng, both U.S. nationals, as well as reporter Philip Wen, an Australian national, have been ordered to leave the country within five days, said Jonathan Cheng, the Journal\u2019s China bureau chief. In a new video, Joe Biden\u2019s campaign appeared to preview how the former vice president would confront Mike Bloomberg on the debate stage tonight. The video highlights Bloomberg\u2019s past clashes with the Obama administration, including the former New York mayor\u2019s criticism of the Affordable Care Act and Wall Street reform. The video concludes: \u201cMoney can\u2019t rewrite history.\u201d Bloomberg has incorporated Barack Obama into his campaign ads, irking some of the former president\u2019s allies who note Bloomberg did not endorse Obama in 2008. From a former national security council spokesperson under the Obama administration: White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley justified Trump\u2019s recent spate of commutations and pardons by saying the president is \u201cagainst aggressive sentencing.\u201d Gidley\u2019s comment was met with a hefty dose of skepticism, considering Trump\u2019s vocal support for the death penalty and his refusal to acknowledge the innocence of the wrongly convicted Central Park Five. Trump granted clemency yesterday to 11 people, including former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who was caught on tape trying to sell a US Senate seat. In his resignation letter, senior Pentagon official John Rood noted that Trump had \u201crequested\u201d his departure. Rood was involved in approving Ukraine\u2019s receipt of US military assistance, and he reportedly raised concerns about the freeze on the funds, the issue at the heart of Trump\u2019s impeachment. As Mike Bloomberg fields complaints from his opponents about how he is using his personal wealth in the presidential primary, his campaign is reportedly launching an unusual effort to boost the billionaire candidate\u2019s mentions on social media. The Bloomberg campaign intends to pay hundreds of staffers $2,500 a month to post positive messages about the former New York mayor on their personal accounts. The Wall Street Journal reports: The effort, which could cost millions of dollars, is launching ahead of California\u2019s March 3 primary and could later be deployed nationwide, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. It is one of the most unorthodox yet by the heavy-spending billionaire and blurs the lines between traditional campaign organizing and the distribution of sponsored content. Most campaigns encourage their supporters to post on social media about their candidates, but paying them at this scale to express support on their personal accounts is unusual, experts say. ... To staff the effort, the campaign is hiring more than 500 \u2018deputy digital organizers\u2019 to work 20 to 30 hours a week and receive $2,500 a month, the documents show. In exchange, those workers are expected to promote Mr. Bloomberg to everyone in their phones\u2019 contacts by text each week and make social-media posts supporting him daily, the documents show. The effort will almost certainly intensify accusations from Bloomberg\u2019s opponents that he is attempting to use his $50bn fortune to \u201cbuy this election\u201d. Trump has confirmed that John Rood, a senior official at the Pentagon, is leaving the administration. Rood reportedly raised concerns about the freeze on Ukraine\u2019s military assistance, which was at the center of Trump\u2019s impeachment. CNN explains: Rood is the Pentagon\u2019s top policy official and oversees aspects of the Pentagon\u2019s relationship with US allies and partners. Rood was involved in certifying to Congress that Ukraine had embarked on significant reforms to justify its receipt of $250 million in security assistance. That certification undermined one of the justifications -- concerns about corruption in Kiev -- that some members of the Trump administration made to defend blocking aid to Ukraine. Hours after Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which kicked off impeachment proceedings, Rood emailed Secretary of Defense Mark Esper -- who had been in the job two days -- informing him about an upcoming deputies meeting, \u2018to discuss the President\u2019s concern about endemic corruption in Ukraine and his reported view that US should cease providing security assistance,\u2019 according to emails reviewed by CNN. Rood notes in his email to the secretary that \u2018placing a hold on security assistance at this time would jeopardize this unique window of opportunity and undermine our defense priorities with a key partner in the strategic competition with Russia.\u2019 While some of his advisers spar with Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign, Mike Bloomberg is aiming his fire at Trump after the president accused him (without evidence) of violating campaign finance laws. Trump has repeatedly accused Bloomberg of violating campaign finance laws by receiving endorsements from lawmakers who have benefitted from Bloomberg\u2019s political contributions, even though such activity is not illegal. In recent days, Trump has used his bully pulpit against Bloomberg more than any other Democratic presidential candidate, even as the former New York mayor trails Bernie Sanders in the polls. But the president and Bloomberg have traded public insults frequently since the latter endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and mocked Trump\u2019s business practices at the Democratic National Convention. \u201cTrump says he wants to run the nation like he\u2019s running his business? God help us,\u201d Bloomberg said at the time. Briahna Joy Gray, Bernie Sanders\u2019 press secretary, said she misspoke when she falsely claimed Mike Bloomberg had previously suffered a heart attack. Gray emphasized Bloomberg and Sanders have both had coronary stents put in, but only Sanders underwent that procedure after suffering a heart attack. Gray also criticized Bloomberg for a tweet from his campaign manager attacking Sanders\u2019 supporters as \u201cBernie bros\u201d: The two campaigns are escalating their attacks on each other before tonight\u2019s debate, when Sanders and Bloomberg will face off for the first time as polls show them leading nationally. After his withdrawal from the Democratic presidential primary, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang is joining CNN as a political commentator. Yang based his long-shot campaign around his proposal for universal basic income, and he attracted enough support and donors to outlast much more \u201cestablished\u201d candidates. But Yang suspended his campaign last week after receiving only 3% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary. After dropping out, Yang told BuzzFeed News: \u201cThere\u2019s part of me that feels disappointed, like I didn\u2019t fulfill some people\u2019s goals for this campaign.\u201d He then memorably added: \u201cThere\u2019s also a competitive part of me, too \u2013 like I can\u2019t believe I lost to these people.\u201d Trump is once again lashing out against Mike Bloomberg, mocking the Democratic candidate for his height and accusing him (without evidence) of violating campaign finance laws. Trump has previously criticized Bloomberg for receiving endorsements from members of Congress who have benefitted from the billionaire\u2019s political donations, but that activity is not illegal. On the other hand, Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen is currently serving time in prison after pleading guilty to violating campaign finance laws (among other charges). Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign responded to a false claim from Bernie Sanders\u2019 press secretary that Bloomberg had previously suffered heart attacks by releasing a statement on his health. In it, campaign manager Kevin Sheekey noted Bloomberg had coronary stents put in 20 years ago after a positive stress test, but he emphasized the candidate has never suffered a heart attack, as Sanders did this fall. Trump continues to ignore attorney general William Barr\u2019s advice to stop tweeting about the justice department. Barr said in an interview last week that Trump\u2019s tweets make his job \u201cimpossible\u201d, and he has reportedly threatened to quit over the president\u2019s Twitter activity (although a justice department spokesperson denied those reports). However, if Trump continues to tweet about justice department affairs, Barr may have to follow through on his reported threat. Ahead of tonight\u2019s Democratic debate, advisers for Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg are attacking each other, as polls show the two candidates leading nationally. During a CNN interview this morning, Sanders\u2019 press secretary was asked about whether the frontrunner should release more medical records, considering his heart attack this fall. In response, Briahna Joy Gray argued Sanders was being held to a double standard, considering Bloomberg had also \u201csuffered heart attacks in the past\u201d. But Bloomberg\u2019s campaign quickly clarified that the billionaire candidate has never had a heart attack, with one adviser calling Gray\u2019s claim \u201ca Trumpy lie\u201d. The confrontation comes as Sanders faces more questions about his health and concerns about him being the oldest president ever elected if he wins in November. During a CNN town hall last night, Sanders said he would not be releasing full medical records. \u201cWe have released quite as much documentation as any other candidate has,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI think we have released a detailed medical report and I\u2019m comfortable on what we have done.\u201d There\u2019s been a boost for Joe Biden ahead of the critical Super Tuesday set of primaries on 3 March. Sylvia Garcia, one of the first two Latina congresswomen from Texas, has endorsed him in public as early voting has begun in the state. \u201cThe vice-president is probably one of the most qualified people I\u2019ve seen run for president,\u201d the 69-year-old Garcia told Associated Press. \u201cHaving worked his way up from city hall to working side by side with President Obama is a story in itself. \u201cHe\u2019s not forgotten where he came from. He\u2019s proven himself. We know who he is. And like us, and I\u2019m talking about Latinos when I say \u2018us,\u2019 he has a strong sense of social justice and a deep respect for humankind as a Catholic.\u201d Early voting started in Texas on Tuesday, and closes on 28 February, giving Texans 10 days to express their preference before the voting on Super Tuesday itself. Garcia served as an impeachment manager during the Senate trial of Donald Trump. Tom Perez, chair of the Democratic National Committee, has been on CNN this morning attempting to reassure people that the fiasco of counting at the Iowa caucuses won\u2019t be repeated at the weekend. He said he had \u201ca lot of confidence in Nevada. We have gone to school over the lessons of Iowa. We are as low-tech as is humanly possible, while still preserving efficiency.\u201d He also hinted that there could be a higher than usual turn-out in Nevada, enabled partly by the change in the rules to allow early voting. Describing the math of the early voting phase as \u201cremarkable\u201d, Perez said \u201cIn the first three days there were 36,000 early voters. We had 84,000 total participants in 2016. And that 36,000 doesn\u2019t include yesterday, which I think may have been the biggest day of them all.\u201d Having visited several sites in the state, he said he put the expected increase down to people just \u201cwanting this president out\u201d. Another potential diplomatic row between the US and China has been opened up with the decision by Chinese authorities to revoke the press credentials of three journalists from the Wall Street Journal. The Chinese had objected to a column that was published naming China as the \u201creal sick man of Asia\u201d. The column had criticised China\u2019s efforts to combat the coronavirus epidemic. Despite none of them working on the piece in question, the three journalists - two American and one Australian - have been ordered to leave the country within five days. The Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of China has issued a statement via Twitter describing the move as \u201can extreme and obvious attempt by the Chinese authorities to intimidate foreign news organizations by taking retribution against their China-based correspondents\u201d adding that \u201cChina has not outright expelled a foreign correspondent since 1998, as far as the FCCC is aware.\u201d 2020 may not be a year that \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid!\u201d holds true for the top priorities of the US voter. A new joint poll by Politico and Harvard that has come out this morning which suggests that healthcare costs are going to trump the health of the economy as the number one concern. Regardless of party affiliation, some 80% of voters rated \u201ctaking steps to lower the cost of health care\u201d as \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d important, and there was a similar level of support for \u201creducing prescription-drug costs\u201d. The two issues polled higher than any structural changes to the healthcare system. It certainly seems unlikely to be the climate crisis election that some people have been calling for. The climate crisis ranked only 11th among voters concerns, with \u201cjust 52 % overall agreeing that it was crucial to drastically increase federal spending and regulation to combat the issue\u201d. In the last couple of hours the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has arrived in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. He had just been in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where he was addressing the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. The Department of State have published a video of his talk, where he spoke of his love of entrepreneurs, saying: \u201cI love risk-takers and those people willing to just go out and crush it every day.\u201d He introduced several businesswomen who were beneficiaries of the White House\u2019s Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative. State department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus re-iterated Pompeo\u2019s message. Pompeo also had to cope with a lapel-mic failure that left him delivering the first minute of his speech to an auditorium that couldn\u2019t actually hear him. The trip to Saudi Arabia is Pompeo\u2019s first visit since top Iranian general Qassem Suleimani was killed by US forces. Before leaving Ethiopa, Pompeo said of the visit to Saudi Arabia: \u201cWe\u2019ll spend a lot of time talking about the security issues with the threat from the Islamic Republic of Iran in particular. \u201cThe pressure campaign continues,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an economic pressure campaign, it\u2019s diplomatic pressures, isolation through diplomacy as well.\u201d Donald Trump doesn\u2019t get to take part in the set-piece election TV debates yet, but he certainly can\u2019t seem to keep away from them. Approaching Saturday\u2019s Nevada Democratic caucuses, the Trump campaign have chosen the day of the Democrats debate to publish a full-page ad attacking the leading candidates in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the city where it takes place. The advert, which pictures Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, declares that \u201cDemocrats will kill Nevada jobs\u201d and promises that \u201cBig government socialism will wreck the economy\u201d. It goes on to extol Trump\u2019s record in office. An image of it was tweeted out by Sarah Matthews, part of the Trump campaign\u2019s press team. CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto and Barbara Starr have been reporting that John Rood, currently undersecretary of defense for policy at the Pentagon, is expected to depart his role. According to their sources, Rood has \u201clost support among senior national security leadership and has been asked for his resignation\u201d. The Pentagon has declined to comment. Rood had been instrumental in implementing Trump\u2019s National Defense Strategy. A new poll this morning from ABC News and the Washington Post has firmly put Bernie Sanders into the lead ahead of tonight\u2019s debate in Las Vegas. The Vermont senator now commands 32% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, according to the poll. That\u2019s up eight points since the previous ABC News/Washington Post poll on 23 January. The poll also reflects the stalled momentum of Joe Biden\u2019s run for the White House. Long considered the party establishment favourite, over the same period his support has slumped to 17%, which is down 11 points. Mike Bloomberg is still behind Biden \u2013 on 14%, but that\u2019s a rise of six points in a few weeks. Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg also made slight gains, with 6% and 7% support respectively, while Elizabeth Warren remained unchanged on 11% support. The numbers will buoy the Sanders and Bloomberg teams going into the debate, but indicate again how much the other four contenders needs some kind of break-out moment tonight to reignite their campaigns If you\u2019d like something to listen to over breakfast this morning, then Wednesday\u2019s edition of Today In Focus might fit the bill. Our tech reporter Julia Carrie Wong spent a year analysing Trump\u2019s Facebook campaign. In this podcast she discusses how the sophisticated social media machine is targeting voters with nearly $20m spent on more than 218,000 different ads. Tonight\u2019s debate will be a test for Mike Bloomberg\u2019s strategy of bypassing Iowa and New Hampshire, and only getting his campaign into full stride ahead of his main aim \u2013 Super Tuesday on 3 March. Skipping the opening caucuses and primaries has never worked for a candidate in modern times. Democratic strategist Brian Brokaw has told Associated Press that for his first debate appearance: \u201cHe is going to have a giant target on his back from all sides. It\u2019ll either all come together brilliantly or could fall apart very quickly. The stakes are just incredibly high for him.\u201d There\u2019s a question mark over Bloomberg\u2019s readiness for the format. The last time he was on a debate stage was in 2009, and during his campaigns to be New York City mayor he never faced more than one challenger at a time. It is likely that the other five candidates will seize on their first opportunity to confront him in person. And there\u2019s been a lot emerging to confront him over during the last few days, as a series of past comments from Bloomberg about race have been highlighted. My colleague Adam Gabbatt has gathered together the most explosive quotes here. They are guaranteed to come up in Las Vegas tonight. Bloomberg\u2019s campaign. though, are promising to tackle the other contenders head on. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see us go toe-to-toe with Bernie Sanders on important issues\u201d said Bloomberg\u2019s senior adviser Tim O\u2019Brien, citing questions about Sanders\u2019 own personal wealth, and his record on criminal justice and gun control. Here\u2019s Sam Levin with more \u2026 Department of Justice spokesperson Kerri Kupec has attempted to quash the rumours that the attorney general, William Barr, has considered resigning over Trump\u2019s repeated tweeted interference in the Roger Stone case. She used her official account overnight to state: \u201cAddressing Beltway rumors: The Attorney General has no plans to resign.\u201d Stone is still expected to be sentenced tomorrow. Good morning. The main focus today for the Democratic challengers for the presidential election nomination is tonight\u2019s televised debate in Las Vegas. After a controversial change of qualifying rules let him in, former mayor of New York Mike Bloomberg will be making his debate debut. It\u2019s his chance to put his mouth where so far mostly his advertising money has been. He takes the stage mired in controversy about his record on race and a whole series of comments that have re-emerged to haunt his campaign. Joe Biden\u2019s flagging campaign could do with a blockbuster performance from the former vice-president in the debate tonight, which could help shape the outcome of Saturday\u2019s Nevada caucuses and the South Carolina primary the following week. It all starts at 6pm Pacific time, and will last for two hours. NBC and MSNBC will air it, and it will also be available to stream online. Donald Trump, meanwhile, is heading to Phoenix for his latest \u201cKeep America Great\u201d evening rally at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum. His day is likely to be dogged by continued controversy over his comments about Roger Stone\u2019s conviction and upcoming sentencing for witness tampering and lying to Congress, and the pardons he issued on Tuesday. The president\u2019s flurry of tweets about Stone yesterday, where he said \u201cEverything having to do with this fraudulent investigation is badly tainted\u201d may have pushed attorney general, William Barr, closer to the edge. Administration officials told the Washington Post and Associated Press that Barr has said to people people close to him that he is considering quitting his post. Having falsely claimed, in relation to the Stone case that \u201cI\u2019m actually, I guess, the chief law enforcement officer of the country\u201d the president also raised eyebrows yesterday by pardoning the swamp, rather than draining it. Among a handful of pardons issued on Tuesday was one to former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich. Blagojevich\u2019s 14-year prison sentence for political corruption was commuted. The 63-year-old Democrat had been found guilty of crimes that included seeking to sell an appointment to Barack Obama\u2019s old Senate seat. Expect the row about that to continue rumbling today.",

Ever since the government banned flights from China, it has been really slow,\u201d he said.</p> <p>January and February are already the low season in Bali, after the Christmas holiday bustle, but according to David Abraham, co-founder of Outpost, a co-working community with three locations on the island, \u201cthe main issue right now is the closed air travel routes from China\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt affects not only Chinese tourists but other Asian tourists as well,\u201d Abraham said, adding that demand from Australian and other non-Asian tourists had remained stable so far.</p> <p>Indonesia has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/indonesia-coronavirus-academic-harvard-marc-lipsitch\">heavily criticised</a> for potential under-reporting of coronavirus in its population of 262 million, especially after a Harvard public health study came out last week projecting that Indonesia should have found approximately five affected patients by now.</p> <p>Adang Bachtiar, a public health expert at the University of Indonesia, said Bali \u201cdoes not have the capacity\u201d to adequately treat patients if they become affected on the island.</p> <p>\u201cThe only laboratories that can even test for the virus right now are in Jakarta, so if someone were to get sick in Bali or Lombok, it\u2019s concerning,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still very weak at both detection and management of this virus, especially outside Jakarta.\u201d</p> <p>More than 230 Indonesian citizens were evacuated from China and <a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/02/16/clear-and-free-wuhan-evacuees-head-home-from-natuna-quarantine.html\">quarantined on Natuna Island</a> for two weeks, but have reportedly all have tested negative for the virus and were released on Sunday.</p> <p>But there have been concerns about the Chinese man who was on holiday in Bali last month, from 22 to 28 January, and later tested positive for coronavirus on his return to China. <a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/02/15/weve-found-a-record-bali-health-agency-locates-hotel-where-infected-chinese-tourist-stayed.html\">Bali tourist officials</a> say they have checked the hotel where he stayed and no one appears to have been affected.

Indonesia, the largest country in south-east Asia, claims to have no cases of coronavirus, but according to the Bali\u2019s tourism board, there have been around 40,000 cancellations of hotel bookings in recent weeks nonetheless. In the first half of February about 740,000 people visited the island \u2013 16.25% fewer than the same period last year \u2013 Bali\u2019s airport spokesman told state news agency Antara this week. Chinese tourists account for about one in six of the island\u2019s visitors, and since Indonesia banned all incoming flights from China on 5 February, their absence has hit hard. \u201cWe feel like there has been a significant downturn in terms of sales and customers,\u201d says Michelle Anindya, head of development at Seniman coffee studios in the popular tourist hub of Ubud, in central Bali. I Ketut Panjul, a driver based in Ubud, says the change has been very difficult: \u201cAs you know, tourism is the main part of our economy here. Ever since the government banned flights from China, it has been really slow,\u201d he said. January and February are already the low season in Bali, after the Christmas holiday bustle, but according to David Abraham, co-founder of Outpost, a co-working community with three locations on the island, \u201cthe main issue right now is the closed air travel routes from China\u201d. \u201cIt affects not only Chinese tourists but other Asian tourists as well,\u201d Abraham said, adding that demand from Australian and other non-Asian tourists had remained stable so far. Indonesia has been heavily criticised for potential under-reporting of coronavirus in its population of 262 million, especially after a Harvard public health study came out last week projecting that Indonesia should have found approximately five affected patients by now. Adang Bachtiar, a public health expert at the University of Indonesia, said Bali \u201cdoes not have the capacity\u201d to adequately treat patients if they become affected on the island. \u201cThe only laboratories that can even test for the virus right now are in Jakarta, so if someone were to get sick in Bali or Lombok, it\u2019s concerning,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still very weak at both detection and management of this virus, especially outside Jakarta.\u201d More than 230 Indonesian citizens were evacuated from China and quarantined on Natuna Island for two weeks, but have reportedly all have tested negative for the virus and were released on Sunday. But there have been concerns about the Chinese man who was on holiday in Bali last month, from 22 to 28 January, and later tested positive for coronavirus on his return to China. Bali tourist officials say they have checked the hotel where he stayed and no one appears to have been affected. The World Health Organization says the general incubation period for the disease is 14 days. Business-related travel is also down: several conferences and meetings on Nusa Dua, a resort area in southern Bali, have been cancelled this month, preventing the arrival of at least 5,200 visitors, the managing director of the Indonesia Tourism Development Corporation says. \u201cBut Bali\u2019s been through a lot,\u201d notes Abraham. \u201cThe volcano [Mount Agung, which spewed ash in a minor eruption in 2019 ], before that the bombings, and so on \u2026 this is an ongoing cycle,\u201d he said, of events that cause temporary dips in tourism. Tara Louise, a 31-year-old British nail technician on holiday in Bali, says she is \u201cnot worried right now, as I think you should live in the moment, plus it is spreading worldwide currently so it\u2019s unsafe anywhere\u201d. She says she is more worried about passing through Singapore, which may lead to extra screening back in the UK. Regarding the general atmosphere in Bali, she says \u201cthere are a few face masks around but it\u2019s not too obvious, unlike in Thailand\u201d, where she has also recently been on holiday. Bali tourism officials have dug in their heels in recent days, arguing that, besides the slump in Chinese visitors, the island is doing fine. \u201cIt\u2019s a hoax,\u201d said Bali Tourism Agency head Putu Astawa last week, of media allegations that Bali was a \u201cghost town\u201d. Bali\u2019s health ministry also issued an \u201cOfficial Statement Regarding \u2018HOAX\u2019 Circulating About the Coronavirus\u201d asserting that zero cases have been detected on the archipelago so far. In Ubud, Michelle Anindya, head of development at Seniman coffee studios, says people are not outwardly scared or taking any major extra health precautions. \u201cNo one is really wearing face masks or panicking,\u201d she says, \u201cthough there are a lot of rumours floating around\u201d. One group of tourists that is not fazed is other Indonesians. \u201cIndonesians are delaying plans to travel overseas because of coronavirus, so they\u2019re opting for domestic destinations [like Bali] instead,\u201d says James Hutauruk, Jakarta-based founder of the Giga Great tour company, which caters to Indonesian travellers. \u201cWe are seeing a spike in requests for domestic packages.\u201d Accordingly, Astawat, head of the Bali Tourism Board, has asked the Indonesian president if he can discount domestic flight tickets. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 February 2020. An earlier version said a Harvard study had projected that Indonesia should have found \u201cat least 10\u201d people affected by coronavirus. In fact the study calculated an expected five cases, in a range from one to 11.",

In half of the cases, perpetrators had previous histories of violence against women, with three found to have killed before. The census says 149 women were killed by 147 men in 2018, 10 more than the previous year and the highest number since the census began. Of the victims, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/20/over-half-of-uk-women-killed-by-men-die-hands-current-ex-partner\">91 (61%) were killed by a current or former partner</a>. There were also cases of women being killed by a son, stepson, son-in-law or former son-in-law. Only 6% were killed by a stranger. Karen Ingala Smith, from domestic violence charity Nia, said many died despite expressing their fear to police, other services, and friends and family, and that they had few options to find help due to under-resourcing of crisis services.

Michael Bloomberg has been fiercely attacked at his first Democratic debate appearance for being an architect of racist policing policies, indulging in sexist comments and silencing aggrieved female employees. Elizabeth Warren led the assault on a disastrous night for the former New York mayor and multi-billionaire. Bloomberg stumbled in his response to a series of questions about stop-and-frisk in New York, saying he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the racially charged tactic and had apologised. Warren also challenged Bloomberg to release women at his company from non-disclosure agreements they signed while settling lawsuits. Bloomberg defended his record on women: \u201cIn my company, lots and lots of women have big responsibilities.\u201d Warren countered: \u201cI hope you heard what his defence was: \u2018I\u2019ve been nice to some women.\u2019\u201d The debate at the Paris Theater in Las Vegas came one week after Sanders won the New Hampshire primary and ahead of a primary in Nevada in which Bloomberg is not competing. Here are five key takeaways as observed by our Guardian US team. * * * 10 die in Germany shootings \u2013 At least 10 people have been killed and several others seriously injured after shootings at two shisha bars in the German town of Hanau, 25km east of Frankfurt, according to local police. Nine people died in the attacks on the two bars at around 10pm on Wednesday, police said. A hunt was launched for the perpetrators and police said at around 5am local time that officers had stormed the home of the alleged suspect where they found him dead along with another body. Police said they had no confirmed information on the background of the two attacks and appealed for witnesses to come forward. Hanau\u2019s MP, Katja Leikert, called it a \u201chorrific scenario\u201d while the Hanau mayor, Claus Kaminsky, lamented the \u201cworst evening imaginable\u201d. It comes a few days after one person was shot dead and four more were injured outside a Berlin music venue that was hosting a Turkish comedy show. * * * Coronavirus cruise deaths \u2013 Two older Japanese passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship have died of the Covid-19 virus, according to reports. An evacuation flight of Britons from the ship is now expected to depart Japan on Friday. The death toll in China stands at more than 2,100. Experts worldwide have signed a statement of support for their Chinese colleagues who are being attacked on social media and threatened with violence as false rumours circulate about the origins of the virus. There are warnings that the haranguing could destroy cooperation between Chinese scientists and their western counterparts to find treatments and vaccines. You can follow all the latest developments on our live blog. * * * Men who kill women \u2013 More than half the women killed by men in the UK in 2018 died at the hands of a current or former partner, according to the fourth Femicide Census. In half of the cases, perpetrators had previous histories of violence against women, with three found to have killed before. The census says 149 women were killed by 147 men in 2018, 10 more than the previous year and the highest number since the census began. Of the victims, 91 (61%) were killed by a current or former partner. There were also cases of women being killed by a son, stepson, son-in-law or former son-in-law. Only 6% were killed by a stranger.

Julie Bindel writes today: \u201cAs a feminist campaigner, I am often asked why women are still targeted by male rage. Our successes have been significant \u2026 but why has this not led to fewer women dying?\u201d * * * \u2018High-risk\u2019 Huawei barred \u2013 Huawei has been excluded from participating in \u00a365m worth of pilot 5G projects for businesses and communities. They include a flood warning scheme in Yorkshire, a coastal search and rescue experiment in Dorset and an electric vehicle project involving Ford and Vodafone. \u201cNone of the winning projects, or future projects, will use equipment from high risk vendors,\u201d the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said. In January the government announced limits on the use of the Chinese supplier\u2019s equipment in the 5G networks being rolled out across the UK. * * * \u2018Prevent has got to go\u2019 \u2013 Rebecca Long-Bailey would commit Labour to scrapping the anti-extremism programme Prevent if elected party leader. The candidate said: \u201cThe Prevent programme has alienated the Muslim community, set back our freedoms and not made us safer. The evidence is clear: it\u2019s got to go.\u201d Long-Bailey said she would replace it with a government-funded system involving Muslim leaders. Labour members will be balloted in the party leadership contest from Friday. * * * Worthy of note \u2013 The new polymer \u00a320 note featuring the artist JMW Turner is to go into circulation as the Bank of England begins replacing the most popular banknote in the country. At least two billion notes have been printed and half of the country\u2019s cash machines should have switched over within the next fortnight. In Scotland, the Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale Bank will launch their polymer \u00a320 notes on 27 February, with the Royal Bank of Scotland following on 5 March.

And Rory McIlroy has delivered what may well prove to be a fatal blow to plans for a breakaway golf tour by stating he has no interest in taking part. Business The world-renowned Axminster Carpets has gone into administration. The Devon-based company has provided carpets for prestigious buildings such as the US Capitol in Washington but has collapsed with the possible loss of 80 jobs. The FTSE100 is set to dip 0.25% at the opening this morning. The pound is on $1.29 and \u20ac1.196. The papers The Guardian moves the flooding coverage along to new homes and the fact that since 2003, one in 10 has been built on \u201cland at high risk of floods\u201d. It potentially leaves tens of thousands of people in greater danger from extreme winter storms \u2013 one expert, Prof Robert Wilby, of the University of Loughborough, argues the government should review its housebuilding target: \u201cWe\u2019re compounding the existing risk by continuing to build on the floodplain.\u201d In the Mirror it\u2019s \u201cHeroes and a zero\u201d as the paper contrasts a flood rescuer\u2019s feat with Boris Johnson\u2019s failure to visit affected areas. Others stay with the Conservatives\u2019 border control plans. \u201cImmigration backlash over British carers\u201d says the i \u2013 at issue is Priti Patel\u2019s claim that we have an untapped workforce of 8.5 million \u2013 when most of those are actually carers, students, sick or retired. The Metro repeats Patel\u2019s claim that \u201c8m Brits can fill low-skill jobs gap\u201d though its subheading points out that most of them actually can\u2019t. The secretary of state also comes under fire in the Times: \u201cHome Office at war after staff accuse \u2018bully\u2019 Patel\u201d saying she is at war with her own permanent secretary. The Mail celebrates \u201cHouse prices surging all over Britain\u201d (a shame if you\u2019re trying to buy one) and claims it as evidence of a \u201cBoris bounce\u201d. \u201cOfsted fears schools will \u2018squander\u2019 extra cash\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s the Telegraph, covering the not-new-to-controversy chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, saying school budgeting procedures should be tightened up before they share in a \u00a314bn funding boost. The Express joins the \u201cBattle for new wonder drug to save lives\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s called Tritafka and holds promise in treating cystic fibrosis. The FT has what sounds like a good idea: \u201cEU aims to loosen big tech\u2019s grip by forcing groups to share data\u201d \u2013 the likes of Amazon and Google that enjoy near-monopolies would have to open up their databases to smaller competitors.

      "bodyText": "The Australian government has extended its ban on international arrivals who have travelled through China for a fourth week due to the novel coronavirus crisis, despite the increasing pressure on the economy and the start of the university year. The ban, which has been in force since 1 February and was initially scheduled for 14 days, will continue into a fourth week. Announcing the extension on Thursday, the government said in a statement that the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei province continued to grow, but was slowing elsewhere. \u201cWe will need to watch closely whether this positive trend continues as people return to work after the holidays,\u201d the statement said. The government\u2019s approach to preventing the spread of the disease in Australia continued to be successful, it said, with the number of cases remaining at 15. The Australian economy faces an estimated $8bn hit due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, which is expected to cost the global economy US$1.1tn. The ban has hit the higher education sector particularly hard, stranding an estimated 65,800 international visa-holding students in China, with universities reportedly preparing for a $1.2bn loss of income while scrambling to accommodate remote learning and to manage the effect on staff workloads, particularly casual staff. The National Tertiary Education Union has called on the federal government to create a support package for the sector. The union\u2019s president, Alison Barnes, said the consequences of the ban were becoming increasingly serious. \u201cMany of our casual members have not had paid work for months over the Christmas period and the prospect of losing hours as a result of the coronavirus is a material and pressing concern for them,\u201d Barnes said. Under the restrictions, foreign nationals who have travelled through mainland China are not allowed to enter Australia for 14 days from the time they left. Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family are exempt from the ban, but are required to self-isolate for 14 days \u2013 the incubation period of the virus \u2013 on their return to Australia if they have been in mainland China since 1 February. On Thursday, 75,660 cases of Covid-19 had been recorded worldwide, including 62,031 in Hubei province, where the virus emerged. More than 2,000 people have died. All those diagnosed in Australia contracted the disease in Wuhan, except for one person who had contact with a person with the virus in China. Ten Australian patients have recovered from the virus, the most recent being an eight-year-old boy, a Chinese national from Wuhan, who was confirmed to have the virus in early February. He has recovered and was discharged from hospital on Wednesday evening, Queensland Health announced on Thursday.

Hughes, who realised he could not return home when he saw on Sky News that Virgin and BA had suspended flights to mainland China, said: \u201cNobody knows what is going on. I\u2019m in total limbo because of a lack of any information.\u201d His employers told him to not book a flight back but to instead enjoy an extended holiday. However, they have yet to provide any further information. \u201cI am just one in 1,000. There are so many foreign teachers in China who are in the same position,\u201d he said. Karel Frederik Bruwer, a teacher living and working in Shenzhen in the south-east, said he went on holiday to visit family and friends in Mpumalanga, in his home country of South Africa, on 22 January and was still there. He has not received any information on when he can return. His offices are shut until 1 March and he is insure what will happen next. Like many other companies and schools, he has been asked to register for online classes. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a mess, as one would expect from something as terrifying as an unknown virus,\u201d said Bruwer, 34. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying my time at home in South Africa with family and friends but do feel worried about my colleagues and students trapped in limbo in China. \u201cAt least I am able to enjoy the summer weather here \u2013 but they are currently holed up inside their homes, living a very surreal life.\u201d Holidaymakers who booked trips to China from April have yet to receive a refund. Many have been told to wait to see if the travel advice changes. Laurent Damm\u00e9, a 30 year-old doctor who lives in Luxembourg, had booked a trip to take part in the Great Wall Marathon. However, the race was cancelled on Wednesday. Though he was reimbursed for the fees he paid to participate, he is yet to receive information on his British Airways flight. \u201cI was disappointed when I heard the marathon was cancelled. As I was there to participate in the marathon, I\u2019d want to be reimbursed for my flight as well, but right now British Airways don\u2019t have any updates about their flights for April and May. I talked to them yesterday but I didn\u2019t get any new information,\u201d he said. \u201cI will have to wait to see what happens.\u201d Adam Wilkins, 50, is in a similar predicament. The service engineer from Gloucestershire had booked a trip to visit China in April with his wife. Wilkins, who was due to travel on 4 April, said: \u201cWe\u2019re in limbo because we\u2019ve booked time off work and we\u2019d like to go but we can\u2019t book anywhere else until we know we\u2019re not going.\u201d He paid the deposit for the trip last year and had to settle the outstanding balance two weeks ago, despite the Foreign Office advising British nationals not to go. \u201cIt was a choice between paying the balance or losing our deposit,\u201d he said. Wilkins said while the issue could seem like \u201ca first-world problem\u201d \u2013 he was aware many people were in a worse situation \u2013 he had booked the holiday to give him and his wife something to look forward to after the death of her father last year.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Mattha Busby with today\u2019s essential stories. Bloomberg roundly attacked in fiercest debate yet The former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has come under fire from his fellow Democratic presidential candidates in his first debate \u2013 the most vicious yet \u2013 as his previous support for stop-and-frisk policing tactics and reports of sexism and discrimination at his companies came under the microscope. After the lively affair in Las Vegas, in which Elizabeth Warren likened Bloomberg to Donald Trump, attention will turn to the crucial Nevada caucuses on Saturday. The victor? The audience, who were treated to a raucous evening where no clear winner emerged, although Warren performed strongly, as our panelists discuss. And here are the key takeaways from the bust-up. Polling. Bernie Sanders is the frontrunner in the third vote during the battle for the Democratic nomination, a lead mirrored in national polling, which predicts Joe Biden will beat Bloomberg into third. Trump \u2018offered Assange pardon to deny Russia DNC hack link\u2019 A court in London heard that Donald Trump offered to pardon Julian Assange if denied the Russian link to leaked Democratic party emails. Assange\u2019s lawyers alleged at Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday that during a visit to London in August 2017, then congressman Dana Rohrabacher made the offer to the WikiLeaks founder on instructions from the president. Rohrabacher said the proposal was his own initiative and that the White House had not endorsed it. The White House spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said it was \u201ca complete fabrication and a total lie\u201d. Who to believe. The White House said Trump \u201cbarely knows\u201d Rohrabacher, but he was invited to meet the president in April 2017 after defending him on television. He also spoke with then chief of staff, John Kelly, about the deal several months later too. \u2018Xenophobic\u2019 gunman kills 10 in Hanau, Germany Ten people have been killed, including the suspect, after attacks on shisha bars in the German town of Hanau, leading Turkey to denounce racism as a \u201ccollective cancer\u201d since some of the victims were of Turkish origin. Investigators believe there was a racist motive for the attack, while the state interior minister, Peter Beuth, spoke of a \u201cxenophobic motive\u201d. Nine people died in the attacks on the two bars at about 10pm local time on Wednesday, before the suspect killed himself after also murdering his 72-year-old mother at his home. Five others had life-threatening injuries, police said. Tobias R. The 43-year-old killer was named by police without disclosing his surname, in line with German practice. The Bild newspaper said he expressed extreme rightwing views in an unconfirmed letter of confession. Trump to appoint loyalist to spy agency role; Bolton condemned In a departure from past practice in which the office of the director of national intelligence was considered non-partisan and generally occupied by career professionals, Donald Trump is planning to appoint a close ally, Richard Grenell, to be acting head, rather than nominating him for the permanent position \u2013 seemingly to sidestep the Senate confirmation process \u2013 according to multiple reports. Meanwhile, Susan Rice, the former national security adviser, suggested John Bolton \u201cshamefully violated the oath\u201d to defend the constitution by not testifying in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. Teaser. Bolton claimed the White House was attempting to block publication of his forthcoming book, in which one of the \u201csprinkles on the ice-cream sundae\u201d is said to be what Trump said to him about withholding aid to Ukraine until they agreed to investigate Joe Biden. Cheat sheet Two passengers on the quarantined Diamond Princess, an 87-year-old man and an 84-year-old woman, have become the first people connected to the cruise ship to have died from coronavirus. Sales of highly hazardous pesticides that contain known or presumed carcinogens are making the world\u2019s five biggest agribusiness companies billions of dollars a year, according to an analysis by campaigners. A large survey suggests young people across Africa believe the continent is set for a new era of transformative success, thanks to technological innovation and entrepreneurship amid growing \u201cAfro-optimism\u201d. A deadly mystery illness is believed to have killed 2,000 people in Ethiopia\u2019s Somali region since 2014, with locals fearing Chinese gas exploration nearby has tainted the water supply. Must-reads How Hindu supremacists are tearing India apart India\u2019s constitution promises equality to all, but the governing BJP party is remaking the country into one in which some people are seen as more Indian than others, as protests mount against a new citizenship law that excludes Muslims.

Author Eleanor Morgan dissects the concerning trend. One million children left behind as Venezuela crisis tears families apart Economic collapse in Venezuela has sparked modern South America\u2019s largest exodus, as parents have been forced to migrate en masse, often initially to nearby Guyana, leaving children abandoned or in the care of relatives and neighbours. \u2018It\u2019s personally insulting\u2019: chefs on the customer antics that most enrage them In the age of TripAdvisor, Trustpilot and ubiquitous feedback forms, critical diners have an array of powerful tools at their disposal. So when do chefs get to be heard above the noise of irksome customers who believe they are always right? Now, apparently. Tony Naylor investigates Opinion The Hunger Games stage of this Democratic primary season is upon us, writes Richard Wolffe, with Bernie Sanders facing off against a \u201cdelusional sideshow\u201d of centrists bent on mutual annihilation.

      "bodyText": "Air France-KLM, Qantas, and the global container shipping company Maersk have become the latest businesses to warn about the financial impact from the spread of coronavirus. The airlines have cancelled flights to and from China and are experiencing weaker demand for travel in Asia. If flights remain suspended until April, the Franco-Dutch group Air France-KLM expects the Covid-19 outbreak to wipe between \u20ac150-200m (\u00a3130-170m) off its earnings. Qantas, which predicts annual profits will be A$150m (\u00a377m) lower, plans to reduce flights to Asia by 15% until at least the end of May. While its planes remain grounded, Australia\u2019s flag carrier will put employees on leave and freeze recruitment. Alan Joyce, the chief executive of Qantas, said there was a similar drop in demand for flights during the Sars outbreak in 2003, which affected the airline for six to eight months. Qantas believes it can manage for at least six months without cutting jobs. \u201cWe are keeping the capability to have the rebound, keeping the aircraft, keeping the people, because we think it will happen eventually,\u201d Joyce said. Maritime transport is also counting the cost of the outbreak. The Danish firm Maersk, which handles one in five containers shipped by sea, forecasts a weak start to 2020. It has not predicted the cost of lower demand and difficulties delivering to some ports. \u201cIt is still early days to measure the overall impact,\u201d Maersk said. \u201cHowever, the weekly container vessel calls at key Chinese ports were significantly down compared [with] last year during the last weeks of January and the first weeks of February. Freight rates are expected to decrease due to dropping demand for containerised goods transport.\u201d The Chinese government has announced new stimulus measures to support the economy. Factories remain closed for longer than usual after the lunar new year holiday in January, and some large industrial centres are under quarantine conditions. The central bank cut its benchmark lending rate and added measures to keep the economy afloat, a move that bolstered Chinese stock markets. In a quarterly report, the central bank said it expected limited economic impact from the outbreak but had offered to extend credit and provide favourable terms to firms with a role in controlling the virus. According to reports from the mainland on Wednesday, there have been 2,004 deaths and 74,185 confirmed infections. New cases have fallen to fewer than 2,000 per day but officials have warned of a potential increase as people return to work. \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk",

      "bodyText": "Closing summary The FTSE 100 is the major holdout across global stock indices thus far on Thursday, up by 0.2%, with Wall Street indices weakening and European stocks retreating from record highs. A couple of notable deals have given Wall Street investors something on which they can focus, with Victoria\u2019s Secret being sold into private hands and Morgan Stanley pushing further into investment management with the $13bn purchase of E-Trade. But as so often this month the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak has set the tone, with Air France-KLM, Qantas, shipping company Maersk and iPhone manufacturer Foxconn all warning of financial damage. Investors seeking safe havens appear to have rushed to the US dollar, forcing down the Japanese yen and the pound. Thank you as ever for joining us for live coverage of the worlds of business, economics and the markets \u2013 and come back tomorrow for more of the same. JJ Another big Wall Street deal announced today: Morgan Stanley is buying online stockbroking platform E-Trade for about $13bn. The combination will have $3.1tn in client assets and 8.2m retail client relationships and accounts \u2013 with E-Trade shifting the balance towards less wealthy customers and a more direct, lower-cost approach. The Associated Press calls it \u201cone of the biggest deals on Wall Street since the financial crisis\u201d and \u201cthe latest chapter in Morgan Stanley\u2019s transformation from the scrappy, deal-doing, stock-trading investment bank to a more well-rounded financial firm now more reliant on its asset and wealth management businesses\u201d. The combined wealth and investment management businesses will account for about 57% of the firm\u2019s pre-tax profits, compared to only approximately 26% in 2010. Stocks have dipped at the open on Wall Street. The Nasdaq, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 have all fallen by 0.2%. US stock market futures suggest that Wall Street is going to drop at the opening bell, following the lead of European markets. The FTSE 100 is the only major index that is not in the red \u2013 and it has only edged up by less than 0.1% (possibly thanks to the dollar surge, which makes US earnings relatively more valuable for companies that report in sterling). The Euro Stoxx 600 index has lost 0.5%, while France\u2019s Cac 40 and Germany\u2019s Dax have both lost 0.3%. The owner of Victoria\u2019s Secret will sell a majority stake in the controversial underwear brand at a $1.1bn ($850m) valuation, in a deal that will also see its chief executive resign. Private equity firm Sycamore Partners will buy 55% of the company for $525m, with L Brands retaining 45% minority stake. L Brands will use the money to reduce its debt pile and focus on its larger Bath and Body Works business, which is much larger than the underwear brand. Leslie Wexner will step down as chief executive of L Brands after 57 years as boss. L Brands bought Victoria\u2019s Secret in 1982. He will remain on the board as \u201cchairman emeritus\u201d. Victoria\u2019s Secret has struggled with falling profits and a change in attitudes from buyers. In November it cancelled its annual \u201cfashion show\u201d with falling viewer numbers. In August, Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s chief marketing officer Ed Razek stepped down. In a much-criticised interview with Vogue in 2018, Razek said the brand would not cast transgender or plus-sized models \u201cbecause the show is a fantasy\u201d. The company was reportedly founded to allow men to feel comfortable buying lingerie for their wives, and it has been hit by a series of controversies about its treatment of models and attitudes towards women that have been criticised as outdated. Some background reading: Foxconn, the biggest maker of Apple\u2019s iPhone, has warned that its revenues will be hit by the coronavirus, but it did not say exactly how big the impact might be. Apple had already warned this week that it faced a supply shortage because of the virus, so the hit to a major supplier does not come as a surprise. Foxconn, which is formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, added that it is restarting some production at Chinese plants, after extended closure. Reutes also reported that Foxconn said its plants in countries such as Vietnam, India and Mexico continue to operate at full capacity with expansion plans under way as it seeks to minimise the impact of the virus. The European Central Bank\u2019s top officials thought that easing trade tensions had reduced risks to the eurozone economy, according to minutes from its latest monetary policy meeting \u2013 although the meeting took place before the extent of the coronavirus epidemic became clear. The meeting of the central bank\u2019s governing council ended on 23 January, shortly before Covid-19 was acknowledged as an emergency that could damage the global economy. Slowly building inflationary pressures and the improved trade outlook added a note of positivity to the minutes. They said: The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook, related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, remained tilted to the downside, but had become less pronounced as some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade had receded. It was felt to be important to acknowledge these positive signs and care should be taken to avoid being too slow to change the risk assessment. However, some bankers did say they should not be \u201ctoo optimistic\u201d, given the continued contraction in the manufacturing economy and particularly the struggles of carmakers. Who knew that the \u00a320 was the most popular bank note in the UK? Anyway, there\u2019s a new one out today. The Bank of England has begun the mammoth operation to replace it, with at least 2bn printed, reports the Guardian\u2019s Patrick Collinson. The Bank expects half of the country\u2019s cash machines to have switched over within the next fortnight. The note will feature Turner\u2019s portrait in front of The Fighting Temeraire, his tribute to the ship that played a distinguished role in Nelson\u2019s victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. (The painting also symbolises the changing of the guard \u2013 as Carney prepares to leave the Bank in less than a month). British manufacturers reported an increase in orders this month, according to the the Confederation of British Industry\u2019s (CBI) monthly gauge. The balance of manufacturers seeing increased orders rose to a reading of -18, from -22 in January, slightly above the consensus forecast of -19 from economists. Expectations for the next three months reached their highest since February 2019. However, the reading remained below the survey\u2019s long-run average of -13 \u2013 and the sector saw actual output volumes (as opposed to orders for the future) falling for a fifth rolling quarter in a row. Alpesh Paleja, the CBI\u2019s lead economist, said: It is encouraging to see manufacturers reporting some early signs of a turnaround in activity, but it\u2019s probably still too early to say whether we\u2019ve seen the end of the slowdown in the sector. Notwithstanding improving optimism, the sector is still grappling with longer-term uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU. The US dollar is on something of a tear at the moment: the trade-weighted basket of currencies measured against it has hit its strongest level since May 2017. The Japanese yen has fallen \u2013 even though it is usually considered something of a safe haven \u2013 amid fears of recession in the world\u2019s third-largest economy. It may have also been affected by its proximity to China, the centre of the coronavirus epidemic. \u201cDollar tramples yen and everything else in its path\u201d is the apt headline on a Reuters report. Rabobank senior currency strategist Jane Foley said: I think this has really brought into focus the role the dollar is playing as a safe haven. The yen has lost 2% to the dollar since Tuesday to its lowest since April 2019. However, UBS\u2019s wealth management arm said it thinks the dollar surge against the yen is \u201cunsustainable\u201d. Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said: Broadly, we attribute the yen move to a combination of risk-on trade in equity markets, rising headwinds for Japan\u2019s economy, and continued US dollar strength. The move may have been exacerbated by other factors, from rising Covid-19 infections in Japan to GPIF [Government Pension Investment Fund] outflows. Some more reaction on the British retail sales rebound. It appears that experts aren\u2019t quite convinced that the post-election bounce means the sector is out of the woods. Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg, an investment bank, said: One month does not make a trend. Retail sales are typically quite volatile. However, they do provide an early indicator of the much bigger category of household spending \u2013 which makes up about 70% of GDP. So far, the data just show a rebound from the fourth quarter and not yet evidence of a strong gains to come throughout 2020. However, the uptick in spending along with the sharp improvement in household survey data at the start of the year suits our call that real household consumption is on track to recover solidly in the first quarter (+0.6% quarter-on-quarter) after the disappointing 0.1% gain in the fourth quarter of 2019. Karen Johnson, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, said: Have UK consumers chosen \u2018buy more big ticket items\u2019 as their New Year\u2019s resolution? Though UK retailers will certainly hope so, this will have required a real growth in consumer confidence. Last year was characterised by nervousness in the market, which led to muted spending and frustration for many businesses. January\u2019s ONS figures offer a glimmer of hope that this pent up consumer demand could now slowly be being released, but the jury is still out on this at the moment. Joe Morris, retail partner at law firm Gowling WLG, said: While promising, there is a need to remember the backdrop of this improvement, which has seen failures and insolvencies in the areas with the highest sales \u2013 both in terms of physical store footfall and a failure to successfully unify on and offline efforts into one seamless experience. The need to meet these core customer needs will continue to challenge the sector, with global supply chain efficiencies also playing a key part. Survival of the fittest has never applied more, but as ever, retailers with strong brands and reactive and widely available lines will continue to do well. A just after mid-morning update on markets: the FTSE 100 has given up almost all of its gains to trade flat for the day. The Euro Stoxx 600 index is down by 0.14%, with Italy\u2019s Milan-based FTSE MIB index down by 0.45% amid political uncertainty. The pound has dropped by 0.3% against the US dollar to $1.2890, its lowest in 10 days, despite the rebound in UK retail sales. Here\u2019s the full report on Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s profits hit \u2013 and some bad news for its chief executive: he is no longer Britain\u2019s best paid banking boss, as we earlier reported. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio has seen his pay packet fall to a mere \u00a34.7m, a 28% cut. Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the chief executive, is now the second-highest paid UK bank boss, behind Barclays\u2019 chief executive, Jes Staley. Staley was paid \u00a35.9m for 2019 despite UK regulators launching an investigation over his links to the sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein in December. Horta Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s pay peaked at \u00a311.5m in 2014. Between 2011 and 2019 he has been paid \u00a356m by the bank. This year\u2019s pay packet includes a \u00a312,000 \u201ccar or car allowance\u201d and a \u00a337,606 \u201ctransportation\u201d. That\u2019s \u00a349,606 for various forms of transport alone \u2013 about 1.7 times the average UK salary, which is roughly \u00a328,300 based on the Office for National Statistics\u2019 weekly earnings figures. Full story here: The end of election uncertainty in December may be driving the improvements in the data, economists suggest. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: January\u2019s official retail sales figures confirm that the decisive general election has released the handbrake of political uncertainty on consumers\u2019 spending. The headline number has been depressed by a huge 5.7% month-to-month drop in fuel store sales \u2013 the biggest since March 2015 \u2013 driven by a rise in fuel prices and bad weather. The overall picture on retail sales is still pretty weak, cautioned Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon \u2013 although the outlook is moderately more positive as household finances improve this year. Textile, clothing and footwear stores recorded the strongest increase among the retail sectors, with volumes up by 3.9% compared to the previous month, the ONS found. Food sales rose by 1.7% month-on-month, counterbalancing a 5.7% fall in fuel sales as prices increased. British retail sales rose by 0.9% in January compared to the previous month, the best performance since March, according to the Office for National Statistics. The numbers were mainly boosted by \u201cmoderate growth\u201d in both food and other stores, despite rising fuel prices dampening volume, the ONS said. The figures offered some hope for the sector, which has endured a torrid few years. The British Retail Consortium\u2019s separate figures had previously found that 2019 was the worst year on record for the sector, with sales falling for the first time in 24 years. Gold prices have held near seven-year highs this morning \u2013 after breaking the mark late on Thursday night as the coronavirus outbreak compounded concerns about slowing global growth. The spot price of a troy ounce of the yellow metal rose above $1,612 late last night \u2013 the highest point since March 2013. This morning gold was trading at $1,609. A note from Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said: We continue to see value from an insurance and diversification angle, but would caution that absolute returns may be limited if coronavirus-related disruptions are largely limited to the first quarter. An interesting story from the Belfast Telegraph this morning on the maker of the \u201cBoris bus\u201d: Northern Ireland\u2019s Audit Office is to probe a \u00a32.5m loan made by Invest NI to Wrightbus just months before the company went into administration. Wrightbus was once hailed as one of Northern Ireland\u2019s most successful manufacturers, but it fell into administration last year after sales slumped. The company and its family owners also faced questions over multimillion-pound donations made by the company to a church run by Jeff Wright. The collapse was politically awkward for the government, given prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s personal association with the company after he ordered new Routemaster double deckers during his time as London\u2019s mayor. NI\u2019s public spending watchdog issued the statement after an MLA raised the issue with the economy committee at Stormont yesterday. From the BelTel\u2019s report: Sinn Fein\u2019s Caoimhe Archibald, chair of the committee, made the call after a number of concerns about the firm\u2019s financial affairs were raised by experts in a BBC Spotlight investigation Wrightbus, based in Ballymena, collapsed into administration in September 2019. About five months earlier, Cornerstone \u2013 the firm\u2019s parent company \u2013 spent \u00a31m buying back the shares held by Wright family member Dr Lorraine Rock, the programme broadcast on Tuesday revealed. [...] Wright has branded any claims money was wrongly donated untrue and \u201cextremely hurtful\u201d and \u201cdamaging\u201d. The top riser on the FTSE 100 this morning is Smith &amp; Nephew, the maker of medical products such as dressings and surgical devices, after it beat expectations. Smith &amp; Nephew forecasted another year of revenue growth after topping annual sales expectations for 2019, helped by higher demand from emerging markets and growth in its sports medicine unit. The company\u2019s revenues topped $5bn for the first time, and slightly outperformed consensus estimates \u2013 shares rose by 8%. NMC Health is the second top performer, up 4%, although given that it is still worth less than a third of its valuation in mid-December the term dead cat bounce springs to mind. The Middle Eastern private hospitals group has been in turmoil since it revealed that its ownership details had been incorrectly reported and short seller Muddy Waters targeted it. Maersk handles one in every five containers shipped by sea across the world, so it is on the front line of impacts from the outbreak. It has issued a warning on the impacts \u2013 but perhaps most strikingly there is no number put on the cost. The Danish company cited \u201cfear of the virus and the efforts to prevent its spread\u201d as denting demand, hampering deliveries at ports and preventing some upgrades to its ships. The outlook for 2020 is impacted by the current outbreak of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) in China, which has significantly lowered visibility on what to expect in 2020. As factories in China are closed for longer than usual in connection with the Chinese New Year and as a result of the Covid-19 we expect a weak start to the year. It is still early days to measure the overall impact[. H]owever, the weekly container vessel calls at key Chinese ports were significantly down compared [to] last year during the last weeks of January and the first weeks of February. Freight rates are expected to decrease due to dropping demand for containerised goods transport. However, Maersk said it still expected global container demand to grow by 1% to 3% this year, compared to 1.4% last year and 3.8% the year before. European markets have lost some ground in early trading \u2013 aside from in the UK, where the pound is slightly lower. London\u2019s blue-chip FTSE 100 is up by 0.2% to about 7,469 points, while the FTSE 250 has gained 0.4%. France\u2019s Cac 40 and Germany\u2019s Dax both lost about 0.1% in early trades, dragging down the Euro Stoxx 600 index down by the same amount. Britain\u2019s best-paid banking boss, Antonio Horta-Osorio, has taken a 28% cut in his \u00a36.5m pay package, as Lloyds Banking Group reported a sharp fall in profits last year, writes the Guardian\u2019s Kalyeena Makortoff. The group was hit by an additional \u00a32.5bn bill for payment protection insurance, sending pre-tax profit down by more than a quarter to \u00a34.4bn for 2019. That compared to \u00a36bn a year earlier, but was ahead of the \u00a33bn expected by analysts. Lloyds has slashed the total pay package for its chief executive to \u00a34.7m, and has also cut the group bonus pool for the first time in four years, with payouts down 33% to a total of \u00a3310m. More details to come on this one. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of the world economy, the eurozone, financial markets and business. Few industries have been hit by the impact of the coronavirus outbreak harder than airlines. Air France-KLM and Qantas both reported costly hits to profits on Thursday. Air France-KLM said that, based on a suspension of China operations from February to March, the outbreak would cost it between \u20ac150m (\u00a3125m) and \u20ac200m. Qantas, Australia\u2019s flagship carrier, said it expected a A$150m (\u00a377m) hit to its profits for the year and a 15% cut in the number of flights to Asia until at least the end of May. The airline will also put employees on leave as it cuts its capacity, and it has suspended its only route to mainland China, direct to Shanghai. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said: Coronavirus resulted in the suspension of our flights to mainland China and we\u2019re now seeing some secondary impacts with weaker demand on Hong Kong, Singapore and to a lesser extent, Japan. Other key routes, like the US and UK, haven\u2019t been impacted. The latest World Health Organisation data say there were 75,204 confirmed cases worldwide on Wednesday, with 2,009 deaths. The vast majority of those have come in China. The Chinese government on Thursday pushed further stimulus measures as it seeks to support its ailing economy. With large industrial centres still under quarantine conditions, growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy is expected to stutter. China\u2019s central bank cut its benchmark lending rate earlier on Thursday, as anticipated, adding measures to try to keep money moving in the economy. The stimulus measure helped Chinese stock market indices to strong gains: the Shanghai Stock Exchange composite index rose by 1.84%, while the CSI 300 benchmark which also incorporates Shenzhen stocks gained 2.3%. However, the increases did not spread uniformly across Asia, indicating that global investors may have already priced in stimulus. Stocks in Hong Kong edged down, while Korea\u2019s Kospi 200 index lost 0.56% amid increased numbers of infected people.

      "bodyText": "The World Health Organization is coordinating with the African Union to prepare the continent\u2019s countries for potential arrivals of people infected with coronavirus. Last week, the first case of coronavirus in Africa was confirmed when a case emerged in Egypt. The World Health Organization has issued a plea to a dozen manufacturers of personal protective equipment to help in a bid to protect health workers from the spread of coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019ve written to 12 chief executives of manufacturers of personal protective equipment to seek their cooperation to ensure supply to protect health workers,\u201d said the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom. Over half of the coronavirus cases outside of China are onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, the World Health Organization\u2019s director general has said. Giving the WHO\u2019s daily update, Tedros Adhanom said there were now more than 1,000 cases outside mainland China, and seven deaths. Here\u2019s the latest country-by-country breakdown of the coronavirus outbreak, as the number of those infected worldwide hits nearly 75,000. According to Associated Press, the latest figures provided by each government\u2019s health authority as of Thursday are: Mainland China: 2,118 deaths among 74,576 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei Hong Kong: 65 cases, 2 deaths Macau: 10 Japan: 727 cases, including 634 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, 3 deaths Singapore: 84 South Korea: 51, 1 death (the number of cases has since risen after reports of new cases at a \u2018cult\u2019 church have taken the total number to 82) Thailand: 35 Taiwan: 24 cases, 1 death Malaysia: 22 Vietnam: 16 Germany: 16 United States: 15 cases; separately, 1 US citizen died in China Australia: 14 France: 12 cases, 1 death United Kingdom: 9 United Arab Emirates: 9 Canada: 8 Iran: 5 cases, 2 deaths Philippines: 3 cases, 1 death India: 3 Italy: 3 Russia: 2 Spain: 2 Belgium: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Sweden: 1 Cambodia: 1 Finland: 1 Egypt: 1 Here are the main things that have happened today: Two Japanese passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise liner have died after becoming infected onboard. Both were in their 80s. China\u2019s national death toll stands at 2,118, with 74,576 confirmed infections in total. New cases of the virus in China have dropped, partly because the way cases are counted was changed for the second time in a week. Scientists have signed an open letter in support of Chinese colleagues who have been targeted on social media with conspiracy theories about the origins of the coronavirus. UK passengers on the Diamond Princess are expected to be flown out from Tokyo on Friday. They will land at Boscombe Down airbase in Wiltshire. The Foreign Office is also helping Britons who were on the Westerdam cruise ship to come home from Cambodia. The South Korean city of Daegu is facing an \u201cunprecedented crisis\u201d, its mayor has said, after a cluster of cases at a church grew to account for nearly half of the nation\u2019s total cases. Iran has reported two deaths from the coronavirus, and an additional three cases in the city of Qom. Australia has extended its travel ban for arrivals from China into a fourth week. It will last until 29 February. Our health editor, Sarah Boseley, reports that 27 prominent public health scientists from nine countries have signed a joint statement of support for Chinese colleagues who are being criticised on social media, and even threatened with violence as false rumours circulate about the origins of the coronavirus. \u201cWe work very closely with the Chinese scientists. We have had incredible openness with the labs in China for the last 15 years, since Sars,\u201d said Dr Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth Alliance in the United States. \u201cWe collaborate on what are dangerous viruses and get incredible information that helps public health around the world. That is all under threat right now.\u201d There is a worry that the open and transparent relationship between the Chinese scientists and their western counterparts will come to an abrupt end, impeding the sharing of data and the hunt for treatments and vaccines against Covid-19. The scientists cite conspiracy theories circulating on social media which claim that the coronavirus was artificially manufactured in a lab conducting bioweapons research. They are \u201ccrackpot theories that need to be addressed, but in the age of social media it is just impossible\u201d, Daszak said. UK companies have begun to flag up the economic impact of the coronavirus. Aveva, which is one of Britain\u2019s biggest tech groups and earns 5% of its revenues from China, said Chinese sales had been knocked by the disruption. Shares in the FTSE 100-listed firm dropped 4% after its update. Shares in the kitchen and bathroom supplier Norcros plummeted 13% when it alerted over profits because of the impact of the disease on Chinese-based suppliers. And the recruitment group Hays says its business in China has slowed. Its chief executive, Alistair Cox, told PA Media that recruitment in China had been \u201cvery subdued\u201d. \u201cEveryone has been concerned about their own health and safety and that of their families \u2013 it has to be everyone\u2019s priority.\u201d US military forces in South Korea have just issued a statement about their response to the situation in Daegu. The measures are intended to restrict unnecessary travel, and schools and children\u2019s centres used by military staff have been closed. Daegu, which is two hours south of the capital, Seoul, accounts for nearly half the confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country. Infections have centred on a controversial \u201ccult\u201d church. A 61-year-old woman who worships there has been linked to the 37 other members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus who have been confirmed as infected. Daegu\u2019s mayor, Kwon Young-jin, has said the city faces \u201can unprecedented crisis\u201d. While, naturally, people\u2019s health is the primary concern with the coronavirus outbreak, it is also undoubtedly having a global economic impact as well. Air France-KLM, Qantas, and the global container shipping giant Maersk have become the latest businesses to warn about the financial impact from the continued spread of the coronavirus. My colleague Joanna Partridge has the full story. There is some more detail from Iran of the coronavirus cases there. Three cases have been confirmed today, in addition to the two people who were known to have died from it. The cases have all been in Qom, which is around 140km (86 miles) south of the capital, Tehran. According to the official IRNA news agency all schools and universities, including religious Shia seminaries, were shut down in the city. Mohammad Mahdi Gouya, Iran\u2019s deputy health minister, said the three people with the coronavirus did not appear to have had any contact with Chinese nationals. Authorities were now investigating the origin of the disease, and its possible link with religious pilgrims from Pakistan or other countries. British Airways have announced a further round of flight cancellations. A spokesperson for the airline said: \u201cIn line with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office\u2019s continued advice against all but essential travel to mainland China, we are cancelling flights to and from Beijing and Shanghai until April 17 2020. We continue to fly to and from Hong Kong. We will keep the situation under review.\u201d The company said it would be contacting customers on cancelled flights to discuss their travel options, which includes the possibility of rebooking on to other carriers, refunds, or flying on a later date. Here\u2019s a summary of the main events so far today. Two Japanese passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise liner have died after becoming infected onboard. Both were in their 80s. China\u2019s national death toll stands at 2,118, with 74,576 confirmed infections in total. New cases of the virus in China have dropped, partly because the way cases are counted was changed for the second time in a week. UK passengers on the Diamond Princess are expected to be flown out from Tokyo on Friday. They will land at Boscombe Down airbase in Wiltshire. The Foreign Office is also helping Britons who were on the Westerdam cruise ship come home from Cambodia. The South Korean city of Daegu is facing an \u201cunprecedented crisis\u201d, its mayor has said, after a cluster of cases at a church grew to account for nearly half of the nation\u2019s total virus cases. Iran has reported two deaths from the coronavirus. Australia has extended its travel ban for arrivals from China into a fourth week. It will last until 29 February. PA is reporting that the plane carrying British passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship will land at the MoD base Boscombe Down in Wiltshire. Around 70 Britons will be on the repatriation flight, which is expected to leave Tokyo late tomorrow night. Sources have told the PA news agency that the Britons in Cambodia who left the Westerdam cruise ship are being assisted by the Foreign Office to make their way home. They are being quite coy about it though \u2013 refusing to disclose how many Britons are involved, or indeed whether they may have already arrived back in the country. The group, who have all tested negative for coronavirus while in Cambodia, are receiving health advice and being helped with commercial flight bookings. Public Health England said airport health teams would meet the flights and speak to Westerdam passengers about any symptoms, and they would be asked to self-isolate at home for 14 days. Hong Kong\u2019s Information Services Department has issued some photos of passengers arriving at Hong Kong international airport on a flight from Tokyo. A total of 106 Hong Kong residents, who were quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Yokohama, were permitted to leave Japan and have flown back to Hong Kong. Upon arrival they were taken straight to a designated quarantine site. Australia may have extended its ban on foreign travellers from China for another week until 29 February, but Melbourne is trying to do something to make the Chinese population currently there feel more welcome. The Victoria state government has decided to light up a series of landmarks including the Arts Centre, the National Gallery Victoria and Melbourne town hall in red and gold as a show of solidarity with China over the coronavirus outbreak. Perhaps more practically, it has proposed that as soon as it is safe to visit China again, the city will send a 100-strong trade delegation. The premier, Daniel Andrews, has also urged people to support Chinese businesses. \u201cGo and visit a Chinese restaurant, go to a precinct which is dominated by Asian businesses, go and show your support for them, because a lot of them are having it very, very tough at the moment as people stay away.\u201d A British couple who published video diaries from a cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan have confirmed that they have the coronvirus as they posted Facebook updates from hospital. Sally and David Abel, who were among thousands of passengers on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, said that Japanese doctors had told them that vaccinations which they had in the past for the flu had stopped the virus from spreading further. The were not displaying any symptoms and were in good spirits, their son Steve added in a live post on Facebook as they awoke on Thursday morning to see photos of his smiling parents in two beds in the same hospital room. David Abel posted: \u201cOutside the hospital I came over a bit weird and nearly passed out. Every pore on my body opened and i was wheelchaired to our room.\u201d \u201cFull health inspection and now we know what\u2019s going on. We both contracted a cold (unaware of) and it has not yet turned into pneumonia. (we do have corona virus). \u201cTomorrow the big tests commence. chest x-rays, ECG, chest scan, urine + more.\u201d Three Iranian patients have tested positive for the new coronavirus disease, according to the state\u2019s semi-official ISNA news agency. The latest development in Iran comes after its health ministry said on Wednesday that two people had died after preliminary tests came back as positive for Covid-19. ISNA reports that five hospitals have been designated for the treatment of cases. A Japanese government official has described coronavirus as the biggest risk to the economy in a country which has already been heavily criticised by others, including US authorities for its handling of quarantined cruise ship passengers. His comments came monthly report said that the Japanese labour market remained solid, but warned about risks to the outlook from the coronavirus epidemic. Japan\u2019s financial watchdog has begun conducting an emergency survey on domestic financial institutions with business operations in China to gauge how the coronavirus outbreak could affect credit costs. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ)is continuing to cover the crisis in China after the state expelled three of its reporters from the country, a move which the news outlet criticised in an editorial on Wednesday night. The WSJ\u2019s latest report (paywall) reports that overburdened hospitals are struggling to provide care to other patients in Hubei, the province at the centre of the outbreak, with some facilities turning away pregnant women with complications. The editorial said: \u201cThe truth is that Beijing\u2019s rulers are punishing our reporters so they can change the subject from the Chinese public\u2019s anger about the government\u2019s management of the coronavirus scourge.\u201d Two more Russians aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan have been diagnosed with the virus, the Russian Embassy in Japan has said. The two will be transferred to a hospital in Japan for treatment, according to the embassy statement published on Facebook. The Diamond Princess has been docked in the Yokohama port near Tokyo since Feb. 4, when 10 people on board tested positive for the virus. So far 621 cases of the virus, which has been named COVID-19, have been confirmed among the the Diamond Princess\u2019s original 3,711 people on board. An evacuation flight for Britons stuck on a cruise ship docked off the coast of Japan over coronavirus fears will leave Tokyo on Friday, the UK\u2019s foreign secretary has said. Dominic Raab said information had been provided to those registered for the flight, but he urged other British nationals still seeking to leave to contact the Foreign Office. He added: \u201cWe will continue to support British nationals who wish to stay in Japan.\u201d Those repatriated from the Diamond Princess will be quarantined at Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral on their return, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said. There were 78 British passengers on the cruise liner when cases of the coronavirus strain known as Covid-19 started to emerge. Four British cases have since been confirmed by the Foreign Office. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog now in London Here\u2019s a summary of events so far on Thursday on the coronavirus. Two Japanese passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise liner have died after becoming infected onboard. Both were in their 80s. The South Korean city of Daegu is facing an \u201cunprecedented crisis\u201d, its mayor has said, after a cluster of cases at a church grew to account for nearly half of the nation\u2019s total virus cases. New cases of the virus in China have dropped, partly because the way cases are counted was changed for the second time in a week. China\u2019s national death toll stands at 2,118, with 74,576 confirmed infections. Iran reported two deaths from the coronavirus. Australia has extended its travel ban for arrivals from China into a fourth week. UK passengers on the Diamond Princess are expected to be flown out on Friday. The mayor of a South Korean city of Daegu has ordered the shutdown of all kindergartens and public libraries, as a surge in confirmed Covid-19 cases linked to a local church raised the prospect of wider transmission. Reuters reported that malls in Daegu, the country\u2019s fourth largest city (population of 2.5 million), were largely empty. \u201cWe are in an unprecedented crisis,\u201d the city\u2019s mayor, Kwon Young-jin, said. Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 31 new cases of the virus on Thursday, following 20 a day earlier, taking the total across the country to 82. Of that national tally, 49 patients are from Daegu or nearby and have been traced to an infected person who attended a local church, a scenario that KCDC described as a \u201csuper-spreading event\u201d. You can read our full story here. The Global Times is reporting that Beijing has postponed some student exams that were due to be held in March. China\u2019s state-run media says small- and medium-sized enterprises may lay off 30% of staff because of the coronavirus. An evacuation flight for Britons stuck on the Diamond Princess will leave Tokyo on Friday, according to the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab. There were 78 British passengers on the cruise liner when cases of the coronavirus strain known as Covid-19 started to emerge. Four British cases have since been confirmed. It is understood that only healthy passengers with no symptoms of the virus will be able to travel on the evacuation flight, with all to spend 14 days at quarantined in the UK. Anyone who develops symptoms during the flight will be taken to hospital, Press Association reports, while it is understood any pre-existing cases will be treated in Japan. Meanwhile, the European Commission has announced the EU will be financing the repatriation of citizens from any of the EU27 still stuck on the Diamond Princess. Indonesia has announced it will evacuate 74 of its nationals from the stricken Diamond Princess cruise liner. Passengers are continuing to disembark from the ship docked at Yokohama, south of Tokyo. As of Wednesday, a total of 621 passengers and crew had tested positive for the new coronavirus. Indonesia currently has no reported cases of coronavirus, but the idyllic holiday island of Bali has been hit by the ripple effect of the crisis, with tourism plummeting. At least one expert says Bali \u201cdoes not have the capacity\u201d to treat patients if they become sick. You can read our full story on it below. The director of disaster response who has been out at the facility housing the new arrivals near Darwin said she is awaiting final number of arrivals but believes it\u2019s 170. Six New Zealanders also arrived on the flight carrying Australians from Japan and were transferred to New Zealand. We are just seeing a press conference from Australia, where passengers from the Diamond Cruise ship recently arrived to carry out 14 days of quarantine. The Northern Territory\u2019s deputy chief health minister, Dianne Stephens, said some arrivals had minor cold symptoms and will be tested for Covid-19. There were six people off that plane identified as having minor sniffles and sore throat that we have separated completely, and they will be swabbed this afternoon, and those people have gone straight into an isolation area of the HowardSprings facility, in the same way that we have done that for the work and cohort, people who have had sniffles and colds. If somebody does test positive for COVID-19, we are fully prepared to manage that situation out at Howard Springs, or in the Royal Darwin Hospital and the jurisdictions are ready to come and retrieve patients who require that. Deaths in China in the past 24 hours were recorded as 114, of which 108 were in Hubei province. This compares to 136 recorded the previous day. The new total for people who have died from Covid-19 in China is now 2,118. Let\u2019s take a look at today\u2019s national figures from China on infections due to the virus. The national health commission said that in the 24 hours to midnight on Wednesday, there were 394 new cases, taking confirmed cases across the country to 74,576. This new cases figure is a significant drop from the 1,749 reported the previous day. It seems to be largely due to another change in the way Hubei province reports cases. According to the Hubei health commission, \u201csuspected cases\u201d and \u201cconfirmed cases\u201d have been separated out again ... which I will try to explain below. You may recall that Hubei changed its reporting criteria last week to include \u201cclinically diagnosed\u201d cases as confirmed cases. That meant cases diagnosed by a doctor (i.e by using scans and assessing symptoms) were included in \u201cnew cases\u201d along with patients who had tested positive using the nucleic acid test. At the time, Chinese authorities said this change was to ensure patients who had symptoms but hadn\u2019t yet had the tests, could access treatment immediately. There was also the suggestion the change was a way of mitigating anger over insufficient numbers of testing kits. Last week\u2019s change saw the number of cases shoot up by approximately 15,000 on one day, but in reality it reflected the counting change. From my reading, the new system as of today has removed some of those people who were clinically diagnosed if they subsequently tested negative using the nucleic acid test. \u201cBased on comprehensive analysis, cases with negative nucleic acid test results were subtracted from the confirmed cases, and a total of 279 cases were corrected,\u201d the health commission\u2019s report said. South Korea has recorded 31 news cases today, taking its total to 82. The country\u2019s disease control centre said 30 of the new cases were in the city of Daegu and surrounding Gyeongbuk province south of Seoul. Of those, 23 are linked with the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, The Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, where the a 61-year-old woman believed to be at the centre of the cluster was a worshipper. The woman is known as Patient 31 because sher was the 31st person recorded with the virus in South Korea. It is now believed that 37 out of the 82 cases are members of the church\u2019s congregation. Of the remaining eight cases announced today, one is in Seoul, two are in hospital in Cheongdo Daenam hospital in Gyeongbuk. The remaning five are being investigated. The two Diamond Princess passengers who died on Thursday were both Japanese, NHK reported - an 87-year-old man and an 84-year-old woman. Both victims reportedly had pre-existing medical conditions, the broadcaster said, adding that the man had been hospitalised on 11 February and the woman the following day. On Wednesday, a video by Prof Kentaro Iwata, a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe University Hospital, was circulated widely on social media. In it he criticised quarantine measures on the cruise liner, including that there were no designated \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cred\u201d zones on the ship that indicated areas that were clear of the virus, or ones where it was present. He subsequently took the clip down, saying he was informed conditions on the ship had improved. But on Wednesday he had told BBC radio: I felt much safer when I was in Africa [during the Ebola crisis] because you know where the virus exists and you know where the patient is. But inside the Diamond Princess you have no idea where the virus is. Over the past few days there has been increasing criticism of the Japanese authorities\u2019 handling of the infection on the cruise line, as infections continued to mount, despite infection control measures being in place. Japan\u2019s health minister, Katsunobu Kato, on Thursday defended Japan\u2019s response to the outbreak in parliament, telling lawmakers that officials had taken expert advice and responded to issues on a daily basis. In a move to reassure the public, the health ministry also issued a statement in both English and Japanese that said all passengers had been required to stay in their cabins since 5 February to contain the virus. The Guardian\u2019s Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry, reports that Kentaro Iwata, a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe University hospital, said he was not surprised to hear reports that two passengers on the Diamond Princess had died. \u201cCruise ships have a lot of elderly passengers, many of whom have chronic diseases and are on medication, so I am not surprised to hear that people have died,\u201d Iwata told reporters by video conference from Yokohama on Thursday. \u201cThey are high risk, and we don\u2019t have a specific treatment for the virus.\u201d Some news just breaking that two elderly passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan, have died. They are believed to be a man and a woman in their 80s, according to Japanese broadcasters Kyodo and NHK. Both outlets are citing government sources. We\u2019ll bring you more on this story as soon as we have it. More than 620 of the passengers on the Diamond Princess liner have been infected on the ship, which has been quarantined since 3 February, initially with about 3,700 people on board. Nationals from Australia, the US, Canada and Hong Kong who have been quarantined on the ship have been airlifted home. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. Here\u2019s an update of what we know so far. Two people infected with Covid-19 on the Diamond Princess cruise liner, have died, reports say. Hong Kong citizens evacuated from the Diamond princess have begun arriving home. New cases in China have fallen to 394 according to the daily national update, taking cases across the country to 74,576. Total deaths have risen by 114 to 2,118. Figures across China for new cases have dropped significantly after Hubei province changed the way it counted cases again, to remove the clinically diagnosed cases who have since tested negative to the virus on the test kit.

      "bodyText": "We know too little about China, and will soon know a little less. Beijing is kicking out three excellent reporters, in the first direct expulsion since 1998. Officials said the trio\u2019s employer, the Wall Street Journal, had refused to apologise for a headline on an opinion piece about the coronavirus outbreak: \u201cChina is the real sick man of Asia.\u201d The headline was offensive to many people, including staff at the paper. Not only does the phrase date from the era when foreign powers were carving up China, but it draws upon racist beliefs that Asian people carried and spread diseases, which reverberate and fuel bigotry even now. It was also insensitive given the hundreds killed and thousands sickened by the virus. But its link to the expulsions should not be taken at face value. Reporters have nothing to do with comment pieces, and this was written and edited outside China. The journalists \u2013 Chao Deng, Josh Chin and Philip Wen \u2013 have produced important coverage, including on the horrific treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang. Wen also wrote about an Australian investigation into a relative of the Chinese leader Xi Jinping; his co-author was refused a visa renewal last year \u2013 one of several reporters forced out that way in recent years. Strikingly, the decision was announced one day after the US said it was designating five media outlets as operatives of the Chinese state. (Not only are they part of the propaganda apparatus, but staff at the news agency Xinhua, for example, produce reports reserved for senior leaders in addition to regular coverage.) Though the move is primarily symbolic, many had predicted that Beijing might act in response. Correspondents in China already face harassment and surveillance, and know that their Chinese colleagues and sources are at much graver risk of retaliation. The expulsions are a clear attempt to intimidate foreign media and shape reporting and commentary done far beyond China\u2019s borders. As news broke of the WSJ expulsions, Chinese diplomats were pressuring Nepalese media over a coronavirus commentary and illustration. Back at home, the Chinese journalists who have produced outstanding coverage of the epidemic face increasing curbs. On the same day that Beijing announced the WSJ expulsions, a well-established Chinese blog vanished; its last article was reportedly titled \u201cChinese are all paying the price for the death of media\u201d. Meanwhile, Wuhan\u2019s new party secretary said officials would be held responsible \u201cif a single new case is found\u201d \u2013 a remark supposed to encourage thoroughness, but giving cadres good reason to conceal any further infections. Since the WSJ headline caused real anger in China, the expulsions may help to divert growing rage at the official handling of the outbreak towards foreigners. But reliable, detailed and humane coverage \u2013 of the kind that Deng, one of those expelled, has been producing from Wuhan \u2013 is in the interests of the public as a whole, and Chinese citizens most of all.",

Top stories Two people have died after the Sydney to Melbourne XPT derailed in Victoria on Thursday evening, with witnesses saying the train was travelling about 100km/h before it left the tracks near Wallan, approximately 45km north of Melbourne. There were 160 people were on board, with the two dead believed to have been travelling in the drivers\u2019 carriage. Four others remain in a stable condition, with one person airlifted to Melbourne for medical care. \u201cInitially we were all just stunned, people went flying, stuff went flying,\u201d one passenger recalled. Former Trump ally Roger Stone has been sentenced to 40 months prison, for obstructing the congressional investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Stone is the sixth presidential aide convicted in a criminal case relating to the Mueller investigation, with Judge Amy Jackson finding the consultant \u201cflat out lied\u201d to congress, and that \u201chis pride in his own lies [were] a threat to the very foundation of this democracy\u201d. Stone could yet receive a presidential pardon, which Democratic impeachment leader Adam Schiff said would constitute a \u201cbreathtaking act of corruption\u201d. One in eight Australians are living in poverty, that\u2019s the damning statistic from a new report by the Australian Council of Social Services, including more than 700,000 children. Unaffordable housing, a lack of jobs and the low rate of Newstart were \u201clocking people in poverty\u201d, Acoss\u2019s chief executive Cassandra Goldie said. The report also found that the poverty gap \u2013 the difference between the poverty line and the average incomes of people in poverty \u2013 had risen to $282 a week. Australia Anthony Albanese is poised to commit Labor to a net-zero emissions target by 2050, saying that the nation\u2019s bushfire emergency highlights the need for national leadership and a \u201creal target\u201d, dismissing any use of carryover credits from Kyoto to reach future commitments. Advocates for victims of domestic violence have angrily criticised Queensland police, following a senior officer\u2019s speculation that the perpetrator of a gruesome car fire attack that killed his wife and three children had perhaps been \u201cdriven too far\u201d and that police would keep an \u201copen mind\u201d about his possible motivations. Myanmar\u2019s commander in chief \u2013 recommended for prosecution over genocide and war crimes by the UN \u2013 has met and exchanged gifts with Australia\u2019s ambassador. Human Rights Watch has condemned the meeting, saying it lent legitimacy to a military accused of mass atrocities. The Great Barrier Reef is facing a third major coral bleaching inside half a decade, if high ocean temperatures do not drop inside the next fortnight, scientists have warned. Around two-thirds of the reef are between 2-3C above average temperatures. The world The murder of nine people in the German town of Hanau by a suspected rightwing extremist has revealed the \u201cpoison\u201d of racism and hate, chancellor Angela Merkel has said. The gunmen targeted two shisha bars before killing himself and his mother. The Irish parliament is headed for deadlock over electing a new taoiseach, with no nominee expected to win a majority in votes following the 8 February election. The stalemate could lead to an unprecedented grand coalition between centrist rivals Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael after the former ruled out working with Sinn F\u00e9in. Doctors will know within a few weeks whether drugs used for HIV or Ebola could prove effective against the coronavirus, following World Health Organisation trials conducted inside China. The current death tolls from the virus stands at over 2,100. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s flagging bid to become the Democratic presidential candidate has revived, after the Massachusetts senator raised $2.8m in donations following a fiery Democratic debate performance in Las Vegas earned her widespread praise. Recommended reads It was the swimming pool at the centre of one of Australia\u2019s most racially charged episodes, but 55 years after Moree pool became a major flashpoint during Charlie Perkins\u2019 1965 Freedom Rides, it is dividing the community once again.

Indigenous affairs editor Lorena Allam reports from Moree \u2013 hear more about this story on this week\u2019s episode of Full Story. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful to be you\u201d.

Oh, and her life coach tells her to take up the xylophone \u201cas a relaxing hobby\u201d.

Sport The seventh Women\u2019s T20 World Cup gets underway in Sydney tonight, and with clean air in cricket\u2019s summer programming the tournament could boost the prominence of the women\u2019s game astronomically, writes Geoff Lemon. Roger Federer will miss up to four months of tennis including the French Open, after the 38-year-old Swiss announced he needs minor surgery on his right knee. The 20-slam champion maintains he still has Wimbledon and the Tokyo Olympics in sight. Media roundup NSW transport minister Andrew Constance has apologised after conceding the state government\u2019s signature Metro project could go over budget by up to $3bn, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

However, they are only a 10km dinghy ride to Boigu Island, the mostly northerly island of the Torres Strait, with a population of about 300 people. People from these and 11 other PNG coastal villages along the Western Province coast are allowed to travel across the Torres Strait to visit the island communities in Australian territory under the Torres Strait Treaty to maintain traditional kinship and trading relationships. They can cross without a passport or visa and there are up to 50,000 visits a year under the treaty. The Torres Strait regional island council\u2019s mayor, Fred Gela, said authorities were putting in place measures to protect the Australian mainland but the Torres Strait had been left exposed. \u201cPeople can get in a dinghy and come straight across to the Torres Strait, and while our health centres are equipped with the capacity to test for the virus, we cannot afford the availability, time or capacity to test everyone crossing the border under the treaty.\u201d Residents of all the Western Province Treaty villages regularly travel back and forth to the island of Daru, which is the region\u2019s commercial centre and has a population of 15,000.

It has some of the world\u2019s worst infection rates of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, as well as a resurgence of leprosy due to lack of medical supplies and access to health services. Torres Strait Islanders are exposed to these communicable diseases by migration movement under the Torres Strait Treaty, where they are six times more likely to contact MDR TB than non-Indigenous mainland Australians. Queensland Health\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, said the Torres and Cape Hospital and Health Service was well-prepared to respond to coronavirus but she did not confirm if any reports of outbreaks in PNG had been received. Gela said the Torres Strait local disaster management group, which includes police, health authorities and border force, met last week to discuss the threat. \u201cDuring this meeting, we flagged concerns that protection measures to prevent potential exposures taken at mainland Australian ports, via regulation of aircraft or shipping entry, has not transpired at our entry points in and around the Torres Strait,\u201d Gela said. \u201cThis is of particular concern given our close proximity of the virus origin, being Asia.\u201d The proximity with Indonesia, with the West Papuan town of Merauke only a dinghy ride away from the Torres Strait, also posed a potential threat from Covid-19.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Demonstrators, some of whom appeared drunk, put up road blocks, burned tyres and clashed with hundreds of riot police who moved to restore access.
