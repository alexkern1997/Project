      "bodyText": "The number of coronavirus cases in California is on the rise after weeks of optimism that infections had slowed, raising fears that plans to reopen counties, along with mass protests against police brutality, could accelerate transmission of the virus. According to numbers from Johns Hopkins University, which has been tracking coronavirus cases and deaths, California is one of 20 states that have seen an uptick in cases in the past five days. Just this week, daily cases of Covid-19 hit a new high across the state, topping 3,000 new daily confirmed cases for the second time in a week and contributing to the 115,000 cases and more than 4,300 deaths the state has reported since the pandemic began. California has been held up as a model for its response to the coronavirus, locking down earlier, and being slower to lift shelter-in-place orders compared with other states. But recent weeks have seen counties push back on the orders, in some cases reopening sections of the economy in defiance of orders from Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor. David Eisenman, the director of the Center for Public Health and Disasters at UCLA, said some of the rise was to be expected as counties accelerate plans to reopen and warm weather draws Californians to beaches and parks. An increase in testing, too, could play a role. \u201cIt\u2019s not terribly surprising, given the timing. It\u2019s to be expected as more people are moving and interacting in the community,\u201d said Eisenman. But he said it was impossible to pinpoint which factors are most directly responsible for the rise \u2013 especially in the weeks ahead, when cases of people who have attended mass protests could show up. The state\u2019s overall increase masks local flare-ups, including an outbreak in southern California\u2019s Imperial county that\u2019s seen nearly 900 new cases and 11 new deaths in the past two weeks. \u201cThe Imperial Valley has a horrendous outbreak going on right now,\u201d Dr George Rutherford, UC San Francisco epidemiologist and infectious diseases expert told the Los Angeles Times. In southern California, home to most of the state\u2019s cases, Los Angeles county tallied almost 10,000 cases just last week, including a single-day record of 2,050 cases, according to data from the state\u2019s public health department. Despite concerns over the spike in cases, efforts to monitor the outbreak could be blunted by the testing facilities that have closed or modified their hours amid widespread protests over the death of George Floyd, who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis. At least 20 of the 30 testing sites overseen by the city and county of Los Angeles have been affected. Meantime, northern California\u2019s San Francisco bay-area counted 263 new cases on Monday, raising the total to 13,655. The region\u2019s weekly average of new cases was 237 last week \u2013 down from the first week of April, when the seven-day average peaked at 249. Mark Essick, the sheriff of Sonoma county, generated headlines last week when he said he would refuse to enforce the county\u2019s stay-at-home order. But just yesterday he reversed course, telling the Press Democrat that he and his deputies would enforce the current health order until 8 June to the limited degree that enforcement has been needed. Cases are up, too, in Alameda county \u2013 the region\u2019s second most populous \u2013 with particularly high case rates in historically disadvantaged East Oakland. California counties are in different phases of reopening economies, complicating a coordinated response to the new outbreaks. For instance as cases spike in Los Angeles, where a stay-at-home order remains in effect, some bars and dine-in restaurants have reopened in San Diego, just two hours south. That has public health officials worried about a second wave of cases before the first wave has completely passed, which could slow efforts to reopen California. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible this means we don\u2019t reopen as fast as we wanted,\u201d said Eisenman. At the top of Eisenman\u2019s concerns, however, are tactics that law enforcement has been using to disperse crowds as thousands march in protests, including teargas and pepper spray. Alongside a list of public health experts, Eisenman sent a letter calling on law enforcement to curb the use of chemical agents on crowds altogether. \u201cCivil unrest over George Floyd\u2019s murder during this Sars-Cov-2 pandemic will increase community transmission of this highly contagious virus and contribute to increased incidence of morbidity and mortality associated with Covid-19,\u201d reads the letter. \u201cThe issue of teargas is central to Covid,\u201d Eisenman told the Guardian. \u201cToo much has been made about physical distance protesters should abide by, and not enough has been said about the tactics law enforcement is using\u201d. \u201cThe use of teargas and pepper spray is going to fuel any spreading that was going to occur anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cIt causes people to cough and sneeze \u2013 on each other, and on the police if they get rounded up and confined. Cops are putting people side by side, removing their masks, and cuffing them so they can\u2019t cover their mouths\u201d. Eisenman is said it was crucial for those who have or will be attending protests, including journalists, to follow precautions when they return home, including self-isolation and testing within three days of attending a demonstration. Still, Eisenman sees the protests as a necessary step in affecting change, and is calling for safe practices as they continue. \u201cRacism is as bad for health as Covid-19,\u201d Eisenman said. \u201cProbably even worse.\u201d",

He added that Zoom does not \u201cproactively monitor meeting content\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe do not share information with law enforcement except in circumstances like child sex abuse,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not have backdoors where anyone can enter meetings without being visible to others. None of this will change.\u201d</p> <p>The decision could set a dangerous precedent for privacy, said Tim Wade, the technical director at the cybersecurity firm&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.vectra.ai/\">Vectra</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIn an online world, encryption is paramount to privacy, and privacy promotes safety, liberty and fairness into our social fabric,\u201d he said. \u201cGating personal privacy behind a paywall erodes basic freedoms and fairness.\u201d</p> <p>The encryption concerns are just the latest in a long line of criticisms Zoom has faced as its popularity soared during coronavirus lockdowns,<strong> </strong>as millions staying home from school and work turned to Zoom to connect.</p> <p>Zoom previously falsely advertised itself as using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/trevortimm/status/1244990579705958400\">end-to-end encryption</a> and, once caught, confirmed in a blogpost that end-to-end encryption was not possible on the platform.</p> <p>Meanwhile incidents of trolls<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/zoom-technology-security-coronavirus-video-conferencing\">attacking users on the app</a> with slurs and offensive imagery \u2013 known as Zoom-bombing \u2013 also rose. Zoom added security measures in response, but the issue is ongoing.</p> <p>On the call, Yuan also outlined just how much the popularity of Zoom has surged in recent months. Zoom expects to generate up to $1.8bn in revenue<strong> </strong>this fiscal year, according to Bloomberg analysts on the call, triple what it generated last year.

      "bodyText": "Zoom, the popular video conferencing platform, has announced it will provide end-to-end encryption after facing a litany of privacy and security concerns \u2013 but only to users who pay for it. Eric Yuan, the company\u2019s CEO, raised alarm among privacy advocates on Wednesday by saying Zoom planned to exclude free calls from end-to-end encryption so as to leave open the possibility of working with law enforcement. \u201cFree users for sure we don\u2019t want to give [end-to-end encryption] because we also want to work together with FBI, with local law enforcement in case some people use Zoom for a bad purpose,\u201d Yuan said on the call with analysts. Privacy and security experts say encryption, which secures communication so that it can only be read by the users involved, is particularly important at a time when video apps and other digital platforms are being used for sensitive issues such as organizing protests, discussing legal issues and attending medical appointments. \u201cBasic security shouldn\u2019t be a premium feature that\u2019s only available to wealthy individuals and big corporations,\u201d said Evan Greer, the deputy director at Fight for the Future, a digital rights advocacy that previously organized a campaign demanding Zoom increase user security. \u201cIt\u2019s just plain gross for the company to say they\u2019ll only keep your calls safe and secure if you pay extra.\u201d Greer also expressed concern that such comments play into ongoing attacks on encryption from officials such as the attorney general William Barr, who has called on companies such as Apple to provide back doors into encrypted devices for law enforcement purposes. They also come as the US considers the Earn It Act, proposed legislation that would hold companies accountable for content distributed on their platform, putting encryption at risk. A spokesman from Zoom said the company already offers basic encryption for users of all tiers. He added that Zoom does not \u201cproactively monitor meeting content\u201d. \u201cWe do not share information with law enforcement except in circumstances like child sex abuse,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not have backdoors where anyone can enter meetings without being visible to others. None of this will change.\u201d The decision could set a dangerous precedent for privacy, said Tim Wade, the technical director at the cybersecurity firm Vectra. \u201cIn an online world, encryption is paramount to privacy, and privacy promotes safety, liberty and fairness into our social fabric,\u201d he said. \u201cGating personal privacy behind a paywall erodes basic freedoms and fairness.\u201d The encryption concerns are just the latest in a long line of criticisms Zoom has faced as its popularity soared during coronavirus lockdowns, as millions staying home from school and work turned to Zoom to connect. Zoom previously falsely advertised itself as using end-to-end encryption and, once caught, confirmed in a blogpost that end-to-end encryption was not possible on the platform. Meanwhile incidents of trollsattacking users on the app with slurs and offensive imagery \u2013 known as Zoom-bombing \u2013 also rose. Zoom added security measures in response, but the issue is ongoing. On the call, Yuan also outlined just how much the popularity of Zoom has surged in recent months. Zoom expects to generate up to $1.8bn in revenue this fiscal year, according to Bloomberg analysts on the call, triple what it generated last year. Yuan said Zoom is seeing as many as 300 million daily participants on the app, up from just 10 million in December.",

It is so fundamental. \u201cI genuinely cannot wrap my head around why the government is not giving it the support that it is giving other industries.\u201d For now, Fraser lives day by day. As Australia reopens, she is wondering about live gigs again, but worries about \u201cthe moral responsibility\u201d of a performer potentially putting audience members at risk of contracting the virus. She\u2019s heading out carefully, going for walks, reading the comfort novels of Dorothy L Sayers and Georgette Heyer, and working hard. Fraser has made the most of lockdown, but live work is \u201cincomparable\u201d. It\u2019s about the level of engagement with an audience, the ability to test an idea. \u201cIt gives you a bone-deep sense of the minute, the constant shifts in the rhythm of society.\u201d Postcards from the pandemic looks at how everyday Australians are coping with immense changes coronavirus has brought to their lives. We\u2019d like to hear your story about how you are managing during this crisis. Email: postcards@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has warned against \u201cimporting the things that are happening overseas to Australia\u201d after protesters gathered in Sydney to denounce the killing of George Floyd in the United States and to rally against Indigenous deaths in custody. Further protests are planned in cities around Australia in the next few days. The prime minister acknowledged during a radio interview on Thursday that Australia also had problems \u201cin this space\u201d that it needed to address, but insisted those issues were being dealt with and \u201cwe don\u2019t need to draw equivalence here\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the divisions that we\u2019re seeing in other countries \u2013 we need to stick together and look after each other,\u201d Morrison told 2GB. His comments came after hundreds of people marched through Sydney on Tuesday, chanting \u201cblack lives matter\u201d and protesting against Indigenous deaths in custody in Australia and the killing of Floyd in the US and a candlelight vigil was held in Brisbane on Wednesday night. Protesters in Sydney chanted \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and \u201cJustice today, for David Dungay\u201d \u2013 the 26-year-old Aboriginal man who said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times before he died in 2015 while being restrained by five prison guards. Dungay is one of at least 432 Aboriginal deaths in custody since the royal commission in 1991, the Guardian\u2019s latest analysis shows. There have been at least five deaths since Guardian Australia updated its Deaths Inside project in August 2019, two of which have resulted in murder charges being laid. The conservative talkback radio host Ray Hadley asked Morrison about protests in Australia during an interview on Thursday morning. Hadley said he had received emails from his listeners who were concerned to see hundreds of people in streets \u201cholding disgusting signs about our police force\u201d without complying with physical-distancing requirements. In response to the question, Morrison said he agreed people should observe physical-distancing rules during any protests in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Australia was a free country, Morrison continued, so any suggestion of stopping protests \u201cwould jar with Australians, rightly\u201d. \u201cBut at the same time people have got to exercise responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at the same time, you know, we shouldn\u2019t be importing the things that are happening overseas to Australia. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we don\u2019t have issues in this space that we need to deal with but the thing is we are dealing with it. And we don\u2019t need to draw equivalence here. \u201cWe should be Australians about this and deal with it our way, and we are.\u201d Morrison said one of the reasons Australia had done well to get through the Covid-19 crisis was because people were genuinely banding together and supporting each other \u201cand what we don\u2019t want is people dividing people\u201d. \u201cSo we respect people\u2019s right to protest, but equally protesters have to respect all other Australians in how they conduct themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s this protest or other protests, I think all Australians are OK with there being protests, but when they see people inconvenience others just trying to get to work or do things like that, well, they obviously get the irrits. And I think it\u2019s important that everyone respects everyone.\u201d Most of the recommendations from the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody in 1991 have either not been implemented or only partly implemented. New South Wales introduced race hate laws two years ago but so far, not a single person has been charged. This week, a NSW police officer was placed on restricted duties after footage surfaced of him tripping a 16-year-old Indigenous boy while arresting him in Sydney, slamming the teenager face first on to bricks. The boy\u2019s family called for an end to \u201cpolice investigating police\u201d, and told media they had felt \u201cangry\u201d, \u201cfrustrated\u201d and \u201cafraid\u201d after watching the footage. At a media conference earlier on Thursday, Morrison said the scenes around the world were distressing and he was \u201cgrateful for the wonderful country we live in here\u201d. He pointed to the Closing the Gap initiative and ongoing discussions with the states and territories as \u201cimportant work\u201d and added that he met regularly with the peak Indigenous groups in Australia.",

City and state authorities have moved aggressively to reopen businesses, including in Rio de Janeiro, where may shops opened for the first time in months on Tuesday. As Latin America battled continued steep infection curves, Germany looked to shore up its battered lockdown economy, with a massive \u20ac130bn ($146bn) stimulus package. Wide-ranging measures included temporarily cutting VAT from 19% to 16%, and handing out a \u20ac300 payment for each child. There will also be incentives to buy new cars and relief for highly indebted municipalities, paving the way for a fiscal programme that is substantially bigger than similar packages by other eurozone partners. \u201cThe size of the package will reach \u20ac130bn for 2020 to 2021, \u20ac120bn of which will be borne by the federal government,\u201d said Chancellor Angela Merkel. \u201cWe have an economic stimulus package, a package for the future and in addition, we\u2019re now dealing with our responsibility for Europe and the international dimension.\u201d Unemployment rose to 6.3% in May and the fresh stimulus comes on top of a massive \u20ac1.1tr rescue package already agreed in March, comprising loan guarantees, subsidies and a beefed-up shorter-hours programme to avoid job cuts. To fund the unprecedented package, parliament had approved new borrowing, marking a sea change in German economic policy, upending a financial crisis-era constitutional rule drastically limiting budget deficits. China has said it will allow qualifying foreign carriers that are currently barred from flying to mainland China to conduct once-per-week flights into a city of their choosing from 8 June. The Civil Aviation Administration\u2019s (CAAC) statement follows Washington\u2019s move on Wednesday to ban Chinese passenger carriers from flying to the US from 16 June, in an apparent effort to pressure Beijing to lift its restrictions on American airlines. The CAAC also said all airlines will be allowed to increase the number of international flights involving China to two per week if no incoming passengers on their flights test positive for Covid-19 for 3 consecutive weeks. In other coronavirus developments: China reported one new coronavirus case and four new asymptomatic Covid-19 cases for on Thursday. The National Health Commission said all five of the cases were imported, involving travellers from overseas. Cases in California are on the rise after weeks of optimism that infections had slowed, raising fears that plans to reopen counties could accelerate transmission of the virus. It is one of 20 states to have seen a rise in the past five days. Hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial drug promoted by Donald Trump, was ineffective in preventing infection in people exposed to the coronavirus, according to a widely anticipated clinical trial released on Wednesday. Russia\u2019s second biggest city of St Petersburg recorded a death rate last month 32% higher than last year, official data showed on Wednesday, suggesting that there may be more people dying of Covid-19 than are being reported. City authorities said issued 6,427 death certificates in May, compared to 4,875 in the same month last year. The European Union and China have cancelled a planned summit in Germany in September because of the coronavirus pandemic.",

      "body": "<p>When we first spoke, in mid-April, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Due\u00f1as began weeping within seconds. Her parents\u2019 home town, Santo Domingo de La Calzada, had the worst death rate from coronavirus in Spain, she told me on the phone. \u201cI\u2019m so scared,\u201d she said. Due\u00f1as told stories of police clambering through windows to rescue the dying, who were too weak to open their doors. Regional politicians, meanwhile, refused to give town-by-town figures for the dead, stoking anxiety and encouraging conspiracy theories. Santo Domingo\u2019s locked-down residents, she claimed, were being deliberately kept in the dark as the virus silently stalked the town.</p> <p>Due\u00f1as does not live in Santo Domingo, a town of 6,300 people set among patchwork fields of cereal crops in the northern Spanish region of La Rioja. She was born there, but now lives 28 miles away in Logro\u00f1o, the capital of this wealthy region, best known for the rich red wines that bear its name. Her angry, sometimes wildly conspiratorial outbursts on local Facebook groups \u2013 some of which have been deleted against her will \u2013 mean not all her old neighbours will welcome her back.</p> <p>If Covid-19 increases tensions among neighbours in big cities, it can produce poisonous outbreaks of mistrust in small, more insular places like Santo Domingo. By the time Due\u00f1as and I spoke again, two weeks later, the abbot from the town\u2019s small cathedral had lodged a complaint against her for defamation. (She had claimed the church was covering up the role it had played in spreading the virus.) Even members of her own family were livid at the way she had aired Santo Domingo\u2019s sorry status as one of Spain\u2019s worst Covid-19 disaster zones.</p> <p>Due\u00f1as suggested I call Jorge S\u00e1nchez, a former town councillor and a well-known local figure, to get a sense of the scale of the disaster. On 9 March, he had met with a couple of friends, Enrique Ortega and Aldo Muga, at Muga\u2019s bar. They had chatted about Ortega\u2019s upcoming 51st birthday. \u201cNow I am the only one left alive,\u201d S\u00e1nchez told me. All three caught the disease, and the other two men both died at a hospital in Logro\u00f1o on 21 March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/spain-zip/giv-3902teJKzF4TU1mt/\" data-alt=\"map of Spain and La Rioja region\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/spain-zip/giv-3902teJKzF4TU1mt/\">map of Spain and La Rioja region</a> </figure>  <p>As news spread through town that I was trying to count the dead, I received a call from town councillor Diego Mendiola. He confirmed that regional officials were refusing to give precise figures for Covid-19 deaths in Santo Domingo. All that residents could do was try to keep a tally. While we spoke, Mendiola stopped to read an incoming WhatsApp message. \u201cThat\u2019s another one,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In recent months, television pictures have shown us the empty streets of the world\u2019s great metropolises \u2013 of Madrid, London, New York, Milan. All have suffered badly. But outside the confined spaces of care homes and cruise ships, Covid-19 has been at its most lethal in a handful of southern European country towns. In Santo Domingo, without sufficient data from the regional government, it has fallen to residents to make their own estimates. Based on the number of messages he has received from parishioners asking for deceased loved ones to be mentioned in mass, the abbot, Francisco Su\u00e1rez, now believes 42 people died in the six weeks after 16 March. It is impossible to know exactly how many were killed by Covid-19, as opposed to other causes, but a reasonable, possibly conservative, estimate \u2013 based on multiple sources including newspaper death columns, funeral home websites and interviews with the head of the region\u2019s local health districts \u2013 would be 35.</p> <p>That may not sound like much in the context of a pandemic, but to get a sense of how shocking this figure is, it\u2019s worth comparing it to the death rate in the world\u2019s worst-affected major cities. London had 86 deaths per <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19bylocalareasanddeprivation/deathsoccurringbetween1marchand17april\" title=\"\">100,000 by mid-April</a> (and is now likely past 100), the Madrid region was at <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1110955/deaths-from-covid-19-disease-per-100-000-people-by-region-spain/\" title=\"\">131 in mid-May</a>, and New York City <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109867/coronavirus-death-rates-by-age-new-york-city/\" title=\"\">is currently 201</a>. The equivalent figure for Santo Domingo would be 550. Only the northern Italian province of Bergamo has experienced something similar. Towns such as San Pellegrino Terme and San Giovanni Bianco have the highest death rates of all, at around or above 1,000 per 100,000 from all causes during the worst weeks. \u201cThe pain becomes communal, precisely because, in these small places, everyone knows everyone,\u201d Vittorio Milesi, the mayor of San Pellegrino Terme, told me.</p> <p>It is easy for city folk to dream of escaping to the countryside, as they seek safe hideaways from close physical contact or the claustrophobia of a locked-down city apartment. Viewed through this lens, rural towns seem like the bucolic, Zoom-connected work centres of the future. I understand how tempting it is to slip into such reveries. During Spain\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, I have been living near Candeleda, a town in the province of \u00c1vila, 100 miles west of Madrid and similar in size to Santo Domingo. I have enjoyed mountain views, flowering meadows and pure, fresh air. But I am also now familiar with the eerie experience of isolation within a normally tight-knit community. City friends are envious. In some ways they are right to be, but in others they are decidedly wrong. Nobody is safe from a global pandemic. Santo Domingo is proof of that.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Few countries have suffered as badly as Spain from Covid-19. In per-capita terms, it is believed to have the world\u2019s highest rate of deaths, according to a study of excess deaths from all causes <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b4c784e-c259-4ca4-9a82-648ffde71bf0?shareType=nongift\">by the Financial Times</a> \u2013 though Britain may soon overtake it. Some critics of Spain\u2019s leftwing coalition government have blamed the severity of the outbreak, in part, on the failure to cancel celebrations for International Women\u2019s Day on Sunday 8 March. Across Spain, at the end of a week that had seen the first coronavirus deaths reported in Madrid, the Basque country and Valencia, several million people took to the streets. Populists such as the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/23/wolf-pack-case-spain-feminism-far-right-vox\" title=\"\"> far-right party Vox</a> have accused prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez of putting feminist politics above public health, but Vox also held a mass meeting at a Madrid bullring that day. The truth is that few politicians took the threat of Covid-19 sufficiently seriously at first, and while some scientists were warning of impending danger, most people in Spain did not realise that the dramatic explosion of cases that began a few weeks before in Italy was just about to happen here as well.</p> <p>In Santo Domingo, there were already clues about what was to come. On 8 March, two elderly inhabitants, Mar\u00eda Isabel Aizpur\u00faa and Valent\u00edn P\u00e9rez, passed away \u2013 part of an unusual five-day spike in deaths. In that short period, six people died, seven times higher than could usually be expected in that time period. It\u2019s possible that Covid-19 had claimed lives in the town even before then. Two deaths recorded earlier in the month now look suspicious, though it\u2019s impossible to know the cause for certain. \u201cThe dead weren\u2019t being tested,\u201d said a doctor who dealt with some of them, but asked not to be named. \u201cSo who knows?\u201d</p> <p>When Jorge S\u00e1nchez, the former town councillor, tested positive for Covid-19 on 10 March, he posted a video online telling everyone. It was, he said, a way of trying to wake the town up to what was happening, and of combating the stigma associated with the disease. \u201cPeople were treating it as something shameful,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"211a2d49c85698a5a16adc1ce28e5833952977af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/211a2d49c85698a5a16adc1ce28e5833952977af/0_430_4625_3179/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plaza del Santo and the Cathedral of Santo Domingo de la Calzada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plaza del Santo and the Cathedral of Santo Domingo de la Calzada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Heusinkveld/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Santo Domingo lies on the famous pilgrim trail, the Camino de Santiago, which brings tens of thousands of international visitors through its cobbled streets and pebbled squares each year. Close to the centre of town, a stone\u2019s throw from the cathedral, is the town\u2019s only care home, the Hospital del Santo. On 11 March, doctors, nurses and family members \u2013 equipped with masks but little else to protect them \u2013 bustled around one of the home\u2019s ailing residents, 85-year-old Rosa Andr\u00e9s Rodrigo, in the hours before she died. She showed what we now see as classic Covid symptoms \u2013 a fever and shortness of breath \u2013 but which could also come from a winter flu. She died so quickly that there wasn\u2019t time to find out. \u201cAt that stage, we still didn\u2019t know,\u201d the care home manager, Sagrario Loza, told me, \u201cI myself was in there with just a mask on.\u201d</p> <p>Within a week, many of those who had tended to Rosa had contracted the coronavirus, including the care home\u2019s main doctor. \u201cShe was so weak she couldn\u2019t get out of bed,\u201d Cristina D\u00edaz, a pharmacist from a nearby village, who took meals to the doctor\u2019s house, told me. Like many care home workers, the doctor was on a short-term contract and low pay. (Take-home pay for Spanish care home doctors is around \u20ac1,600 per month, and just \u20ac1,400 for nurses.) When the doctor finally got better, her contract had already ended, so she took a job elsewhere. Soon almost half of the care home staff were ill as well.</p> <p>On 14 March, when S\u00e1nchez imposed a nationwide lockdown, he held up the country\u2019s elderly as a reason for acting, reminding Spaniards that it was the pension money of parents and grandparents that had prevented many families falling into destitution during the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cIn this crisis, they are the ones who need to be helped,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In Santo Domingo, people were only slowly registering the speed at which the disease was spreading. On 17 March, a group of elderly Hospital del Santo residents sat around a table, dipping brushes into brightly coloured paints to make a rainbow poster with a reassuring message. \u201cWe are all fine,\u201d it read. They hung the poster from a balcony and sent a photograph to <a href=\"https://www.larioja.com/la-rioja/coronavirus/fundacion-hospital-santo-20200406152737-nt.html?ref=https:%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F\" title=\"\">La Rioja newspaper</a>.</p> <p>A week later, with care home deaths rising across Spain, a team from the military emergency unit \u2013 wearing white, hood-to-toe protection suits \u2013 were sent to inspect the Hospital del Santo. They helped to reorganise the centre into different zones, and returned daily to teach staff safety protocols, disinfect corridors and clean out the rooms of the dead. \u201cTheir work was tremendously important to us,\u201d Loza told me. Tests eventually showed 37 of the 65 residents \u2013 including five elderly nuns, living in their own wing \u2013 had Covid-19. Remarkably, most survived. Loza says there were five confirmed Covid-19 deaths, and suspects the disease was responsible for four more. \u201cWe can\u2019t say when it started,\u201d she said. Elsewhere in the country, military units <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52014023\" title=\"\">were discovering</a> care home residents \u201ccompletely abandoned, sometimes even dead in their beds\u201d, the defence minister Margarita Robles told reporters. In Madrid, almost one in seven care home residents has died \u2013 nearly 6,000 people, according to state broadcaster RTVE.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f077afc29c8817fb6cdaa1e5e2b4975ba30925a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f077afc29c8817fb6cdaa1e5e2b4975ba30925a/0_0_3648_2432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez (centre) and colleagues observing a minute\u2019s silence at the start of Spain\u2019s 10 days of national mourning, 27 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez (centre) and colleagues observing a minute\u2019s silence at the start of Spain\u2019s 10 days of national mourning, 27 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Calvo/LA MONCLOA/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Spain\u2019s health services are run by its 17 regional governments, which have each handled the pandemic in their own way \u2013 some choosing to release detailed data, others withholding it. La Rioja is a semi-autonomous region, with a population of just 315,000 and one of the highest living standards in Spain. Between March and late May, it recorded 4,052 cases and 361 deaths, making it Spain\u2019s third-worst region in per-capita terms, but the regional government has refused to produce a town-by-town breakdown of deaths \u2013 a stance that has encouraged people such as Due\u00f1as to see a conspiracy of silence. At daily press briefings in Logro\u00f1o on 21 and 22 March, questions from La Rioja newspaper about Santo Domingo were batted away, even as evidence was mounting that the town was suffering a particularly severe outbreak of Covid-19. \u201cThe government\u2019s spokeswoman, Chus del R\u00edo, basically answered that there was no point in talking about individual local outbreaks because the whole of La Rioja was affected,\u201d the newspaper reported.</p> <p>On the town\u2019s main Facebook group, which began life as a place to post fond childhood memories of schoolteachers, shopkeepers, nuns and priests, there was outrage. Why weren\u2019t they being told? How many had really died? \u201cDo they think we are stupid? We live here, we can all see what is happening,\u201d complained one group member. A spokesman for La Rioja\u2019s regional government told me that the decision not to give details from specific towns was to prevent them being stigmatised. But withholding information also prevented more searching questions about exactly why Santo Domingo was suffering so badly \u2013 and whether more could be done to save its residents.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Lockdown has meant different things in different places. Spain\u2019s has been among the strictest, and was no less strictly observed in the countryside than in cities. Outdoor exercise was banned and children under the age of 13 were not allowed to leave home for 45 days. Some Spaniards embraced the restrictions with <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-lockdown-snitches-thrive-in-europe-reports-watchmen-spying-neighbors/\" title=\"\">inquisitorial fervour</a>. The media began using the phrase \u201cbalcony police\u201d to describe people who hurled insults at passersby who seemed to be breaking lockdown rules. In Madrid, even medical staff on their way to work were sometimes pelted with eggs. This was not just a city thing. In Santo Domingo, too, people complained about the zeal of these \u201cwindow cops\u201d. In some rural towns, including both Santo Domingo and Candeleda where I\u2019m living, the lockdown was enforced not only by residents and police, but also army patrol units.</p> <p>Rural lockdown has certain advantages. In Candeleda, in mid-March, I had a conversation \u2013 shouted from one field to another \u2013 with a neighbour who was counting his cattle. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be alright here,\u201d he roared. \u201cIf necessary, we can just kill a pig or barter our vegetables.\u201d Rural subsistence was suddenly an advantage, and people knew it. As weeks went by, I watched wild flowers paint the valley with streaks of red, yellow and purple. I saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/30/boar-wars-how-wild-hogs-are-trashing-european-cities\" title=\"\">wild boar</a> and otters scurry through fields occupied by sheep, cattle and horses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1b7cfb23c0260864ba83e5794661073dd83fc267\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b7cfb23c0260864ba83e5794661073dd83fc267/0_0_4340_2878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pilgrims walking the Camino de Santiago, which runs through Santo Domingo de la Calzada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pilgrims walking the Camino de Santiago, which runs through Santo Domingo de la Calzada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But this was no idyll. The internet kept me, and the rest of the town, hooked on the minute-by-minute narrative of death. There were still loved ones to fret about. The countryside was strangely still and hushed. There were no clanking tractors, petrol-powered bush-cutters, jangling goat bells, braying mules or cussing herdsmen. Most of the local farmers live in town, and could only leave to feed livestock. I even missed things that normally bothered me. Distant traffic and overhead flights \u2013 tiny pinpricks of moving light in the night sky \u2013 disappeared. I was too far away from town to share the evening applause for health workers that boosted morale and upheld the sense of community.</p> <p>Just like in cities, loneliness hit people hard. My closest neighbour, Santi, is a self-sufficient countryman in his mid-70s. He moved in near to me a decade ago, doing up his small barn. Santi is a man who needs to talk. Before lockdown, most days he would have coffee at the petrol station cafe and, later, take a walk up the river with friends. Now these were forbidden. \u201cIf you don\u2019t speak, you start forgetting how,\u201d he said after finding another reason to appear at my gate. Sometimes he sat on a nearby rock for an hour, waiting for some company.</p> <p>Santi has a fine sense of humour and I was grateful for his easy laugh, even as I fretted about how far a virus might travel on the wind. Whenever we spoke of someone dying, he shrugged. \u201cPeople have always died,\u201d he said. But his health isn\u2019t good and he was also scared. On his visits into town, the grocer and baker made him stay in his car while they put his food in the boot. There was no chatting. Isolation is isolation, wherever you are.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In Santo Domingo de La Calzada, the dead included Gregorio S\u00e1ez, a well-known figure in a town where the Catholic church plays a central role. The 83-year-old was prior of the lay Brotherhood of Saint Isidore the Farmer, which parades an image of their saint around town during its May fiestas. Santo Domingo\u2019s five brotherhoods, or cofrad\u00edas, are an essential part of local life. Some date back almost to the town\u2019s founding by the 11th century shepherd-hermit, Saint Dominic of the Causeway, after whom the town is named.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot understand Santo Domingo without its saint,\u201d Francisco Su\u00e1rez, the cathedral\u2019s abbot, told me. In his lifetime, the saint helped to build bridges, roads and shelter for pilgrims travelling to the tomb of Saint James in Santiago de Compostela, about 300 miles west. (Santo Domingo is patron saint of Spain\u2019s civil engineers.) Work on Santo Domingo\u2019s cathedral began in the 12th century, and the town has been a stopping point for pilgrims ever since. Today, much of the local economy revolves around the dozen hostels and hotels that offer hundreds of rooms to pilgrims.</p> <p>Such towns are not used to tragedy. In normal times, the most dramatic events that local reporter Javier Albo, a one-man newsroom, covers are minor car crashes. Skimming through La Rioja\u2019s local pages from March and April 2019, the most noteworthy stories concerned a modest swarm of bees and a few complaints about a \u201cplague\u201d of pigeons invading the town.</p> <p>During the strictest phase of lockdown, residents of Santo Domingo tried to keep up their spirits. The police began driving around town in the evening and stopping every few blocks to blast music from their loudhailers and exchange applause with people on balconies. This ritual was briefly suspended after complaints that it was unsuitable at a time of tragedy, but soon it started up again. People loved the shows, which filled the emptiness with noise and coloured lights. Eventually, it turned into a caravan of municipal police cars, ambulances, civil protection and street-cleaning vehicles, which set out at 8pm and drove around for two hours with sirens blaring and loud music mangled by tinny speakers. Like any party, the music depended on who took control of the sound system: some days it was corny Spanish pop or children\u2019s tunes, other days it was AC/DC.</p> <p>\u201cPeople started asking if we could do something for their kids\u2019 birthdays, so we did that too \u2013 playing Happy Birthday,\u201d Francisco Reina, one of the town\u2019s dozen municipal cops told me. \u201cThen a local baker offered to make them cakes, so we delivered those. We even got out and danced La Macarena.\u201d Reina kept going even after his wife joined the sick and took to her bed. \u201cWe surprised one couple on their golden anniversary, playing the wedding march,\u201d he said. \u201cThat man wept.\u201d Now the police station is full of brightly painted children\u2019s pictures, sent in thanks.</p> <p>The only visible signs of the pandemic scything its way through the town were the muted to-and-fro of ambulances and hearses making daytime trips down empty streets to collect the infected and the dead. Reina and his colleagues rescued the very sick from apartments, helped ambulance crews, and took food to those who couldn\u2019t shop. There was also anger. Posters appeared in windows and on balconies. \u201cWe want tests,\u201d they read.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bad010d36cbab28e06a548a9e5619f75412c4c5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bad010d36cbab28e06a548a9e5619f75412c4c5e/0_88_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People in Logro\u00f1o, the regional capital of La Rioja, protesting against the government\u2019s management of the coronavirus pandemic, May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People in Logro\u00f1o, the regional capital of La Rioja, protesting against the government\u2019s management of the coronavirus pandemic, May 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raquel Manzanares/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps the most disturbing thing was that Santo Domingo could not mourn its dead. In a small town like this, packed with relatives, friends and acquaintances, hundreds may be expected at the velatorio \u2013 the 24-hour wake with the body on display \u2013 or the later funeral mass. A local group called I Like Santo Domingo lobbied for the cathedral bells, which are housed in their own baroque tower, to be rung in honour of the dead. On the evening of 22 March they chimed solemnly for two minutes as people stood silently at windows or on balconies \u2013 a tradition repeated every Monday over the following weeks. It was, at least, a communal mourning. \u201cThat was really important to the families,\u201d said the journalist Albo, who doubles as the group\u2019s president. \u201cAt least they felt that people were supporting them in their grief.\u201d</p> <p>Otherwise, the pandemic was measured in absences. It wasn\u2019t just that the streets were empty and the pilgrims gone, or that the dead were being carried off. Easter went by without its processions of religious statues. The Virgin Mary and the Risen Christ remained on their pedestals in the cathedral. The weeping notes of a trumpet saeta, an Easter tradition that once inspired a Miles Davis recording, had to be performed from the soloist\u2019s apartment balcony.</p> <p>On 10 May, the town began five days of fiestas to honour its saint. The following day, as those parts of Spain where infection rates had dropped were allowed to slowly ease restrictions, people were finally released from their houses. The only group event permitted in this still-limited first phase, however, was mass. The cathedral\u2019s wooden benches were replaced with plastic chairs, dotted at safe distances. After a trial run on 11 May, with just 17 people, seven masses were held the following day. Between each service, the cathedral was disinfected.</p> <p>The highlight of the fiestas is the spectacular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/may/14/the-20-photographs-of-the-week#img-13\" title=\"\">procession of the Doncellas</a>, when three dozen young women in long white dresses and veils carry baskets of bread covered with white linen on their heads. Like everything else, this was cancelled. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if we can do it later in the year,\u201d the abbot told me. Not since 1943, when the town suffered a typhus outbreak, had anything similar happened.</p> <p>But, with neighbouring towns suffering much less, some people had a burning question: where had the virus come from?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Given religion\u2019s central role in Santo Domingo de la Calzada, it is not surprising that some blamed the church. On 17 February, a group of 46 parishioners had set out by coach to visit Rome and Florence. They took a bottle of rioja wine for Pope Francis and, after meeting the Vatican official Cardinal Mauro Piacenza, came back with the promise of plenary indulgence for visitors to Saint Dominic\u2019s tomb over the next seven years. The measure, which remits the need to purge sins and thereby avoid tortures in purgatory, was a way of prolonging the 2019 celebrations for the saint\u2019s 1,000th birthday.</p> <p>Did the parishioners also bring back the virus? Italy, after all, is where Covid-19 began its rampage across Europe, and the group returned via northern Italy on 22 February, just as the first cases were being reported there. Many people in Santo Domingo, including one of the local doctors I spoke to, assume the virus came with them. Due\u00f1as has been the most vocal accuser. \u201cOf course they brought it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the church is too powerful to criticise.\u201d</p> <p>Abbot Su\u00e1rez, who led the trip, is incensed by the accusation that his group is responsible for bringing the disease to Santo Domingo. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete lie. The most stupid thing anybody could say,\u201d he told me. He noted that only one of the group \u2013 the prior of the Saint Isidore brotherhood, Gregorio Saez \u2013 had died of Covid-19, \u201cand the family think he caught it in hospital\u201d.</p> <p>Blame and stigma were part of La Rioja\u2019s experience of the pandemic from the very start. The region\u2019s first recorded cases, in the wine town of Haro, 12 miles north of Santo Domingo, appeared among members of its Roma community, who have been made into scapegoats many times in Spanish history. On 24 February, community members attended a funeral in the Basque city of Vitoria, which became one of Spain\u2019s first known contagion points.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"41a9c98a8de9c5e7463d633d923be6042012aaf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41a9c98a8de9c5e7463d633d923be6042012aaf0/0_0_4225_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Empty streets in Haro, another small town near Santo Domingo, in early March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Empty streets in Haro, another small town near Santo Domingo, in early March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ander Gillenea/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The civil guard\u2019s toughest unit \u2013 the Logro\u00f1o-based rapid action group \u2013 was sent to Haro to hand out quarantine notices to those who had been there. Conservative media published false tales of virus-carrying Roma from Haro sneaking out of hospitals. Local websites and newspapers even published names and medical records of those allegedly infected. \u201cA lot of lies were told, and people were bombarded with threatening messages,\u201d Silvia Ag\u00fcero, a Roma activist and writer in La Rioja, told me.</p> <p>La Rioja\u2019s rationale for not sharing death figures for towns (or health districts) was precisely to avoid this kind of stigma. \u201cWe\u2019ve never talked about ethnicity, or given information about individuals with Covid,\u201d Alvaro Ruidez, a spokesman for La Rioja\u2019s health service, told me. But the examples of Haro and Santo Domingo show that, if anything, the lack of information provided fertile ground for malicious rumours. \u201cIn fact, knowing this would have made people take it still more seriously,\u201d one of the town\u2019s sharpest observers, who asked not to be named, told me. When I spoke to mayor Milesi of San Pellegrino Terme in Bergamo, he said transparency was crucial to the town\u2019s wellbeing and to its future recovery. Spain, meanwhile, still lacks official municipal data, not just for Santo Domingo but for other hard-hit rural provinces such as Cuenca, Segovia and Soria.</p> <p>Jorge S\u00e1nchez believes the virus entered town from several directions at once. Ricardo Velasco, head of La Rioja\u2019s local health districts, points to the Camino de Santiago itself, often described as the oldest tourist trail in Europe, as a possible source. Its popularity has increased tenfold over two decades, attracting 352,000 pilgrims last year. Half of them follow the so-called \u201cFrench route\u201d, which goes through Santo Domingo. Visitor numbers fall dramatically in February and March, \u201cbut even in these months there are thousands,\u201d Velasco told me. The visitors are from all over the world. \u201cThey come in groups, so suddenly you may have a lot of Italians, and another day it\u2019s a group of Koreans,\u201d says Rafael Crespo, a doctor who serves half a dozen small villages close to Santo Domingo.</p> <p>The camino brings in money and shapes local identity. During the 11 centuries that the route has existed, only wars and natural disasters have closed it. Shutting it down, in other words, means the world has changed utterly. As Covid-19 has spread, people everywhere have, at some stage, been slow to accept that. In early March, local doctors had lobbied for part of the route to be closed, but this didn\u2019t happen until the nationwide lockdown was imposed.</p> <p>Other towns on the pilgrimage route do not seem to have suffered as badly as Santo Domingo. The mayor of neighbouring Belorado, \u00c1lvaro Egu\u00edluz, told me he did not want to blame its own moderately large Covid-19 outbreak on either pilgrims or people from Santo Domingo. \u201cIf we start doing that,\u201d he said, \u201cit will never end.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>\u2018No government in the world or in any autonomous region can claim to have got everything right,\u201d prime minister S\u00e1nchez said at the end of April, admitting that he himself could have done better. It was a refreshingly honest comment. People such as Due\u00f1as are right to complain about the lack of transparency, but there is no sign of other major mistakes in Santo Domingo that are not widely shared elsewhere.</p> <p>In three months, we have learned a lot. It is notable that the rural black spots in Spain and Italy are places that combine the intimacy of small Mediterranean communities with proximity to the highways of global travel and business. (San Pellegrino Terme, for example, gives its name to a brand of fizzy water sold around the world, but also welcomes tourists to its thermal baths.) Normally, for those places, that is a happy mix. When a virus strikes, it can prove deadly. The connection between Covid-19 and travel is especially grave for Spain, a country where tourism generates 12% of GDP. Only the boldest pilgrims, for example, will pass through Santo Domingo this summer, which will be devastating to locals who depend on their custom.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/24/italy-home-schooling-coronavirus-lockdown-what-weve-learned\">Italian lessons: what we've learned from two months of home schooling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Spain, the lockdown is being eased slowly, in a careful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/lockdown-easing-have-other-leaders-fared-better-than-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">four-stage</a> process that will take up to two months to complete.

      "bodyText": "When we first spoke, in mid-April, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Due\u00f1as began weeping within seconds. Her parents\u2019 home town, Santo Domingo de La Calzada, had the worst death rate from coronavirus in Spain, she told me on the phone. \u201cI\u2019m so scared,\u201d she said. Due\u00f1as told stories of police clambering through windows to rescue the dying, who were too weak to open their doors. Regional politicians, meanwhile, refused to give town-by-town figures for the dead, stoking anxiety and encouraging conspiracy theories. Santo Domingo\u2019s locked-down residents, she claimed, were being deliberately kept in the dark as the virus silently stalked the town. Due\u00f1as does not live in Santo Domingo, a town of 6,300 people set among patchwork fields of cereal crops in the northern Spanish region of La Rioja. She was born there, but now lives 28 miles away in Logro\u00f1o, the capital of this wealthy region, best known for the rich red wines that bear its name. Her angry, sometimes wildly conspiratorial outbursts on local Facebook groups \u2013 some of which have been deleted against her will \u2013 mean not all her old neighbours will welcome her back. If Covid-19 increases tensions among neighbours in big cities, it can produce poisonous outbreaks of mistrust in small, more insular places like Santo Domingo. By the time Due\u00f1as and I spoke again, two weeks later, the abbot from the town\u2019s small cathedral had lodged a complaint against her for defamation. (She had claimed the church was covering up the role it had played in spreading the virus.) Even members of her own family were livid at the way she had aired Santo Domingo\u2019s sorry status as one of Spain\u2019s worst Covid-19 disaster zones. Due\u00f1as suggested I call Jorge S\u00e1nchez, a former town councillor and a well-known local figure, to get a sense of the scale of the disaster. On 9 March, he had met with a couple of friends, Enrique Ortega and Aldo Muga, at Muga\u2019s bar. They had chatted about Ortega\u2019s upcoming 51st birthday. \u201cNow I am the only one left alive,\u201d S\u00e1nchez told me. All three caught the disease, and the other two men both died at a hospital in Logro\u00f1o on 21 March. As news spread through town that I was trying to count the dead, I received a call from town councillor Diego Mendiola. He confirmed that regional officials were refusing to give precise figures for Covid-19 deaths in Santo Domingo. All that residents could do was try to keep a tally. While we spoke, Mendiola stopped to read an incoming WhatsApp message. \u201cThat\u2019s another one,\u201d he said. In recent months, television pictures have shown us the empty streets of the world\u2019s great metropolises \u2013 of Madrid, London, New York, Milan. All have suffered badly. But outside the confined spaces of care homes and cruise ships, Covid-19 has been at its most lethal in a handful of southern European country towns. In Santo Domingo, without sufficient data from the regional government, it has fallen to residents to make their own estimates. Based on the number of messages he has received from parishioners asking for deceased loved ones to be mentioned in mass, the abbot, Francisco Su\u00e1rez, now believes 42 people died in the six weeks after 16 March. It is impossible to know exactly how many were killed by Covid-19, as opposed to other causes, but a reasonable, possibly conservative, estimate \u2013 based on multiple sources including newspaper death columns, funeral home websites and interviews with the head of the region\u2019s local health districts \u2013 would be 35. That may not sound like much in the context of a pandemic, but to get a sense of how shocking this figure is, it\u2019s worth comparing it to the death rate in the world\u2019s worst-affected major cities. London had 86 deaths per 100,000 by mid-April (and is now likely past 100), the Madrid region was at 131 in mid-May, and New York City is currently 201. The equivalent figure for Santo Domingo would be 550. Only the northern Italian province of Bergamo has experienced something similar. Towns such as San Pellegrino Terme and San Giovanni Bianco have the highest death rates of all, at around or above 1,000 per 100,000 from all causes during the worst weeks. \u201cThe pain becomes communal, precisely because, in these small places, everyone knows everyone,\u201d Vittorio Milesi, the mayor of San Pellegrino Terme, told me. It is easy for city folk to dream of escaping to the countryside, as they seek safe hideaways from close physical contact or the claustrophobia of a locked-down city apartment. Viewed through this lens, rural towns seem like the bucolic, Zoom-connected work centres of the future. I understand how tempting it is to slip into such reveries. During Spain\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, I have been living near Candeleda, a town in the province of \u00c1vila, 100 miles west of Madrid and similar in size to Santo Domingo. I have enjoyed mountain views, flowering meadows and pure, fresh air. But I am also now familiar with the eerie experience of isolation within a normally tight-knit community. City friends are envious. In some ways they are right to be, but in others they are decidedly wrong. Nobody is safe from a global pandemic. Santo Domingo is proof of that. * * * Few countries have suffered as badly as Spain from Covid-19. In per-capita terms, it is believed to have the world\u2019s highest rate of deaths, according to a study of excess deaths from all causes by the Financial Times \u2013 though Britain may soon overtake it. Some critics of Spain\u2019s leftwing coalition government have blamed the severity of the outbreak, in part, on the failure to cancel celebrations for International Women\u2019s Day on Sunday 8 March. Across Spain, at the end of a week that had seen the first coronavirus deaths reported in Madrid, the Basque country and Valencia, several million people took to the streets. Populists such as the far-right party Vox have accused prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez of putting feminist politics above public health, but Vox also held a mass meeting at a Madrid bullring that day. The truth is that few politicians took the threat of Covid-19 sufficiently seriously at first, and while some scientists were warning of impending danger, most people in Spain did not realise that the dramatic explosion of cases that began a few weeks before in Italy was just about to happen here as well. In Santo Domingo, there were already clues about what was to come. On 8 March, two elderly inhabitants, Mar\u00eda Isabel Aizpur\u00faa and Valent\u00edn P\u00e9rez, passed away \u2013 part of an unusual five-day spike in deaths. In that short period, six people died, seven times higher than could usually be expected in that time period. It\u2019s possible that Covid-19 had claimed lives in the town even before then. Two deaths recorded earlier in the month now look suspicious, though it\u2019s impossible to know the cause for certain. \u201cThe dead weren\u2019t being tested,\u201d said a doctor who dealt with some of them, but asked not to be named. \u201cSo who knows?\u201d When Jorge S\u00e1nchez, the former town councillor, tested positive for Covid-19 on 10 March, he posted a video online telling everyone. It was, he said, a way of trying to wake the town up to what was happening, and of combating the stigma associated with the disease. \u201cPeople were treating it as something shameful,\u201d he said. Santo Domingo lies on the famous pilgrim trail, the Camino de Santiago, which brings tens of thousands of international visitors through its cobbled streets and pebbled squares each year. Close to the centre of town, a stone\u2019s throw from the cathedral, is the town\u2019s only care home, the Hospital del Santo. On 11 March, doctors, nurses and family members \u2013 equipped with masks but little else to protect them \u2013 bustled around one of the home\u2019s ailing residents, 85-year-old Rosa Andr\u00e9s Rodrigo, in the hours before she died. She showed what we now see as classic Covid symptoms \u2013 a fever and shortness of breath \u2013 but which could also come from a winter flu. She died so quickly that there wasn\u2019t time to find out. \u201cAt that stage, we still didn\u2019t know,\u201d the care home manager, Sagrario Loza, told me, \u201cI myself was in there with just a mask on.\u201d Within a week, many of those who had tended to Rosa had contracted the coronavirus, including the care home\u2019s main doctor. \u201cShe was so weak she couldn\u2019t get out of bed,\u201d Cristina D\u00edaz, a pharmacist from a nearby village, who took meals to the doctor\u2019s house, told me. Like many care home workers, the doctor was on a short-term contract and low pay. (Take-home pay for Spanish care home doctors is around \u20ac1,600 per month, and just \u20ac1,400 for nurses.) When the doctor finally got better, her contract had already ended, so she took a job elsewhere. Soon almost half of the care home staff were ill as well. On 14 March, when S\u00e1nchez imposed a nationwide lockdown, he held up the country\u2019s elderly as a reason for acting, reminding Spaniards that it was the pension money of parents and grandparents that had prevented many families falling into destitution during the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cIn this crisis, they are the ones who need to be helped,\u201d he said. In Santo Domingo, people were only slowly registering the speed at which the disease was spreading. On 17 March, a group of elderly Hospital del Santo residents sat around a table, dipping brushes into brightly coloured paints to make a rainbow poster with a reassuring message. \u201cWe are all fine,\u201d it read. They hung the poster from a balcony and sent a photograph to La Rioja newspaper. A week later, with care home deaths rising across Spain, a team from the military emergency unit \u2013 wearing white, hood-to-toe protection suits \u2013 were sent to inspect the Hospital del Santo. They helped to reorganise the centre into different zones, and returned daily to teach staff safety protocols, disinfect corridors and clean out the rooms of the dead. \u201cTheir work was tremendously important to us,\u201d Loza told me. Tests eventually showed 37 of the 65 residents \u2013 including five elderly nuns, living in their own wing \u2013 had Covid-19. Remarkably, most survived. Loza says there were five confirmed Covid-19 deaths, and suspects the disease was responsible for four more. \u201cWe can\u2019t say when it started,\u201d she said. Elsewhere in the country, military units were discovering care home residents \u201ccompletely abandoned, sometimes even dead in their beds\u201d, the defence minister Margarita Robles told reporters. In Madrid, almost one in seven care home residents has died \u2013 nearly 6,000 people, according to state broadcaster RTVE. Spain\u2019s health services are run by its 17 regional governments, which have each handled the pandemic in their own way \u2013 some choosing to release detailed data, others withholding it. La Rioja is a semi-autonomous region, with a population of just 315,000 and one of the highest living standards in Spain. Between March and late May, it recorded 4,052 cases and 361 deaths, making it Spain\u2019s third-worst region in per-capita terms, but the regional government has refused to produce a town-by-town breakdown of deaths \u2013 a stance that has encouraged people such as Due\u00f1as to see a conspiracy of silence. At daily press briefings in Logro\u00f1o on 21 and 22 March, questions from La Rioja newspaper about Santo Domingo were batted away, even as evidence was mounting that the town was suffering a particularly severe outbreak of Covid-19. \u201cThe government\u2019s spokeswoman, Chus del R\u00edo, basically answered that there was no point in talking about individual local outbreaks because the whole of La Rioja was affected,\u201d the newspaper reported. On the town\u2019s main Facebook group, which began life as a place to post fond childhood memories of schoolteachers, shopkeepers, nuns and priests, there was outrage. Why weren\u2019t they being told? How many had really died? \u201cDo they think we are stupid? We live here, we can all see what is happening,\u201d complained one group member. A spokesman for La Rioja\u2019s regional government told me that the decision not to give details from specific towns was to prevent them being stigmatised. But withholding information also prevented more searching questions about exactly why Santo Domingo was suffering so badly \u2013 and whether more could be done to save its residents. * * * Lockdown has meant different things in different places. Spain\u2019s has been among the strictest, and was no less strictly observed in the countryside than in cities. Outdoor exercise was banned and children under the age of 13 were not allowed to leave home for 45 days. Some Spaniards embraced the restrictions with inquisitorial fervour. The media began using the phrase \u201cbalcony police\u201d to describe people who hurled insults at passersby who seemed to be breaking lockdown rules. In Madrid, even medical staff on their way to work were sometimes pelted with eggs. This was not just a city thing. In Santo Domingo, too, people complained about the zeal of these \u201cwindow cops\u201d. In some rural towns, including both Santo Domingo and Candeleda where I\u2019m living, the lockdown was enforced not only by residents and police, but also army patrol units. Rural lockdown has certain advantages. In Candeleda, in mid-March, I had a conversation \u2013 shouted from one field to another \u2013 with a neighbour who was counting his cattle. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be alright here,\u201d he roared. \u201cIf necessary, we can just kill a pig or barter our vegetables.\u201d Rural subsistence was suddenly an advantage, and people knew it. As weeks went by, I watched wild flowers paint the valley with streaks of red, yellow and purple. I saw wild boar and otters scurry through fields occupied by sheep, cattle and horses. But this was no idyll. The internet kept me, and the rest of the town, hooked on the minute-by-minute narrative of death. There were still loved ones to fret about. The countryside was strangely still and hushed. There were no clanking tractors, petrol-powered bush-cutters, jangling goat bells, braying mules or cussing herdsmen. Most of the local farmers live in town, and could only leave to feed livestock. I even missed things that normally bothered me. Distant traffic and overhead flights \u2013 tiny pinpricks of moving light in the night sky \u2013 disappeared. I was too far away from town to share the evening applause for health workers that boosted morale and upheld the sense of community. Just like in cities, loneliness hit people hard. My closest neighbour, Santi, is a self-sufficient countryman in his mid-70s. He moved in near to me a decade ago, doing up his small barn. Santi is a man who needs to talk. Before lockdown, most days he would have coffee at the petrol station cafe and, later, take a walk up the river with friends. Now these were forbidden. \u201cIf you don\u2019t speak, you start forgetting how,\u201d he said after finding another reason to appear at my gate. Sometimes he sat on a nearby rock for an hour, waiting for some company. Santi has a fine sense of humour and I was grateful for his easy laugh, even as I fretted about how far a virus might travel on the wind. Whenever we spoke of someone dying, he shrugged. \u201cPeople have always died,\u201d he said. But his health isn\u2019t good and he was also scared. On his visits into town, the grocer and baker made him stay in his car while they put his food in the boot. There was no chatting. Isolation is isolation, wherever you are. * * * In Santo Domingo de La Calzada, the dead included Gregorio S\u00e1ez, a well-known figure in a town where the Catholic church plays a central role. The 83-year-old was prior of the lay Brotherhood of Saint Isidore the Farmer, which parades an image of their saint around town during its May fiestas. Santo Domingo\u2019s five brotherhoods, or cofrad\u00edas, are an essential part of local life. Some date back almost to the town\u2019s founding by the 11th century shepherd-hermit, Saint Dominic of the Causeway, after whom the town is named. \u201cYou cannot understand Santo Domingo without its saint,\u201d Francisco Su\u00e1rez, the cathedral\u2019s abbot, told me. In his lifetime, the saint helped to build bridges, roads and shelter for pilgrims travelling to the tomb of Saint James in Santiago de Compostela, about 300 miles west. (Santo Domingo is patron saint of Spain\u2019s civil engineers.) Work on Santo Domingo\u2019s cathedral began in the 12th century, and the town has been a stopping point for pilgrims ever since. Today, much of the local economy revolves around the dozen hostels and hotels that offer hundreds of rooms to pilgrims. Such towns are not used to tragedy. In normal times, the most dramatic events that local reporter Javier Albo, a one-man newsroom, covers are minor car crashes. Skimming through La Rioja\u2019s local pages from March and April 2019, the most noteworthy stories concerned a modest swarm of bees and a few complaints about a \u201cplague\u201d of pigeons invading the town. During the strictest phase of lockdown, residents of Santo Domingo tried to keep up their spirits. The police began driving around town in the evening and stopping every few blocks to blast music from their loudhailers and exchange applause with people on balconies. This ritual was briefly suspended after complaints that it was unsuitable at a time of tragedy, but soon it started up again. People loved the shows, which filled the emptiness with noise and coloured lights. Eventually, it turned into a caravan of municipal police cars, ambulances, civil protection and street-cleaning vehicles, which set out at 8pm and drove around for two hours with sirens blaring and loud music mangled by tinny speakers. Like any party, the music depended on who took control of the sound system: some days it was corny Spanish pop or children\u2019s tunes, other days it was AC/DC. \u201cPeople started asking if we could do something for their kids\u2019 birthdays, so we did that too \u2013 playing Happy Birthday,\u201d Francisco Reina, one of the town\u2019s dozen municipal cops told me. \u201cThen a local baker offered to make them cakes, so we delivered those. We even got out and danced La Macarena.\u201d Reina kept going even after his wife joined the sick and took to her bed. \u201cWe surprised one couple on their golden anniversary, playing the wedding march,\u201d he said. \u201cThat man wept.\u201d Now the police station is full of brightly painted children\u2019s pictures, sent in thanks. The only visible signs of the pandemic scything its way through the town were the muted to-and-fro of ambulances and hearses making daytime trips down empty streets to collect the infected and the dead. Reina and his colleagues rescued the very sick from apartments, helped ambulance crews, and took food to those who couldn\u2019t shop. There was also anger. Posters appeared in windows and on balconies. \u201cWe want tests,\u201d they read. Perhaps the most disturbing thing was that Santo Domingo could not mourn its dead. In a small town like this, packed with relatives, friends and acquaintances, hundreds may be expected at the velatorio \u2013 the 24-hour wake with the body on display \u2013 or the later funeral mass. A local group called I Like Santo Domingo lobbied for the cathedral bells, which are housed in their own baroque tower, to be rung in honour of the dead. On the evening of 22 March they chimed solemnly for two minutes as people stood silently at windows or on balconies \u2013 a tradition repeated every Monday over the following weeks. It was, at least, a communal mourning. \u201cThat was really important to the families,\u201d said the journalist Albo, who doubles as the group\u2019s president. \u201cAt least they felt that people were supporting them in their grief.\u201d Otherwise, the pandemic was measured in absences. It wasn\u2019t just that the streets were empty and the pilgrims gone, or that the dead were being carried off. Easter went by without its processions of religious statues. The Virgin Mary and the Risen Christ remained on their pedestals in the cathedral. The weeping notes of a trumpet saeta, an Easter tradition that once inspired a Miles Davis recording, had to be performed from the soloist\u2019s apartment balcony. On 10 May, the town began five days of fiestas to honour its saint. The following day, as those parts of Spain where infection rates had dropped were allowed to slowly ease restrictions, people were finally released from their houses. The only group event permitted in this still-limited first phase, however, was mass. The cathedral\u2019s wooden benches were replaced with plastic chairs, dotted at safe distances. After a trial run on 11 May, with just 17 people, seven masses were held the following day. Between each service, the cathedral was disinfected. The highlight of the fiestas is the spectacular procession of the Doncellas, when three dozen young women in long white dresses and veils carry baskets of bread covered with white linen on their heads. Like everything else, this was cancelled. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if we can do it later in the year,\u201d the abbot told me. Not since 1943, when the town suffered a typhus outbreak, had anything similar happened. But, with neighbouring towns suffering much less, some people had a burning question: where had the virus come from? * * * Given religion\u2019s central role in Santo Domingo de la Calzada, it is not surprising that some blamed the church. On 17 February, a group of 46 parishioners had set out by coach to visit Rome and Florence. They took a bottle of rioja wine for Pope Francis and, after meeting the Vatican official Cardinal Mauro Piacenza, came back with the promise of plenary indulgence for visitors to Saint Dominic\u2019s tomb over the next seven years. The measure, which remits the need to purge sins and thereby avoid tortures in purgatory, was a way of prolonging the 2019 celebrations for the saint\u2019s 1,000th birthday. Did the parishioners also bring back the virus? Italy, after all, is where Covid-19 began its rampage across Europe, and the group returned via northern Italy on 22 February, just as the first cases were being reported there. Many people in Santo Domingo, including one of the local doctors I spoke to, assume the virus came with them. Due\u00f1as has been the most vocal accuser. \u201cOf course they brought it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the church is too powerful to criticise.\u201d Abbot Su\u00e1rez, who led the trip, is incensed by the accusation that his group is responsible for bringing the disease to Santo Domingo. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete lie. The most stupid thing anybody could say,\u201d he told me. He noted that only one of the group \u2013 the prior of the Saint Isidore brotherhood, Gregorio Saez \u2013 had died of Covid-19, \u201cand the family think he caught it in hospital\u201d. Blame and stigma were part of La Rioja\u2019s experience of the pandemic from the very start. The region\u2019s first recorded cases, in the wine town of Haro, 12 miles north of Santo Domingo, appeared among members of its Roma community, who have been made into scapegoats many times in Spanish history. On 24 February, community members attended a funeral in the Basque city of Vitoria, which became one of Spain\u2019s first known contagion points. The civil guard\u2019s toughest unit \u2013 the Logro\u00f1o-based rapid action group \u2013 was sent to Haro to hand out quarantine notices to those who had been there. Conservative media published false tales of virus-carrying Roma from Haro sneaking out of hospitals. Local websites and newspapers even published names and medical records of those allegedly infected. \u201cA lot of lies were told, and people were bombarded with threatening messages,\u201d Silvia Ag\u00fcero, a Roma activist and writer in La Rioja, told me. La Rioja\u2019s rationale for not sharing death figures for towns (or health districts) was precisely to avoid this kind of stigma. \u201cWe\u2019ve never talked about ethnicity, or given information about individuals with Covid,\u201d Alvaro Ruidez, a spokesman for La Rioja\u2019s health service, told me. But the examples of Haro and Santo Domingo show that, if anything, the lack of information provided fertile ground for malicious rumours. \u201cIn fact, knowing this would have made people take it still more seriously,\u201d one of the town\u2019s sharpest observers, who asked not to be named, told me. When I spoke to mayor Milesi of San Pellegrino Terme in Bergamo, he said transparency was crucial to the town\u2019s wellbeing and to its future recovery. Spain, meanwhile, still lacks official municipal data, not just for Santo Domingo but for other hard-hit rural provinces such as Cuenca, Segovia and Soria. Jorge S\u00e1nchez believes the virus entered town from several directions at once. Ricardo Velasco, head of La Rioja\u2019s local health districts, points to the Camino de Santiago itself, often described as the oldest tourist trail in Europe, as a possible source. Its popularity has increased tenfold over two decades, attracting 352,000 pilgrims last year. Half of them follow the so-called \u201cFrench route\u201d, which goes through Santo Domingo. Visitor numbers fall dramatically in February and March, \u201cbut even in these months there are thousands,\u201d Velasco told me. The visitors are from all over the world. \u201cThey come in groups, so suddenly you may have a lot of Italians, and another day it\u2019s a group of Koreans,\u201d says Rafael Crespo, a doctor who serves half a dozen small villages close to Santo Domingo. The camino brings in money and shapes local identity. During the 11 centuries that the route has existed, only wars and natural disasters have closed it. Shutting it down, in other words, means the world has changed utterly. As Covid-19 has spread, people everywhere have, at some stage, been slow to accept that. In early March, local doctors had lobbied for part of the route to be closed, but this didn\u2019t happen until the nationwide lockdown was imposed. Other towns on the pilgrimage route do not seem to have suffered as badly as Santo Domingo. The mayor of neighbouring Belorado, \u00c1lvaro Egu\u00edluz, told me he did not want to blame its own moderately large Covid-19 outbreak on either pilgrims or people from Santo Domingo. \u201cIf we start doing that,\u201d he said, \u201cit will never end.\u201d * * * \u2018No government in the world or in any autonomous region can claim to have got everything right,\u201d prime minister S\u00e1nchez said at the end of April, admitting that he himself could have done better. It was a refreshingly honest comment. People such as Due\u00f1as are right to complain about the lack of transparency, but there is no sign of other major mistakes in Santo Domingo that are not widely shared elsewhere. In three months, we have learned a lot. It is notable that the rural black spots in Spain and Italy are places that combine the intimacy of small Mediterranean communities with proximity to the highways of global travel and business. (San Pellegrino Terme, for example, gives its name to a brand of fizzy water sold around the world, but also welcomes tourists to its thermal baths.) Normally, for those places, that is a happy mix. When a virus strikes, it can prove deadly. The connection between Covid-19 and travel is especially grave for Spain, a country where tourism generates 12% of GDP. Only the boldest pilgrims, for example, will pass through Santo Domingo this summer, which will be devastating to locals who depend on their custom. In Spain, the lockdown is being eased slowly, in a careful four-stage process that will take up to two months to complete. When I spoke to abbot Su\u00e1rez, it was 11 May \u2013 the day that Santo Domingo entered the first stage of easing. I felt envious. Candeleda was still stuck in so-called \u201cphase zero\u201d. We have since progressed, but we remain several weeks behind Santo Domingo in shaking off the effects of the virus on daily life. Su\u00e1rez had just held the cathedral\u2019s first mass for a small group of people \u2013 an experiment \u201cto see how it worked\u201d. He was already thinking about numerous funeral masses to come. Elsewhere in Santo Domingo, groups of 10 people were now allowed to socialise, while bars and restaurants could serve clients at widely spaced outside tables. I imagined a town that had suddenly burst back into life. I was wrong. \u201cPeople are still scared,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is, we don\u2019t know if life will ever be quite the same.\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here \u2022 This article was amended on 5 June 2020 to clarify that the information regarding Spain having the world\u2019s highest rate of deaths came from one particular study of excess deaths.",

      "body": "<p>Hurtling down the motorway on a Triumph T120 with a backpack full of knickers, Jen Lewandowski thought: <em>this is terrific.</em> Lewandowski, 41, had met Tom Gidley, 51, just four times before she moved into his Ramsgate home at the beginning of the coronavirus lockdown in March.&nbsp;</p> <p>They originally met through work. Lewandowski had contacted Gidley, who is an artist, to ask if she could sell some of his paintings at an exhibition she was staging. When she collected the paintings from his studio in January, there was an instant connection. \u201cShe had an energy and real light about her,\u201d says Gidley. After the show opened in March, they went for a drink, and then a cup of tea at Lewandowski\u2019s kitchen table. Finally, Lewandowski, who lives in London, visited him for the weekend.&nbsp;<br><br>Then the lockdown measures were announced. \u201cI said: \u2018Look, why don\u2019t you just come down here?\u2019\u201d says Gidley. \u201cEverything\u2019s getting a bit strange.\u201d She agreed, and Gidley collected her on his motorcycle. Since that high-speed jaunt, their relationship has barely slackened in pace. They have spent the entire lockdown together, said \u201cI love you\u201d to each other within days and are in general horribly in love. \u201cIsn\u2019t it <em>wild</em>?\u201d giggles Lewandowski. \u201cIt is quite whirlwind, but it feels right, and we\u2019re going with it.\u201d</p> <p>Gidley and Lewandowski are just one example of the British couples turbocharging their relationships by moving in together during the coronavirus lockdown despite scarcely knowing each other. On 24 March, a day after the lockdown was introduced in England, the deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, suggested that couples living apart may want to consider moving in together. \u201cThey should test the strength of their relationship,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/budding-couples-in-uk-told-to-live-together-or-stay-apart\">said Harries</a> at a government press conference, \u201cand decide whether one wishes to be permanently resident in another household.\u201d</p> <p>Harries\u2019 comments sent couples across the country scrambling into crisis talks, as they tried to decide whether moving in together during a global pandemic was a good idea, a bit premature or potential disaster. During this time, many came to the conclusion that it was worth a shot \u2013 the partner could just move out again if everything went down the toilet. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have an exit strategy,\u201d confesses Jack McGarey, a 31-year-old teacher. \u201cI suppose, at the back of my head, I thought: \u2018If it doesn\u2019t work out, she can just go home.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c8d27746ab6043409406a1c950ba79692d0d9beb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8d27746ab6043409406a1c950ba79692d0d9beb/0_246_6517_3911/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jen Lewandowski with Tom Gidley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jen Lewandowski with Tom Gidley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McGarey is a bold man: he asked Francesca Elizabeth Williams, a 33-year-old marketer, to move in with him after just one date. After matching on Bumble, the couple had gone for a physically distanced walk in Crowthorne, where they both live, on 21 March, just before the lockdown restrictions came in. After the walk, at a loss for what to suggest \u2013 most restaurants and bars had by then closed \u2013 Williams invited McGarey over for dinner. He arranged the furniture so it would be two metres apart. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to break the rules,\u201d McGarey says. \u201cWe had good intentions.\u201d He groans. \u201cObviously, the night started with social distancing,\u201d Williams says, \u201cbut as the night wore on and we had a few glasses of wine, we didn\u2019t keep our distance.\u201d</p> <p>Two days later, the lockdown began. \u201cI said: \u2018Grab your gym kit and your laptop, and come over.\u201d Williams never left. When we speak, the couple are still syrupy sweet on each other. Every day, they stick to a strict schedule of thrice-daily exercise (a morning 5k run, a yoga class and evening high-intensity interval training workout), meditate, listen to a podcast together, cook and have a \u201cdeep chat\u201d about their families or childhoods. \u201cWe do an audit later in the day,\u201d says McGarey, \u201cto make sure that we\u2019ve ticked everything off.\u201d It may sound hellish to some, but it\u2019s working for them \u2013 although they haven\u2019t said, \u201cI love you,\u201d yet, it\u2019s clearly on the cards. \u201cA few times, I almost said it,\u201d admits Williams shyly, \u201cbut then I thought it was too soon.\u201d</p> <p>Still, it is easy to rush headlong into a whirlwind romance when you are young. Time takes the edge off romantic ardour: we become cynical, crablike, cautious. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot over the years,\u201d muses Jonathan Lovett, a 53-year-old design director from London. \u201cYou have to look for someone who is emotionally available. So many people think they want relationships, but they don\u2019t really.\u201d He met his boyfriend, Kit Yunes, 45, an Argentinian-born, London-based retail worker, on a dating app in February.&nbsp;When the lockdown restrictions came in, Lovett and Yunes were in a music shop, waiting to buy a drum kit. \u201cI turned to Kit,\u201d Lovett says, \u201cand said: \u2018Where are we going to put these drums, then?\u2019\u201d The men got an Uber to Lovett\u2019s house, drum kit in boot, and Yunes never left.&nbsp;</p> <p>Experience has made both men certain that their relationship is durable, and not mere infatuation. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a sort of puppy love,\u201d Lovett insists. But the speed at which they have moved has raised eyebrows among some of their friends, particularly when Yunes gave up his rented property and officially moved in. \u201cSome people have said: \u2018What if this doesn\u2019t work? You don\u2019t want to end up homeless in a pandemic,\u2019\u201d Yunes says. He is unconcerned. \u201cI am happy to take this risk. Everything feels natural, not rushed. I\u2019ve never felt so close to another partner in my life this quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Still, living with someone and picking up their socks when you have milk in your fridge that\u2019s probably older than your relationship \u2013 there\u2019s no way for that not to be weird.&nbsp;\u201cYou catch yourself laughing at how surreal it is,\u201d Lewandowski jokes. \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d Adjusting to the rhythms of another person\u2019s life, their schedule, their caprices, takes time. \u201cYou definitely have to negotiate around each other,\u201d Gidley says. \u201cThe proximity is wonderful, but it takes work to get the balance right.\u201d He has noticed they tend to have a tiny bust-up when they\u2019re tired, on Friday evenings \u2013 which they always resolve immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s like a pressure valve,\u201d Gidley says. \u201cIt feels healthy.\u201d</p> <p>Is there any way to tell how a relationship formed under the weight of a global pandemic can go? \u201cAll things are possible,\u201d says the Relate counsellor Gurpreet Singh. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a single rule that applies.\u201d Moving in prematurely will exacerbate underlying stressors. \u201cCouples who move in together too soon haven\u2019t worked out a strategy for resolving arguments amicably,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you end up in a lockdown situation too soon, you may drive each other up the wall a little bit, and that might put you off the relationship.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Taking a punt on love doesn\u2019t always go to plan. Emily, a 26-year-old student from Birmingham, met Neil (not their real names) on Bumble in late March: they went on a date just before the lockdown was announced. \u201cI went over to his, and we had a nice time,\u201d says Emily, \u201cso I ended up staying over. He seemed quite keen for me to stay again the next night, so I did, and then I ended up staying for the weekend.\u201d When Neil asked her to stay with him during the coronavirus lockdown, Emily agreed. \u201cI thought it would be a way of helping each other through a mutually difficult time,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe, in retrospect, I wasn\u2019t using my best judgment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e9249299ddefd7f9432ce83a958fc4674971ad74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9249299ddefd7f9432ce83a958fc4674971ad74/190_259_5525_3314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Lovett and Kit Yunes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Lovett and Kit Yunes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The two cohabited together amicably, at first mostly because Emily swallowed her feelings. When Neil was on video calls with his family and friends, he didn\u2019t mention she was there. \u201cHe was cagey,\u201d Emily says. \u201cI felt like he was trying to conceal me and our relationship, whatever it was.\u201d The anxiety gnawed away at her. \u201cI finally cracked,\u201d she says. \u201cI said that I was uncomfortable and anxious about where I stood. He said he wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship yet.\u201d That must have been tough, I say, after living together for two months as a quasi-couple. \u201cThe fact that it was so intense \u2013&nbsp;I suppose I expected a little bit more,\u201d Emily says flatly. \u201cI wish he had been a bit more honest about his expectations because then I wouldn\u2019t have opened up so much and allowed myself to fall for him.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Emily isn\u2019t bitter about her decision to move in with Neil, even though it ended badly. \u201cI don\u2019t regret it,\u201d she says. \u201cLast year, I was serially dating, mostly through apps, and not getting much out of it.&nbsp;This seemed like a nice chance to give a relationship a go, without overthinking it all the time.\u201d</p> <p>The pandemic has given prospective partners the opportunity to connect outside a brutal and sometimes dehumanising dating scene. \u201cWith online dating,\u201d says Gidley, \u201cit can feel horribly like a marketplace. It encourages you to think there\u2019s always another option out there, so you never commit to anyone, even if you really like each other.\u201d</p> <p>In our hyperscheduled modern lives, having the time and space to get to know someone away from work, family and friends means that lovers can develop an intimacy that would take months, even years, to gestate under ordinary circumstances. \u201cIt\u2019s given us a bubble of time to build our closeness,\u201d says Lewandowski. \u201cI think that intimacy would be hard to achieve when normal life is happening.\u201d In lockdown, time speeds up, slips forward, accelerates. A meal at your kitchen table together is the equivalent of three real-world dinner dates. A Zoom quiz with friends feels like hitting the three-month mark.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cYou feel like you have time to waste, almost,\u201d says Lovett. \u201cNothing has to just be a conversation over dinner. You can have conversations for hours or even days. That\u2019s the beauty of it. It\u2019s been so intense.\u201d Lovett travels abroad frequently for work and doubts he would have had the time to grow so close to Yunes were it not for the lockdown. \u201cI\u2019d have had to make space for him in my daily routine, seeing my friends, going to work, the gym,\u201d agrees Yunes. \u201cIt would have taken a lot longer.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>This is dating on steroids: a time-lapse fast-forward stumble through all the major relationship milestones. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve been together for six months,\u201d says McGarey, \u201cnot six weeks.\u201d They plan to move to Texas together later this year, so that McGarey can take up a teaching job. \u201cI want to be where Jack is,\u201d Williams says. They have met each other\u2019s families \u2013 on Zoom, of course.</p> <p>Lewandowski compares the heady excitement of her lockdown romance to the shotgun weddings of the second world war. \u201cThere\u2019s something old-fashioned about it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t met any of each other\u2019s friends or families. It reminds me of those old movies where the soldier coming back from the war hops off a train with his new bride.\u201d</p> <p>But a better comparison may be prison. \u201cThose who have relationships in prison have better mental health than those who don\u2019t have a partner or have a partner outside prison,\u201d says Dr Rodrigo Gonz\u00e1lez of the University of Salamanca. He has conducted research into relationships in Spanish prisons. \u201cIt\u2019s partly about companionship,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez says. \u201cBut it\u2019s mostly about sex. Having sex relates to better mental health and higher satisfaction levels in the public as well as prison inmates.\u201d He\u2019s probably on to something: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/dutch-official-advice-to-single-people-find-a-sex-buddy-for-lockdown-coronavirus\">always practical Dutch authorities</a> even recommended that single people find a designated \u201csex buddy\u201d during lockdown.</p> <p>Is the intimacy these couples feel real? Or are they punch-drunk on the surreal enforced intimacy of a global pandemic? \u201cIt\u2019s as real as it can be,\u201d says Singh. \u201cIf they\u2019ve coped well together during these times, it would give me the sense there is strength in the relationship.\u201d But Singh points out that none of the couples will have met each other\u2019s family or friends in real life or had to balance commuting, living apart or work commitments. \u201cGood, healthy relationships are formed over time, when people have lived in each other\u2019s lives during periods of vulnerability,\u201d Singh says. \u201cYou can\u2019t build that in a few days.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReality is the true test of any relationship,\u201d Lovett admits. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in this bubble, but I know it\u2019s coming very quickly \u2013 <em>the real world</em>.\u201d But he\u2019s confident they will go the distance. \u201cPeople may be cynical,\u201d Lovett says. \u201cBut sometimes you\u2019ve just got to take that leap of faith.\u201d</p> <p>Lewandowski and Gidley certainly are. On a beautiful Saturday afternoon in the Kent Downs a few weeks ago, Gidley asked Lewandowski to marry him. \u201cI said yes,\u201d Lewandowski says, \u201cand we had a lovely kiss. Just as we did, the wind picked up! It went: <em>whoosh</em>. It was very romantic.\u201d Lewandowski lets out a peal of laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s a good job we\u2019re in lockdown because if people could see us, they would puke,\u201d she cries. \u201cLet\u2019s just see if it lasts!\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Hurtling down the motorway on a Triumph T120 with a backpack full of knickers, Jen Lewandowski thought: this is terrific. Lewandowski, 41, had met Tom Gidley, 51, just four times before she moved into his Ramsgate home at the beginning of the coronavirus lockdown in March. They originally met through work. Lewandowski had contacted Gidley, who is an artist, to ask if she could sell some of his paintings at an exhibition she was staging. When she collected the paintings from his studio in January, there was an instant connection. \u201cShe had an energy and real light about her,\u201d says Gidley. After the show opened in March, they went for a drink, and then a cup of tea at Lewandowski\u2019s kitchen table. Finally, Lewandowski, who lives in London, visited him for the weekend. Then the lockdown measures were announced. \u201cI said: \u2018Look, why don\u2019t you just come down here?\u2019\u201d says Gidley. \u201cEverything\u2019s getting a bit strange.\u201d She agreed, and Gidley collected her on his motorcycle. Since that high-speed jaunt, their relationship has barely slackened in pace. They have spent the entire lockdown together, said \u201cI love you\u201d to each other within days and are in general horribly in love. \u201cIsn\u2019t it wild?\u201d giggles Lewandowski. \u201cIt is quite whirlwind, but it feels right, and we\u2019re going with it.\u201d Gidley and Lewandowski are just one example of the British couples turbocharging their relationships by moving in together during the coronavirus lockdown despite scarcely knowing each other. On 24 March, a day after the lockdown was introduced in England, the deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, suggested that couples living apart may want to consider moving in together. \u201cThey should test the strength of their relationship,\u201d said Harries at a government press conference, \u201cand decide whether one wishes to be permanently resident in another household.\u201d Harries\u2019 comments sent couples across the country scrambling into crisis talks, as they tried to decide whether moving in together during a global pandemic was a good idea, a bit premature or potential disaster. During this time, many came to the conclusion that it was worth a shot \u2013 the partner could just move out again if everything went down the toilet. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have an exit strategy,\u201d confesses Jack McGarey, a 31-year-old teacher. \u201cI suppose, at the back of my head, I thought: \u2018If it doesn\u2019t work out, she can just go home.\u2019\u201d McGarey is a bold man: he asked Francesca Elizabeth Williams, a 33-year-old marketer, to move in with him after just one date. After matching on Bumble, the couple had gone for a physically distanced walk in Crowthorne, where they both live, on 21 March, just before the lockdown restrictions came in. After the walk, at a loss for what to suggest \u2013 most restaurants and bars had by then closed \u2013 Williams invited McGarey over for dinner. He arranged the furniture so it would be two metres apart. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to break the rules,\u201d McGarey says. \u201cWe had good intentions.\u201d He groans. \u201cObviously, the night started with social distancing,\u201d Williams says, \u201cbut as the night wore on and we had a few glasses of wine, we didn\u2019t keep our distance.\u201d Two days later, the lockdown began. \u201cI said: \u2018Grab your gym kit and your laptop, and come over.\u201d Williams never left. When we speak, the couple are still syrupy sweet on each other. Every day, they stick to a strict schedule of thrice-daily exercise (a morning 5k run, a yoga class and evening high-intensity interval training workout), meditate, listen to a podcast together, cook and have a \u201cdeep chat\u201d about their families or childhoods. \u201cWe do an audit later in the day,\u201d says McGarey, \u201cto make sure that we\u2019ve ticked everything off.\u201d It may sound hellish to some, but it\u2019s working for them \u2013 although they haven\u2019t said, \u201cI love you,\u201d yet, it\u2019s clearly on the cards. \u201cA few times, I almost said it,\u201d admits Williams shyly, \u201cbut then I thought it was too soon.\u201d Still, it is easy to rush headlong into a whirlwind romance when you are young. Time takes the edge off romantic ardour: we become cynical, crablike, cautious. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot over the years,\u201d muses Jonathan Lovett, a 53-year-old design director from London. \u201cYou have to look for someone who is emotionally available. So many people think they want relationships, but they don\u2019t really.\u201d He met his boyfriend, Kit Yunes, 45, an Argentinian-born, London-based retail worker, on a dating app in February. When the lockdown restrictions came in, Lovett and Yunes were in a music shop, waiting to buy a drum kit. \u201cI turned to Kit,\u201d Lovett says, \u201cand said: \u2018Where are we going to put these drums, then?\u2019\u201d The men got an Uber to Lovett\u2019s house, drum kit in boot, and Yunes never left. Experience has made both men certain that their relationship is durable, and not mere infatuation. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a sort of puppy love,\u201d Lovett insists. But the speed at which they have moved has raised eyebrows among some of their friends, particularly when Yunes gave up his rented property and officially moved in. \u201cSome people have said: \u2018What if this doesn\u2019t work? You don\u2019t want to end up homeless in a pandemic,\u2019\u201d Yunes says. He is unconcerned. \u201cI am happy to take this risk. Everything feels natural, not rushed. I\u2019ve never felt so close to another partner in my life this quickly.\u201d Still, living with someone and picking up their socks when you have milk in your fridge that\u2019s probably older than your relationship \u2013 there\u2019s no way for that not to be weird. \u201cYou catch yourself laughing at how surreal it is,\u201d Lewandowski jokes. \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d Adjusting to the rhythms of another person\u2019s life, their schedule, their caprices, takes time. \u201cYou definitely have to negotiate around each other,\u201d Gidley says. \u201cThe proximity is wonderful, but it takes work to get the balance right.\u201d He has noticed they tend to have a tiny bust-up when they\u2019re tired, on Friday evenings \u2013 which they always resolve immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s like a pressure valve,\u201d Gidley says. \u201cIt feels healthy.\u201d Is there any way to tell how a relationship formed under the weight of a global pandemic can go? \u201cAll things are possible,\u201d says the Relate counsellor Gurpreet Singh. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a single rule that applies.\u201d Moving in prematurely will exacerbate underlying stressors. \u201cCouples who move in together too soon haven\u2019t worked out a strategy for resolving arguments amicably,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you end up in a lockdown situation too soon, you may drive each other up the wall a little bit, and that might put you off the relationship.\u201d Taking a punt on love doesn\u2019t always go to plan.

      "body": "<p>During the first weeks of the coronavirus lockdown in the United States and Britain, a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/convincing-boomer-parents-to-take-the-coronavirus-seriously\">flurry</a> of media commentary centred around issues of generational difference in response to the pandemic. \u201cBoomer\u201d parents, although at heightened risk of deadly complications from contracting Covid-19, were apparently not taking the virus seriously enough. They flouted social distancing measures in favour of bridge games and cruise trips. The young, it seemed, were the adults in the room, begging for seriousness from their at-risk elders.&nbsp;</p> <p>For the most part, these stories were media <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/epgkb7/if-your-aging-parents-are-ignoring-coronavirus-risks-youre-not-alone\">trend</a> pieces and glossed anecdotes drenched in unspoken class assumptions. These reckless parents in their 60s and 70s had accrued enough capital to be cruise-tripping and golfing; they owned the homes where they should have been sheltering. And, as it turns out, the narrative of \u201cunserious boomers\u201d and \u201ccautious millennials\u201d obscured more than it revealed. The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-baby-boomers.html\">reported</a> that a higher percentage of Americans born between 1946 and 1964 were practising social distancing than people born after 1980. Not to mention that many thousands of older essential workers, from nurses to supermarket workers, were left out of this tale of generational difference and indifference.</p> <p>There\u2019s an understandable appetite for generational analysis during this pandemic. The risk of dying from the virus is primarily determined along age lines, while most workers under 40, already shut out of capital ownership, face mass unemployment and an economic depression with little financial insulation. Yet the story of medically imperilled boomers and economically imperilled millennials, while largely valid, ignores the cross-generational divisions of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/curse-poverty-coronavirus\">class</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/americas-racial-contract-showing/611389/\">racialised inequality</a> this pandemic has exposed and exacerbated.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/young-peoples-mental-health-hit-by-coronavirus-uk-poll\">UK poll finds young people's mental health hit by coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We can argue about whether younger or older generations will suffer more and in what ways. Or we can recognise that our economic and political reality, forged in the service of capital, is incompatible with human flourishing for all but the wealthy. This reckoning need not pit the old against the young, but it will require a long overdue undressing of the economic ideology that defined the baby boomer generation and its legacy.</p> <p>Namely, that with a decent enough education, and by obtaining the necessary skills to produce value for a boss, you were ensured a materially secure future. This was already a boomer myth; in pandemic times, it\u2019s a cruel joke. Intergenerational solidarity during this crisis requires challenging the very value system that defined boomers and millennials as meaningfully distinct generations in the first place.&nbsp;</p> <p>In his 2017 book, Kids These Days: Human Capital and The Making of Millennials, the author Malcolm Harris defines millennials according to the material conditions that have defined the post-1980s decades in which they came of age. That is, a world where we were taught to accrue, indeed to become, \u201chuman capital\u201d, turning ourselves into walking investments in our future capacity to earn and produce value. While wages have stagnated in recent decades, even some of the most privileged young people have taken on unprecedented amounts of student debt to chase the promise of a sustainable future available to a vanishingly small number of people.&nbsp;</p> <p>These conditions apply as much to millennials as they do to members of so-called Generation Z. While the affective experiences of current teenagers differ to those of early millennials, we\u2019re in the same boat when it comes to the imperative of becoming human capital. \u201cAs it turns out,\u201d wrote Harris, \u201cjust because you can produce an unprecedented amount of value doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you can feed yourself under twenty-first-century American capitalism.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>This should not be surprising: that capitalism depends on human life as exploitable labour is a feature, not a bug. The boomer experience of postwar wealth and full employment on a living wage was the exception to the rule, which is nonetheless touted as proof of capitalism\u2019s ability to deliver a dignified life to workers. The pandemic and its attendant economic crisis are now exposing the horrifying stakes involved when life is reconfigured wholly in market terms. </p> <p>In late May, White House adviser Kevin Hassett <a href=\"https://slate.com/business/2020/05/human-capital-stock-kevin-hassett-coronavirus.html\">cheerfully told CNN</a>, \u201cOur human capital stock is ready to go back to work.\u201d Everyone from 40-year-olds to teenagers were sold a promise that we were to accrue \u201chuman capital\u201d as an investment on returns for our own futures. But that promise was a myth. The capital was never ours. As Harris told me, in response to Hassett\u2019s comment, \u201cThat\u2019s giving away the game right there, admitting that human capital is something for capitalists and states to control and exploit, not a \u2018company of the self\u2019 that each worker has, which is what they\u2019ve been telling us it is for years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuman capital stock\u201d refers to the workers across generations who are being pushed back to work during a health crisis in order to produce more value for asset holders. It\u2019s a dystopian scenario that offers up poor, older workers \u2013 especially workers of colour \u2013 as a blood sacrifice as readily as any millennial or younger slice of \u201chuman capital\u201d.</p> <p>To be sure: it does not need to be this way. American billionaires have grown $434bn <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/american-billionaires-richer-since-coronavirus-pandemic-began\">richer</a> since the beginning of the pandemic. There are more than enough resources to go around. But the exposure of capitalism\u2019s brutal incompatibility with human and non-human flourishing is hardly new. It would be naive to presume that the highly visible unequal suffering caused by the pandemic will force a revaluation of values.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/boris-johnson-urged-to-publish-bame-covid-19-review-immediately\">Boris Johnson urged to publish BAME Covid-19 review immediately</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the same time, in the midst of this crisis, we\u2019re seeing what resistance looks like. Across the US and the UK, mutual aid networks have sprung up where young and able-bodied people are providing food and medical necessities to their elderly and infirm neighbours. These networks of mutual aid and community care are hardly thorns in the side of capital; for now, they fill gaps where the state and market are failing. But at their best, they transcend the ethos of charity and recognise how our current system designates certain lives as disposable, while organising towards liberation from within that system. The youth of the Navajo Nation, which spans four US states, have <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/26/navajo-nation-covid-19-youth-response-elders-health/\">self-organised</a> to provide for their elders as their communities are devastated by the pandemic and government neglect. This is life-affirming resistance in the face of an unbroken history of state violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>The same can and should be said of the current wave of bold <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/30/21275507/minneapolis-george-floyd-protests-police-violence\">uprisings</a> across nearly every city in the US following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. The protests have shown a righteous anger and resolve that speaks to far greater needs and demands than the indictment of individual killer police officers.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: \u2018Our main line of inquiry is this suspect\u2019</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray here, let\u2019s cut through the noise and get to the news.</p> \n<p>Police have identified an imprisoned German paedophile, drug trafficker and burglar as the new prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in Portugal 13 years ago. The suspect who has not been named was in the vicinity of the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz on the evening of 3 May 2007, and had a phone conversation that ended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/03/german-prisoner-named-as-suspect-in-disappearance-of-madeleine-mccann\">just over an hour before Madeleine went missing</a> from the holiday apartment where she had been sleeping with her younger twin siblings as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant. The man was known to Portuguese police over break-ins at hotels and holiday homes in the Praia da Luz and Lagos areas.</p> \n<p>Images have been released of a VW T3 Westfalia campervan, an early 1980s model with white upper body and a yellow skirting and a Portuguese registration plate; as well as a 1993 Jaguar car that was registered in Germany.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"841afbd28261df7d82cbc7b18c8c3ed0cf869e0f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/841afbd28261df7d82cbc7b18c8c3ed0cf869e0f/0_0_933_297/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jaguar car connected with the Madeleine McCann suspect.\" width=\"500\" height=\"159\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jaguar car connected with the Madeleine McCann suspect.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: German police/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On 4 May 2007, the day after Madeleine\u2019s disappearance, the suspect got the car re-registered in Germany under someone else\u2019s name at a time when police believe it was still in Portugal. German investigators have initiated proceedings against the suspect on suspicion of McCann\u2019s murder. Christian Hoppe, of the German federal office of criminal investigations, told a local television programme similar to the BBC\u2019s Crimewatch that the suspect had two previous convictions for sexual abuse of girls. Stuart Cundy, the Met\u2019s deputy assistant commissioner, said: \u201cOur main line of inquiry is this suspect.\u201d Now aged 43, in 2007 the man was 30 \u2013 but it was said he may have looked younger. He had been in the Algarve between 1995 and 2007, with short spells in Germany during that time.</p> \n<p>German police have been quietly investigating the man since a 2013 tip-off connected to the McCann case. They are expected to say more today.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>George Floyd: more police charged \u2013 </strong>Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of defence has said he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-protests-trump-troops-esper\">does not support sending in the military</a> to quell protests over the death of George Floyd. And the president\u2019s first defence secretary, James Mattis, has delivered a blistering condemnation, declaring: \u201cDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2013 does not even pretend to try. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/james-mattis-comdemns-trump-george-floyd-protests\">Instead he tries to divide us</a> \u2026&nbsp;We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.

They persuaded two police officers to \u201ctake the knee\u201d outside the gates of Downing Street in a mark of respect for George Floyd.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Our main line of inquiry is this suspect\u2019 Hello, Warren Murray here, let\u2019s cut through the noise and get to the news. Police have identified an imprisoned German paedophile, drug trafficker and burglar as the new prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in Portugal 13 years ago. The suspect who has not been named was in the vicinity of the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz on the evening of 3 May 2007, and had a phone conversation that ended just over an hour before Madeleine went missing from the holiday apartment where she had been sleeping with her younger twin siblings as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant. The man was known to Portuguese police over break-ins at hotels and holiday homes in the Praia da Luz and Lagos areas. Images have been released of a VW T3 Westfalia campervan, an early 1980s model with white upper body and a yellow skirting and a Portuguese registration plate; as well as a 1993 Jaguar car that was registered in Germany. On 4 May 2007, the day after Madeleine\u2019s disappearance, the suspect got the car re-registered in Germany under someone else\u2019s name at a time when police believe it was still in Portugal. German investigators have initiated proceedings against the suspect on suspicion of McCann\u2019s murder. Christian Hoppe, of the German federal office of criminal investigations, told a local television programme similar to the BBC\u2019s Crimewatch that the suspect had two previous convictions for sexual abuse of girls. Stuart Cundy, the Met\u2019s deputy assistant commissioner, said: \u201cOur main line of inquiry is this suspect.\u201d Now aged 43, in 2007 the man was 30 \u2013 but it was said he may have looked younger. He had been in the Algarve between 1995 and 2007, with short spells in Germany during that time. German police have been quietly investigating the man since a 2013 tip-off connected to the McCann case. They are expected to say more today. * * * George Floyd: more police charged \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of defence has said he does not support sending in the military to quell protests over the death of George Floyd. And the president\u2019s first defence secretary, James Mattis, has delivered a blistering condemnation, declaring: \u201cDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2013 does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us \u2026 We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership. We know that we are better than the abuse of executive authority that we witnessed in Lafayette Park. We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our constitution.\u201d The Minnesota attorney general, Keith Ellison, has announced charges of aiding and abetting murder against three former police officers in the death of George Floyd, and increased to second-degree murder the charge against the officer who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck. Barack Obama has told young people of colour \u201cyour lives matter\u201d in public remarks that contrasted with Donald Trump\u2019s racially charged and divisive threats of a crackdown. \u201cYou have the potential to make things better and you have helped to make the entire country feel as if this is something that\u2019s gotta change.\u201d Thousands of protesters have marched through central London in an overwhelmingly peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstration that culminated in crowds gathering at the heart of Westminster. They persuaded two police officers to \u201ctake the knee\u201d outside the gates of Downing Street in a mark of respect for George Floyd. The actor John Boyega was among those taking part. * * * Coronavirus latest \u2013 The government has faced fierce criticism for making MPs return to parliament in person after the business secretary, Alok Sharma, became unwell during a Commons speech and ended up being tested for coronavirus. Lisa Nandy, Labour\u2019s shadow foreign secretary, said the development was \u201cjust awful \u2026 The government stopped MPs from working from home and asked us to return to a building where social distancing is impossible. MPs are travelling home to every part of the country tonight. Reckless doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it.\u201d Priti Patel faces mounting calls to publish the scientific advice behind the 14-day quarantine period for new arrivals to the UK, after the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, declined to fully endorse such a blanket policy, which is due to take effect on Monday. The prime minister has been vague on whether Britons will be able to holiday overseas if they self-isolate for 14 days on returning. Mexico and Brazil have recorded their highest daily death tolls while Germany has announced a massive spending package to reboot its post-lockdown economy.

The plant is operated by a division of Nornickel, whose factories in the area have made the city of Norilsk one of the most heavily polluted places on Earth.

Sport Tottenham have revealed that one of their players has tested positive for Covid-19 and will self-isolate for seven days, although he is not experiencing any symptoms of the virus. Nine people from six Championship clubs also tested positive in the English Football League\u2019s latest round of testing. Fresh doubt has been cast on whether Premiership rugby clubs can keep players on the government\u2019s furlough scheme when they return to training after HMRC moved to clarify its position.

There is just such a bar on Carrer de Mart\u00ednez de la Rosa in Barcelona. I can\u2019t tell you its name because I\u2019ve forgotten; it doesn\u2019t have a website or any social media, and it isn\u2019t on Google Maps. You\u2019ll have to explore the street and look for a tiny bar with a cosy red hue where the staff all wear crisp white shirts, waistcoats and ties, and where they craft the most elegant cocktails.

Staff at Reach, the publisher that owns the titles, said their wages were docked by 10% at the start of April \u201cwithout consultation or consent\u201d, and without any reduction in the amount of work they were expected to do. Newspaper sales and advertising revenue have plummeted across the media industry, with some other news outlets forcing staff to take pay cuts. Reach could be a test case for the legality of some of the wage reductions imposed at the height of the pandemic. Reach employees are particularly angry because their chief executive, Jim Mullen, and chief financial officer, Simon Fuller, were paid almost \u00a3300,000 in bonuses at the end of March relating to the previous financial year. The pair were also given shares worth \u00a31.18m, which they can access in five years as part of the company\u2019s long-term incentive scheme. Days after these bonuses were announced, other Reach staff were told their pay would be cut by at least 10%. The National Union of Journalists has told journalists it is looking for support for a collective grievance case uniting the company\u2019s national titles with more than 100 regional outlets, including the Manchester Evening News. Union officials said: \u201cOur advice is that, on the face of it, the company is clearly in breach of contract and has opened itself up to an unlawful deduction of wages claim by cutting our pay without our consent. \u201cOur members have suggested various ways that the company could recompense us for the money that we have lost. But if we can\u2019t reach agreement then ultimately the grievance will allow us to consider taking legal action on behalf of those covered by it.\u201d Reach has paused its dividend, pension contributions, and future bonus scheme. But staff have noted that earlier this month it told shareholders that its \u00a320m cash reserves had increased to \u00a333m during the crisis. \u201cThat raises questions for us over whether our deducted wages are being used to amass a war chest to acquire weakened businesses,\u201d union officials told staff. \u201cWe want the company and its shareholders to do well, but not at our expense.\u201d Other media outlets have taken a different approach to cut costs in the pandemic, with the Daily Mail asking journalists to take a pay cut in return for shares in the parent company. The Guardian has furloughed around 100 non-editorial staff but not changed terms for its journalists. A Reach spokesperson said: \u201cFollowing sector-wide declines in circulation and advertising resulting from the Covid-19 crisis, we have regrettably had to take proactive measures at all levels on pay reduction and to suspend annual bonuses for 2020 to protect jobs and to protect the Reach business for the long term. April Group revenues were down 30.5% and there continues to be uncertainty around the severity and length of the crisis.\u201d",

One asthma sufferer, Paul, 14 from Liverpool, has often found it difficult to breathe, but has had to use his reliever inhaler a lot less during lockdown. \u201cYou can really feel the difference now,\u201d he said. \u201cI walk out, and I\u2019m hit with clean air which is like a utopia compared to before.\u201d Dr Alison Cook, the chair of the Taskforce for Lung Health, a coalition of 30 organisations, said: \u201cChildren deserve to breathe cleaner air and to grow up in a country where their health is not put at risk by going outside.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>On Wednesday, Australia\u2019s Liberal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, acknowledged Australia is in economic recession. The economy shrunk by 0.3% in the March quarter. June is expected to be worse. It\u2019s our first acknowledged recession in 29 years.&nbsp;</p> <p>The situation is unsurprising. Earlier in the year, Australia had to contend with the destruction and expense of summer\u2019s devastating fires. Then it felt the impact of the coronavirus lockdown, with its fallout of suspended activity, lost jobs and changed consumer spending priorities.&nbsp;</p> <p>And it\u2019s going to get worse.

During the <a href=\"https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/great-depression\">Great Depression</a>, unemployment in Australia hit a staggering 32%. The only country to supersede this index of misery \u2013 fatefully \u2013 was Germany.</p> <p>And yet there are features of that awful time that have disturbing parallels to now. Firstly, there were structural problems in our economy pre-existing the onset of external disaster. Before the last election, statistics were sounding loud alarms about instabilities fomented by government policy inaction. A year ago there was already <a href=\"https://thenewdaily.com.au/finance/finance-news/2019/03/07/retail-sales-flatline/\">a retail slump</a>, attributed to ongoing low wage growth. Indicators like a <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-12/business-conditions-and-confidence-fall/10892224\">16% </a><a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-12/business-conditions-and-confidence-fall/10892224\"> drop</a> in first-homebuyer loans and a <a href=\"https://www.caradvice.com.au/743110/vfacts-market-sales-report-for-q1-2019/\">7.9% drop</a> in new vehicle sales <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-06/car-dealers-bearing-the-brunt-of-australian-economic-slowdown/10875580\">were read</a> as a \u201cwarning sign of impending [economic] doom\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s unfortunate that a pre-election declaration by the Australian Bureau of Statistics chief economist that \u201csoft household spending\u201d lay underneath Australia entering \u201ca per capita recession\u201d weren\u2019t heeded at the time. Because the second sad parallel of the Depression-era past to now is that Australia has a government ideologically ill-equipped to manage the crisis.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s the Liberal-Nationals\u2019 committed neoliberal policy habit of low-wage labour exploitation that has eroded spending capacity within the economy. The tracts of Milton Friedman have been literally <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/mp-tim-wilson-holds-free-market-bible-on-day-of-oaths/news-story/b07c6c5371b74be41701b16690d3f456\">gripped to the chest</a> of Morrison\u2019s parliamentarians as they\u2019ve made business-generous \u201ctrickle-down\u201d economic decision-making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/05/labors-support-for-tax-cuts-is-an-unfathomable-betrayal-of-principle\">flow</a>. Alas, the free-market-purist logic of allowing people to just \u2013 y\u2019know \u2013 die in the service of economic growth turned out to be unpopular when government-friendly stalking horses <a href=\"https://junkee.com/coronavirus-economic-cost/250257\">gave this idea their best neigh</a> in the media.</p> <p>Morrison \u2013 brand-damaged by his Waikiki vacation and stumbling clown act in the bushfires \u2013 has been obliged by the shocked new recruits to <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/careers/coronavirus-australia-second-day-of-queues-outside-centrelink/news-story/dfeb4aca0964cfff9bd41d3e1b262bde\">Centrelink queues</a> to pivot beyond neoliberal business as usual. Hence the unexpected, apparent glasnost between the hardline, neoliberal front of Morrison\u2019s boyos with their long-chosen enemy, the trade union movement.&nbsp;</p> <p>What a spectacle it is to see a neocon IR minister, Christian Porter, now desperate as a teenager before a dance to claim an iron socialist like the ACTU\u2019s Sally McManus is his \u201cnew BFF\u201d, despite her conspicuous refusal to do the same. The Liberal leadership have realised that only the application of Depression-ending Keynesian economic strategies can ameliorate their vulnerable political situation. They\u2019re trying to glean economic concepts and grab some policy ideas from McManus and the unions because they cannot risk elevating and vindicating parliamentary Labor\u2019s own Keynesians in the public policy conversation. Nor can the Liberals do nothing \u2013 they\u2019d just cede an economic leadership platform to Labor\u2019s Anthony Albanese.</p> <p>This was the framework that informed the creation of jobkeeper \u2013 the income subsidy that originated from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/08/casual-and-migrant-workers-are-at-the-mercy-of-an-economy-that-punishes-its-victims\">explicit union demands</a>. Yet despite the government\u2019s rush to consult McManus, like any inauthentic contribution to a project, the Liberals\u2019 fundamental disbelief in the politics of a subsidy have <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/treasurer-closes-loopholes-fixes-problems-with-jobkeeper-20200424-p54mzb.html\">warped its design</a>. Jobkeeper has been slow to start, cumbersome to access, has not helped all those who needed help and is contributing to unemployment as opportunistic businesses exploit staff on the subsidy rather than create new jobs to meet demands.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/the-homebuilder-scheme-is-simply-pork-barrelling-to-the-coalitions-electoral-base\">The homebuilder scheme is simply pork-barrelling to the Coalition's electoral base | Emma Dawson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So too have union demands for local procurement and investment in paid local jobs been contorted into the government\u2019s unhinged \u201chome improvement\u201d stimulus scheme. A real \u201ctradie-led\u201d economic recovery would entail restarting government departments of public works and committing to the great projects of infrastructure-building with which the Curtin-Chifley Labor governments of the 1940s <a href=\"https://meanjin.com.au/blog/a-future-from-our-past/\">rebuilt Australia</a> in the wake of the Depression and the second world war. This country is crying out for public housing, among many other things \u2013 but state enterprise and public services are anathema to the neoliberal DNA. Instead, Scott Morrison\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/property/residential/why-morrison-s-housing-stimulus-has-missed-a-huge-opportunity-20200603-p54z1f\">bizarre cash grants for home improvements</a> have the conditions and restrictions of a wine club discount voucher where you have to buy more of what you don\u2019t want at a price you can\u2019t afford before the savings kick in at all.&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite everything, the Liberals have continued their sabre-rattling at unions, repeating ancient threats of further \u201c<a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-31/coronavirus-jobs-industrial-relations/12300118\">IR reform</a>\u201d, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cathywilcox1/status/1265760675587960832/photo/1\">a cartoon</a> appeared the other day depicting the union negotiations with Morrison as the allegorical scorpion asking for a ride from a frog in a union T-shirt.&nbsp;</p> <p>Given that the unions have presently negotiated Morrison\u2019s government into progress on their demands, the removal of the union-busting \u201cEnsuring Integrity\u201d legislation and vindication of their most fundamental economic politics, I\u2019d politely suggest that the famously <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/is-sally-mcmanus-the-woman-the-coalition-fears-most-20181011-p508zx.html\">bird</a><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/is-sally-mcmanus-the-woman-the-coalition-fears-most-20181011-p508zx.html\">watching McManus</a> is more sensibly depicted as an owl.&nbsp;</p> <p>Owls have long memories.

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday, Australia\u2019s Liberal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, acknowledged Australia is in economic recession. The economy shrunk by 0.3% in the March quarter. June is expected to be worse. It\u2019s our first acknowledged recession in 29 years. The situation is unsurprising. Earlier in the year, Australia had to contend with the destruction and expense of summer\u2019s devastating fires. Then it felt the impact of the coronavirus lockdown, with its fallout of suspended activity, lost jobs and changed consumer spending priorities. And it\u2019s going to get worse. The Age reports that economists, the Treasury and the Reserve Bank are \u201cresigned to the June quarter showing the economy experiencing its worst three-month period since the 1930s\u201d. That\u2019s not a period of which Australia, in any way, should wish to be reminded. During the Great Depression, unemployment in Australia hit a staggering 32%. The only country to supersede this index of misery \u2013 fatefully \u2013 was Germany. And yet there are features of that awful time that have disturbing parallels to now. Firstly, there were structural problems in our economy pre-existing the onset of external disaster. Before the last election, statistics were sounding loud alarms about instabilities fomented by government policy inaction. A year ago there was already a retail slump, attributed to ongoing low wage growth. Indicators like a 16% drop in first-homebuyer loans and a 7.9% drop in new vehicle sales were read as a \u201cwarning sign of impending [economic] doom\u201d. It\u2019s unfortunate that a pre-election declaration by the Australian Bureau of Statistics chief economist that \u201csoft household spending\u201d lay underneath Australia entering \u201ca per capita recession\u201d weren\u2019t heeded at the time. Because the second sad parallel of the Depression-era past to now is that Australia has a government ideologically ill-equipped to manage the crisis. It\u2019s the Liberal-Nationals\u2019 committed neoliberal policy habit of low-wage labour exploitation that has eroded spending capacity within the economy. The tracts of Milton Friedman have been literally gripped to the chest of Morrison\u2019s parliamentarians as they\u2019ve made business-generous \u201ctrickle-down\u201d economic decision-making flow. Alas, the free-market-purist logic of allowing people to just \u2013 y\u2019know \u2013 die in the service of economic growth turned out to be unpopular when government-friendly stalking horses gave this idea their best neigh in the media. Morrison \u2013 brand-damaged by his Waikiki vacation and stumbling clown act in the bushfires \u2013 has been obliged by the shocked new recruits to Centrelink queues to pivot beyond neoliberal business as usual. Hence the unexpected, apparent glasnost between the hardline, neoliberal front of Morrison\u2019s boyos with their long-chosen enemy, the trade union movement. What a spectacle it is to see a neocon IR minister, Christian Porter, now desperate as a teenager before a dance to claim an iron socialist like the ACTU\u2019s Sally McManus is his \u201cnew BFF\u201d, despite her conspicuous refusal to do the same. The Liberal leadership have realised that only the application of Depression-ending Keynesian economic strategies can ameliorate their vulnerable political situation. They\u2019re trying to glean economic concepts and grab some policy ideas from McManus and the unions because they cannot risk elevating and vindicating parliamentary Labor\u2019s own Keynesians in the public policy conversation. Nor can the Liberals do nothing \u2013 they\u2019d just cede an economic leadership platform to Labor\u2019s Anthony Albanese. This was the framework that informed the creation of jobkeeper \u2013 the income subsidy that originated from explicit union demands. Yet despite the government\u2019s rush to consult McManus, like any inauthentic contribution to a project, the Liberals\u2019 fundamental disbelief in the politics of a subsidy have warped its design. Jobkeeper has been slow to start, cumbersome to access, has not helped all those who needed help and is contributing to unemployment as opportunistic businesses exploit staff on the subsidy rather than create new jobs to meet demands. So too have union demands for local procurement and investment in paid local jobs been contorted into the government\u2019s unhinged \u201chome improvement\u201d stimulus scheme. A real \u201ctradie-led\u201d economic recovery would entail restarting government departments of public works and committing to the great projects of infrastructure-building with which the Curtin-Chifley Labor governments of the 1940s rebuilt Australia in the wake of the Depression and the second world war. This country is crying out for public housing, among many other things \u2013 but state enterprise and public services are anathema to the neoliberal DNA. Instead, Scott Morrison\u2019s bizarre cash grants for home improvements have the conditions and restrictions of a wine club discount voucher where you have to buy more of what you don\u2019t want at a price you can\u2019t afford before the savings kick in at all. Despite everything, the Liberals have continued their sabre-rattling at unions, repeating ancient threats of further \u201cIR reform\u201d, and a cartoon appeared the other day depicting the union negotiations with Morrison as the allegorical scorpion asking for a ride from a frog in a union T-shirt. Given that the unions have presently negotiated Morrison\u2019s government into progress on their demands, the removal of the union-busting \u201cEnsuring Integrity\u201d legislation and vindication of their most fundamental economic politics, I\u2019d politely suggest that the famously birdwatching McManus is more sensibly depicted as an owl. Owls have long memories. They hunt moving targets. Oh, and owls eat scorpions - don\u2019t you know? \u2022 Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnist",

Instead we can only look back on what we are potentially missing this time around. A decade ago Rafael Nadal powered past Robin Soderling to claim one of his 12 titles at Roland Garros. It made up for being shocked by the Swede the previous year, one of only a handful of career losses in the French capital. It also means we will miss out this sort of light-hearted banter, when Goran Ivanisevic swapped his racket with a ball boy in 2015, not to mention this gloriousness from Jo-Wilfred Tsonga. Twenty years ago, Mary Pierce produces one of the great trick shots on French soil. 5) The revived rugby league Ashes series is the latest to be cancelled due to coronavirus, meaning we will miss out on classics like this from 2003 and more attritional stuff from 1994. It does at least mean we will be spared unsavoury incidents. 6) Technically, pigeon racing was the first competitive sport to return to these shores. It might be all flat caps and feathers in the UK, but for the Chinese it is very big business. Although, it surprising how many stereotypes are ticked on in this documentary. Not to mention the fact that Mike Tyson is a fan. Our favourites from below the line last week 1) The state of the pitch for the 1970 League Cup final was terrible. Still, at least it\u2019s not as bad as this. 2) Celebrity golfing, you say? Try Terry Wogan holing what was then the longest televised putt. 3) Final Score from 1986. How does your team get on? 4) Some more archival football, from 1902. And seeing as it\u2019s about FA Cup final time \u2013 Path\u00e9 covered the 1963 final in colour and with slow motion.

Power was asked to confirm whether he remained a shareholder in Fortescue, and whether the proposed pipeline would benefit that company. He confirmed he remained a shareholder in Fortescue, and he acknowledged that FMG had lobbied for a trans-continental gas pipeline when he was the chief executive. But Power said Fortescue would not benefit from the pipeline now, because it had not developed gas interests. Asked whether he had recused himself from discussions among commissioners about developing gas as part of the Covid-19 recovery, Power replied: \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d In response to questions about his remuneration, Power confirmed he was being paid $267,345 to cover his expenses. He said the money was paid into a trust, and he said the trust paid tax in according with tax office rules. Officials from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet said Power was not required to keep receipts to demonstrate expenses. Power commutes to Canberra on a private aircraft. He told the hearing he piloted the plane, and had periodically given Perth-based government ministers a ride home to the west during the Covid crisis. He had sought and been granted an exemption for travel, because WA has closed the border. Power was also granted an exemption to fly to Queensland to manage his private agricultural interests. Malcolm Thompson, the deputy chief executive officer of the NCCC, told the hearing commissioners had procedures to declare conflicts of interest. At a hearing of the Senate committee in mid-May, NCCC officials said Liveris was not required to make a disclosure because he was an adviser to the commission, not a commissioner. But on Thursday, Thompson told the committee Liveris had now been required to make a conflict of interest declaration. He said declarations had also been sought from the chair and all the members of an industrial relations taskforce appended to the commission. Thompson also indicated the budget for the NCCC had increased from $3m to $5.4m.",

Thousands of hectares of Amazon are being felled every year to graze cattle and provide meat for world markets. As well as providing financial backing for Minerva, Brazil\u2019s second largest beef exporter, and Marfrig, its second largest meat processing company, UK-based financial institutions held tens of millions of dollars worth of shares in JBS, the world\u2019s largest meat company. All three meat companies have been linked to deforestation in their supply chains, though they say they are working to monitor their suppliers and mitigate risks. Marfrig, a Brazilian meat company that has supplied fast-food chains around the world, was found to have bought cattle from a farm that had been using deforested land last year. JBS remains unable to monitor a significant proportion of its suppliers despite operating deep in the Amazon, while last year Marfrig admitted that more than half of the cattle it slaughtered originated from indirect suppliers that it could not monitor. According to a joint investigation by the Guardian, Unearthed and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, financial data between January 2013 and May 2019 shows that HSBC underwrote $1.1bn of bonds for Marfrig and $917m for Minerva.

I really didn\u2019t want to see a recession ever again in Australia. And as a government, we worked so hard to bring the budget back into balance, to create one and a half million jobs. And there were many sacrifices that had to be achieved to get Australia\u2019s economy back on track and to see Covid-19 hit it like a torpedo is absolutely devastating.

They\u2019ve been hit by the same risks that we have. But Australia\u2019s resolve has been so much better and one of the reasons for that is that people were drawn together. As a government, we have brought people together. As a prime minister, I\u2019ve sought to bring people, the treasurer the same, all of my ministers in our federal cabinet, working with states, territories, industry, the various groups that are

date \u2013 and a definition \u2013 for eliminating Covid-19 from it\u2019s shores:</p> \n  <p>(via AAP)<br></p> \n  <p>New Zealand finally has a date for when it will achieve its lofty goal of elimination of Covid-19:<strong> June 15.</strong></p> \n  <p>After weeks of urging by public health experts and government wrangling, the country\u2019s Health Department has settled on a definition of elimination of the deadly virus.</p> \n  <p>New Zealand has followed an elimination policy path since the arrival of the virus, eschewing lighter approaches by countries including Australia.</p> \n  <p>The Kiwi approach, including a seven-week lockdown, is paying dividends.</p> \n  <p>On Thursday, health officials announced they had found no new cases of the virus for the 13th straight day, from thousands of tests.</p> \n  <p>Just one person in New Zealand has Covid-19, an Aucklander currently isolating who is due to be asymptomatic this week, should the virus follow a normal course.</p> \n  <p>Australia currently has 491 active cases.<br></p> \n  <p>However, the final Kiwi case is irrelevant to whether New Zealand has eliminated the disease.</p> \n  <p>The Ministry of Health now says elimination can be declared 28 days after the last case from a \u201clocally acquired unknown source\u201d, or community transmission, has completed their treatment and tested negative.</p> \n  <p>According to the ministry, New Zealand\u2019s last case of community transmission tested positive on 29 April, and was in isolation until 18 May.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAs per the definition of elimination, the 28-day period would be counted from that person\u2019s exit from isolation,\u201d a department spokeswoman told AAP.</p> \n  <p>That means when director general of health <strong>Ashley Bloomfield </strong>holds his regular daily briefing on 15 June \u2013 28 days from 18 May\u2013 he will be able to say New Zealand has eliminated Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>Of course, a subsequent discovery of another case of community transmission would restart the clock towards the elimination milestone.</p> \n  <p>The date has symbolic meaning but Bloomfield said it wouldn\u2019t stop the government\u2019s ongoing work to prevent new cases.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cElimination is an ongoing process,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt may well be there is no domestic onshore transmission or onshore infections of Covid-19. It would be great if we reached that point and it\u2019s increasingly looking like we are.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut our elimination strategy is ongoing because we clearly still have measures at the border and a desire to open up the border in a safe way.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf534f9bbe3cabf72871ef62ae131caae1e83ccd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf534f9bbe3cabf72871ef62ae131caae1e83ccd/0_0_5400_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Health and safety signage at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Health and safety signage at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hagen Hopkins/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T02:13:40.762Z\">at 3.13am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed8509d8f082107f453a5ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T01:39:23.296Z\">2.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Australian Council of Social Services is also not thrilled with the homebuilder program:</p> \n  <p>The Australian Council of Social Service rejects the federal government\u2019s plan to provide large grants to home builders and renovators as a wasted opportunity to address the backlog of urgent social housing repairs and the shortfall in social housing stock. </p> \n  <p>Australian Council of Social Service CEO Dr <strong>Cassandra Goldie </strong>said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is no argument that the construction sector needs a shot in the arm, but this money will not go where it is most needed.

The fall follows a rise of 8.5% in March 2020. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cCovid-19 continued to affect retail trade in April with many retail businesses closing their physical stores during April due to restrictions relating to social distancing,\u201d said <strong>Ben James</strong>, director of Quarterly Economy Wide Surveys. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThere were record falls in cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services (-35.4%), and clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing (-53.6%), as well as a large fall in department stores (-14.9%).\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Food retailing (-17.4%) led the falls in dollar terms this month following unprecedented demand in March. Spending in food retailing remains 5.1% above the level of April 2019, likely reflecting additional meals being consumed at home during April 2020. Other retailing (-14.4%) fell after a large rise in March, while household goods retailing (-0.1%) saw a minor fall in sales as falls from closures of some physical stores were offset by a rise in hardware, building and garden supply retailing. <br></p> \n  <p>In seasonally adjusted terms, there were falls in Victoria (-21.1%), New South Wales (-17.5%), Queensland (-15.7%), Western Australia (-16.8%), South Australia (-14.6%, Tasmania (-17.5%), the Australian Capital Territory (-14.9%), and the Northern Territory (-7.7%) in April 2020. <br></p> \n  <p>The closure of physical stores in some industries led to a rise in online retail turnover, which contributed 11.1% to total retail turnover in original terms in April 2020, up from 7.1% in March 2020. In April 2019, online retail turnover contributed 5.7% to total retail.

      "bodyText": "With that, we\u2019ll leave you for the day. Thanks for reading. Stay safe. Let\u2019s wrap up the main events of today. The Morrison government unveiled its homebuilder program, although it\u2019s been criticised by economists and Labor for its design. NSW recorded a week with no Covid cases. Biosecurity restrictions will be lifted in WA. In good news for the proposed \u201ctravel bubble\u201d, New Zealand expects to eliminate Covid by 15 June. Queensland\u2019s judicial system has been buried under a backlog of some 18,000 magistrate\u2019s court cases which are expected to take a year to clear. The build-up is because the magistrates court heavily scaled back operations in mid-March because of coronavirus as jury trials ceased in the supreme and district courts, according to AAP. The magistrates courts are due to resume, while a jury trial has been set down for the district court on June 22, according to correspondence sent to Queensland\u2019s legal fraternity. Several hundred cases are expected to be scheduled for both the Brisbane and Southport magistrates court when they return in the coming weeks. On the issue of airlines, Catherine King, Labor\u2019s transport spokeswoman, says in a statement: The Morrison government\u2019s underwriting of the domestic network has kept a small number of flights in the air over the last two months, but if they let their agreement expire next week many regions around Australia will suddenly find themselves without access to the air routes that are vital to their economies. Throughout this crisis the Morrison government has refused to extend jobkeeper to thousands of aviation workers and allowed Virgin Australia to fall into voluntary administration through a lack of support. The government cannot allow regions across our country to be left without flights. South Australia is once again free of active Covid-19 cases, AAP reports. SA Health says a woman who tested positive to the infection when she arrived from Victoria last month has now been cleared of the disease. The woman had arrived on 24 May after travelling from Britain. She was given an exemption on compassionate grounds to come to Adelaide to visit her dying father despite only spending about a week in quarantine in Melbourne. But after missing an email from their Victorian counterparts, local health officials failed to meet her at Adelaide airport, forcing her to identify herself to police. She had tested negative for coronavirus while in isolation in Victoria, but tested positive after arriving in SA, forcing about 20 people she had been in contact with into self-isolation. SA had previously cleared all its active Covid-19 cases on 15 May and had not reported a new case for about three weeks before the woman\u2019s arrival. The state\u2019s total remains at 440 with 436 of those now cleared. Four people have died from the disease. A few in the disability community have made a similar point. Further to my last blog post on the Australia and India virtual summit, the two countries have agreed to work together to support the rules-based maritime order in the Indo-Pacific region. A statement issued by Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said the two countries would expand their cooperation on maritime safety and security, including by building stronger links between coastguard and civil maritime agencies, and by developing deeper navy-to-navy engagement. Payne did not directly mention China or the territorial disputes in the South China Sea, but underlined the need to respect the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. She said the Joint Declaration on Maritime Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific \u201ccommits our nations to supporting the rules-based maritime order in the region, founded on respect for the sovereignty of all nations and international law, particularly the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea\u201d. \u201cImportantly, the partnership extends to working together to strengthen maritime domain awareness throughout the Indo-Pacific, and combating transnational challenges such as people smuggling, arms and narcotics trafficking, climate change, terrorism, and illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing.\u201d Payne said the two sides had also signed an agreement to cooperate on cyber and critical technology issues. They would aim to \u201cpromote and preserve an open, free, safe and secure Internet, enhance digital trade, harness critical technology opportunities and address cyber security challenges\u201d. Because of coronavirus-related travel restrictions, Scott Morrison met with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, by video-link this afternoon. In the \u201cvirtual meeting\u201d \u2013 the opening portion of which was open to the cameras \u2013 the pair agreed to elevate the relationship between Australia and India to a comprehensive strategic partnership. Previously Australia and India had what the diplomats call a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d. Morrison went big on the theme of building trust: \u201cIn a time like this we want to deal very much with friends and trusted partners, and this is a partnership which has stood the test of time, and is during the course of this current crisis.\u201d Morrison told Modi he hoped to see an increase in the levels of trade and investment flows between Australia and India, because the current levels were \u201cnot where you or I would both like them to be, but they are growing, and they can grow a lot faster\u201d. \u201cBut I think the comprehensive strategic partnership that we are forming today going to a whole new level of relationship will continue to build the trust. Because we want commercial and training relationships that are built on trust.\u201d The Queensland government has less than a week to prepare its defence against two challenges to its constitutional right to keep the state\u2019s borders closed amid the coronavirus pandemic. AAP reports that the high court in Brisbane on Thursday ordered the government\u2019s lawyers to submit their case by Monday ahead of two 12 June directions hearings for challenges by outspoken billionaire businessman Clive Palmer and Travel Essence. Palmer\u2019s challenge through his flagship company Mineralogy is expected to be heard by the full bench on 29 June. The Travel Essence challenge, which is understood to be a consortium of six plaintiffs, is not as far progressed with the chief justice, Susan Kiefel, likely to indicate when it will be heard on 23 June. The Grattan Institute is pretty categorical about the government\u2019s homebuilder scheme. Is it a well constructed package? \u201cNo, I think this is a case of where classic retail politics has got in the way of the economics,\u201d Grattan\u2019s Brendan Coates tells Patricia Karvelas. This will be one to watch. Staying with the protests, the Labor MP Peter Khalil says on the ABC he is hoping to go to the Black Lives Matter protest in Melbourne on Saturday. The Liberal MP Katie Allen says she won\u2019t be, but that\u2019s because Covid-19 restrictions are in place. Khalil gets a question about the fact the premier is saying people should not attend, which he sidesteps. Returning to Victoria, Victoria police has outlined the figures around Covid-19 fines by local government area. The issue has been picked up by the Victorian Greens MP Tim Read. The party quizzed authorities about the fines at a recent parliamentary hearing and said it \u201chighlights that Melbourne (590), Greater Dandenong (333) and Frankston (297) were the localities with the highest number of fines issued\u201d. \u201cThere is a wide variation across Victoria in the rate at which fines have been issued,\u201d a statement read. \u201cFor example, almost five fines were issued per every 1,000 head of population in Corangamite \u2013 almost double the rate of any other area in Victoria.\u201d Coming up tonight ... There have been 6,813 reduced rent agreements lodged with Victoria\u2019s Consumer Affairs authority up to 11 May 2020. The figure is contained in answers to questions lodged with Paec, a Victorian parliamentary committee. The committee also said there had been 216 disagreements between tenants and landlords referred to Dispute Settlement Centre Victoria for specialised mediation. As of 11 May, no rent relief payments had been made. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has said people should not go to the Black Lives Matter protests scheduled for Saturday, citing coronavirus concerns. Although police have said they will not issue fines at the event, which more than 17,000 people say they plan to attend, Andrews said Covid-19 rules should still be followed and that the restrictions were \u201cthere to keep people safe\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not going to the protest. I would suggest to other people they shouldn\u2019t go to the protest either,\u201d he told reporters on Thursday. \u201cI understand the depth of feeling on this issue, but I might make the point this way \u2013 enough people have been hurt. \u201cLet\u2019s not do anything on the weekend that compromises safety, let\u2019s not do anything on the weekend that potentially spreads the virus.\u201d The health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said: \u201cBlack lives do matter. We know that Aboriginal people are more susceptible to becoming severely ill if they contract coronavirus, and I urge them to heed the advice of the chief health officer to follow all of the health advice, and that is to stay home.\u201d Event organisers Warriors of the Aboriginal Resistance have shared a list of Covid-19 precautions that must be followed, including wearing masks, bringing hand sanitiser and maintaining social distancing, according to AAP. \u201cWe will protest because we believe that standing up for Black peoples right to life is an ESSENTIAL SERVICE,\u201d they posted on Thursday. \u201cWe are working closely with health authorities to make sure the march will be as safe as can possibly be.\u201d Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, has issued the state\u2019s daily update. It says: Total cases increased by eight to 1,678. No new deaths were recorded, keeping the death toll in Victoria at 19. Seven people are in hospital, including two in ICU. \u201cOf yesterday\u2019s cases, six were detected in returned travellers in hotel quarantine and one case is under investigation,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe remaining case is a household contact linked to the outbreak at Rydges on Swanston, which now has 13 confirmed cases. \u201cThe department is working with Global Resource Recovery in Laverton after two employees tested positive last week. These cases are part of the Keilor Downs family outbreak.\u201d My colleague Matilda Boseley reports: Pressure is mounting on governments to reopen trans-Tasman travel as industry groups ask for travellers\u2019 expressions of interest in New Zealand flights leaving as early as 1 July. Australia\u2019s trade surplus eased in April to a seasonally adjusted $8.8bn amid widespread restrictions to check the spread of coronavirus. AAP reports that the result was better than market expectations for a surplus of about $7.5bn and comes after the trade surplus more than doubled in March to a record $10.6bn. Exports of goods and services dropped 11% to $37.5bn, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. The fall was mainly on account of lower exports of iron ore and coal, natural gas and machinery. Imports were down 10% to $28.7bn. This was mainly on account of lower demand for gold, fuels and lubricants and services. Qantas has announced the airline and its low-cost carrier Jetstar will scale up flights on domestic and regional routes in June and July, AAP reports. Capacity will increase to 15% of pre-coronavirus levels, or more than 300 return flights a week by the end of June, the airline says. Australia\u2019s flag carrier is currently operating domestic capacity at just 5% of pre-coronavirus levels following government restrictions on travel and has stood down two-thirds of its 30,000-member workforce until the end of June. Qantas says it could boost domestic flights up to 40% of the group\u2019s pre-crisis domestic capacity by the end of July, depending on demand and further relaxation of state borders. \u201cWe know there is a lot of pent-up demand for air travel and we are already seeing a big increase in customers booking and planning flights in the weeks and months ahead,\u201d the Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, said. \u201cThese additional flights are an important first step to help get more people out into communities that rely on tourism and bring a much-needed boost to local businesses.\u201d The airline will boost services on capital city routes, particularly Melbourne-Sydney and a number of routes to and from Canberra. It will also increase intrastate flights for Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia. Qantas said it would also begin flights from Sydney to Byron Bay after the route launch was postponed due to the coronavirus. A Western Australian police statement says roadside breath testing is set to resume in the state. \u201cThe WA police force are to recommence roadside random breath testing (RBT), including the deployment of breath and drug buses on Saturday 6 June 2020,\u201d it said. \u201cThe high-volume static testing was temporarily suspended in mid-March 2020 due to the health risks associated with the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cRoadside testing continued, through random and targeted high-visibility traffic patrols during this period. \u201cThe re-commencement of breath and drug bus operations is occurring, following extensive consultation with the Department of Health.\u201d Some news for those in South Australia from AAP. Speeding motorists will be fined more after the South Australian government announced a 1.9% rise in fees, fines and charges for the next financial year. Under the scheme, drivers caught exceeding the limit by less than 10km/h will be fined an extra $3, totalling $180, while motorists speeding 10-20km/h will be charged $408, up by $8. Those guilty of not wearing a seatbelt will pay an extra $7, costing $388, and motorists using a mobile phone will have their fine rise by $10 to $544. Announcing the increase on Thursday, the state government said it was in line with the standard indexation rate and was below the current rate of inflation. Hi there, thanks to Amy for her work today. I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours. Get in touch on luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com or @lukehgomes. On that note, I am going to hand you over to the brilliant Luke-Henriques-Gomes. I\u2019ll be back next week when parliament resumes on Wednesday. Until then, please, take care of you. Things are getting back to normal in Queensland politics as well \u2013 two ministers, Steven Miles and Mick Di Brenni, have just allowed themselves to be filmed weightlifting to celebrate gyms being reopened in that state today: Miles: I know a lot of people have missed their chance to get to the gym through iso life. And so whether you\u2019ve been hanging out for a spin class, a step class, to get on a tready or to pump some weights, now is the time to get out and do it. It\u2019s great exercise, really good for your mental wellbeing, and I know for a lot of people it\u2019s a social opportunity as well. Of course, we are still asking you to maintain your social distance, wipe down your gear after you\u2019ve used it, but that\u2019s all the kind of thing that\u2019s covered off in this Covid-safe plan. There is an election in October. Not that that could have anything to do with weightlifting for the cameras. It looks like politics as usual has returned to Tasmania: Air New Zealand is looking at resuming some sort of pre-Covid normality. New Zealand is hoping it can say it has been successful in eliminating Covid-19 on 15 June. AAP reports Air New Zealand is getting ready to boost its schedule: In a further sign of New Zealand\u2019s recovery, the national carrier will return to half of its pre-coronavirus capacity next month. Air New Zealand says it plans to operate at 55% of domestic capacity in July and August after Kiwis showed their appetite to return to the skies. \u201cWe\u2019ve been encouraged by demand from leisure travellers recently and we\u2019re also expecting demand for business travel to continue to build,\u201d the Air NZ executive Scott Carr said on Wednesday. \u201cAs a result, we have been working to add more flying to our domestic schedule from next month and this includes additional services for the July school holidays.\u201d North Island resort town Taupo and South Island city Timaru will come back on line next week, bringing the number of domestic destinations to 20. Air New Zealand has slashed international services due to Covid-19, but is still running flights to Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Los Angeles and Hong Kong for those people permitted to move between countries. For a visual on what is happening in the retail industry, here is Grogs: Queensland\u2019s health minister, Steven Miles, says the state is down to just three active cases of Covid-19. A truly incredible result. Two of those are currently in hospital. One is in ICU and they are receiving ventilation. We\u2019ve now tested 198,292 people. That\u2019s an increase of 4,416, so close to that target we set ourselves of 200,000 a little time ago. And the intrastate tourism flights are on the increase. Miles: The Queensland government is really pleased to welcome the announcement today by Qantas and Jetstar that they will provide 62 additional flights into regional Queensland, intrastate flights into regional Queensland. There is now no excuse, no excuse not to plan your Queensland getaway. The seven new flights into Cairns, seven into Townsville, eight into Rockhampton, seven into Mackay, three to the Whitsundays, right across Queensland you will now be able to fly to some of those tourism hot spots. Parliament should be fun next week. This was part of Jim Chalmers\u2019s speech to workers rallying in Brisbane, after being left out of Jobkeeper: Josh Frydenberg yesterday was boasting that our recession is better than the Americans\u2019. Well, that\u2019s cold comfort, isn\u2019t it? That kind of boast, that it\u2019s better than it is in America as America tears itself apart in lots of ways, or this boast that things are a little bit better than he thought they might have been a couple of months ago doesn\u2019t pay your rent or your mortgage, does it? That doesn\u2019t put food on your table, or school shoes on your kids. We need and expect much better from this government. About 35 million hectares of Australia burned during the 2019-2020 bushfire season, the bushfire royal commission has heard. That\u2019s about 4.5% of Australia\u2019s total landmass, or one Germany. Andrew Colvin, the head of the National Bushfire Recovery Agency, said that figure came from the federal department of agriculture, water and the environment. The footprint of areas that are eligible to receive emergency bushfire assistance is much smaller \u2013 111 local government areas in New South Wales, the ACT, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. Colvin said the differences between payments available in each jurisdiction created confusion and he wanted to implement \u201cno wrong door and one-stop-shop principles\u201d to make it easier for those impacted by fire to get assistance. \u201cIt would be ideal that a victim of a bushfire only ever needs to talk to one person and tell their story once, because every time they have to tell their story we\u2019re effectively retraumatising that individual.\u201d Colvin said the emergency response at relief centres was \u201coverwhelming\u201d even to him and there should be a single national coordination point for all disaster relief responses. \u201cI can only imagine what it was like for somebody who was trying to bring their life back together \u2026 We should be trying to do better here.\u201d Charities, other government agencies like Services Australia, and bushfire victims have all told the royal commission the same thing \u2013 they want one point of entry for assistance. Shane Stone, the coordinator general of the National Drought and Northern Queensland Flood Response Agency, said that the overarching structure of support should be national and permanent but that the actual assistance on the ground had to be led by local communities. \u201cThere is no greater sceptic than the Australian public when you turn up and say \u2018I\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help\u2019. You need to get boots on the ground quickly and that\u2019s part of our ethos, boots on the ground.\u201d He added: \u201cAt the end of the day you will be judged by how quickly you arrived on the ground and how quickly you delivered the first support for people caught up in a dire situation.\u201d Greta Thunberg is also trending in Australia. At least that gives him another column idea. His latest offerings have been so tired, they\u2019ve put hyperactive toddlers to sleep. You can read the full Guardian Australia report here: Thredbo has released its daily lift pass price list (it plans on reopening for the season from 22 June). It looks like a very expensive day out: One Day Lift Pass Prices* 22 to 64 years: $159 18 to 21 years: $149 13 to 17 years: $95 5 to 12 years: $85 65 to 69 years: $85 70+ years: $40 *This year, there are no discounts for multi-day passes or based on seasonality. Four and under pricing TBC. Scott Cam is currently trending on Australian Twitter. At one time the TV personality worked in construction. He has spent the past two decades or so wearing shorts and steel-capped boots on TV, earning the Gold Logie, because apparently, at some point, he was considered the cream of Australian TV talent. He\u2019s now being paid $347,000 by the government as a national careers ambassador, because there is nothing like a boomer to convince teenagers to take up a job. (And seemed quite cranky at the idea that people might want to know what he was getting paid, despite it being taxpayer-funded.) But from what I can tell, no, homebuilder was not his idea. My colleague Paul Karp is looking a little more deeper into the homebuilder policy and wants to hear from you if you have done a $150,000 renovation, or are considering one that will cost that much, or know someone who has. What will $150,000 buy you, in the reno stakes? The homebuilder scheme is available to owner-occupiers spending $150,000 or more on \u201csubstantial renovations\u201d. We\u2019ve heard from quite a few readers that their renovations were big but didn\u2019t cost anywhere near that. Now we want to hear from readers who have either spent or worked on a renovation costing $150,000 or more. What does that kind of money buy you? Please email paul.karp@theguardian.com Meanwhile, there is also this happening behind the scenes, which deserves more attention: It is not just NSW having problems with the pay freeze policy. Queensland\u2019s Labor government is having a moment as well. I missed this. But the prime minister addressed the \u201cget off my lawn\u201d incident on Ray Hadley\u2019s program this morning: It was quite funny because we were out there at Googong which is you know a housing estate like so many all around the country, and people are very house-proud and this bloke had just built his house and all the media was standing on part of his lawn that he\u2019d re-seeded. And so he wasn\u2019t yelling at me but he came and said \u201cget off my lawn\u201d. So I ushered them all off the lawned area and he was quite happy then, he said thanks and went back inside. So it was, it was quite funny actually. Adam Bandt has responded to the $688m (forecast) homebuilder program: Public money should be used to create construction jobs and tackle homelessness by building public housing, not to lift house values for people who can already afford large renovations. We should build homes for the hundreds of thousands of people who are homeless or on public housing waiting lists, not hand out granite benchtop grants. More than a million people are in housing stress, about to default on their mortgage, or on public housing waiting lists, but Scott Morrison is using public money to make the problem worse. Everyone deserves the dignity of a safe and secure home. However, this package will make that a more distant goal for millions of people. It will make housing inequality worse in Australia. Through this scheme, a couple on $200k a year with no mortgage could turn their $1.4m home into a $2m+ mansion. Meanwhile, a single parent on the public housing waitlist will see the median house price drift further out of reach. Over 116,000 people face sleeping rough each night, but instead of putting a roof over their heads, Scott Morrison has decided to hand out granite benchtop grants to people with incomes and wealth high enough to weather the corona crisis. Perversely, Labor\u2019s saying the grants are too restrictive and don\u2019t allow people to upgrade their swimming pools. Instead of backing big government investment in public housing, Labor is calling for the superannuation industry to build homes, which will do little to address the growing public housing waiting lists. If Labor\u2019s only contribution to fixing this appalling policy is to secure the inclusion of lap pool grants, they will have comprehensively abandoned working class people in Australia.\u201d Linda Burney spoke to the Seven Network this morning about what it felt like to see the video of a NSW police officer sweeping the legs out under an Indigenous teenager he was arresting, which the police commissioner Mick Fuller has acknowledged \u201ccould have been handled better\u201d, but added that the officer may have been having \u201ca bad day\u201d. The officer\u2019s conduct is under investigation. Burney: I think my reaction was the reaction that most people would have. Looking at that power imbalance at the scene and understanding that the policing that we saw with that young boy is not appropriate, and I note that the family talking about legal action, so I don\u2019t want to make too much more comment. I think the most important thing, with your show and with people making public comments is to talk about constructive ways to rebalance the relationship between Aboriginal communities, Aboriginal people, Aboriginal young people and the police. ... I think there have been some remarkable efforts between Aboriginal communities, Aboriginal organisations and police commands to overcome a history \u2013 a terrible history, of police and Aboriginal people. I mean, people need to understand that it was actually the police \u2013 whether they wanted to not, that were the main instrumentality in the forced removal of Aboriginal children. And most Aboriginal families can relate to stories of overzealous policing with their young people. But as I say, the most important thing is to use this as an opportunity to examine what has happened in terms of the implementation of the royal commission\u2019s recommendation some 30 years ago, and to also work constructively between governments, the community and the police force, including the police union, to address some of these issues. Here is that whole question and answer with Scott Morrison on Australia entering recession: Q: Prime minister, Wayne Swan could never say the word \u201cdeficit\u201d, can you say \u201crecession\u201d? Morrison: It\u2019s certainly something that I never wanted to see happen in Australia ever again. I really didn\u2019t want to see a recession ever again in Australia. And as a government, we worked so hard to bring the budget back into balance, to create one and a half million jobs. And there were many sacrifices that had to be achieved to get Australia\u2019s economy back on track and to see Covid-19 hit it like a torpedo is absolutely devastating. And so where we find ourselves now is heartbreaking. But what you do is you respond and you pull together and that\u2019s what the country is doing. I think one of the things Australia has done to its credit and is a reason for our success compared to so many other countries, countries just like ours, sophisticated developed economies, democracies. They\u2019ve been hit by the same risks that we have. But Australia\u2019s resolve has been so much better and one of the reasons for that is that people were drawn together. As a government, we have brought people together. As a prime minister, I\u2019ve sought to bring people, the treasurer the same, all of my ministers in our federal cabinet, working with states, territories, industry, the various groups that are impacted, day in and day out, to bring Australians together to get through this crisis and today is another example. The prime minister says he doesn\u2019t want Australians to \u201cimport\u201d America\u2019s race issues, here. Anyone who has been paying attention should know there is no need to import something which has always been part of the systems we, ourselves, built in this nation. New Zealand has set a date \u2013 and a definition \u2013 for eliminating Covid-19 from it\u2019s shores: (via AAP) New Zealand finally has a date for when it will achieve its lofty goal of elimination of Covid-19: June 15. After weeks of urging by public health experts and government wrangling, the country\u2019s Health Department has settled on a definition of elimination of the deadly virus. New Zealand has followed an elimination policy path since the arrival of the virus, eschewing lighter approaches by countries including Australia. The Kiwi approach, including a seven-week lockdown, is paying dividends. On Thursday, health officials announced they had found no new cases of the virus for the 13th straight day, from thousands of tests. Just one person in New Zealand has Covid-19, an Aucklander currently isolating who is due to be asymptomatic this week, should the virus follow a normal course. Australia currently has 491 active cases. However, the final Kiwi case is irrelevant to whether New Zealand has eliminated the disease. The Ministry of Health now says elimination can be declared 28 days after the last case from a \u201clocally acquired unknown source\u201d, or community transmission, has completed their treatment and tested negative. According to the ministry, New Zealand\u2019s last case of community transmission tested positive on 29 April, and was in isolation until 18 May. \u201cAs per the definition of elimination, the 28-day period would be counted from that person\u2019s exit from isolation,\u201d a department spokeswoman told AAP. That means when director general of health Ashley Bloomfield holds his regular daily briefing on 15 June \u2013 28 days from 18 May\u2013 he will be able to say New Zealand has eliminated Covid-19. Of course, a subsequent discovery of another case of community transmission would restart the clock towards the elimination milestone. The date has symbolic meaning but Bloomfield said it wouldn\u2019t stop the government\u2019s ongoing work to prevent new cases. \u201cElimination is an ongoing process,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may well be there is no domestic onshore transmission or onshore infections of Covid-19. It would be great if we reached that point and it\u2019s increasingly looking like we are. \u201cBut our elimination strategy is ongoing because we clearly still have measures at the border and a desire to open up the border in a safe way.\u201d The Australian Council of Social Services is also not thrilled with the homebuilder program: The Australian Council of Social Service rejects the federal government\u2019s plan to provide large grants to home builders and renovators as a wasted opportunity to address the backlog of urgent social housing repairs and the shortfall in social housing stock. Australian Council of Social Service CEO Dr Cassandra Goldie said: There is no argument that the construction sector needs a shot in the arm, but this money will not go where it is most needed. It will largely benefit those on middle and higher incomes undertaking costly renovations, without any related social or environmental benefits. The risk is that it will saddle people with huge debts that they may not end up being able to afford, especially given the uncertainty of the job market. We are in a recession, with more and more people struggling to pay rent, which will only lead to greater homelessness. We should be focusing on ensuring everyone has a roof over head, not on government support for people who are relatively well off to upgrade their roofs. The ABS has another update on retail spending: Australian retail turnover fell 17.7% in April 2020, seasonally adjusted, according to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Retail Trade figures. This is a minor revision to the fall of 17.9% published in the preliminary retail turnover release of 20 May 2020. The fall follows a rise of 8.5% in March 2020. \u201cCovid-19 continued to affect retail trade in April with many retail businesses closing their physical stores during April due to restrictions relating to social distancing,\u201d said Ben James, director of Quarterly Economy Wide Surveys. \u201cThere were record falls in cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services (-35.4%), and clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing (-53.6%), as well as a large fall in department stores (-14.9%).\u201d Food retailing (-17.4%) led the falls in dollar terms this month following unprecedented demand in March. Spending in food retailing remains 5.1% above the level of April 2019, likely reflecting additional meals being consumed at home during April 2020. Other retailing (-14.4%) fell after a large rise in March, while household goods retailing (-0.1%) saw a minor fall in sales as falls from closures of some physical stores were offset by a rise in hardware, building and garden supply retailing. In seasonally adjusted terms, there were falls in Victoria (-21.1%), New South Wales (-17.5%), Queensland (-15.7%), Western Australia (-16.8%), South Australia (-14.6%, Tasmania (-17.5%), the Australian Capital Territory (-14.9%), and the Northern Territory (-7.7%) in April 2020. The closure of physical stores in some industries led to a rise in online retail turnover, which contributed 11.1% to total retail turnover in original terms in April 2020, up from 7.1% in March 2020. In April 2019, online retail turnover contributed 5.7% to total retail. Additional analysis noted that online sales made up over 20.5% of sales across household goods retailing, clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing, department stores, and other retailing. AAP has an update on Western Australia\u2019s biosecurity restrictions: Coronavirus-related biosecurity restrictions are set to be lifted in Western Australia\u2019s north, allowing travellers to return, but access to 274 remote Indigenous communities will remain off-limits. The commonwealth has agreed to the state government\u2019s request to remove the restrictions for the Kimberley, shire of Ngaanyatjarraku and parts of the East Pilbara on Friday. There are no active cases in WA\u2019s regional areas and no positive cases reported in remote communities. However, as of Thursday, there were 26 active cases in WA, including 20 crew members from the Al Kuwait livestock ship. \u201cAll Western Australians are urged to be aware of the high vulnerability of remote communities and to follow the restrictions to help keep them safe,\u201d WA Aboriginal affairs minister Ben Wyatt said. A raft of Covid-19 restrictions are being eased on Saturday including raising the limit on gatherings to 100 people, with 300 allowed in venues with multiple divided spaces. Many businesses will resume trading, including beauty parlours, cinemas and gyms, while Perth Zoo will again be open to the public after closing for the first time in its 122-year history. The federal government has processed more than 220,000 claims for bushfire assistance worth more than $240m, and some 84,000 families received a share in an additional $33m in disaster relief made available to people with children, the bushfire royal commission has heard. The bulk of those applications, about 216,000, were for the one-off $1,000 disaster recovery payment. About 11% of applications were rejected, and it took an average of six days to be declared eligible. A further 4,950 people were found eligible for a 13-week short-term income support payment, the disaster recovery allowance. A third of all people who applied for that support were rejected and the average processing time was 35 days. Michelle Lees, the deputy chief executive of Services Australia, said that applications were rejected if people\u2019s primary residence was outside an eligible local government area, or if damage to their property wasn\u2019t sufficient, or in the case of the DRA if they couldn\u2019t prove income loss. Services Australia also trialled the use of facial recognition technology to identify people who had lost identification documents, using drivers licence photos in Victoria and South Australia and passport photos in other jurisdictions. She said the different recovery payments available at commonwealth and state level could be \u201cconfusing\u201d and she would support a single point of entry for recovery payments. \u201cSo in my opinion, there may be some benefit to looking at whether those arrangements are consolidated in some way, or reviewed in some way, to consider whether it might be beneficial for individuals and more efficient to have one entity administer the payments.\u201d (A previous version of this post referenced fraudulent claims - that was in relation to a Queensland floods report, not the bushfires) Murray Watt: Does it undermine the functioning of the national cabinet for the prime minister to say things like, \u201cThere is no doubt that those sorts of borders do harm the economy, they do harm jobs and it\u2019s important we get those removed as soon as possible\u201d? Phil Gaetjens: Not in my view, senator. Watt: So it\u2019s a sovereign right when it suits the prime minister, but it\u2019s not a sovereign right and something he disagrees with [it]. Is that how it works? Gaetjens: Well no, I wouldn\u2019t say it works that way. Murray Watt wants to know why the prime minister has been attacking states over not opening their borders, given the states have their own powers of decision making in those areas. Most recently, Scott Morrison said this while speaking to Brisbane radio 4BC: Well, we need to open the borders. It\u2019s simple. I mean, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to get flights moving again and that\u2019s why that\u2019s so important. And the timetable that the national cabinet has is that interstate travel will be up and running again in July and so we need to get to that point and if we can do it sooner, I think that would be fantastic. I mean, states are taking their own health advice on this. But as you know, the national cabinet never made a decision to close any borders down. Phil Gaetjens: I think what the prime minister was referring to, was it was never a decision of national cabinet, to close or restrict borders, and it has never been the advice of [the national health advice committee] that that occur. I don\u2019t think he was saying anything about national cabinet. And, I, again I do not agree with the formulation that he attacked any state or territory. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian says there have been just two people return a positive Covid-19 test in the last 24 hours: Can I thank the more than 11,300 people that got tested in the last 24 hours. That is an outstanding result and one which we want to maintain. And during that last 24-hour period, there were only two cases, both in quarantine. We have gone a full week without a community-to-community transmission, that\u2019s a great result. We want to keep that going as much as we can especially given restrictions are easing, have eased, and this long weekend is an opportunity for people to enjoy the best that New South Wales has to offer in a safe way. Can I please stress to everybody that whilst we are doing very well, we\u2019re probably doing better than we anticipated at this stage of the pandemic, however we have to be cautious, we have to be vigilant, we have to be safe to make sure that even the mildest symptom means we get tested and stay home until we get the all-clear. The success will only continue with the good citizens of New South Wales continue to bring themselves forward for testing which is so important. Please know for some of us who may have been tested five or six weeks ago, if you get another set of symptoms, it means you have to go back and get another test. That is really important. You may have had a test already some time ago, but then you developed symptoms again. Please take that test because that will make a huge difference. Could the national cabinet make a decision that the federal cabinet alter? Phil Gaetjens: We\u2019ll be having a look at these things I suspect, and we will be making the detailed, if you like, rules that apply to that again and supply them the national cabinet for them to make their ultimate decision. So the rules haven\u2019t been finalised yet for national cabinet. Well, we will work because we actually have to set up, not more national cabinets being set up but we now have to set it up in terms of a different and longer-term structure. Phil Gaetjens tells Kristina Keneally his judgment is the national cabinet federation reform committees would also be covered by cabinet-in-confidence rules \u2013 and therefore exempt from FoIs. Katy Gallagher says the Covid-19 committee still can\u2019t get a straight answer on when chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy first briefed the cabinet on Covid-19. Gallagher says both Health and Treasury have referred questions on modelling to PM&amp;C. Which hasn\u2019t answered the questions. PM&amp;C\u2019s bosses says they have not advised the other departments to avoid the questions, and would only provide information on cabinet in-confidence protocols. A reminder that homebuilder (I will probably continue to call it a bunch of incorrect names because we have so many two-words mashed together policy names now, even Orwell would raise a brow) may not spend as much as the government has laid out ($688m is in the forecast cost). As Josh Frydenberg says: It is a demand-driven program, but we\u2019re expecting between 25 and 30,000 new builds or significant renovations and it\u2019s temporary. It\u2019s going to run till the end of the year. We\u2019re undertaking a review in the month of June and in the economic update that I and the finance minister will provide in July. It will include any changes that come out of the review into the jobkeeper program. But we do recognise that some industries, some sectors, will recover more slowly than others and that will be a function of the restrictions that may need to stay in place because of the threat from the coronavirus. I\u2019m talking particularly about the tourism sector and the impact of the international borders being closed. But we are responding, we\u2019re looking at the art sector and a package of measures building on what we have already announced there already. Today we\u2019re making an announcement about the housing sector and we\u2019ll continue to do what is necessary to get the economy to the other side of this pandemic. This is what Peter Whish-Wilson was asking about. Expect to hear a lot more of this, as the committee\u2019s recommendations are eventually rolled out. We already know, thanks to Adam Morton, that they believe gas needs more investment. Here is the exchange between Kristina Keneally and Nev Power about what he is being paid, and his transport choices: On pay (there was a mistake last meeting, after the PM&amp;C mixed up how much he was paid). KK: So if I can just confirm that the contract published on Austender shows that you are being paid $294,079.50 for your work. Is that correct? NP: I believe that\u2019s correct. Senator. KK: Thank you and is your position full-time? NP: Yes, it is. On transport: KK: OK, and when you conduct your role as chair, do you travel on your private jet? NP: Yes, I do. KK: Did you travel on your private jet to this hearing? NP: I\u2019ve been here since Monday ... or Sunday ... Monday. KK: You\u2019ve been where? Canberra? NP: I\u2019ve been in Canberra since Monday. KK: And did you travel there in your private jet? NP: I did. KK: OK. And on the guests on his plane: KK: Mr. Power I do need ask though the Sydney Morning Herald is reported on the fifth of May that you\u2019ve been [with] some West Australian government MPs on your private jet to and from Canberra, including the attorney general, the finance minister and the assistant to the prime minister Ben Morton, is that correct? NP: Yes, that\u2019s correct. I was going back I think that was predominantly for a trip back for Easter and offered them a lift. KK: And have any other ministers or government MPs flown on your private jet since you were appointed as chair? NP: No, I don\u2019t believe so. KK: OK. And Mr Porter was on at least one of those flights. Did you discuss industrial relations with him? NP: No, I did not. I pilot the aircraft and therefore up to the front, not in the cabin. KK: All right then. And in you pilot it all the time when you fly these government ministers? NP: I did. Peter Whish-Wilson is trying to find out why all members of the Covid-19 commission have not submitted conflicts of interest declarations. They weren\u2019t asked to. Marise Payne has released a statement after meeting with Pacific Island women ministers: The Pacific Women Leaders agreed to continue to work together to explore new ways to enhance the wellbeing of women and girls, including through social and development measures. The inaugural virtual gathering considered the needs of women and girls in government and community responses to the pandemic. The meeting of 30 Pacific women ministers, parliamentarians and senior civil servants from 18 countries affirmed our commitment to: \u00b7 Address critical needs for women healthcare workers\u2019 to access necessary resources, such as childcare, in order to carry out vital work safely \u00b7 Encourage measures and policies to promote gender equality, which have become more critical as the pandemic heightens the risk of violence against women and children \u00b7 Ensure recognition of the vital role women must play in the economic recovery of the region Pacific women must lead in the region\u2019s response to Covid-19 to ensure the interests of women and girls are at the forefront of government responses. Australia\u2019s Covid-19 Response and Recovery package includes a focus on the most vulnerable, particularly women and girls, with an additional $16m to address the differential impact of Covid-19 in the community. This builds on the Australian government\u2019s existing programs to support gender equality and empower women and girls in the Indo-Pacific region. A statement from the meeting is available here. Liberal senator James Paterson is asking what the \u201cpolicy\u201d rationale is on replacing Coag with the national cabinet. Phil Gaetjens says it will be more focused: I think what they\u2019re trying to do is extend the experience of the national cabinet dealing with a health issue to having that modality and method of dealing with issues as they arise, and it is an issue that is in the national interest for national leaders to actually address. Gaetjens says moving to a \u201ccabinet-style\u201d decision-making process \u2013 which makes everything discussed subject to cabinet in-confidence and therefore outside of FoIs, is necessary for a \u201ctightly focused leader driven management style\u201d. This is one way to describe a $60bn bungle. We usually give you a dose of Peter Dutton on Ray Hadley on Thursdays, but it looks like Scott Morrison took his spot today. The pair will have to wait until next week, when parliament is sitting, to have their catch-up. The Covid committee has got under way \u2013 Nev Power has confirmed he flew his private jet to Canberra on Monday. That\u2019s in relation to this story from Samantha Maiden. The Last Post ceremony is back at the War Memorial: The Last Post Ceremony to take place at 4.55pm on 1 July will commemorate the 75th anniversary of the amphibious landings of the Australian 7th Division at Balikpapan in New Guinea during the second world war. The ceremony will honour Private Leslie James Hanlon of the 2/27th Australian Infantry Battalion, who was killed during Operation Oboe Two. Director of the Australian War Memorial Matt Anderson said that he was looking forward to welcoming the public back to the daily ceremony and urged people who wished to attend to book a free ticket online. On the planned protests in Australia in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, Scott Morrison says: In terms of some of the violence we\u2019re seeing around the world today, for those Australians who find themselves in those situations, I would urge them to show great caution. Already we have had to provide support for those in the media sector, for journalists who have found themselves in those situations, and of course we will continue to provide that support. But I would urge people to be extremely cautious. These are dangerous situations and people should exercise great care in where they\u2019re placing themselves.\u201d Labor\u2019s Jason Clare says he can\u2019t imagine \u201ctoo many battlers\u201d have a lazy $150,000 around to renovate. It reminds of the movie the Wizard of oOz. Remember when they get to the Emerald City and they hear the big, booming voice of the Oz. And Toto pulls the curtain away and you find that he is not that great and powerful afterwards. The same with the housing package \u2013 all week we were told how big and old, and powerful it was going to be. Turns out it is not that big and powerful at all. For that last quote from the prime minister, I add this as some much-needed context, from Chris Knaus: Further to the \u201cget off my lawn\u201d comment: Scott Morrison says he \u201creally didn\u2019t want to see a recession ever again in Australia\u201d. The last time the \u2018R\u2019 word was mentioned was during the election campaign, when Morrison hinted Labor\u2019s tax plan could plunge the nation into an economic contraction. This is what he said, then, during the AFR conference in March 2019: Whether you are in business, whether you are raising a family, whether you\u2019re in retirement or entering into retirement, or whether you\u2019re a young person coming out of university, I was one of those who entered the economy under Labor in the 1990s that went into recession. We can\u2019t go back to that, we must go forward and we have the plans to take Australia there \u2026 I\u2019m saying the economy will be weaker under Labor \u2013 that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying, because they\u2019re going to put $200bn worth of taxes and take Australia\u2019s industrial relations system back to the times when we had recessions in this country. I\u2019m being very clear with Australians. No use on the other side going, \u2018Oh, I didn\u2019t really realise that it would have that impact.\u2019 It will have that impact.\u201d Speaking at the HouseBuilder launch today, where Sky\u2019s Thomas O\u2019Brien says a neighbour yelled at people to get off his lawn, Morrison said delivering the news of a recession (which was Josh Frydenberg\u2019s job yesterday) was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d. As a government we worked so hard to bring the budget back into balance ... to see Covid-19 hit it like a torpedo is absolutely devastating. Where we find ourselves now is heartbreaking. Here are the HomeBuilder numbers as the government sees them: From today until 31 December 2020, HomeBuilder will provide all eligible owner-occupiers (not just first home buyers) with a grant of $25,000 to build a new home or substantially renovate an existing home. Construction must be contracted to commence within three months of the contract date. HomeBuilder applicants will be subject to eligibility criteria, including income caps of $125,000 for singles and $200,000 for couples based on their latest assessable income. A national dwelling price cap of $750,000 will apply for new home builds, and a renovation price range of $150,000 up to $750,000 will apply to renovating an existing home with a current value of no more than $1.5 million. The program is expected to provide around 27,000 grants at a total cost of around $680 million. This increase in residential construction will help to fill the gap in construction activity expected in the second half of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. In doing so, HomeBuilder will help to support the 140,000 direct jobs and another 1,000,000 related jobs in the residential construction sector including businesses and sole-trader builders, contractors, property developers, construction materials manufacturers, engineers, designers and architects. (That difficult news by the way, was recession. We are in a recession. And while the March figures were bad, the June ones will only be worse.) Scott Morrison was out at sparrow\u2019s to speak about the construction stimulus package. He went to the Eden-Monaro electorate to tick off two boxes: You wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere else other than Australia, particularly in times like this. When we look around the world and we see what\u2019s happening. And Australia is certainly not immune from the difficult challenges that are being faced. But here in Australia, we\u2019re doing better than many, and better than most, and that\u2019s not just on the health front. Even with the difficult news that we had yesterday that the treasurer had to share, Australia is making its way and, importantly, we\u2019re making our way back. It\u2019s going to be a hard road back. There are many lives and livelihoods that are going to be impacted by the dreadful impact of the coronavirus, both on the health impact and on the economic impact. Jobs lost. Businesses closed. But Australia is reopening. And Australia is in that battle for jobs, and our government is in that battle for jobs. And in that battle for jobs, we\u2019ve got to deal with the difficulties in the short term and we have to deal with the challenges over the longer term as well. AAP reports that Tasmania is about to unveil its infrastructure spend: Premier Peter Gutwein will on Thursday detail the two-year spend, which he has said will build infrastructure worth $3.1 billion. The projects, including housing and roads, have been brought forward from a previously announced $3.7 billion four-year infrastructure plan. \u201cThis will be a construction blitz and it will be far-reaching,\u201d Mr Gutwein said on Wednesday. \u201cThese are challenging times but now is not the time to sit idle.\u201d The review of the jobkeeper wage subsidy program is due to start very soon. We know there are changes coming, including more industries which will be looked at, with the government moving to a more \u201ctargeted\u201d narrative in how it describes it. Here is what Josh Frydenberg had to say about that this morning: Many people are receiving the particular income support payment payments that we\u2019re providing. But, again, we\u2019re looking at all the sectors, how they\u2019re recovering as a function of the restrictions being eased. We\u2019ll take what actions we can. So from 10am in the Covid committee you have: Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Phil Gaetjens, secretary (appearing from 10am to 11am) Stephanie Foster, PSM, associate secretary Simon Duggan, deputy secretary economic, industry and G20 Caroline Millar, deputy secretary, national security Cath Patterson, acting deputy secretary, social policy Lachlan Colquhoun, first assistant secretary, national security division National Covid-19 Coordination Commission Neville Power, chair Malcolm Thompson, deputy chief executive officer Tanya Plibersek appeared on ABC News Breakfast to discuss the home renovation/build program the government just announced: I guess the housing industry is one of the missed opportunities that we\u2019re looking at now, because of course we support, Labor supports, extra investment in our construction sector. It is a sector which employs over a million Australians, we\u2019re talking about 500,000 tradies. If we do have a training and apprenticeship element to that, it would be a good thing, but this program doesn\u2019t have that. Of course, the other missed opportunity in the housing package is the missed opportunity of an investment in social housing. It is great to help people buy or renovate their home but when we were last in Government in the global financial crisis, we built 126,000 new public housing homes, we upgraded about 70,000. We started about 80 homelessness programs. We have thousands being turned away every night in Australia from crisis accommodation, mums and kids fleeing violence, veterans sleeping in our parks. It shouldn\u2019t happen in a country like Australia and now is the ideal time to be building accommodation for those people. Except social housing isn\u2019t part of this package (although some states have their own programs). Labor has some things to say about the meeting: Australia is well-placed to help meet India\u2019s economic aspirations. India is our second-largest source of international students, and Australia benefits from a 700,000-strong Indian-Australian diaspora. But next month marks two years since former DFAT secretary, Peter Varghese, presented this Government with the India Economic Strategy, which was intended as a blueprint to transform our economic engagement. Since then the strategy has gathered dust, continuing years of failure by this Government to adequately diversify Australia\u2019s trading economy. Under Scott Morrison as Prime Minister and Treasurer, Australia has become increasingly reliant on a single trading partner. The only economy that depends more on China than Australia is Hong Kong. Instead of trade diversification, Scott Morrison and his government have overseen the proportion of Australian trade with China increase by a third \u2013 from 19.8 per cent of Australia\u2019s total trade to 26.4 per cent. In the same period, the proportion of Australia\u2019s trade with Japan, South Korea, Singapore and the US has declined and the proportion of Australia\u2019s trade with India has increased by a measly 0.7 percentage points \u2013 from 2.7% to 3.4%. We recognise that India alone does not provide a magical solution on diversification, but the fact is that India has barely rated a mention by this Government. Labor launched negotiations with India for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement in May 2011. The most recent negotiation was 45 months ago, in September 2015. We hope this week\u2019s virtual summit yields more than headlines aimed at providing a distraction from recent trade issues with China, and instead marks a long overdue shift in emphasis and a serious plan for diversifying Australia\u2019s interests. After bushfires and coronavirus put their summit off, Scott Morrison will (virtually) meet today with India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi. Unfortunately, Modi misses out on these \u201cdelicacies\u201d \u2026 The Housing Industry Association is, unsurprisingly, pretty happy with the HomeBuilder package. It says: HIA estimates it could generate over $15 billion in national economic activity. Most importantly this incentive will support hundreds of thousands of jobs across Australia. The housing industry directly engages more than one million people \u2013 builders, trade contractors, designers, professional service providers and others. It provides jobs for many thousands more in the manufacturing and retail sectors, which supply the materials, products, white goods and furnishings that go into our homes. This incentive will help to address the projected decline in housing activity over the next 12 months. The Senate committee looking at the Covid response will hear today from Scott Morrison\u2019s handpicked coordination committee chair \u2013 the man charged with kickstarting the economy \u2013 Nev Power. It\u2019s MPs\u2019 first chance to chat to the mining and gas executive since he took over the role. This story is likely to be a topic of questions, as is this one. In case you haven\u2019t seen it, this story from Melissa Davey and international Guardian colleagues is very, very much worth your time: The World Health Organization and a number of national governments have changed their Covid-19 policies and treatments on the basis of flawed data from a little-known US healthcare analytics company, also calling into question the integrity of key studies published in some of the world\u2019s most prestigious medical journals. A Guardian investigation can reveal the US-based company Surgisphere, whose handful of employees appear to include a science fiction writer and an adult-content model, has provided data for multiple studies on Covid-19 co-authored by its chief executive, but has so far failed to adequately explain its data or methodology. Data it claims to have legitimately obtained from more than a thousand hospitals worldwide formed the basis of scientific articles that have led to changes in Covid-19 treatment policies in Latin American countries. It was also behind a decision by the WHO and research institutes around the world to halt trials of the controversial drug hydroxychloroquine. On Wednesday, the WHO announced those trials would now resume. As expected, the government\u2019s home renovation/building stimulus package will be announced today. Following the theme of policies boiling down to two words jammed together, this one is known as HomeBuilder. You\u2019ve got it for six months. As Katharine Murphy explains: The Morrison government will fund grants worth $25,000 for eligible singles and couples planning to build or renovate homes between June and the end of December, with the uncapped program estimated to cost taxpayers $688m. With the March quarter national accounts indicating that Australia has entered the first recession in nearly three decades, the new tranche of economic stimulus designed to create a pipeline of work for the construction sector will be unveiled by the Coalition on Thursday. To be eligible for the grants, singles need to earn $125,000 a year or less based on a 2018-19 tax return or later, and couples need to earn under $200,000. Building contracts need to be executed between 4 June and 31 December 2020. Meanwhile, Indonesian authorities are investigating the death of an Australian man in Bali after he suffered respiratory issues. As AAP reports: An Australian man has reportedly died in Indonesia after complaining of breathing difficulties. The man, aged in his 50s, died this week in holiday accommodation in Munggu, in Bali, according to media reports. The regency of Badung\u2019s police chief Roby Septiad said the man was with his Indonesian girlfriend when he complained of shortness of breath, The Daily Telegraph reports. The woman gave him an unspecified \u201cbreath\u201d medicine, believed to be Ventolin. \u201cAt 3am [June 3], the victim complained of shortness of breath and hugged (the woman) until finally his body did not move,\u201d the paper cited Mr Septiad as saying on Wednesday. \u201c[She] then reported the death to the owner of the boarding house.\u201d We\u2019ll cover that, and anything else that happens as the day rolls on. You have Amy Remeikis for most of the day. Ready?",

It\u2019s almost a holiday from the shitstorm. These are strange times we are working in, but I haven\u2019t felt frightened, and neither should the women I\u2019m helping.</p> <p>Antenatal classes are online and a lot of care is delivered by telephone; it seems to have worked very well. If a woman has to come in, our emergency obstetric unit is open, but anybody else attending must wait outside. Most birth partners have been incredibly understanding, given that we don\u2019t even provide chairs in the corridor outside. Often, there\u2019s a line of physically distanced people.</p> <p>More women have started asking to have an induction or elective caesarean section to try and gain a bit of control in the circumstances. Once someone is in established labour, the birth partner can stay until delivery. We try and keep people in there as long as possible, but it depends how many people are in at one time. Once the woman leaves and goes into postnatal care, it\u2019s goodbye to the birth partner at the doors. The only exceptions we\u2019ve made have been when the woman is experiencing mental health issues.</p> <p>More people have been delivering babies in the car park than usual. It\u2019s always been the third most popular place after the delivery suite and antenatal wards. People are leaving it to the last minute because of fears around coronavirus. More are coming in in advanced labour; some decide to stay at home until they get anxious and come into hospital.</p> <p>The postnatal ward is a lovely place to be at the moment.

      "bodyText": "The word \u201cbreathe\u201d has never been more potent than at the moment. The instruction to breathe is something midwives say an awful lot to women in labour. It\u2019s also being said a great deal to patients on ventilators whose lungs have been taken over by Covid-19. In the hospital where I work as a midwife, there are double doors leading from our midwifery unit to a makeshift intensive care unit. On one side, I am involved with the unborn who are yet to breathe, while on the other there are people unable to breathe independently. The proximity of brand new life and end of life separated by double doors is very affecting for me and all my colleagues. The women I look after must be aware, but when they are allocated a delivery room, they are completely absorbed in giving birth. It\u2019s almost a holiday from the shitstorm. These are strange times we are working in, but I haven\u2019t felt frightened, and neither should the women I\u2019m helping. Antenatal classes are online and a lot of care is delivered by telephone; it seems to have worked very well. If a woman has to come in, our emergency obstetric unit is open, but anybody else attending must wait outside. Most birth partners have been incredibly understanding, given that we don\u2019t even provide chairs in the corridor outside. Often, there\u2019s a line of physically distanced people. More women have started asking to have an induction or elective caesarean section to try and gain a bit of control in the circumstances. Once someone is in established labour, the birth partner can stay until delivery. We try and keep people in there as long as possible, but it depends how many people are in at one time. Once the woman leaves and goes into postnatal care, it\u2019s goodbye to the birth partner at the doors. The only exceptions we\u2019ve made have been when the woman is experiencing mental health issues. More people have been delivering babies in the car park than usual. It\u2019s always been the third most popular place after the delivery suite and antenatal wards. People are leaving it to the last minute because of fears around coronavirus. More are coming in in advanced labour; some decide to stay at home until they get anxious and come into hospital. The postnatal ward is a lovely place to be at the moment. The curtains are open, and women are helping each other and bonding in a way that we thought was a thing of the past. One of the things we will probably review is how often partners are allowed in. Now that is not happening, there is a spirit of female empowerment and togetherness. Those who have had babies before are helping first-timers with breastfeeding, for example.

      "bodyText": "Tens of thousands of Britons had to be retested for coronavirus after the government sent their swabs to the US. Nearly 30,000 tests were found to be invalid after being flown out following problems at a UK laboratory last month. The 29,500 voided tests were among a batch of 67,000 sent to the US following technical issues at the privately run Randox laboratory in Northern Ireland. It emerged last month that the government had to send 50,000 tests abroad owing to processing problems in the UK. However, it has now emerged that 17,000 more tests than previously admitted were sent to the US and that 29,500 came back void. Samples have to be tested within 72 hours of the test being taken, which means that any delay in their processing could leave people with symptoms unsure if they have the virus. The Telegraph reported that the 67,000 tests were airlifted to a university lab on the east coast of the US over 10 days last month after officials failed to find capacity for them to be analysed in the UK. The swabs were returned a few days later in two large bags, the paper reported, one containing a \u201cmuch higher than expected void rate\u201d. It said part of the problem appeared to be different equipment standards in the US. The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cWe worked hard to get complete tests for people under difficult circumstances. In many cases that worked and we are grateful for the team for their efforts. \u201cBut in some cases it didn\u2019t, and the correct judgment was made to void the tests. Everyone affected was offered a new test immediately and we worked quickly to restore full capacity in the UK.\u201d Lisa McNally, the public health director at Sandwell council in the West Midlands, said on Thursday she was surprised the lockdown had been eased before the test-and-trace system was \u201cat full speed\u201d. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWhat surprises me, I guess, is that we are moving ahead so quickly with easing lockdown before the system is at full speed. We need to allow time to assess how things are going, get this system up to speed. \u201cTo be honest with you, I\u2019m concerned that by the time we realise we need to hit the brakes, we will have spun off the road and be over the cliff-edge.\u201d McNally predicted the UK could be \u201cgoing back to a place we really don\u2019t want to be, which is where we were at the end of April\u201d in terms of the number of coronavirus-related infections and deaths if test and trace did not prove effective. On Wednesday Boris Johnson committed to getting \u201call tests turned around in 24 hours by the end of June, except for difficulties with postal tests or insuperable problems like that\u201d. He made the promise in the Commons after the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said getting tests done within 24 hours was \u201cabsolutely essential\u201d to the success of the government\u2019s much-vaunted test-and-trace system. The government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has said the system must get infected people\u2019s contacts to isolate within 48 hours to be effective. However, tests currently take 48 hours on average to produce results.",

A politician who won election in 2013 largely on a promise to reform the NYPD and scrap its racially discriminatory stop-and-frisk policy, astounded even his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CynthiaNixon/status/1267129182057791489\">closest supporters</a> when he defended the police.</p> \n<p>De Blasio said: \u201cI do believe the NYPD has acted appropriately.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9e9161dc-5684-4ceb-ba73-1fc976d4253c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AuZZ7aJ07Eg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Social media lit up.

The largest police force in the US, with its $5.6bn annual budget and 36,000 uniformed officers under the leadership of one of the most progressive mayors in the country, has responded to demonstrations about police brutality with more police brutality.</p> \n<p>The Black, Latino and Asian Caucus of the city council, which makes up more than half of the legislative body, was swift and devastating in its criticism. In a <a href=\"https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/05/31/mad-as-hell-mayor-selectively-quotes-council-minority-leadership-silencing-their-narrative/\">statement</a>, it said that the NYPD had acted \u201cwith aggression towards New Yorkers who vigorously and vociferously but nonetheless peacefully advocated for justice\u201d.</p> \n<p>Adrienne Adams, co-chair of the caucus, told the Guardian the NYPD had tried to suppress legitimate anger felt by African American and other minority communities following years of police abuse. \u201cWe cannot allow people who have kept people of color down for decades to say now that we don\u2019t have the right to display our outrage,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Though that sentiment applies nationwide, Adams believes New York stands out as having a \u201chorrible history of police brutality\u201d. It was the NYPD that set the tone, she said, when Daniel Pantaleo, the officer implicated in the 2014 death by chokehold of Eric Garner in Staten Island, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/16/eric-garner-death-new-york-no-charges\">avoided prosecution</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen nothing happened to the police officers who were responsible for the death of Eric Garner, New York set the blueprint for what happened to George Floyd,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no penalty, no consequence, so it\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> \n<p>Adams\u2019s framing of the Garner killing could equally be applied to a long string of notorious episodes of police misconduct that preceded it. In 1997, Haitian immigrant <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/twenty-years-later-look-back-nypd-assault-abner-louima-and-what-it-means-today/\">Abner Louima</a> was handcuffed by an NYPD officer and sexually assaulted with a broken broomstick.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d776116c7d650ee868cc2e81802fbc76cc733f4f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d776116c7d650ee868cc2e81802fbc76cc733f4f/0_0_3000_1755/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police clash with demonstrators protesting the Staten Island, New York grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict a police officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in December 2014 in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"585\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police clash with demonstrators protesting against the decision not to indict a police officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in December 2014 in New York City.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Burton/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Two years later, <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/justice/2019/2/1/21211182/20-years-after-the-nypd-killing-of-amadou-diallo-his-mom-asks-what-s-changed\">Amadou Diallo</a> was shot near his home in a hail of 41 bullets after officers mistook his wallet for a gun. In an echo of that event, an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/24/nyregion/in-sean-bell-killing-4-officers-to-be-forced-out.html\">unarmed Sean Bell</a> was shot 50 times in Queens on the morning of his wedding in 2006 \u2013 it took six years for the NYPD detective who opened the fusillade to be chucked off the force while nobody has ever been convicted of any crime.</p> \n<p>In the policing of protest, the NYPD also has a contentious track record. In 2004 it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/15/new-york-agrees-settlement-2004-republican-convention\">rounded up</a> more than 1,800 peaceful protesters rallying outside the Republican National Convention during the re-election bid of George W Bush and herded them into overcrowded pens on Pier 57 in Manhattan. In 2011 it was similarly criticized for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/02/occupy-wall-street-nypd-tactics\">heavy-handed tactics</a> during the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations.</p> \n<p>Cutting across all this, the force has consistently targeted its efforts on neighborhoods of the city with majority black or Latino populations, straying at times into overt racial profiling. Though stop and frisk has been reined back in recent years, the NYPD continues to <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/tale-two-new-york-cities-when-it-comes-policing\">heavily and disproportionately police</a> those communities despite a historically low <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-citys-murder-rate-hit-new-low-in-2018-11546559793\">homicide rate</a>.</p> \n<p>Despite this long legacy of overreach, the force continues to be systemically resistant to public oversight. Under <a href=\"https://www.nyclu.org/en/news/law-makes-it-nearly-impossible-police-police-new-york\">Section 50-A</a> of New York state law, the disciplinary files of police officers are largely held in secret, making the task of holding them accountable almost impossible.</p> \n<p>Jennvine Wong, a staff attorney at the Cop Accountability Project (CAP) within the Legal Aid Society, told the Guardian that there were currently more than 200 police officers still being employed by the NYPD on full pay who should have been considered for termination following reports of misconduct.</p> \n<p>Data collected by CAP shows that where cases of misconduct arise they often involve escalation of low-level encounters into aggressive confrontations \u2013 something officers are supposed to be trained not to do.

      "bodyText": "It doesn\u2019t take long to blow up a reputation. In the case of the New York police department, an institution with an already troubled history, the clip lasted all of 27 seconds. It showed an NYPD vehicle in Brooklyn lined up against a metal barricade behind which protesters were chanting during Saturday\u2019s demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd. Projectiles were thrown on to the roof of the car, then suddenly a second police SUV drew up alongside and instead of stopping continued to plough straight into the crowd. Seconds later the first vehicle lurched forward, knocking the barrier over and with it propelling several protesters to the ground amid a harrowing chorus of shrieking. A 27-second video, now viewed more than 30m times, had quickly shredded years of effort to repair the deeply tarnished image of the NYPD. New York\u2019s \u201cfinest\u201d were firmly cast in a role normally reserved for the security corps of petty dictators. The shocking video was compounded hours later when the mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, spoke about the incident. A politician who won election in 2013 largely on a promise to reform the NYPD and scrap its racially discriminatory stop-and-frisk policy, astounded even his closest supporters when he defended the police. De Blasio said: \u201cI do believe the NYPD has acted appropriately.\u201d Social media lit up. Was it appropriate to drive those two SUVs into the crowd? Was it appropriate for an NYPD officer forcibly to remove the coronavirus mask of a black protester whose arms were raised in the air, then pepper-spray his face? Was it appropriate for another officer to tell a protester to get off the street, then physically shove her several feet towards the curb where she landed on her head? Or that the police officers involved in the pepper spray incident had covered their badge numbers, presumably to avoid having to answer for their actions. Or to beat a worker walking home from a shift at a hospital? The clashes between New York\u2019s police and its protesters have reverberated around the city. The largest police force in the US, with its $5.6bn annual budget and 36,000 uniformed officers under the leadership of one of the most progressive mayors in the country, has responded to demonstrations about police brutality with more police brutality. The Black, Latino and Asian Caucus of the city council, which makes up more than half of the legislative body, was swift and devastating in its criticism. In a statement, it said that the NYPD had acted \u201cwith aggression towards New Yorkers who vigorously and vociferously but nonetheless peacefully advocated for justice\u201d. Adrienne Adams, co-chair of the caucus, told the Guardian the NYPD had tried to suppress legitimate anger felt by African American and other minority communities following years of police abuse. \u201cWe cannot allow people who have kept people of color down for decades to say now that we don\u2019t have the right to display our outrage,\u201d she said. Though that sentiment applies nationwide, Adams believes New York stands out as having a \u201chorrible history of police brutality\u201d. It was the NYPD that set the tone, she said, when Daniel Pantaleo, the officer implicated in the 2014 death by chokehold of Eric Garner in Staten Island, avoided prosecution. \u201cWhen nothing happened to the police officers who were responsible for the death of Eric Garner, New York set the blueprint for what happened to George Floyd,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no penalty, no consequence, so it\u2019s OK.\u201d Adams\u2019s framing of the Garner killing could equally be applied to a long string of notorious episodes of police misconduct that preceded it. In 1997, Haitian immigrant Abner Louima was handcuffed by an NYPD officer and sexually assaulted with a broken broomstick. Two years later, Amadou Diallo was shot near his home in a hail of 41 bullets after officers mistook his wallet for a gun. In an echo of that event, an unarmed Sean Bell was shot 50 times in Queens on the morning of his wedding in 2006 \u2013 it took six years for the NYPD detective who opened the fusillade to be chucked off the force while nobody has ever been convicted of any crime. In the policing of protest, the NYPD also has a contentious track record. In 2004 it rounded up more than 1,800 peaceful protesters rallying outside the Republican National Convention during the re-election bid of George W Bush and herded them into overcrowded pens on Pier 57 in Manhattan. In 2011 it was similarly criticized for heavy-handed tactics during the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations. Cutting across all this, the force has consistently targeted its efforts on neighborhoods of the city with majority black or Latino populations, straying at times into overt racial profiling. Though stop and frisk has been reined back in recent years, the NYPD continues to heavily and disproportionately police those communities despite a historically low homicide rate. Despite this long legacy of overreach, the force continues to be systemically resistant to public oversight. Under Section 50-A of New York state law, the disciplinary files of police officers are largely held in secret, making the task of holding them accountable almost impossible. Jennvine Wong, a staff attorney at the Cop Accountability Project (CAP) within the Legal Aid Society, told the Guardian that there were currently more than 200 police officers still being employed by the NYPD on full pay who should have been considered for termination following reports of misconduct. Data collected by CAP shows that where cases of misconduct arise they often involve escalation of low-level encounters into aggressive confrontations \u2013 something officers are supposed to be trained not to do. The project is currently litigating the case of Tomas Medina who was put in a chokehold and Tasered in 2018 after police were called to a complaint about loud music being played. Eric Garner\u2019s fatal arrest was triggered by him allegedly selling single cigarettes. Although the use of chokeholds has been banned in New York, the project has found that between 2015 and 2018 the city settled 30 lawsuits involving NYPD use of the potentially lethal maneuver. Wong believes such endemic deployment of excessive force has spilled over into the NYPD\u2019s handling of the George Floyd protests. She was present at a peaceful protest in Brooklyn that suddenly turned volatile not because of the behavior of protesters but by a sudden change of tack on the part of the police. \u201cIn a split second, the NYPD snapped and engaged in over-aggressive enforcement. They escalated it from 0 to 10 out of nowhere, arresting people and wielding their batons.\u201d If there has been unrestrained use of batons in the city, it would be with the full approval of Ed Mullins, the provocative president of one of the main police unions, the Sergeants Benevolent Association (SBA). He wrote to members urging \u201ceach and every one of you to report for duty with your helmet and baton and do not hesitate to utilize that equipment in securing your personal safety\u201d. The sister Police Benevolent Association of New York City has also spoken to its members in inflammatory terms about them being \u201cunder attack by violent, organized terrorists while New York City council and other politicians sit at home demanding we \u2018de-escalate\u2019\u201d. There is no denying that the NYPD faces difficult challenges in the policing of mass protests, especially late at night when violent outbreaks have erupted as they did on Monday in Manhattan and the Bronx. Fires were started in the street and stores looted. For Eugene O\u2019Donnell, a former NYPD officer and prosecutor in Brooklyn and Queens who is now a professor of police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, Monday night\u2019s spectacle of looting along Fifth Avenue amounted to a collapse of policing in the city. \u201cThis weekend, the job of police officer in New York became officially impossible when the police abolitionists won.

They stood back and watched as damage was inflicted that was irreversible.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 June 2020 because an earlier version referred to a nurse whereas the incident involved a hospital worker.",

      "body": "<p>Transportation is going to change enormously during the 2020s. The electrification of vehicles large and small is opening up all kinds of possibilities. Electric vehicles (EVs) lend themselves very well to being connected vehicles and, by combining transport with apps, data and smart systems, we are provoking a total rethink of how we travel.</p> <p>The traditional transport system of trains, planes and automobiles is being upended by big data. Transport will soon be far more than the simple A to B and is already encompassing elements of the sharing economy, autonomous systems and cross-sector collaborations.</p> <p><strong>Clean air</strong><br>A major driver behind electrification is the push for lower carbon emissions. Transportation contributes close to <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter8.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">a quarter of all global emissions</a> and policy makers and the general public are demanding cleaner mobility.</p> <p>The lockdown created in response to the coronavirus pandemic has led to huge drops in traffic and congestion across the world. As a result, we\u2019ve all been experiencing far better air quality, and many want this to continue.</p> <p>\u201cA precipitous fall in traffic on our roads has suddenly given British cities cleaner air and we must all realise that returning back to the norm is not an option,\u201d says Charlie Jardine, founder and CEO of EO Charging.</p> <p><strong>Autonomous vehicles and sharing<br></strong>Another way to cut emissions and congestion \u2013 as well as to reduce costs \u2013 is to use our vehicles far more efficiently. Most cars spend the majority of their lifespan parked on a driveway or street, and there are comparable inefficiencies in larger vehicles, too.</p> <p>Laurence Weir, technology lead at the engineering company Plextek, is among a growing number of experts predicting the growth of vehicle leasing on a \u201cper trip\u201d basis. Few of us will own cars, he suggests. Instead, we will take advantage of smart platforms that will match our journey needs with the appropriate autonomous vehicles.</p> <p>\u201cMost of us currently drive to work alone in a car with enough space for a five person family going on a week\u2019s holiday and, for a lot of the rest of the time, that car sits dormant on a driveway or in a work car park. It\u2019s clearly not the most efficient use of materials,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Autonomous vehicles would also be a real gamechanger for freight and haulage, Weir adds. \u201cThe haulage industry would be transformed. Currently, so much of the logistics and costs revolve around the driver and the availability of a vehicle large enough to make it efficient. Without the driver, goods could be moved around in smaller, discrete crates at the optimum time of day, therefore making the use of the road network much more efficient.\u201d</p> <p>Artificial intelligence is already changing the way vehicles are designed, says Holger Hampf, president of the BMW subsidiary Designworks. \u201cAI is more of an aid in efficiency rather than in the development of entirely new designs,\u201d he says. \u201cThe designer is becoming more like a conductor; setting directions and making decisions.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Apps and software</strong><br>Transport is moving away from being centred on ownership and is instead becoming a service you can access from your phone. The term \u201cMobility as a Service\u201d (MaaS) is now an industry buzzword and is suggestive of how much tech and transport are overlapping.</p> <p>Last year, the navigation app Citymapper unveiled a pass that enables users to pay for all London tubes, buses, bikes and even taxis via one payment card. Nearly everyone has a wallet and a phone and with those two items we\u2019ll soon all be able to rapidly access transport.</p> <p><strong>Pedal power </strong><br>Mark Hodgson, founder of Co Cars and Co Bikes, has embraced the all-electric theme with gusto, offering pedal power and engines to his club members. He describes short-term hire for an e-bike or electric car as a smart option.</p> <p>\u201cOur experience shows that there\u2019s huge interest in zero-emission travel,\u201d says Hodgson, adding that electric cars are the most popular part of his fleet, perhaps suggesting that, given the choice, people will pick the cleaner option. Meanwhile, he describes e-bikes as a credible, \u201cnon-sweaty\u201d, alternative to driving.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/plug-into-hybrid/2020/may/19/a-tipping-point-is-likely-in-2021-why-electric-vehicles-will-soon-dominate-uk-roads\">\u2018A tipping point is likely in 2021\u2019: why electric vehicles will soon dominate UK roads</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Car manufacturers are investing heavily in electric vehicles. As well as having a range of 10 plug-in hybrid vehicles, often the first step for consumers towards a fully electric car,<strong> </strong>BMW is planning on building its iNext model from 2021, describing it as \u201cfully networked, fully electric\u201d. These \u201ccars of the future\u201d, complete with a newly designed steering wheel, talking functions and increasing autonomy, are starting to resemble a certain car called Kitt, which for those old enough to remember was one of the stars of a 1980s TV show, Knight Rider.</p> <p>There are big challenges ahead for electrification. Converting planes from jet fuel to a battery-powered solution still appears to be some way off.

      "bodyText": "Transportation is going to change enormously during the 2020s. The electrification of vehicles large and small is opening up all kinds of possibilities. Electric vehicles (EVs) lend themselves very well to being connected vehicles and, by combining transport with apps, data and smart systems, we are provoking a total rethink of how we travel. The traditional transport system of trains, planes and automobiles is being upended by big data. Transport will soon be far more than the simple A to B and is already encompassing elements of the sharing economy, autonomous systems and cross-sector collaborations. Clean air A major driver behind electrification is the push for lower carbon emissions. Transportation contributes close to a quarter of all global emissions and policy makers and the general public are demanding cleaner mobility. The lockdown created in response to the coronavirus pandemic has led to huge drops in traffic and congestion across the world. As a result, we\u2019ve all been experiencing far better air quality, and many want this to continue. \u201cA precipitous fall in traffic on our roads has suddenly given British cities cleaner air and we must all realise that returning back to the norm is not an option,\u201d says Charlie Jardine, founder and CEO of EO Charging. Autonomous vehicles and sharing Another way to cut emissions and congestion \u2013 as well as to reduce costs \u2013 is to use our vehicles far more efficiently. Most cars spend the majority of their lifespan parked on a driveway or street, and there are comparable inefficiencies in larger vehicles, too. Laurence Weir, technology lead at the engineering company Plextek, is among a growing number of experts predicting the growth of vehicle leasing on a \u201cper trip\u201d basis. Few of us will own cars, he suggests. Instead, we will take advantage of smart platforms that will match our journey needs with the appropriate autonomous vehicles. \u201cMost of us currently drive to work alone in a car with enough space for a five person family going on a week\u2019s holiday and, for a lot of the rest of the time, that car sits dormant on a driveway or in a work car park. It\u2019s clearly not the most efficient use of materials,\u201d he says. Autonomous vehicles would also be a real gamechanger for freight and haulage, Weir adds. \u201cThe haulage industry would be transformed. Currently, so much of the logistics and costs revolve around the driver and the availability of a vehicle large enough to make it efficient. Without the driver, goods could be moved around in smaller, discrete crates at the optimum time of day, therefore making the use of the road network much more efficient.\u201d Artificial intelligence is already changing the way vehicles are designed, says Holger Hampf, president of the BMW subsidiary Designworks. \u201cAI is more of an aid in efficiency rather than in the development of entirely new designs,\u201d he says. \u201cThe designer is becoming more like a conductor; setting directions and making decisions.\u201d Apps and software Transport is moving away from being centred on ownership and is instead becoming a service you can access from your phone. The term \u201cMobility as a Service\u201d (MaaS) is now an industry buzzword and is suggestive of how much tech and transport are overlapping. Last year, the navigation app Citymapper unveiled a pass that enables users to pay for all London tubes, buses, bikes and even taxis via one payment card. Nearly everyone has a wallet and a phone and with those two items we\u2019ll soon all be able to rapidly access transport. Pedal power Mark Hodgson, founder of Co Cars and Co Bikes, has embraced the all-electric theme with gusto, offering pedal power and engines to his club members. He describes short-term hire for an e-bike or electric car as a smart option. \u201cOur experience shows that there\u2019s huge interest in zero-emission travel,\u201d says Hodgson, adding that electric cars are the most popular part of his fleet, perhaps suggesting that, given the choice, people will pick the cleaner option. Meanwhile, he describes e-bikes as a credible, \u201cnon-sweaty\u201d, alternative to driving. Car manufacturers are investing heavily in electric vehicles. As well as having a range of 10 plug-in hybrid vehicles, often the first step for consumers towards a fully electric car, BMW is planning on building its iNext model from 2021, describing it as \u201cfully networked, fully electric\u201d. These \u201ccars of the future\u201d, complete with a newly designed steering wheel, talking functions and increasing autonomy, are starting to resemble a certain car called Kitt, which for those old enough to remember was one of the stars of a 1980s TV show, Knight Rider. There are big challenges ahead for electrification. Converting planes from jet fuel to a battery-powered solution still appears to be some way off. But rapidly growing economies such as India and China do seem to be embracing electrification where it makes sense to do so. Mathias Lelievre, CEO of the sustainability consultancy Engie Impact, points to \u201cmammoth momentum\u201d in China, which is expected to have 200,000-450,000 e-buses by the end of 2020. Meanwhile, at the other end of the scale, in India the ancient rickshaw is receiving an electric makeover. \u201cIndia [is purchasing] about 11,000 new electric rickshaws every month \u2013 not because of government mandates or even sustainability goals but because they\u2019re cheaper than conventional rickshaws, which enables operators and drivers to make more money,\u201d he says. Finally, as lockdown restrictions begin to ease, many of us are taking advantage of home delivery services. Johan Herrlin, CEO of Ito World, ponders whether this could mean a rebirth of an EV that was once ubiquitous on British streets \u2013 the milk float. \u201cWhere milk delivery companies still operate, they are seeing very high demand,\u201d he says. \u201cPerhaps the local grocery home delivery market will undergo permanent change after Covid-19, and we might see a return to local electric vehicles making deliveries.\u201d Technology drives the world, and is the beating heart of every BMW.

He established a new Ministry of Women, Gender and Diversity, which runs a helpline for victims of violence and works to shift attitudes through education campaigns. \u201cYou can see the changes,\u201d said Andrea Lescano, whose daughter Micaela Garcia was murdered in 2017. Her death prompted Argentina to pass a law requiring all government workers to undergo gender sensitivity training. Universities and other places of work are developing protocols to deal with gender violence in their spheres. \u201cIt\u2019s not that there is more violence, it\u2019s that now you\u2019re seeing it and naming it,\u201d says Lescano. Marta Dillion, a founder of the Ni Una Menos movement, sees important progress in these past five years. \u201cBlaming the victim is no longer possible,\u201d she says. Argentina is not the only country where Ni Una Menos has helped spur on positive change for women. In Chile, the movement has contributed to the organisation of a forceful group of women\u2019s rights collectives, who have played a key role in mass demonstrations over equality and high costs of living. Earlier this year, activists succeeded in pressuring political groups to ensure gender parity in the construction of Chile\u2019s new constitution. If the country votes in favour of such a reform during the historic referendum in October, it would make the constitution the world\u2019s first to include gender parity. But there is no assurance that such measures will automatically curb femicide rates and shift cultural attitudes. Mexico\u2019s president, Andres Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a populist leftwinger, appointed the first cabinet with gender parity in Latin America when he assumed office last year. Mexico has seen a wave of assertive protests by women\u2019s groups, who credit Ni Una Menos with amplifying their voices \u2013 but many activists still feel like they are not being heard. \u201cAs a first step, we want authorities to recognise there is a problem and that violence against women is increasing,\u201d says Arussi Unda, who belongs to a Veracruz-based organisation, Brujas del Mar. Lop\u00e9z Obrador has been criticised for failing to address entrenched violence against women: when calls to domestic violence helplines spiralled during the coronavirus lockdown, the president dismissed such reports as \u201c90% fake\u201d. Femicide laws exist in Mexico, yet impunity rates of over 90% point to their ineffectuality. The problem was highlighted earlier this year in a sobering viral video, showing a woman named Yesenia Zamudio pleading for justice for her daughter\u2019s murder, which was dismissed by authorities as suicide four years ago. \u201cI don\u2019t need a collective, I need a fucking political party that represents me,\u201d she cries in the video. Zamudio\u2019s frustration is echoed by Montero, the mother in Argentina. \u201cIf we had achieved a change in the past five years, we wouldn\u2019t have to keep fighting for one less death,\u201d she says. Dillion, one of the Ni Una Menos founders, agrees there is still a lot of work to do. \u201cFemicides are still happening because it\u2019s a form of disciplining,\u201d she says. \u201cIn general, the killer acts when a woman says: \u2018enough\u2019.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Iowa is betting on its new public health program to allow for the reopening of businesses such as bars and movie theaters following weeks of Covid-19 closures. But health experts and lawmakers are<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TrashBoySai/status/1260607121852436480\"> raising questions</a> about the program and the little-known company behind it, pointing at missed deadlines, long test delays and complaints over the accessibility of testing sites. </p> <p>The principle behind TestIowa is one familiar to many states and countries by now. Residents participate in a survey that determines whether they qualify for Covid-19 testing; people determined to be at higher risk of having contracted Covid-19 are directed to free testing sites, and positive cases are identified to allow those residents to isolate and curb the spread of the virus.</p> <p>\u201cOur ability to target the virus down to a zip code means that we can act with precision, to identify and isolate positive cases, track and contain the spread and keep things operating as normal,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ketv.com/article/gpv-reynolds-to-provide-covid-19-update-wednesday-morning-may-20/32613264\">Iowa</a><a href=\"https://www.ketv.com/article/gpv-reynolds-to-provide-covid-19-update-wednesday-morning-may-20/32613264\">\u2019s governor, Kim Reynolds</a>, told reporters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b46b92072d04cf154a400ffdacb963daffbf7ffd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b46b92072d04cf154a400ffdacb963daffbf7ffd/0_0_4842_3236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Governor Kim Reynolds holds a coronavirus briefing in Johnston.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Governor Kim Reynolds holds a coronavirus briefing in Johnston.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Neibergall/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To run the program, Reynolds in April signed a $26m no-bid contract with Nomi Health, after being pitched on the company <a href=\"https://apnews.com/ef5038c7d6e9e08601d469d1a72bba6b\">by Ashton Kutcher</a>, the actor-turned-investor who is originally from Iowa. The company bills itself as a general contractor, that helps governments rebuild the testing supply chain and lower costs. </p> <h2>A contentious start</h2> <p>Nomi Health was contracted to have the TestIowa website built and to <a href=\"https://www.iowapublicradio.org/post/state-lab-continues-double-check-test-iowa-results\">supply </a><a href=\"https://www.iowapublicradio.org/post/state-lab-continues-double-check-test-iowa-results\">the state</a> with 10 machines for testing and 540,000 coronavirus tests over six months at an eventual rate of 3,000 tests a day. To meet those goals, the company works with partners including departments of health, the national guard and private companies like diagnostic firm Co-Diagnostics and tech firms Qualtrics and Domo. Reynolds said at full capacity the state would <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2020/05/14/iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-coronavirus-covid-19-briefing-thursday-data-maps-cases-unemployment/3106767001/\">be testing 5,000</a> people a day with TestIowa and other testing capacities combined.</p> <p>But the program was off to a contentious start. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c72c719a82450ba8f45576afddf8edbcb5d8400f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c72c719a82450ba8f45576afddf8edbcb5d8400f/0_0_5002_3752/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A healthcare worker waits for people to show up to a testing site in Sioux City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A healthcare worker waits for people to show up to a testing site in Sioux City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jerry Mennenga/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The number of daily tests following TestIowa\u2019s launch on 21 April fell far short of what the governor had promised. Some residents reported their results<a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2020/05/07/test-iowa-coronavirus-samples-damaged-incomplete-kim-reynolds-covid-19/3090197001/\"> were lost</a>, marked as \u201cincomplete\u201d, or damaged. Others complained they <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2020/05/12/iowans-wait-test-iowa-results-governor-kim-reynolds-expands-sites-coronavirus-delayed-inconclusive/3116898001/\">waited weeks</a> for their results. By 13 May, three weeks after its launch and two days before the state officially started to reopen, TestIowa had <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2020/05/14/iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-coronavirus-covid-19-briefing-thursday-data-maps-cases-unemployment/3106767001/\">sent results</a> to only 4,000 Iowans. </p> <p>Part of the delays stemmed from checking the accuracy of some of the tests. Utah-based Nomi had also been serving as the general contractor for testing programs in Utah and Nebraska, where some local <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/04/30/this-is-potential-public/\">reports</a> cast doubt on the accuracy of testing. Iowa, before using Nomi-contracted testing, cross-checked results through its State Hygienic Laboratory. But until the TestIowa machines were vetted, Covid-19 samples had to be processed at Iowa\u2019s State Hygienic Lab, causing more delays.</p> <p><a href=\"https://khqa.com/news/coronavirus/testiowa-equipment-validated-gov-kim-reynolds-says\">Vetting</a> was completed by 14 May and, according to the governor, showed 95% accuracy for determining positive results and 99.7% for determining negative results.</p> <p>A spokeswoman from Nomi health said the company does not \u201ccollect, process, or provide clinical advice on test results\u201d and that sample collection, test administration and processing of tests are all carried out by its partners. </p> <p>Co-Diagnostics develops and manufactures the Covid-19 molecular diagnostics that Nomi uses, in addition to tests for other infectious diseases. It does not, according to its spokeswoman, collect, process or retain test data. Co-Diagnostics\u2019 Covid-19 test has received emergency use authorization from the FDA.</p> <p>\u201cThe accuracy of Co-Diagnostics\u2019 test has been demonstrated time and again in independent third party evaluations, including the recent validation in Iowa,\u201d Co-diagnostics told the Guardian in a statement. \u201cThe company continues to be surprised by reports that ignore this data and that parrot \u2018concerns\u2019 that were originally raised by a competitor and published by the Salt Lake Tribune.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Additional concerns</strong></h2> <p>Meanwhile, public health experts raised concerns about the design of the TestIowa portal, and accessibility of the testing sites. \u201cI have taken the TestIowa assessment and I felt as though the questions were designed by analysts and not people with expertise on infectious disease,\u201d said Lina Tucker Reinders, executive director at the Iowa public health association. The way the program is constructed, she argued, \u201ccould result in or exacerbate inequities\u201d.</p> <p>Nomi Health refutes these allegations and indicates that it collaborated with \u201cleading medical experts\u201d to create the assessment.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tucker Reinders pointed out that the platform\u2019s accessibility is affected by internet access \u2013 in a state with known broadband access issues, especially in rural areas. Only about 65% of Iowa\u2019s 216,007 census blocks have access to broadband internet at speeds of at least 25 mbps download and 3 mbps upload,<a href=\"https://wcfcourier.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/virus-exposes-iowa-s-broadband-weaknesses/article_ff84c089-0659-5871-8757-640badefdabc.html\"> according to 2019 data</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t own a computer, tablet or mobile phone with internet connection, they cannot access the TestIowa site independently,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are advised to have a family member or friend help them enter their data. This is inappropriate because the assessment asks personal medical information.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, the platform is only offered in English and Spanish, making it inaccessible to speakers of other languages common in the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/05/850964016/meatpacking-workers-are-struggling-to-protect-themselves-during-the-pandemic\">factories where Covid-19 is most prevalent</a> in Iowa, where immigrants from Mexico, Bosnia and Burma work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a471b679bc8ddf33f073d3a5dadaefeeefe333cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a471b679bc8ddf33f073d3a5dadaefeeefe333cd/0_0_1807_1205/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iowa Department of Public Health workers administer coronavirus tests in a parking lot in Waterloo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iowa department of public health workers administer coronavirus tests in a parking lot in Waterloo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Powers/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And residents have complained that the program\u2019s eight drive-through testing sites are hard to access by public transportation and are only open certain hours, mostly weekdays and during day time. Some Iowans have found their closest testing site is hours away.</p> <p>A spokesman for the governor said \u201cthe program also works directly with employers to overcome language barriers that exist\u201d for people who do not speak Spanish or English, and that TestIowa is just one tool individuals can use to get a Covid-19 test. \u201cThat being said, we have made significant improvements in this area and the governor has been a champion for expanding broadband access, especially in rural communities,\u201d the spokesman added. &nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Calls for an investigation</strong></h2> <p>Some health experts in the state have questioned the government\u2019s decision to award the testing contract to an out-of-state company. \u201cThe expertise of Nomi Health and their partners appear to be in the fields of data analytics and engineering, which are not the same as epidemiology,\u201d said Tucker Reinders.</p> <p>To Rossana Rosa, an infectious disease specialist based in Des Moines, it\u2019s clear when looking at the TestIowa platform that it was not made in partnership with the existing public health framework in Iowa. \u201cOf course we welcome any effort to expand testing in Iowa,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is a web-based platform without any relationship or integration with any of the healthcare systems. Patients get a lot of the burden of interpreting a test result or knowing what to do once they get it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was surprised by the fact that instead of utilizing established public health entities, we went to a company that has never been involved in diagnostics before,\u201d said Megan Srinivas, an infectious disease physician at the University of North Carolina\u2019s Institute of Global Health and Infectious Diseases. \u201cIt is unusual to do in the setting of a pandemic when we really want to use resources that are reliable.\u201d</p> <p>A Nomi Health spokeswoman disputed the suggestion that the company lacked expertise, and said its co-founder and COO, Josh Walker, had more than 20 years of healthcare experience and the company has partnered with hospital systems, leading disease detection technologies, and other established healthcare entities.</p> <p>\u201cWhile Nomi Health may be a new company, our partners executing on these testing programs are not,\u201d she said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dc4a86317a503c9be331829cf22f9f3c1b7dedce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc4a86317a503c9be331829cf22f9f3c1b7dedce/0_0_3600_2406/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Healthcare worker test a resident at a drive-through Covid-19 testing site in Waterloo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Healthcare worker test a resident at a drive-through Covid-19 testing site in Waterloo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Neibergall/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Iowa lawmakers, however, <a href=\"https://www.kcrg.com/2020/05/28/iowa-lawmakers-call-forinvestigation-of-test-iowa/\">are calling</a> for an investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that TestIowa failed to meet the goals outlined by Governor Reynolds. Iowa taxpayers are on the hook for $26m and they deserve to know whether their money is being spent wisely,\u201d representatives Ruth Ann Gaines and Chris Hall said in a letter last week calling for a government oversight investigation.</p> <p>\u201cWe trust what Iowans and local officials are communicating about their experiences with TestIowa. If Iowans can\u2019t get the answers they deserve regarding TestIowa, it may be time to cancel the contract,\u201d said the letter.</p> <p>Lawmakers are also concerned about the lack of transparency around how the TestIowa contract got awarded.

      "bodyText": "Iowa is betting on its new public health program to allow for the reopening of businesses such as bars and movie theaters following weeks of Covid-19 closures. But health experts and lawmakers are raising questions about the program and the little-known company behind it, pointing at missed deadlines, long test delays and complaints over the accessibility of testing sites. The principle behind TestIowa is one familiar to many states and countries by now. Residents participate in a survey that determines whether they qualify for Covid-19 testing; people determined to be at higher risk of having contracted Covid-19 are directed to free testing sites, and positive cases are identified to allow those residents to isolate and curb the spread of the virus. \u201cOur ability to target the virus down to a zip code means that we can act with precision, to identify and isolate positive cases, track and contain the spread and keep things operating as normal,\u201d Iowa\u2019s governor, Kim Reynolds, told reporters. To run the program, Reynolds in April signed a $26m no-bid contract with Nomi Health, after being pitched on the company by Ashton Kutcher, the actor-turned-investor who is originally from Iowa. The company bills itself as a general contractor, that helps governments rebuild the testing supply chain and lower costs. A contentious start Nomi Health was contracted to have the TestIowa website built and to supply the state with 10 machines for testing and 540,000 coronavirus tests over six months at an eventual rate of 3,000 tests a day. To meet those goals, the company works with partners including departments of health, the national guard and private companies like diagnostic firm Co-Diagnostics and tech firms Qualtrics and Domo. Reynolds said at full capacity the state would be testing 5,000 people a day with TestIowa and other testing capacities combined. But the program was off to a contentious start. The number of daily tests following TestIowa\u2019s launch on 21 April fell far short of what the governor had promised. Some residents reported their results were lost, marked as \u201cincomplete\u201d, or damaged. Others complained they waited weeks for their results. By 13 May, three weeks after its launch and two days before the state officially started to reopen, TestIowa had sent results to only 4,000 Iowans. Part of the delays stemmed from checking the accuracy of some of the tests. Utah-based Nomi had also been serving as the general contractor for testing programs in Utah and Nebraska, where some local reports cast doubt on the accuracy of testing. Iowa, before using Nomi-contracted testing, cross-checked results through its State Hygienic Laboratory. But until the TestIowa machines were vetted, Covid-19 samples had to be processed at Iowa\u2019s State Hygienic Lab, causing more delays. Vetting was completed by 14 May and, according to the governor, showed 95% accuracy for determining positive results and 99.7% for determining negative results. A spokeswoman from Nomi health said the company does not \u201ccollect, process, or provide clinical advice on test results\u201d and that sample collection, test administration and processing of tests are all carried out by its partners. Co-Diagnostics develops and manufactures the Covid-19 molecular diagnostics that Nomi uses, in addition to tests for other infectious diseases. It does not, according to its spokeswoman, collect, process or retain test data. Co-Diagnostics\u2019 Covid-19 test has received emergency use authorization from the FDA. \u201cThe accuracy of Co-Diagnostics\u2019 test has been demonstrated time and again in independent third party evaluations, including the recent validation in Iowa,\u201d Co-diagnostics told the Guardian in a statement. \u201cThe company continues to be surprised by reports that ignore this data and that parrot \u2018concerns\u2019 that were originally raised by a competitor and published by the Salt Lake Tribune.\u201d Additional concerns Meanwhile, public health experts raised concerns about the design of the TestIowa portal, and accessibility of the testing sites. \u201cI have taken the TestIowa assessment and I felt as though the questions were designed by analysts and not people with expertise on infectious disease,\u201d said Lina Tucker Reinders, executive director at the Iowa public health association. The way the program is constructed, she argued, \u201ccould result in or exacerbate inequities\u201d. Nomi Health refutes these allegations and indicates that it collaborated with \u201cleading medical experts\u201d to create the assessment. Tucker Reinders pointed out that the platform\u2019s accessibility is affected by internet access \u2013 in a state with known broadband access issues, especially in rural areas. Only about 65% of Iowa\u2019s 216,007 census blocks have access to broadband internet at speeds of at least 25 mbps download and 3 mbps upload, according to 2019 data. \u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t own a computer, tablet or mobile phone with internet connection, they cannot access the TestIowa site independently,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are advised to have a family member or friend help them enter their data. This is inappropriate because the assessment asks personal medical information.\u201d In addition, the platform is only offered in English and Spanish, making it inaccessible to speakers of other languages common in the factories where Covid-19 is most prevalent in Iowa, where immigrants from Mexico, Bosnia and Burma work. And residents have complained that the program\u2019s eight drive-through testing sites are hard to access by public transportation and are only open certain hours, mostly weekdays and during day time. Some Iowans have found their closest testing site is hours away. A spokesman for the governor said \u201cthe program also works directly with employers to overcome language barriers that exist\u201d for people who do not speak Spanish or English, and that TestIowa is just one tool individuals can use to get a Covid-19 test. \u201cThat being said, we have made significant improvements in this area and the governor has been a champion for expanding broadband access, especially in rural communities,\u201d the spokesman added. Calls for an investigation Some health experts in the state have questioned the government\u2019s decision to award the testing contract to an out-of-state company. \u201cThe expertise of Nomi Health and their partners appear to be in the fields of data analytics and engineering, which are not the same as epidemiology,\u201d said Tucker Reinders. To Rossana Rosa, an infectious disease specialist based in Des Moines, it\u2019s clear when looking at the TestIowa platform that it was not made in partnership with the existing public health framework in Iowa. \u201cOf course we welcome any effort to expand testing in Iowa,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is a web-based platform without any relationship or integration with any of the healthcare systems. Patients get a lot of the burden of interpreting a test result or knowing what to do once they get it.\u201d \u201cI was surprised by the fact that instead of utilizing established public health entities, we went to a company that has never been involved in diagnostics before,\u201d said Megan Srinivas, an infectious disease physician at the University of North Carolina\u2019s Institute of Global Health and Infectious Diseases. \u201cIt is unusual to do in the setting of a pandemic when we really want to use resources that are reliable.\u201d A Nomi Health spokeswoman disputed the suggestion that the company lacked expertise, and said its co-founder and COO, Josh Walker, had more than 20 years of healthcare experience and the company has partnered with hospital systems, leading disease detection technologies, and other established healthcare entities. \u201cWhile Nomi Health may be a new company, our partners executing on these testing programs are not,\u201d she said. Iowa lawmakers, however, are calling for an investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that TestIowa failed to meet the goals outlined by Governor Reynolds. Iowa taxpayers are on the hook for $26m and they deserve to know whether their money is being spent wisely,\u201d representatives Ruth Ann Gaines and Chris Hall said in a letter last week calling for a government oversight investigation. \u201cWe trust what Iowans and local officials are communicating about their experiences with TestIowa. If Iowans can\u2019t get the answers they deserve regarding TestIowa, it may be time to cancel the contract,\u201d said the letter. Lawmakers are also concerned about the lack of transparency around how the TestIowa contract got awarded. A spokesman for the governor said decision was made in coordination with the Iowa department of public health and the state medical director and epidemiologist. He said Reynolds also spoke with the Utah governor, Gary Herbert, and his staff regarding its parallel program, TestUtah, before making her decision. Lawmakers in other states where Nomi Health is operating have called for similar reviews. In Utah, disease specialists have questioned the company\u2019s results after data showed far lower positive rates than those of other providers. And in Nebraska, the Journal Star reported the TestNebraska initiative results were showing a 2% positive rate, which is \u201cwell below the 18% average positive rate for all other tests conducted in Nebraska since testing began in early March\u201d. Nebraska lawmakers have asked the state\u2019s governorto terminate the $27m contract with Nomi, saying the company has no prior experience with epidemiology. \u201cPerhaps not the best entity to be dealing with this massive project, considering they aren\u2019t a healthcare company and they admittedly don\u2019t know anything about lab testing prior to March of this year,\u201d the Nebraska state senator Machaela Cavanaugh wrote. Nomi Health said it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that \u201csome politicians have decided to use their positions to target a community health program run by the state to serve their own political agendas in the midst of a crisis, instead of directing their energy toward taking meaningful action to help the State\u2019s COVID-19 response\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s also clear these politicians don\u2019t understand our role or what it takes to pull together an effective testing operation like this so quickly with no defined playbook,\u201d the company added. A Nomi spokeswoman said the backlog of results in Iowa has been resolved and were a normal part of the program ramping up its capabilities during a health crisis. \u201cIt is a herculean effort to launch a state-wide assessment and testing program in record time in the midst of a pandemic with no precedent for doing so,\u201d she said. Where TestIowa stands Despite the widespread concerns, Reynolds is moving forward with TestIowa, saying the state is approaching its original goal of 5,000 daily tests. But some Iowans say they are still having trouble getting results. Meanwhile, Iowa is one of the fastest-growing states for cases of coronavirus, fueled in part by spikes at meatpacking plants where hundreds of mostly immigrant workers have fallen ill. Nearly 60% of employees at one Tyson plant in Perry, Iowa \u2013 730 employees \u2013 reportedly were infected with the virus. Another Tyson plant, in Waterloo, Iowa, had 1,031 reported cases among about 2,800 workers. An additional outbreak was revealed in a news conference in May in Storm Lake where 555 of the plant\u2019s 2,517 employees have tested positive. In that announcement, the Iowa department of public health said it would not be publicly announcing continuing outbreaks at meatpacking plants unless directly asked by reporters. The Iowa department of public health and the governor\u2019s office declined to respond to questions about the number of coronavirus hotspots in the state, and whether those would be tracked by TestIowa.",

      "bodyText": "The movement to defund the police is gaining significant support across America, including from elected leaders, as protests over the killing of George Floyd sweep the nation. For years, activists have pushed US cities and states to cut law enforcement budgets amid a dramatic rise in spending on police and prisons while funding for vital social services has shrunk or disappeared altogether. Government officials have long dismissed the idea as a leftist fantasy, but the recent unrest and massive budget shortfalls from the Covid-19 crisis appear to have inspired more mainstream recognition of the central arguments behind defunding. \u201cTo see legislators who aren\u2019t even necessarily on the left supporting at least a significant decrease in New York police department [NYPD] funding is really very encouraging,\u201d Julia Salazar, a New York state senator and Democratic socialist, told the Guardian on Tuesday. \u201cIt feels a little bit surreal.\u201d Floyd\u2019s death on camera in Minneapolis, advocates say, was a powerful demonstration that police reform efforts of the last half-decade have failed to stop racist policing and killings. Meanwhile, the striking visuals of enormous, militarized and at times violent police forces responding to peaceful protests have led some politicians to question whether police really need this much money and firepower. Meanwhile, unemployment is surging amid the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, with housing and healthcare crises worsening. Many governments have been making painful cuts to services and expect to see tax revenue fall even further in the coming year. But police budgets have not been affected, and some mayors are even seeking to expand law enforcement funding. A snapshot of some of city budget debates that have escalated this week: Los Angeles: the police budget is $1.8bn, and the mayor has for weeks been pushing for raises and bonuses for officers and an overall 7% increase that would make the budget more than half of the general fund. But on Wednesday, he said he was now looking to make cuts to the police budget. New York: The mayor is pushing to leave the NYPD\u2019s nearly $6bn budget intact while slashing education and youth programs and cutting other agencies by as much as 80%. Philadelphia: The mayor has proposed spending $977m on police and prisons, which is 20% of the general fund. A $14m increase for police comes as the city is cutting funding for youth violence prevention, arts and culture, workforce development, and laying off staff at recreation centers and libraries. Defunding, said activist Jeralynn Blueford, is the logical response from leaders in this moment of unprecedented unrest. \u201cIf police had been serious about reform and policy change, then guess what? People would not be this angry.\u201d Blueford\u2019s son was killed by Oakland police in 2012 and she\u2019s been fighting for reforms since. \u201cWe allowed you to kill our children, and you said this was going to change, and you reneged on it. If we keep funding them, it gives them the green light to continue \u201d. Community groups advocating for defunding have put forward differing strategies, some merely opposing police budget increases, others advocating mass reductions, and some fighting for full defunding as a step toward abolishing police forces. Some initiatives are tied to the fight to close prisons. All are pushing for a reinvestment of those dollars in services.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. The last two US secretaries of defense have both voiced stiff opposition to Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the George Floyd protests. Mark Esper, the current Pentagon chief, said categorically on Tuesday that he did not support invoking the Insurrection Act to allow active duty troops to be deployed in American cities, as the president has threatened. And in an extraordinary broadside, published by the Atlantic, Esper\u2019s predecessor James Mattis said he was \u201cangry and appalled\u201d by the behaviour of his former boss: Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2013 does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. As the largely peaceful demonstrations continued across the country on Wednesday night, it emerged that more than 3,000 people had been arrested in Los Angeles county during the unrest \u2013 the vast majority for non-violent offences such as failure to disperse. Amid the protests, the NYPD has restored its historic reputation for brutality, while the New York Times is under fire \u2013 including from members of its own staff \u2013 after it published an op-ed by GOP Senator Tom Cotton, calling on Trump to \u201csend in the troops\u201d. If this harsh response to protests occurred in another country, writes Michael H Fuchs, the US would rightly condemn it: In the same week that America is trying to pressure China over its repression in Hong Kong and commemorating the anniversary of China\u2019s violent crackdown against citizens in Tiananmen Square in 1989, the American government is threatening violence against peaceful protesters at home. Could Joe Biden really be a \u2018transformational\u2019 president? Barack Obama said on Wednesday that despite the division on display across the US, he remains \u201coptimistic\u201d about the future, and about the capacity of young people of colour to change the country for the better. During a Zoom event organised by the Obama Foundation, America\u2019s first black president said young protesters had \u201ccommunicated a sense of urgency that is as powerful and as transformative as anything that I\u2019ve seen in recent years\u201d. Obama\u2019s former vice-president, Joe Biden, now faces the challenge of convincing those protesters he has ambitions beyond just being \u201cbetter than Trump\u201d, reports Lauren Gambino. According to Akunna Cook, the former president of the Black Economic Alliance: \u201cBiden has the latitude to be a transformational president.\u201d Minnesota charges all four officers over George Floyd\u2019s death The attorney general of Minnesota, Keith Ellison, said on Wednesday that he had increased the charge against Derek Chauvin \u2013 the Minneapolis police officer who knelt on George Floyd\u2019s neck for almost nine minutes \u2013 from third- to second-degree murder. The other three officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd\u2019s death now face charges of aiding and abetting murder. Defund the police? Activists say one answer to police brutality is to cut law enforcement budgets and reinvest in services. And now some lawmakers say they agree, reports Sam Levin. Floyd tested positive. George Floyd tested positive for Covid-19 in April, according to his autopsy report \u2013 though the virus was not a contributing factor in his death. The WHO is restarting its hydroxychloroquine trials Last month, the World Health Organization halted its global clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine, the antimalarial drug touted by Trump and others as a possible Covid-19 treatment, after a study published by the Lancet raised concerns about the risks of the drug. But scientists have since questioned that study, while a Guardian investigation found it was based on flawed data from the small and little-known US firm Surgisphere. And so, on Wednesday, the WHO announced it would resume the trial after all. And yet, a separate study published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests the drug is no more effective in protecting people exposed to the virus than a placebo. More coronavirus updates: Cases are on the rise in 20 US states including California over the past five days, raising fears that reopening will increase the rate of transmission. Mexico and Brazil recorded their highest daily death tolls even as the Brazilian authorities push aggressively to reopen the country\u2019s economy. A small Spanish town was one of Europe\u2019s worst hotspots. The outbreak in La Rioja led to suspicion and recrimination among a tiny, tight-knit community, as Giles Tremlett discovered. In other news\u2026 At least 20,000 tonnes of diesel have spilled into a river in the Russian Arctic. Vladimir Putin has declared a state of emergency over the incident near Norilsk, which is already notorious as Russia\u2019s most polluted city. Trump tried to register to vote with the wrong address. The president, who has railed repeatedly against vote by mail, attempted to register in Florida last year under his Washington DC address: 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Florida does not allow people to register to vote without an in-state address. A jailed German paedophile is the prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann case, the most significant development to date in the high-profile disappearance of the three-year-old British girl in Portugal, 13 years ago. The oldest and biggest known structure built by the Mayas \u2013 a colossal elevated platform, built between 1000 and 800BC \u2013 has been discovered in Mexico\u2019s Tabasco state. Great reads The USA\u2019s 2002 World Cup quarter-finals run: an oral history It is 18 years this week since coach Bruce Arena started the USA men\u2019s team on a World Cup campaign that would change how the country \u2013 and the rest of the world \u2013 saw America\u2019s footballers. Eoin O\u2019Callaghan hears the story from those who were there. The whirlwind romances of lockdown Back in March, couples in England were advised to either stay apart in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus \u2013 or to move in together. It was a dilemma facing those in new relationships around the world. Sirin Kale spoke to some of the pairs who took the plunge. Opinion: the brands defending black lives used to silence us Candice Frederick was at first heartened to see it wasn\u2019t just black people demanding justice for the death of George Floyd \u2013 until she noticed organisations such as the NFL jumping on the Black Lives Matter bandwagon \u2013 the same platforms that previously silenced voices like Colin Kaepernick\u2019s. Black lives didn\u2019t matter to them then, so their shallow presentations of coalition don\u2019t matter to protesters now.

      "bodyText": "The luxury carmaker Aston Martin Lagonda plans to make 500 workers redundant as it looks to cut costs under new chief executive, Tobias Moers, because of the slump in sales due to the coronavirus pandemic. The company says it needs a smaller workforce because it is producing fewer cars than previously expected and due to improved productivity. Aston Martin says it will begin consulting employees and trade unions within days. It is also looking to cut costs in other areas, including contractor numbers, marketing and travel, as it battles its way back to profitability. It expects the cost-cutting to save \u00a328m , with the restructuring costing it \u00a312m in 2020. The company said it was still on track to deliver its first sports utility vehicle (SUV), the DBX, to customers in the summer, and says it has a strong order book for the vehicle, which is made at its factory at St Athan in south Wales. The DBX is seen as key for Aston Martin to boost its sales and appeal to new customers. The jobs announcement comes just days after Aston Martin sacked its chief executive, Andy Palmer, as part of a wider board overhaul, replacing him with Moers, who will join on 1 August from Mercedes-AMG, where he is the boss of the German carmaker\u2019s high-performance division. The share price of the British company, known as the maker of James Bond\u2019s favourite cars, has plunged since it floated on the stock market in October 2018. It is down 62% so far this year, currently trading at about 63p, giving the company a market value of around \u00a31.04bn, compared with \u00a34bn when it floated. The shares have traded higher since Palmer\u2019s departure, but slid 8% on the news of the job cuts. The company recently came close to going bust for the eighth time in its 107-year history. The coronavirus pandemic forced it to close 90% of its global dealerships, and in May it reported a loss of \u00a3119m for the first quarter of the year. Lawrence Stroll, the billionaire who became the executive chair of Aston Martin after leading a \u00a3536m rescue deal in March, agreed in recent weeks to inject more than \u00a375m in short-term funding to enable the company to fight off a cash crunch.",

That means potentially 1,000 additional deaths in St Petersburg in May tied to the pandemic. The new data, released by the city on Wednesday and first reported by Reuters, further indicates how Russia\u2019s conservative account of its coronavirus death toll may be missing out thousands of deaths, while feeding political talking points and informing policy decisions about tackling the outbreak and reopening the country. Russia has reported a 1.2% mortality rate from the disease, while Brazil and the US have reported higher than 5.6% and 5.8%, respectively, according to Johns Hopkins University. France posted a 15.4% mortality rate and Italy has posted a 14.4% mortality rate. But experts have said that comparing national mortality rates is misleading when reporting standards vary widely and that excess deaths are likely to give a clearer picture of the death toll from the disease. Russian officials have aggressively denied that the data on coronavirus deaths is being massaged. Even if corrected upward to reflect likely deaths from coronavirus, the death toll in cities such as St Petersburg or Moscow will probably remain far lower than in cities such as New York and London. Still, data posted in recent weeks by St Petersburg, Moscow and in regions such as Dagestan, has caused scandals, showing that deaths from pneumonia likely tied to the outbreak could be far higher than the official coronavirus death toll, sometimes by a factor of 10. In many other regions, data on total mortality for May and April remains unavailable, making it difficult to corroborate the government\u2019s official tally of deaths from coronavirus. The government\u2019s handling of the outbreak, including the economic backlash from tough self-isolation measures, has become a sensitive political issue. Amid economic difficulties, Vladimir Putin\u2019s approval ratings reaching their lowest point in 20 years in early May, the independent Levada Centre reported. Russian officials have told the public to expect a sharp rise in mortality from Russia\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, the third largest in the world after the US and Brazil. But Russia\u2019s state statistics agency postponed plans to release April\u2019s mortality data for the whole country, saying it needed extra time because of closures of local registration offices. The data will be released on 15 June. St Petersburg\u2019s governor, Alexander Beglov, said in mid-May that 694 people had died of pneumonia since the coronavirus outbreak began, while the city had tallied just 63 deaths from the disease. Russia\u2019s conservative reporting standards require an autopsy to show that patients died of coronavirus, rather than simply that they died while infected with the disease, unlike countries in western Europe. The St Petersburg data showed that the city issued 6,427 death certificates in May of this year, a rise of 1,552 recorded deaths from last May and 1,400 deaths higher than the average for that month over the previous decade. More deaths were recorded in May 2020 than in any month over the previous decade. Death rates usually rise in winter and early spring, occasionally to over 6,000, as recently as 2018.",

It\u2019s not an official figure, but comes from their own tally of arrest reports.</p> \n  <p>The AP figures show that Los Angeles has had more than a quarter of the national arrests, followed by New York, Dallas and Philadelphia. Many of the arrests have been for low-level offences such as curfew violations and failure to disperse. Hundreds were arrested on burglary and looting charges.</p> \n  <p>During the course of the protests it has been a common refrain from the authorities that \u201coutside agitators\u201d from out-of-town were responsible for the highly visible protests. Minnesota governor Tim Walz even went as far as to say that 80 percent of the participants in the demonstrations were from out of state.</p> \n  <p>The AP figures tell a different story. In a nearly 24-hour period from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon, 41 of the 52 people cited with protest-related arrests in Minneapolis had Minnesota driver\u2019s licenses, according to the Hennepin County sheriff.</p> \n  <p>Likewise, in the nation\u2019s capital, 86 percent of the more than 400 people arrested as of Wednesday afternoon were, according to AP, from Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia.</p> \n  <p>Los Angeles Chief Michel Moore told the city\u2019s Police Commission Tuesday the bulk of the arrests, about 2,500, were for failure to disperse or curfew violations. The rest were for crimes including burglary, looting, assaults on police officers and other violence. </p> \n  <p>The only other U.S. city with an arrest toll that comes close to Los Angeles\u2019 is New York, with about 2,000.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed8a3848f082107f453a7bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T07:42:57.226Z\">8.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>If you\u2019ve been following the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on social media you may have been surprised this morning by a sudden flood of Korean characters and the repeated phrase: \u201cWe stand against racial discrimination.

Here\u2019s a review what\u2019s transpired over the last few hours:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Protests continued across the US, with demonstrators defying curfew to take a stand against police brutality. </strong>In Washington DC, people marched and sang, despite the amped-up presence of officers from several federal agencies including the FBI, Ice and the DEA.

But that didn\u2019t stop them from trying to exploit racial tensions among US forces to encourage desertion in the closing days of World War II. </p> \n  <p>\u201cCreating wedges between people had been a Nazi strategy since the party\u2019s inception.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Widely seen as one of the \u201cadults in the room\u201d who attempted to restrain Trump during his first years in office, Mattis resigned as defense secretary over the president\u2019s attempts to withdraw troops from Syria. </p> \n  <p>His dissatisfaction with the president was widely known, but in 2019 the retired marine published a memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/01/call-sign-chaos-review-james-mattis-trump\">Call Sign Chaos</a>, which only obliquely referred to his differences with Trump. Publicising the book, Mattis said he believed it would be inappropriate for him to criticise a sitting president. </p> \n  <p>It seems Trump\u2019s actions on Monday, when he ordered an assault on peaceful protesters outside the White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/trump-washington-walk-to-the-church-photo-op\">so he could stage a photo op at St John\u2019s church</a>, helped to change Mattis\u2019s mind.

Most of the reforms needed should take place locally, Obama says. It is mayors and county executives that determine police practices, he says, and district and state attorneys decide whether to prosecute cases of police misconduct.</p> \n  <p>Obama says he has been hearing \u201ca little bit of chatter\u201d on the internet about \u201c<strong>voting vs protest</strong>\u201d, and that perhaps civil obedience is a better course of action to achieve change.

There is something different here, he says. Nowadays there is a far more representative cross-section of America, he says, out on the streets protesting, and a majority of Americans think the protests over George Floyd\u2019s death are justified.

Here\u2019s a summary of what you need to know about today so far: Protests continued overnight, but with seemingly less violence overall. Some cities were scaling back their response - Seattle is cancelling a planned curfew However, New Orleans police confirm they used tear gas, and there was violence in New York injuring protestors and the police AP figures put the number of arrests so far in protests about the killing to be 10,000 nationwide Barack Obama offered words of hope and optimism about the future Former defence secretary James Mattis launched an extraordinary attack on the president over his handling of the protests, accusing him of dividing the US Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, has spoken out over the killing of George Floyd, telling pupils at her old high school \u201cI am so sorry that you have to grow up in the world where this is still present.\u201d Follow the latest developments here: Star Wars actor John Boyega was one of the most high profile people protesting in London yesterday, and he has won praise for his address to the crowd. Despite admitting himself that it was potentially a risky move for his career, he has received widespread praise from others associated with Star Wars and Boyega\u2019s films. Our film editor Catherine Shoard has more on this story here, looking at the reaction to Boyega\u2019s speech. Lego has asked its partners to pull all marketing for police themed sets as part of its response to the ongoing black lives matter protests in the US. More than 30 building sets, minifigures and accessories are included on the list, distributed amongst affiliate marketers and widely published on social media. Amongst the sets to be pulled are \u201cPolice Dog Unit\u201d, \u201cPolice Bike\u201d and \u201cPolice Station\u201d, but also some products with a less obvious connection to the police, including \u201cFire Plane\u201d, \u201cBarbecue Burn Out\u201d and \u201cDonut Shop Opening\u201d. The Lego Architecture version of the White House, a \u00a390 model intended for adult builders, is also included on the list. In a statement, a Lego spokesperson said \u201cWe requested that our affiliate partners refrain from posting promotional LEGO content as part of our decision to respect #BlackOutTuesday and pause posting content on our social media channels in response to the tragic events in the US. We regret any misunderstanding and will ensure that we are clearer about our intentions in the future.\u201d On its Twitter feed Lego, a statement said the company \u201cstands with the black community against racism and inequality. There is much to do. \u201cWe will donate $4m to organisations dedicated to supporting black children and educating all children about racial equality,\u201d the company added. In a move sure to irk Donald Trump, Iranian president Hassan Rouhani has described George Floyd\u2019s killing as \u201cbrutal\u201d and criticised Trump for posing for photos while holding a Bible. In a televised speech he said \u201cWe express sympathy toward the American people who are on the streets while harshly condemning the crime. It is a shame that the president stands with a Bible when he plans to act against his people.\u201d The two presidents are not shy about discussing protests in the other\u2019s nation. Earlier in the year Trump repeatedly tweeted support for protestors in Iran, including a direct appeal to them in Farsi. In the UK overnight the family of Lee Rigby have issued a statement asking right-wing social media users to stop using the name of the late soldier in posts aimed at denigrating the #BlackLivesMatter movement. The statement, posted on Facebook by the Lee Rigby Foundation reads: As a foundation and a family we are aware of a number of posts using images of Lee and his murder in a divisive way to fuel arguments against the Black Lives Matter protests. Lee proudly served his country to protect the rights and freedoms of all members of this great melting pot of a nation. Seeing his image used to cause hate of any kind especially for those exercising their freedoms in protest against this issue hurts. We find these post extremely heartbreaking and distressing, and in complete opposition to what Lee stood for. We ask you all to please stop using his image and memory in such posts as he was a lover of all humanity. Signed by Lee\u2019s mother Lyn, the message goes on to state that \u201cOur thoughts and support goes out to George Floyd\u2019s friends and family at this tragic time.\u201d Fusilier Lee Rigby of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers was murdered in a terror attack in Woolwich, southeast London, in May 2013. His attackers were sentenced in 2014 to life imprisonment. Associated Press are reporting that more than 10,000 people have now been arrested in protests against racism and police brutality in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death. It\u2019s not an official figure, but comes from their own tally of arrest reports. The AP figures show that Los Angeles has had more than a quarter of the national arrests, followed by New York, Dallas and Philadelphia. Many of the arrests have been for low-level offences such as curfew violations and failure to disperse. Hundreds were arrested on burglary and looting charges. During the course of the protests it has been a common refrain from the authorities that \u201coutside agitators\u201d from out-of-town were responsible for the highly visible protests. Minnesota governor Tim Walz even went as far as to say that 80 percent of the participants in the demonstrations were from out of state. The AP figures tell a different story. In a nearly 24-hour period from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon, 41 of the 52 people cited with protest-related arrests in Minneapolis had Minnesota driver\u2019s licenses, according to the Hennepin County sheriff. Likewise, in the nation\u2019s capital, 86 percent of the more than 400 people arrested as of Wednesday afternoon were, according to AP, from Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia. Los Angeles Chief Michel Moore told the city\u2019s Police Commission Tuesday the bulk of the arrests, about 2,500, were for failure to disperse or curfew violations. The rest were for crimes including burglary, looting, assaults on police officers and other violence. The only other U.S. city with an arrest toll that comes close to Los Angeles\u2019 is New York, with about 2,000. If you\u2019ve been following the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on social media you may have been surprised this morning by a sudden flood of Korean characters and the repeated phrase: \u201cWe stand against racial discrimination. We condemn violence. You, I and we all have the right to be respected. We will stand together.\u201d The source of this is the world\u2019s biggest K-Pop band, BTS, who posted on social media this morning: The post on Twitter is already rapidly approaching 1 million likes after just an hour, and has mobilised their huge social media army, who are currently retweeting, quoting and fund-raising for the #BlackLivesMatter movement. The band\u2019s following were also active on social media earlier in the week - flooding hashtags like #BlueLivesMatter and #WhiteLivesMatter with pictures and videos of the band, to drown out anti-#BlackLivesMatter sentiment. Their K-Pop tweets on the main #BlackLivesMatter hashtag itself may not be universally welcomed however. Tuesday\u2019s attempt at a social media blackout was criticised by some activists complaining that the string of blank images and silent posts was inhibiting the ability for people to share useful information with the hashtag. If you missed former president Barack Obama\u2019s intervention yesterday you can catch up with the highlights in this video package. His main theme was of optimism for the future, citing \u201ca far more representative cross-section of America out on the streets peacefully protesting and who felt moved to do something because of the injustices\u2026 That didn\u2019t exist back in the 1960s.\u201d Unlike James Mattis, Obama avoided explicit criticism of the current administration. You can read more about what Obama said here: \u2018Your lives matter\u2019: Obama offers words of hope in contrast to Trump\u2019s division Meghan Markle has spoken out about the death of George Floyd in a video recorded for students graduating from her old high school, Immaculate Heart, in Los Angeles \u201cI know you know that black lives matter,\u201d the Duchess of Sussex said in the video. \u201cFor the past couple of weeks I\u2019ve been planning on saying a few words to you for your graduation and as we\u2019ve all seen over the last week what is happening in our country, and in our state and in our home town of LA is absolutely devastating \u201cFirst thing I want to say to you is that I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry that you have to grow up in a world where this is still present,\u201d she said in her message. The duchess admitted in the video that she was worried about saying the right thing and that she expected her words to be \u201cpicked apart\u201d. It is unusual for members of the British royal family to comment on political issues - however Meghan and her husband Prince Harry have been anything but conventional in their approach to royal life. They effectively retired from royal duties in March, and are currently living in Los Angeles with their son Archie. \u201cThe only wrong thing to say is to say nothing. Because George Floyd\u2019s life mattered, and Breonna Taylor\u2019s life mattered, and Philando Castile\u2019s life mattered and Tamir Rice\u2019s life mattered and so did so many other people whose names we know, and whose names we do not know,\u201d she said. The 38-year-old also reflected on her own memories of the 1992 LA riots. \u201cThose memories don\u2019t go away and I can\u2019t imagine that at 17 or 18 years old, which is how old you are now, that you would have to have a different version of that same type of experience,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s something you should have an understanding of, but an understanding of as a history lesson not as your reality. So I\u2019m sorry that in a way we have not gotten the world to the place you deserve it to be.\u201d The MLS winger Aleksandar Katai, who plays for LA Galaxy, has found himself embroiled in a racism row after it appeared his wife had posted inflammatory messages about the George Floyd protests on her Instagram account. Tea Katai\u2019s posts were written in Serbian and appeared to be a call to \u201ckill\u201d protesters, with another calling them \u201cdisgusting cattle\u201d. The team issued the following statement: \u201cThe LA Galaxy strongly condemned the social posts and requested their immediate removal. The LA Galaxy stands firmly against racism of any kind, including that which suggests violence or seeks to demean the efforts of those in pursuit of racial equality. The LA Galaxy stand with communities of color, and especially the Black community, in the protests and fight against systemic racism, social inequality, bigotry and violence.\u201d There\u2019s a steady stream of stunning images coming through from last nights protests from across the US, and indeed the world. The protests and grief over the killing of George Floyd have dominated headlines in the US and around the world for over a week, and are not likely to let up at any point soon. A huge focus today will be the first of the memorial services for Floyd. Associated Press reports that the first service will be this afternoon at North Central University in Minneapolis. Rev. Al Sharpton, founder of the National Action Network, and Floyd family attorney Ben Crump will speak. Floyd\u2019s body will then go to Raeford in North Carolina, where he was born, for a two-hour public viewing and private service for the family on Saturday. Finally, a public viewing will be held Monday in Houston, where he was raised and lived most of his life. A 500-person service on Tuesday will take place at The Fountain of Praise church and will include addresses from Sharpton, Crump, and the Rev. Remus E. Wright. Here\u2019s a summary of the key points in the last few hours In a highly unusual intervention, former defence secretary James Mattis condemned Trump\u2019s handling of the George Floyd protests, saying \u201cDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people\u201d. The New York Times is being criticised by its own staff for an op-ed by a Republican senator urging Trump to \u201csend in the troops\u201d. Protests continued in major US cities overnight, but seemingly with less confrontation than in previous days. Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti has announced that he will scrap a planned budget boost for the city\u2019s police department, diverting some of the funds to efforts to address problems faced by black residents. Donald Trump addressed claims that he was hiding in a bunker while protest took place in DC by claiming that he briefly visited it to \u201cinspect\u201d it. In Australia, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has warned against \u201cimporting the things that are happening overseas to Australia\u201d after protesters gathered in Sydney to denounce the killing of George Floyd and to rally against Indigenous deaths in custody. I\u2019m Martin Belam in London, and I\u2019ll be running the blog here until handing over to my colleagues in New York in a few hours. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Thank you for following along and, as always, to those who took the time to get in touch. My colleague Martin Belam will once again be steering this ship for the next few hours. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has announced that he will scrap a planned budget boost for the city\u2019s police department, diverting some of the funds to efforts to address problems faced by black residents, NPR reports. The planned boost had included $41 million in bonuses. NPR continues, \u201cNot only will the LAPD budget not increase, the mayor is also looking to make cuts. He said he is committed to slashing another $250 million within the department as he plans to do across all others.\u201d NBC reports that two police officers involved in an apparent assault on Australian journalists have been placed on administrative duty, according to officials. \u201cIn a statement, United States Park Police acting Chief Gregory T. Monahan said the move came while the 1 June incident in Lafayette Square is investigated,\u201d NBC reports. Here is our video of the incident: You can read more about it here: A member of a Texas city council has resigned under fire over a social media response he made to a protest of George Floyds death in Minneapolis police custody, AP reports. Paris City Council member Benny Plata submitted his resignation at a special meeting Tuesday. Mayor Steve Clifford called the meeting to censure Plata after the council member messaged a protester, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave America if it\u2019s so bad,\u201d The Paris News reported. Plata said he really cares about the city and was responding to one person berating America. In Australia, the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, has warned against \u201cimporting the things that are happening overseas to Australia\u201d after protesters gathered in Sydney to denounce the killing of George Floyd in the United States and to rally against Indigenous deaths in custody. Further protests are planned in cities around Australia in the next few days. The prime minister acknowledged during a radio interview on Thursday that Australia also had problems \u201cin this space\u201d that it needed to address, but insisted those issues were being dealt with and \u201cwe don\u2019t need to draw equivalence here\u201d. You can get in touch with me directly on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Today in pictures: Here is the video referred to in the previous post: The police department in Charlotte, North Carolina\u2019s largest city, is coming under criticism after a video posted to social media appeared to show officers using chemical agents on demonstrators who were boxed in while protesting the death of George Floyd. The video was recorded Tuesday night by Justin LaFrancois, co-founder and publisher of the alternative Charlotte newspaper Queen City Nerve. He said officers fired tear gas and flash-bangs from behind the protesters, and in front of them as well. He also said officers perched on top of buildings were firing pepper balls down on the crowd. \u201cWe were completely trapped,\u201d LaFrancois said. \u201cThere was one way to get out, and half of the group did go out that way through the tear gas and through the pepper balls. But for the rest of us, the only route of escape ... was to pull up a gate on the parking structure that we were pressed up against.\u201d Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said on Twitter they are looking into the incident: Venezuela\u2019s authoritarian leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, railed against President Donald Trump on Wednesday, while expressing solidarity with the family of George Floyd, whose death in Minneapolis has sparked protests and street violence across the United States, AP reports. Maduro accused Trump of turning the US military against his own people. He spoke on state TV at a ceremony decorating Venezuelan soldiers credited with fending off a recent attack that the socialist leader blames on Trump. Maduro also extended Venezuela\u2019s solidarity with young and black people in the US He says they are taking to the streets demanding an end to racism and police violence. The White House has launched a campaign to oust Maduro. The US and other nations as well as human rights groups condemn Maduro for employing brutal force and torture to silence Venezuelans who oppose the socialist government. In Liberty, Missouri, civil rights organizations on Wednesday called for the resignation of Kansas City Police Chief Rick Smith, hours after a group of mostly black pastors demanded changes to improve relations between police and the city\u2019s minority community, AP reports. The Urban League of Greater Kansas City, the NAACPs Kansas City, Missouri branch, and More2 said in a statement that Smith should resign because of his handling of excessive force complaints and officer-involved shootings of black men. \u201cSince November 2019, our Civil Rights organizations, in collaboration with faith and community leaders, have become increasingly appalled and very much concerned about Chief Smiths questionable leadership of the Kansas City Police Department,\u201d the coalition said in a statement. The group also criticized the city\u2019s Board of Police Commissioners for allowing Smith to conduct internal investigations of officer-involved shootings and complaints of excessive force rather than calling in independent investigators. A group of mostly black religious leaders made similar demands earlier Wednesday, but without calling for Smiths resignation. Public relations officers for the department did not immediately respond to the demand that Smith resign. Hi, Helen Sullivan joining you now. I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest news from across the country for the next few hours \u2013 please do get in touch on Twitter with questions, feedback, and, of course, news from wherever you are. I\u2019m @helenrsullivan. Alternatively, send me an email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com That\u2019s it from me today. My colleague Helen Sullivan will continue providing live updates. Here\u2019s a review what\u2019s transpired over the last few hours: Protests continued across the US, with demonstrators defying curfew to take a stand against police brutality. In Washington DC, people marched and sang, despite the amped-up presence of officers from several federal agencies including the FBI, Ice and the DEA. In San Francisco, protesters took the streets by foot and by horse. And in Seattle, demonstrations continued as the mayor announced that the curfew would be lifted. The former defense secretary, James Mattis, who quit over the president\u2019s attempts to withdraw troops from Syria, condemned the president\u2019s handling of protests in DC and around the country. Mattis, like other former military and defense officials, excoriated Trump for having peaceful protestors gassed so he could pose for a photo. Additional charges were filed against the former police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd. The Minnesota attorney general, Keith Ellison, said that the murder charge against Derek Chauvin had been elevated to second-degree murder, and three other officers had been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. Kayleigh McEnany signaled defense secretary Mark Esper\u2019s job may be in trouble. Asked during her White House briefing about whether the president still has faith in Esper, the press secretary said, \u201cAs of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper.\u201d The comment came after Esper said he would not support sending active-duty troops to states that have seen protests, as Trump has suggested. A prominent US police chief called for a nationwide ban on chokeholds in response to Floyd\u2019s death. Cerelyn \u201cCJ\u201d Davis, the police chief of Durham, North Carolina, said on Good Morning America, \u201cThe emotions and feelings that we see expressed out on the streets of cities all across the country going way back are substantiated. There have been years and years of systemic racism in law enforcement.\u201d Trump has moved to block Chinese airlines from flying to the US, as tensions intensify between the two countries over the coronavirus pandemic and trade. The announcement comes after Beijing said it would not allow United Airlines and Delta Air Lines to resume flights this week to China. The 22-year-old Latino man who was fatally shot by police in Vallejo, California amid firey protests was kneeling outside a Walgreens and was not carrying a firearm, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Sean Monterrosa, 22, of San Francisco died after a police officer opened fire because of a \u201cperceived threat\u201d Vallejo police chief Shawny Williams said at a news conference earlier today. Though Monterrosa was killed at around 12:30am on Tuesday morning, the police department did not report his death until today. The officer who shot the young man has been placed on administrative leave. The officer thought he saw a handgun at Monterossa\u2019s waist; it turned out to be a hammer, Williams explained at a news conference. The department would not release the name of the officer. On Tuesday, the city called in 50 troops from the National Guard to assist during protests. As the clock ticked past 8pm in downtown Oakland, thousands of protesters stepped into a major intersection and sat down, chanting their message loud and clear: \u201cFuck your curfew\u201d. The sit-in at 14th and Broadway in Oakland marked the sixth straight night of protest in the city with a long history of black liberation struggle \u2013 and a troubled police department that is currently under a consent decree. Organizers said they planned to stay in the intersection for two hours. Local racial justice organizations had called for the demonstration in response to police behavior on Monday evening, the first night of the curfew, when 15,000 people joined a march organized by high school students. Twenty minutes before curfew began, and without warning, police unleashed a barrage of teargas and flash bangs on a crowd of hundreds. \u201cOur babies were peacefully dispersing,\u201d said Cat Brooks, the leader of the Anti-Police Terror Project, from the back of a pickup truck in the intersection. \u201cThey teargassed our children.\u201d The large crowd includes longtime organizers and first-time protesters. One black woman told the Guardian that seeing the video of George Floyd reminded her of a time she was shopping with her sister and a white friend, and security called the police, who wrongfully arrested her and her sister, but let the white friend go. \u201cI just remember the handcuffs. I felt like my hands were going to fall off.\u201d The woman asked the Guardian to withhold her name because she is concerned about backlash for protesting at her job, where she is the only black employee. She said she was scared to break the curfew, but determined. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said. \u201cI know this is where I belong.\u201d Opinion: The perils of being black in public: we are all Christian Cooper and George Floyd Carolyn Finney, the author of Black Faces, White Spaces: Reimagining the Relationship of African Americans to the Great Outdoors, and a scholar-in-residence at Middlebury College in Vermont, writes for the Guardian: In the summer of 1997, I lived in Seattle. I worked at a temp job while preparing to start my master\u2019s degree in the fall. I was walking to a bus stop after a day at the office, when I stepped into a pothole on the street and heard my ankle crack. Feeling lightheaded and fearing I would black out, I limped in search of a payphone, and found that when I looked to passersby for help, no one stopped. I reached a corner and saw a young white man and woman with two kids. With tears in my eyes, I asked for their help. But like everyone else, they backed away and left me alone. As an African American woman who enjoys spending time outside, I have encountered this reaction \u2013 an absence of any desire, willingness or responsibility to engage \u2013 in both crowded cities and in nature. For black people, navigating both city streets and hiking trails can be charged; at worst, they are fraught terrains where we are at the mercy of someone else\u2019s interpretation of our presence. Too often, by default, black people are perceived as threats to white people\u2019s physical safety. And as a consequence, it is our physical safety that is compromised, as the stories of Christian Cooper, the birdwatcher who filmed a white woman in Central Park lying to the cops about how he was threatening her (when all he did was ask her to leash her dog), and George Floyd, the man who died with a police officer\u2019s knee on his neck, illustrate. Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle has announced that the city has canceled its curfew. Meanwhile, in Oakland, protestors are gathering ahead of curfew. Demonstrators are planning to hold a sit-in in defiance of the order, my colleague Julia Carrie Wong reports: The massive demonstration in the heart of San Francisco is still going strong Here are this week\u2019s main developments on Covid-19, as American wrestles with civil unrest. Where are cases of coronavirus increasing? More cases are being detected in a number of southern states, including Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. But cases are not increasing only in southern states. Alaska, Montana and California have also seen cases increase. In total, 17 states are seeing increases. These increases reflect infections that may have taken place weeks ago. The novel coronavirus has a long incubation period, and people may not get tested until they feel ill. Where are cases of coronavirus decreasing? Broadly speaking, the states which had the worst outbreaks this spring and the most severe stay-at-home orders are bending the curve downward. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, Washington DC and seven other states are all seeing reductions in cases. Mass protests began in Minnesota last week over the killing of Floyd on 25 May, but it may take weeks for increases in case to show up in testing data, because of the virus\u2019s long incubation period. It is also unclear whether temperature could play a role in limiting the spread of this disease now that summer is approaching. Protestors in gathered near the White House sang \u201cLean on me\u201d. The number of coronavirus cases in California is on the rise after weeks of optimism that infections had slowed, raising fears that plans to reopen counties, along with mass protests against police brutality, could accelerate transmission of the virus. According to numbers from Johns Hopkins University, which has been tracking coronavirus cases and deaths, California is one of 20 states that have seen an uptick in cases in the past five days. Just this week, daily cases of Covid-19 hit a new high across the state, topping 3,000 new daily confirmed cases for the second time in a week and contributing to the 115,000 cases and more than 4,300 deaths the state has reported since the pandemic began. California has been held up as a model for its response to the coronavirus, locking down earlier, and being slower to lift shelter-in-place orders compared to other states. But recent weeks have seen counties push back on the orders, in some cases reopening sections of the economy in defiance of orders from Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor. The Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho reports from San Francisco: Thousands gathered in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District on Wednesday to protest the police killing of George Floyd and remember the other black and brown lives lost to police violence in recent years. Among the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cdefund the police\u201d signs, Aztec dancers danced and protesters burned sage. Organizers handed out masks, gloves and water bottles. Alongside chants of \u201cGeorge Floyd\u201d and \u201cBreonna Taylor,\u201d protesters shouted the name of their own who were killed by police: Mario Woods. Jessica Williams. Alex Nieto. Oscar Grant in Oakland. \u201cThey still feel like they can just kill us,\u201d said 15-year-old McKinna Lincoln. Her mother, Mink Lincoln-Price, brought her five-year-old and seven-year-old sons with them to the protest. Lincoln-Price said as the mother of black boys, this past week has been really emotional. The protesters marched to the Mission police station, where in 2016, five activists went on a hunger strike following a series of police killings. Police lined up outside the station, and protesters chanted at them, \u201cQuit your job!\u201d In recent years, much of San Francisco\u2019s black community has been pushed out of the city, with the population dwindling to below 6% in recent years. By comparison, 37% of San Francisco\u2019s homeless population is black. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say \u2018Black lives matter,\u2019\u201d said a protester who asked to only be identified as Marie. \u201cIt\u2019s another thing to see it.\u201d As many predicted, Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to criticize James Mattis, the former defense secretary who today condemned the president\u2019s response to the nationwide protests. Mattis resigned over Trump\u2019s attempts to withdraw troops from Syria. Floyd tested positive for coronavirus in April, according to a full autopsy report released by the Hennepin county medical examiner\u2019s office. The report noted that the virus was not a contributing factor in his death. The office states Floyd \u201cbecame unresponsive while being restrained by law enforcement officers; he received emergency medical care in the field and subsequently in the Hennepin HealthCare (HHC) Emergency Department, but could not be resuscitated.\u201d Floyd\u2019s family asked doctors to conduct an independent autopsy. Although both the county and the independent report agree that Floyd\u2019s death was a homicide, the county\u2019s account says there were drugs in Floyd\u2019s system. The county also said heart disease was an issue; the independent report didn\u2019t find that to be the case. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he will introduce legislation requiring federal officers posted domestically to wear identification. Reporters covering the DC protests have noted that it\u2019s unclear which branch some of the officers posted around the district serve. Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, is expected to announce plans to remove a prominent statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee in the state capital. AP reported the news. Activists have been advocating for the removal of the Lee statue, and other monuments to the Confederacy for years. On Monument Avenue in Richmond, Virginia, Lee\u2019s statue is one of five Confederate monuments. This weekend, several of those monuments \u2013 including Lee\u2019s statue and those of Confederate generals JEB Stuart and Stonewall Jackson \u2013 were marked with graffiti. The headquarters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy was also scrawled on with spray paint, and it burned for while over the weekend. The Guardian\u2019s California reporter Vivian Ho is at the protest in San Francisco today. And she\u2019s reporting that once again, we\u2019ve got demonstrators on horseback. In Washington DC, personnel from the national guard, US Park Police, Secret Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration, US Marshals Service, Bureau of Prisons, Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement are all out patrolling the streets. Because Washington is a district, not a state, the president and federal government have more leeway to deploy a range of officers. Thousands of protesters have marched through central London in an overwhelmingly peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstration that culminated in passionate crowds gathering at the heart of Westminster. The demonstrators: \u2018No justice, no peace, no racist police\u2019, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019 and \u2018the UK is not innocent\u2019, in a lockdown-defying demonstration that was largely organized through word of mouth and social media away from established anti-racism groups. Meanwhile, law enforcement sent to quell protests in DC are equipped with tools used by military forces. Stun grenades, or flashbangs, were designed 40 years ago to help military special forces rescue hostages. They create a bright flash and ear-splitting boom, designed to disorient. The New York Times\u2019 decision to run an op-ed from the Republican senator Tom Cotton titled \u201cSend in the troops\u201d is drawing widespread criticism, including from Times staff. Employees are tweeting \u201cRunning this put Black @nytimes staffers in danger\u201d along with screenshots of Cotton\u2019s piece. A former New York Times Op-Ed editor, and the current Los Angeles Times editorial page editor has also weighed in. A police officer in California shot and killed a 22-year-old San Francisco resident. Sean Monterrosa, 22, was killed in Vallejo after an officer mistook a hammer on Monterrosa\u2019s waistband as a gun. Monterrosa was suspected of trying to break into a Walgreens, according to the police department, which has refused to release the name of the officer, according to the Mercury News. The Vallejo police chief, Shawny Williams, said at a news conference that the police officer \u201cresponded to a perceived threat\u201d. Mattis\u2019 statement condemning Trump\u2019s handling of nationwide protests contains an implicit jab at current defense secretary Mark Esper and other officials. \u201cWe must reject any thinking of our cities as a \u2018battlespace\u2019 that our uniformed military is called upon to \u2018dominate.\u2019,\u201d Mattis wrote. \u201cIt erodes the moral ground that ensures a trusted bond between men and women in uniform and the society they are sworn to protect.\u201d Mattis condemned the mobilization guardsmen to \u201cviolate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens\u2014much less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside. The Senate has cleared a bill to give businesses more flexibility on Paycheck Protection Plan loans. The bill will allow businesses 24 weeks instead of eight to spend PPP money and have the loans forgiven. The legislation is now on its way to Trump, who will need to sign it into law. In perhaps the most extraordinary passage of James Mattis\u2019s extraordinary condemnation of Donald Trump, which was published by the Atlantic an hour ago, the former Marine Corps general and US defense secretary seems to equate the president\u2019s behaviour in dividing Americans with the aims of the Nazi regime during the second world war. Mattis writes: \u201cInstructions given by the military departments to our troops before the Normandy invasion reminded soldiers that \u2018The Nazi slogan for destroying us \u2026 was \u2018Divide and Conquer.\u2019 Our American answer is \u2018In Union there is Strength.\u2019\u2019 We must summon that unity to surmount this crisis \u2013 confident that we are better than our politics. Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2013 does not even pretend to try. Instead, he tries to divide us. \u201d In a Medium post from 2017, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum elaborated on the Nazis\u2019 strategy and propaganda efforts. \u201cThe Nazis were virulent racists,\u201d the post says, \u201c\u2026 they identified black people as an inferior, alien race that threatened the future existence of western society. But that didn\u2019t stop them from trying to exploit racial tensions among US forces to encourage desertion in the closing days of World War II. \u201cCreating wedges between people had been a Nazi strategy since the party\u2019s inception.\u201d Widely seen as one of the \u201cadults in the room\u201d who attempted to restrain Trump during his first years in office, Mattis resigned as defense secretary over the president\u2019s attempts to withdraw troops from Syria. His dissatisfaction with the president was widely known, but in 2019 the retired marine published a memoir, Call Sign Chaos, which only obliquely referred to his differences with Trump. Publicising the book, Mattis said he believed it would be inappropriate for him to criticise a sitting president. It seems Trump\u2019s actions on Monday, when he ordered an assault on peaceful protesters outside the White House so he could stage a photo op at St John\u2019s church, helped to change Mattis\u2019s mind. Defense secretary Mark Esper and Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, accompanied Trump on his walk to the church. Mattis joined criticism of their presence and wrote: \u201cWe know that we are better than the abuse of executive authority that we witnessed in Lafayette Square.\u201d Now the gloves are off, eyes may turn to HR McMaster, Trump\u2019s second national security adviser and an Army general. He has a book coming out, delayed by the coronavirus pandemic to September, which is said to deal with his time in office. McMaster has rarely spoken in public since he left Trump\u2019s employ \u2013 though in May 2018 he did speak to the Guardian: about rugby. Here\u2019s Lloyd Green\u2019s review of Mattis\u2019s memoir: Three men with ties to a right-wing extremist movement have been arrested on terrorism-related charges, the AP reports. Authorities said there was a conspiracy to spark violence during the protests in Las Vegas. Prosecutors said the thee white men had US military experience and were arrested after making Molotov cocktails in glass bottles and filling cans with gas, according to a criminal complaint obtained by the AP. Read on: They were arrested Saturday on the way to a protest in downtown Las Vegas after filling gas cans at a parking lot and making Molotov cocktails in glass bottles, according to a copy of the criminal complaint obtained by The Associated Press. The complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas on Wednesday said they self-identified as part of the \u201cboogaloo\u201d movement, which U.S. prosecutors said in the document is \u201ca term used by extremists to signify coming civil war and/or fall of civilization.\u201d Stephen T. Parshall, 35, Andrew T. Lynam Jr., 23, and William L. Loomis, 40, were being held on $1 million bond each in the Clark County jail Wednesday, according to court records. Each currently faces two federal charges \u2014 conspiracy to damage and destroy by fire and explosive, and possession of unregistered firearms \u2014 along with multiple terrorism-related state charges. Court records don\u2019t list lawyers for the men. As Donald Trump\u2019s threat to stick the military on American citizens draws widespread criticism, including from former Trump administration defense secretary James Mattis, reporters in DC are documenting a huge show of law enforcement, including military vehicles and military police holding a line against protestors. Hi there, it\u2019s Maanvi Singh \u2014 blogging from the West Coast. Barack Obama ended his virtual town hall with this closing thought: \u201cThis country was founded on protest. It is called the American Revolution. Every step of progress in this country, every expansion of freedom, every expression of our deepest ideals, has been won through efforts that made the status quo uncomfortable.\u201d Former defense secretary James Mattis has broken his silence on the Trump administration, fiercely criticizing the president\u2019s handling of the recent mass protests over George Floyd\u2019s death. In statement published by the Atlantic, Mattis accuses the president of dividing the country and ordering the military to violate the constitutional rights of Americans. \u201cDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2014 does not even pretend to try. Instead, he tries to divide us,\u201d Mattis writes. \u201cWe are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.\u201d Mattis, who resigned as defense secretary in 2018 in protest over Trump\u2019s widely criticized decision to withdraw US forces from Syria, goes on to accuse the president of having violated the rights of Americans for a photo op in Washington DC this week. \u201cWhen I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution,\u201dthe statement says. \u201cNever did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens\u2014much less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside.\u201d Obama is speaking again, and has paid tribute to the speakers so far - activist Brittany Packnett Cunningham, former attorney general Eric Holder, Minneapolis councilperson Fellipe Cunningham, and Color of Change president Rashad Robinson. The former president said he\u2019s feeling \u201conce again inspired\u201d by how they\u2019re thinking \u201cstrategically\u201d about how to enact change. Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, is talking about how to channel the energy seen at the protests over George Floyd\u2019s death into meaningful change. He said it\u2019s about \u201cpushing for justice but recognizing we need to move people up a ladder of engagement.\u201d Here\u2019s Robinson\u2019s most recent opinion piece for the Guardian, on how the Covid-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted people of color, and revealed racism in the US health system. Here are some clips from Obama\u2019s opening address: Eric Holder, Obama\u2019s first attorney general, speaks first, remembering the case of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014 and discussing how to keep people safe while reforming police and policing and the criminal justice system. Involve the community, engage the police and bring them together, he says, which he says the Obama administration did in forming its 21st-century policing task force and producing its recommendations. \u201cIt laid the foundation for future work,\u201d Holder says. No one has mentioned the Trump administration yet. There will now be a discussion, involving Obama, led by the activist Britney Packnett Cunningham. I\u2019ll listen in. Obama appeals to the young to get involved in the push for change, pointing to civil rights leaders, feminist leaders, and leaders of the union and environmental movements too, King among them, who began to work for their cause when young. He is optimistic, he says, that \u201cthis country\u2019s going to get better\u201d. The young of America have witnessed too much violence and death, he says, and \u201ctoo often that violence has come from folks supposed to be serving and protecting you\u201d. Obama also acknowledges \u201cthe folks in law enforcement that share the goals of reimagining policing\u201d, who he says he knows are just as outraged as many of the protesters out on the streets across the country. He is heartened, he says, by seeing police and other officers who have engaged with the protests over George Floyd\u2019s death. Obama discusses his task force on 21st-century policing, which was formed after the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014. Its report, he says, \u201cshowcased a range of proven strategies and aims\u201d meant to be used for reforms. Most of the reforms needed should take place locally, Obama says. It is mayors and county executives that determine police practices, he says, and district and state attorneys decide whether to prosecute cases of police misconduct. Obama says he has been hearing \u201ca little bit of chatter\u201d on the internet about \u201cvoting vs protest\u201d, and that perhaps civil obedience is a better course of action to achieve change. Unsurprisingly, Obama doesn\u2019t agree. \u201cThis is not an either-or,\u201d he says, having noted the local positions above are by and large voted for. He says he is urging every mayor in the US to review use-of-force policies with their communities and commit to reforms they can make. He also thinks every city in the US should \u201cbe a My Brother\u2019s Keeper community\u201d, aiming to expand opportunity for young men of colour, because the programme can make a difference. Obama closes these remarks by saying people are reminded of the 60s by the current unrest and discord. There is something different here, he says. Nowadays there is a far more representative cross-section of America, he says, out on the streets protesting, and a majority of Americans think the protests over George Floyd\u2019s death are justified. The country must use this momentum for change, he says. Barack Obama is speaking now. The 44th president founded My Brother\u2019s Keeper, the host for this virtual town hall, in 2014 after the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, a teenager in Florida. He begins by saying the US has recently seen \u201cepic changes and events as profound as anything I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime\u201d. Obama was born in 1961, so he was seven or so when Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated, and the last civil unrest on a comparable scale was seen. He begins by paying tribute to George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, the African Americans most recently violently killed in events which are fueling the current protests nationwide, and across the world. Obama also notes the disporportionate effects on communities of colour of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 105,000 people in the US. Such problems are the result of the \u201coriginal sin of our society\u201d, meaning racial injustice, Obama says, but says recent events offer an opportunity for America to work together for change. The Obama event is about to begin but here\u2019s a snap from the Associated Press: defense secretary Mark Esper has reversed the decision to send active duty troops back to their bases after they were moved towards Washington, as the president threatened to deploy them against protesters. Earlier, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany pointedly did not say Esper\u2019s job was safe, after he told reporters he disagreed with Trump over the possible need to deploy troops. In an abrupt reversal, Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Wednesday overturned an earlier Pentagon decision to send a couple hundred active-duty soldiers home from the Washington DC region, amid growing tensions with the White House over the military response to the protests. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told the Associated Press that the reversal came after Esper attended a meeting at the White House, and after other internal Pentagon discussions. It is unclear if Esper met with President Donald Trump. McCarthy said he believes the change was based on ensuring there is enough military support in the region to respond to any protest problems if needed. McCarthy said he received notice of the Pentagon order to send about 200 soldiers with the 82nd Airborne\u2019s immediate response force home just after 10am Wednesday. Hours later, the Pentagon notified him that Esper had reversed the decision. While we wait for Barack Obama to speak on police reform at an Obama Foundation online event, here\u2019s our sports editor on the controversy enveloping a great NFL quarterback\u2026 New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees did not back down from comments on Wednesday that he will \u201cnever agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States\u201d, when asked about the prospect of NFL players kneeling for the national anthem during the upcoming season. Brees reiterated his opposition to the non-violent protest of police violence launched by Colin Kaepernick during the 2016 season in an interview with Yahoo Finance published on Wednesday, his first remarks since last week\u2019s police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. \u201cI will never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States of America or our country,\u201d the future Hall of Famer said. \u201cLet me just tell what I see or what I feel when the national anthem is played and when I look at the flag of the United States. \u201cI envision my two grandfathers, who fought for this country during world war two, one in the Army and one in the Marine Corps. Both risking their lives to protect our country and to try to make our country and this world a better place. So every time I stand with my hand over my heart looking at that flag and singing the national anthem, that\u2019s what I think about.\u201d Brees\u2019s comments drew immediate criticism from one of his highest-profile teammates, Pro Bowl wide receiver Michael Thomas, who tweeted: \u201cHe don\u2019t know no better.\u201d You can read the full story here: That\u2019s it from me today. My colleagues, Martin Pengelly and Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Additional charges were filed against the former police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd. Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison said that the murder charge against Derek Chauvin had been elevated to second-degree murder, and three other officers had been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. Kayleigh McEnany signaled defense secretary Mark Esper\u2019s job may be in trouble. Asked during her White House briefing about whether the president still has faith in Esper, the press secretary said, \u201cAs of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper.\u201d The comment came after Esper said he would not support sending active-duty troops to states that have seen protests, as Trump has suggested. McEnany was criticized for comparing Trump\u2019s controversial photo op at St John\u2019s Church to Winston Churchill visiting bombing sites during World War II. McEnany said Trump\u2019s visit was a \u201cpowerful\u201d symbol that sent \u201ca message of resilience and determination,\u201d like Churchill inspecting bombing sites or George W Bush throwing out the first baseball pitch after the September 11 attacks. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said the White House was \u201cdelusional\u201d for making the comparison. A prominent US police chief called for a nationwide ban on chokeholds in response to Floyd\u2019s death. Cerelyn \u201cCJ\u201d Davis, the police chief of Durham, North Carolina, said on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d \u201cThe emotions and feelings that we see expressed out on the streets of cities all across the country going way back are substantiated. There have been years and years of systemic racism in law enforcement.\u201da Trump has moved to block Chinese airlines from flying to the US, as tensions intensify between the two countries over the coronavirus pandemic and trade. The announcement comes after Beijing said it would not allow United Airlines and Delta Air Lines to resume flights this week to China. Martin and Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Citing a commitment not to \u201camplify voices who incite racial violence and injustice,\u201d Snap said Wednesday that it will no longer promote Donald Trump\u2019s posts to users who do not already follow him. \u201cWe are not currently promoting the President\u2019s content on Snapchat\u2019s Discover platform,\u201d a spokesperson for Snap said in a statement, referring to a section of the social media app where users can see content from news outlets, professional publishers, and public figures. \u201cWe will not amplify voices who incite racial violence and injustice by giving them free promotion on Discover. Racial violence and injustice have no place in our society and we stand together with all who seek peace, love, equality, and justice in America.\u201d Trump\u2019s account will be allowed to remain on the platform, and users who choose to follow it will still see its posts. Trump tripled his following on the youth-focused platform to 1.5m followers over the past eight months amid a push to reach young voters, Bloomberg reported last month. Snap joins Twitter in taking previously unimaginable action to limit the reach of the president\u2019s social media posts out of concern that his racist rhetoric will incite violence. The move is less of a stretch for Snap than it was for the company that once boasted of being \u201cthe free speech wing of the free speech party\u201d; Snapchat was launched as a more private and ephemeral alternative to platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and has never made claims to being an open forum for political debate. Still, Snap\u2019s decision will likely increase pressure on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has come under intense criticism from civil rights leaders and Facebook employees over his decision to allow Trump\u2019s threat that \u201cwhen the looting starts the shooting starts\u201d remain on the platform. Facebook employees have continued to speak out publicly against their boss on Twitter in the wake of an all-staff meeting Tuesday where the billionaire CEO defended his reasoning. \u201cHonestly why is this guy in charge,\u201d one Facebook employee, product designer Nick Inzucchi, wrote on Twitter in response to an article about Zuckerberg. \u201cTech CEOs should not be making one-off content policy decisions, least of all for those who might regulate them ... Mark is just not doing a very good job. He needs to sit down, be humble, and empower someone who gets it.\u201d Hallie Golden reports for the Guardian from Seattle: Washington State Patrol has apologized after an officer was recorded on video during protests in Seattle Tuesday night telling his team members: \u201cDon\u2019t kill them, but hit them hard\u201d. On Wednesday morning, WSP spokesman Chris Loftis apologized for the \u201cpoor choice of words,\u201d saying they \u201crecognize the hurt and confusion it has caused.\u201d The instructions by the team leader were given in Seattle\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood in preparation for a push maneuver, which involves pushing protesters who are acting aggressive or not complying with orders away from a certain area. The officer who gave the instructions has not been identified. The viral video of the officer, which was posted on Twitter, has received a mix of responses, with some saying his instructions were needed, while many others called it \u201cdisgusting\u201d or \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Loftis said in a statement sent to the Guardian that the troopers have been working in difficult and dangerous situations, and \u201cthey are doing so with courage, commitment and compassion, but not always with perfection.\u201d The video was captured on the fifth consecutive night of George Floyd protests in Seattle, which have remained primarily peaceful. On Tuesday evening, protesters in Capitol Hill had been on the streets at least two hours past the city\u2019s 9 p.m. curfew, when water bottles were reportedly thrown at law enforcement. The police fired pepper spray and used flash bangs on the crowd. The state patrol has deployed about 200 troopers each day since Friday to Seattle and other cities across Washington to help with crowd control. Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison has just concluded his press conference announcing additional charges in connection to the killing of George Floyd. Ellison acknowledged there was a level of public distrust around prosecutors carrying out police brutality cases because \u201cour country has underprosecuted these matters.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t control the past,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cAll we can do is take the case that we have in front of us right now and do our good faith best to bring justice to this situation, and we will.\u201d Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison said that, in order to charge Derek Chauvin with first-degree murder, prosecutors would need to find evidence of \u201cpremeditation and deliberation\u201d in the killing of George Floyd. Many critics have called on Chauvin to be charged with first-degree murder, but Ellison only elevated the charge to second-degree murder today. Asked whether he expected the cases against the officers to go to trial or if they would take plea deals, Ellison said it was too early to make a prediction. Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison asked for \u201ccontinued patience\u201d from the public as officials continue to investigate the killing of George Floyd. Ellison warned that his office would likely not be able to say very much publicly about the investigation in the days to come. Ellison said the road ahead would be difficult, but he expressed confidence in Hennepin county attorney Mike Freeman, noting Freeman has previously successfully prosecuted a murder case against a police officer. \u201cWe\u2019re confident in what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cBut history does show that there are challenges here.\u201d Ellison emphasized that \u201cGeorge Floyd mattered\u201d and recongized that these additional charges cannot solely rectify \u201cthe hurt and loss that so many people feel.\u201d Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison has confirmed the murder charge against Derek Chauvin has been elevated and the three other police officers fired over the killing of George Floyd have been charged. Chauvin will now be charged with second-degree murder, and the three other officers \u2014 Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane \u2014 will be charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. The attorney general thanked the American people for their \u201cpatience\u201d in recent days as his office sorted through the additional charges. Senator Amy Klobuchar\u2019s office reponded to questions about why she confirmed the additional charges in the Floyd case before Keith Ellison did. A Klobuchar spokesperson claimed the Minnesota senator was only repeating reporting from the Star Tribune about the expected charges to be announced by the state\u2019s attorney general. Klobuchar\u2019s original tweet sparked questions about why the senator had gotten ahead of Ellison\u2019s announcement, with some saying the lawmaker was acting more like a journalist. House spekaer Nancy Pelosi attended a protest in Washington, as news broke that additional charges would be filed against the Minneapolis police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd. Asked about the expected additional charges, Pelosi celebrated the news and praised Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison for taking action. A CNN reporter also asked Pelosi about White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany comparing Trump\u2019s controversial visit to St John\u2019s Church to Winston Churchill visiting bombing damage during World War II and George W Bush throwing out the first pitch at a baseball game after the September 11 attacks. \u201cI think they\u2019re hallucinating,\u201d Pelosi said in response. Attorney Ben Crump said Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison has told the Floyd family that Derek Chauvin\u2019s murder charge would be elevated to first-degree murder if additional evidence supported it. \u201cThis is a significant step forward on the road to justice, and we are gratified that this important action was brought before George Floyd\u2019s body was laid to rest,\u201d Crump said in a statement on the additional charges being filed today against the three other officers involved in the killing of Floyd. \u201cThat is a source of peace for George\u2019s family in this painful time. Attorney General Ellison has informed the family that his office will continue to investigate and will upgrade the charges to first-degree murder if the evidence supports it.\u201d Crump emphasized that Americans should continue fighting to demand change from the country\u2019s police officers. \u201cWe are deeply grateful for the outpouring of support by Americans in cities across the country, and we urge them to raise their voices for change in peaceful ways,\u201d Crump said. \u201cOur message to them is: Find constructive and positive ways to keep the focus and pressure on. Don\u2019t let up on your demand for change.\u201d As we await the official announcement from Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison about additional charges in the George Floyd case, the attorney representing the Floyd family reacted to reports of the charges. Attorney Ben Crump said the Floyd family was \u201cdeeply gratified\u201d that the murder charge against Derek Chauvin would be elevated to second-degree murder and that the other three officers involved would be charged, calling this a \u201cbittersweet moment.\u201d According to court records in Minnesota today, the charges that we expect the state\u2019s attorney general, Keith Ellison, to announce shortly against the police officers fired over the killing of George Floyd have been filed. They confirm a second-degree murder charge against Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for almost nine minutes, and charges against the other three officers present of aiding and abetting second-degree murder, CNN reported. First degree murder charges require evidence of pre-planning. Crowds singing as they mourn at site where George Floyd was killed. As we wait to hear from Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison at a press conference imminently to announce new charges in the George Floyd case, timing still to be confirmed, protesters at the site where Floyd died under the knee of a police officer 10 days ago are singing. Emotional crowds are singing the civil rights resistance anthem \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d in the sunshine. The site is a mass of flowers and chalked tributes. People danced with the elation of relief when news seeped through that Ellison will announce new charge since taking over the case from the county prosecutor. We\u2019re expecting the charges against Derek Chauvin, who kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck, to be elevated from third degree murder to second degree murder, which has to show intention to kill. And the three other officers who were with Chauvin and helped hold Floyd down and kept away bystanders who wanted to intervene, could be charged with aiding and abetting murder, and possibly other charges. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has just concluded her briefing, which was particularly newsy today. Hours after defense secretary Mark Esper said he was opposed to using the Insurrection Act to send active-duty troops to states with George Floyd protests, McEnany said, \u201cThe president has the sole authority to invoke the Insurrection Act.\u201d Esper said this morning that such a drastic step should only be used as a \u201clast resort,\u201d but McEnany told reporters, \u201cIt is definitely a tool within [Trump\u2019s] power.\u201d According to reports, the president and his team privately expressed frustration with Esper this morning after the cabinet secretary came out in opposition to using the 1807 law to deploy active-duty troops. Repeatedly pressed on why peaceful protesters near the White House were forcibly removed on Monday. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany pinned that decision on attorney general William Barr. McEnany said Barr \u201cmade the order\u201d to expand the perimeter near the White House, and she dodged questions about why the protesters were forcibly removed 30 minutes before Washington\u2019s curfew went into effect. When asked why Barr made the order to remove the protesters, McEnany said it was \u201cbecause we were not going to see the church burn another night,\u201d referencing the damage to St John\u2019s Church on Sunday night. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany praised Trump\u2019s visit to St John\u2019s Church on Monday, which has been criticized by many religous leaders. McEnany compared the president\u2019s visit to Winston Churchill visiting bombing damage during World War II and George W Bush throwing out the first pitch at a baseball game after the September 11 attacks. Trump\u2019s visit to the church, moments after peaceful protesters nearby were forcibly removed using tear gas, was criticized as a thoughtless photo op, during which he used the Bible as a \u201cprop.\u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the forcible removal of peaceful protestes near the White House on Monday. Echoing claims from the Trump campaign, McEnany said no tear gas had been used against the protesters. However, the US Park Police confirmed that officers deployed pepper balls against the protesters, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers pepper spray to be tear gas. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany tip-toed around a question about defense secretary Mark Esper, amid questions over whether Trump will dismiss the senior official. Asked whether Trump still has confidence in Esper, McEnany told reporters, \u201cIf he loses confidence in Secretary Esper, I\u2019m sure you will be the first to know.\u201d The press secretary ominously added, \u201cAs of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper.\u201d That comment will likely intensify speculation that Trump will dismiss Esper after the defense secretary broke with the president\u2019s proposal to send active-duty troops to states in reponse to the George Floyd protests. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has started her briefing, and she opened by saying Trump\u2019s physical results would soon be released. The announcement comes seven months after the White House said Trump unexpectedly visited Walter Reed to complete part of his physical. \u201cIn summary, the president remains healthy,\u201d McEnany said of the physical results, declining to go into details. McEnany went on to quote Dr Martin Luther King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech to criticize looting amid the George Floyd protests. Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar has confirmed that the state\u2019s attorney general, Keith Ellison, intends to elevate the murder charge against Derek Chauvin and file charges against the three other police officers fired over the killing of George Floyd. Ellison is expected to soon deliver an announcement on the charges, and the Floyd family and attorney Ben Crump have said they are confident that the officers will be charged. Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison intends to elevate the murder charge against former police officer Derek Chauvin and file charges against three of his former colleagues over the killing of George Floyd, according to the Star Tribune. The Minnesota newspaper reports: Ellison is expected to provide an update this afternoon on the state\u2019s investigation into Floyd\u2019s death. According to sources, former officer Derek Chauvin, recorded on video kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck as he begged for air on May 25, will now be charged with second-degree murder. The other three officers at the scene \u2014 Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane \u2014 will also be charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, according to the sources, who spoke on conditions of anonymity. Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter Friday, but many critics argued the former officer should have been charged with first-degree murder. Law enforcement officers patrolling DC have declined to identify themselves, raising concerns about lack of transparency days after protesters near the White House were forcibly removed using tear gas. According to an MSNBC reporter, the officers enforcing a perimeter near the White House have removed all insignias and name plates that would identify themselves. DC mayor Muriel Bowser confirmed yesterday that the Trump administration floated the idea of taking control of the DC police during the George Floyd protests, which would be allowed under federal law. Bowser said she would consider the use of that federal provision to be \u201can affront to our limited home rule and to the safety of the District of Columbia.\u201d Trump originally tried to register to vote in Florida while listing his \u201clegal residence\u201d as the White House, according to the Washington Post. The Post reports: The September 2019 registration application listed Trump\u2019s legal residence as 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, the location of the White House. That created a potential problem for Trump: Florida law requires voters to be legal residents of the state. A month later, Trump resubmitted his application to use a Florida address and in March he voted by mail in Florida\u2019s Republican primary. Trump\u2019s original voter-registration application, which was obtained by The Washington Post via a public records request, was filed during a time when the president was making a highly publicized move to change his permanent residence from his Manhattan penthouse to Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach, Fla. The voter application is dated Sept. 27, 2019 \u2014 the same day that Trump made the domicile change. On one of his forms that day he was telling Florida officials that his \u2018legal residence\u2019 was Washington, D.C., and on another he was saying he was a \u2018bona fide resident\u2019 of Palm Beach. The report will likely increase scrutiny of Trump\u2019s criticism of vote by mail, which he has claimed (without evidence) is particularly susceptible to voter fraud, even though voter fraud is very rare. The president has repeatedly said he is opposed to states\u2019 efforts to expand vote by mail amid the coronavirus crisis, claiming fear of contracting the virus is not a valid reason to request a mail-in ballot. A Republican member of the House armed services committee said he agreed with Mark Esper\u2019s statement that it was not necessary to deploy active-duty troops to states with George Floyd protests. \u201cI agree with Secretary Esper,\u201d congressman Bradley Byrne wrote in a tweet. \u201cAt this time, there is absolutely no reason to use the Insurrection Act to deploy active-duty U.S. forces. That is a tool that should only be used as an absolute last resort.\u201d On Monday, Trump threatened to use the 1807 law to send military troops to states, but Esper said he disagreed with that suggestion during a press conference this morning. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Additional charges are expected to be announced against the four officers fired over the killing of George Floyd. Former officer Derek Chauvin has already been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, and Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison is expected to announce additional charges this afternoon. Defense secretary Mark Esper said he does not support sending active-duty troops to states that have seen protests. The president has threatened to use the Insurrection Act of 1807 to send troops to the states, but Esper said such a decision should only be used as a \u201clast resort\u201d and is not currently necessary. Trump has moved to block Chinese airlines from flying to the US, as tensions intensify between the two countries over the coronavirus pandemic and trade. The announcement comes after Beijing said it would not allow United Airlines and Delta Air Lines to resume flights this week to China. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. George Floyd\u2019s son, Quincy Mason Floyd, and attorney Ben Crump, who has been representing the Floyd family, are visiting the site of Floyd\u2019s killing in Minnespolis. Crump and the younger Floyd kneeled in prayer at the site, where a police officer put a knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than eight minutes. Crump said he and the Floyd family \u201cabsolutely believe that he was tortured\u201d to death, adding that they are \u201cconfident\u201d all four police officers fired over the killing of Floyd will be charged. Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison is expected to announce additional charges this afternoon, while former officer Derek Chauvin has already been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. \u201cWe expect all police officers to be arrested before we have the memorial here in Minneapolis tomorrow,\u201d Crump said. He continued, \u201cWe cannot have two justice systems in America, one for black America and one for white America. We must have equal justice for the United States of America.\u201d \u201cChange is going to come in the tragic killing of George Floyd,\u201d Crump said. \u201cThat change starts today.\u201d Greg Gianforte, the Republican congressman from Montana who infamously attacked a Guardian reporter in 2017, won a gubernatorial primary on Tuesday. He will now face lieutenant governor Mike Cooney in the race to replace Steve Bullock, the Democratic governor who briefly ran for the presidential nomination and is now mounting a strong challenge for a US Senate seat. Here\u2019s a video in which reporter Ben Jacobs, who left the Guardian last year, describes the \u201cbody slam\u201d assault, which happened at Gianforte\u2019s campaign headquarters in Bozeman in May 2017. The video begins with audio of the moment Gianforte, in answer to a question about healthcare reform, slammed Jacobs to the ground. As the Guardian reported when Gianforte was charged with assault: Fox News reporter Alicia Acuna, field producer Faith Mangan and photographer Keith Railey witnessed the incident \u2026 according to an account published on the Fox News website. After Jacobs asked Gianforte his question, Acuna wrote: \u201cGianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground behind him. \u201cFaith, Keith and I watched in disbelief as Gianforte then began punching the man, as he moved on top the reporter and began yelling something to the effect of \u2018I\u2019m sick and tired of this!\u2019 \u2026 To be clear, at no point did any of us who witnessed this assault see Jacobs show any form of physical aggression toward Gianforte, who left the area after giving statements to local sheriff\u2019s deputies.\u201d Donald Trump has praised Gianforte, who first said Jacobs had provoked the attack but then pleaded guilty and was sentenced to community service, a $385 fine and 20 hours of sessions for anger management. Gianforte wrote a letter of apology to Jacobs, as part of a civil settlement under which he also gave $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists. He also promised to sit down for an interview with Jacobs but when it became clear he would not do so, Jacobs said in a statement: \u201cI forgave Congressman Gianforte for his unprovoked attack and his slanderous statement afterwards in hope that this behavior was an aberration. Instead, I have become increasing convinced that those actions were a display of his true character. Here\u2019s a story about the release of Gianforte\u2019s police mugshot: New York police officers were captured on video shoving and yelling expletives at two Associated Press reporters, as the journalists covered the city\u2019s George Floyd protests last night. In the video, the officers can be heard ordering the reporters to go home as New York\u2019s curfew neared. When the journalists attempt to explain that members of the media are exempt from the city\u2019s curfew order, two officers\u2019 language became profane. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit,\u201d one officer says. Another tells videojournalist Robert Bumsted, \u201cget the fuck out of here you piece of shit.\u201d The incident comes as a number of journalists across the country have been arrested and injured as they sought to cover the protests, sparking criticism of the police\u2019s treatment of the press. The Minnesota attorney general has reportedly reached a decision on filing additional charges against the police officers who were fired over the killing of George Floyd. CNN reports: One of the [law enforcement] officials said state Attorney General Keith Ellison will be making a significant announcement in the case early this afternoon. The officials would not reveal what the decision was. Three now-former officers can be seen on video on top of Floyd during his killing on May 25. Derek Chauvin, who had his knee pressed into Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degre manslaughter. Former officers Thomas Lane and J.A. Keung, who helped restrain Floyd, and a fourth former officer, Tou Thao, who stood near the others, have not yet been charged. When the charges against Chauvin were announced on Friday, many critics said his colleagues should have been charged along with him, but Hennepin county attorney Mike Freeman said that he expected additional charges to be filed. The Trump administration is moving to block Chinese airlines from flying into the US, as tensions escalate between the two countries over the coronavirus pandemic and trade. The announcement came after Beijing said it would not allow United Airlines and Delta Air Lines to resume flights this week to China, which sparked US complaints that the country was violating an agreement between the two governments. The transportation department said its new policy would take effect on June 16. \u201cThe Department will continue to engage our Chinese counterparts so both U.S. and Chinese carriers can fully exercise their bilateral rights,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cIn the meantime, we will allow Chinese carriers to operate the same number of scheduled passenger flights as the Chinese government allows ours.\u201d Several hundred protesters have gathered at the Capitol to protest the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, two days after protesters near the White House were forcibly removed using tear gas. Despite the intense heat in Washington today, the demonstrators gathered at the Capitol to peacefully protest police brutality. They chanted the names of those killed by police in recent weeks and kneeled to honor their memories before lying down on the ground for more than eight minutes, in recognition of the length of time that a police officer kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck. Philadelphia has removed a statue of former mayor Frank Rizzo, who has been severely criticized for his treatment of African American and LGBT residents of the city in the 1970\u2019s. Rizzo spent three years serving as the city\u2019s police commissioner, followed by two terms as mayor. Rizzo opposed the desegregation of Philadelphia\u2019s schools, and he was criticized for overseeing a polce force that often resorted to brutality against residents. In recent years, Philadelphians have called for the removal of the statue, and it has become a focal point of the city\u2019s George Floyd protests in recent days. Democratic mayor Jim Kenney had the statue removed overnight. \u201cThe continued display of the statue has understandably enraged and hurt many Philadelphians, including those protesting the heinous murders of George Floyd and too many others. I have seen and heard their anguish. This statue now no longer stands in front of a building that serves all Philadelphians,\u201d Kenney said in a statement. \u201cThe statue is a deplorable monument to racism, bigotry, and police brutality for members of the Black community, the LGBTQ community, and many others. The treatment of these communities under Mr. Rizzo\u2019s leadership was among the worst periods in Philadelphia\u2019s history,\u201d At his press briefing, defense secretary Mark Esper also said he had asked the army secretary, Ryan McCarthy, to launch an inquiry into a National Guard medevac helicopter that was filmed hovering low over protesters in Washington, in an apparent effort to disperse them by intimidation and the strong wind from its rotor. Esper said it was only confirmed it was a National Guard helicopter on Tuesday and that he ordered the inquiry within an hour of learning about it. \u201cI want to make sure I understand why,\u201d Esper said. \u201cWhat happened? Who was involved? What orders were they given or not given? Was there a safety issue involved with an aircraft. hovering that low? So there\u2019s a lot of questions that need to be answered.\u201d Esper refused to be drawn in to making an initial assessment but he did offer an alternative to the general view that the helicopter was using for intimidation. \u201cI got a report back that they were asked by law enforcement to look at a checkpoint, a National Guard checkpoint, to see if there were protesters around, so there\u2019s conflicting reports,\u201d Esper said. He did not explain why a helicopter would be needed to spot protesters when the streets were full of law enforcement officers from various agencies, nor why a helicopter would have to hover so low to confirm the presence of protesters on the street. Defense secretary Mark Esper claimed he and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Mark A Milley, had planned to thank National Guard members who were on duty near the White House when they accompanied Trump to St John\u2019s Church on Monday. \u201cIt was also my aim and General Milley\u2019s to meet with and thank the members of the National Guard, who are on duty that evening in the park. It is something the president likes to do as well,\u201d Esper said. But the cabinet secretary added, \u201cThe path we took to and from the church didn\u2019t afford us that opportunity.\u201d Instead, Esper and Milley accompanied Trump to a photo op at the church, which has sparked criticism that the senior officials are politicizing the military. \u201cI was not aware of a photo op was happening,\u201d Esper said. \u201cOf course, the president drags a large press pool along with him. And look, I do everything I can to try stay apolitical and try and stay out of situations that may appear political and sometimes I\u2019m successful with doing that, and sometimes I\u2019m not as successful, but my aim is to keep the department out of politics, to stay apolitical.\u201d Defense secretary Mark Esper said he \u201cdid know\u201d that he was accompanying Trump to St John\u2019s Church on Monday night, but he claimed he \u201cwas not aware that a photo op was happening.\u201d Esper has been widely criticized for partcipating in the photo op, with one member of the Defense Science Board even resigning over the issue. In his resignation letter, James N Miller criticized the president for the forcible removal of protesters near the White House on Monday. \u201cYou may not have been able to stop President Trump from directing this appalling use of force, but you could have chosen to oppose it,\u201d Miller wrote to Esper. \u201cInstead, you visibly supported it.\u201d Esper said yesterday that he believed he was accompanying Trump to Lafayette Square to inspect damage from the protests. \u201cI thought I was going to do two things: to see some damage and to talk to the troops,\u201d Esper told NBC News. Mark Esper, the defense secretary, has said there is no grounds for invoking the Insurrection Act, which Trump has threatened to do. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed and continue to believe that the National Guard is best suited for performing domestic support to civil authorities and these situations in support of local law enforcement,\u201d Esper told reporters at the Pentagon. \u201cI say this not only as Secretary of Defense, but also as a former soldier, and a former member of the National Guard, the option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort, and only in the most urgent and dire of situations. We are not in one of those situations now. I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act.\u201d On Monday night, Trump said National Guard troops must \u201cdominate the streets\u201d or he would use the Insurrection Act of 1807 to send military troops to the states where George Floyd protests have intensified. Trump has contradicted details of the reports that the Service Service took him to the underground bunker on Friday night as George Floyd protests unfolded near the White House, out of concern for his safety. The president said he had gone to the bunker during the day \u201cfor a tiny, little, short period of time,\u201d but he claimed the visit was \u201cmore for an inspection.\u201d Trump said the Secret Service had encouraged the \u201cinspection.\u201d \u201cThey said it would be a good time to go down and take a look because maybe sometime you\u2019re going to need it,\u201d Trump said. The president noted he has been to the bunker \u201ctwo and half\u201d times because he\u2019s \u201cdone different things\u201d while there, but he claimed moments earlier that his visits had been \u201call for inspection.\u201d Multiple outlets reported that Trump was taken to the bunker on Friday night, as the president privately expressed alarm for his own safety. The New York Times reported: Inside the White House, the mood was bristling with tension. Hundreds of protesters were gathering outside the gates, shouting curses at President Trump and in some cases throwing bricks and bottles. Nervous for his safety, Secret Service agents abruptly rushed the president to the underground bunker used in the past during terrorist attacks. The scene on Friday night, described by a person with firsthand knowledge, kicked off an uneasy weekend at the White House as demonstrations spread after the brutal death of a black man in police custody under a white officer\u2019s knee. While in the end officials said they were never really in danger, Mr. Trump and his family have been rattled by protests near the Executive Mansion that turned violent for a third night on Sunday. This is Joan Greve, taking over for Joanna Walters. Ella Jones was elected as the first African-American mayor of Ferguson, Missouri, yesterday, six years after the a police officer fatally shot Michael Brown, sparking protests that drew international attention to the Black Lives Matter movement. Jones, who serves on the Ferguson city council, is also the first woman to become the mayor of the city, and both she and her opponent have expressed support for the protests continuing across the country in response to the killing of George Floyd. \u201cI\u2019ve got work to do \u2014 because when you\u2019re an African-American woman, they require more of you than they require of my counterpart,\u201d Jones said in a video shared by a Missouri journalist after her victory. \u201cI know the people in Ferguson are ready to stabilize their community, and we\u2019re going to work together to get it done.\u201d The existential choice facing America was laid bare on Tuesday, as Donald Trump and Joe Biden set out radically contrasting visions for a nation convulsed by seven nights of protests over police brutality and racial injustice. The president visited the Saint John Paul II National Shrine in Washington, after threatening to deploy the American military against the American people and being eviscerated by church leaders for using the Bible as a political prop. Biden, the former vice-president and presumptive Democratic nominee for president in November, delivered a sombre speech at Philadelphia\u2019s city hall, suggesting the US is at one of the most important crossroads in its history. A week of demonstrations were triggered by the killing of George Floyd, an African American man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes, even after Floyd stopped moving and pleaded: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Those words are still \u201cechoing across this nation\u201d, Biden said in his most high-profile public appearance since the coronavirus pandemic forced him to campaign from home. A prominent US police chief has called for \u201csweeping reforms\u201d to policing in the US to reverse entrenched racism and also demanded a national ban on chokeholds - the kind of restraints that killed George Floyd 10 days ago when an officer in Minneapolis knelt on his neck and Eric Garner in New York in 2014 who died with a police arm around his neck. Both men\u2019s dying words included \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, which has become a national, and even international, cry during protests against police brutality. Cerelyn \u201cCJ\u201d Davis, the police chief of Durham, North Carolina, called for the ban on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America show moments ago, and was joined by two other senior police leaders who also backed reforms. \u201cThe emotions and feelings that we see expressed out on the streets of cities all across the country going way back are substantiated. There have been years and years of systemic racism in law enforcement,\u201d she said. Davis was appointed in 2016. ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos asked if there was a need for a nationwide ban on chokeholds \u201cand the kind of neck restraint we saw that ended up with the death of George Floyd\u201d. \u201cWe not just need a nationwide ban, we need nationwide standards,\u201d Davis said, decrying the \u201csmorgasbord\u201d of standards across US departments. \u201cWe need sweeping changes that are supported with legislation..to ensure that every agency large and small have the best practices in place or we are going to continue to see these..we don\u2019t want to see this any more.\u201d Terrence Monahan, chief of department at the New York Police Department, said that all police leaders needed to \u201ctake a good hard look at their agency, to bridge the gap between cops and community.\u201d He added that dialogue was crucial. \u201cWhatever reforms there are it\u2019s important that we see one another as human,\u201d he said. Houston\u2019s police chief, Art Acevedo, echoed the Texas governor in rejecting Donald Trump\u2019s threat to send the US military into states that don\u2019t control the protests and \u201cdominate\u201d their streets. \u201cThis is Texas, cities are safe, things are going well here, we do not need any support in terms of federal troops.\u201d He said the local departments were trusted by their communities \u201cby and large\u201d. And he added he was honored that George Floyd\u2019s family had invited the police to help them organize the man\u2019s funeral next week, in his native Houston. NYPD chief Terence Monahan has been doing the TV round this morning - appearing on Today He said an earlier curfew helped take out of neighborhoods \u201cpeople who didn\u2019t belong there\u201d and that officers had allowed peaceful protests to continue beyond 8pm. He said those who had broken off from the main groups \u201clooking to cause mayhem\u201d had been rapidly dealt with. He also responded to criticism from Governor Andrew Cuomo, saying that he should never call his officers ineffective, and said that last night \u201c[Cuomo\u2019s] office called and apologised to me\u201d and said the Cuomo had called the commissioner directly to apologise. You can watch the full interview here: Monahan\u2019s comments don\u2019t entirely square with Associated Press reports that two of their journalists were surrounded, shoved and had expletives yelled at them while simply trying to cover the protests in New York last night. In a video clip, videojournalist Robert Bumsted is heard explaining to the officers that the press are considered \u201cessential workers\u201d and are allowed to be on the streets. An officer responds \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d Another tells Bumsted \u201cget the fuck out of here you piece of shit.\u201d British prime minister Boris Johnson has described the death of George Floyd as \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cinexcusable\u201d in the British parliament - but he also cautioned protests to stay \u201clawful and reasonable\u201d. There is a weekly session in London where the prime minister is grilled by MPs, and this week Keir Starmer, the leader of the UK\u2019s main opposition Labour party, opened by saying: \u201cCan I start by expressing shock and anger at the death of George Floyd. This has shone a light on racism and hatred experienced by many in the US and beyond.\u201d He want on to castigate Johnson for his lack of response so far, urging the UK to send a strong message to the US president: \u201cI\u2019m surprised the prime minister hasn\u2019t said anything about this yet, but I do hope that next time he speaks to President Trump he will convey to him the UK\u2019s abhorrence about his response to the events.\u201d For his part, Johnson responded: \u201cI think what happened in the United States was appalling, it was inexcusable. We all saw it on our screens, and I perfectly understand people\u2019s right to protest, though obviously I also believe that protests should take place in a lawful and reasonable way.\u201d Fatima Bhutto has written for us today about yesterday\u2019s #blackouttuesday and #theshowmustbepaused campaigns, which she scathingly dismisses as \u201ca facile attempt at armchair activism\u201d. At exactly the moment when power requires interrogation and urgent reckoning, social media users, celebrities and influencers rallied for silence. Whereas 24 hours earlier, users had been posting legal information, names of pro bono lawyers and bail funds, filming videos of wanton cruelty and abuses of power, now they were shtum, save for the sanctimonious black squares. You can read the full piece here: Fatima Bhutto - As responses to George Floyd\u2019s death go, #BlackOutTuesday was embarrassing More details are emerging about the death of retired police captain David Dorn in St Louis, Missouri, after his widow, St. Louis police Sgt. Ann Marie Dorn, spoke to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. He was apparently killed by people who had broken into a pawn shop. His widow said Dorn frequently checked on Lee\u2019s Pawn &amp; Jewelry when alarms went off, as he was a friend of the owner. According to the Associated Press, Dorn\u2019s last moments were caught on video and apparently posted on Facebook Live, though the video has since been taken down. His body was found on the sidewalk at about 2:30am. No arrests have yet been made. 77 year old Dorn had served 38 years on the St. Louis police force before retiring in October 2007. The Ethical Society of Police, which represents black officers in St. Louis, said in a news release that Dorn was \u201cthe type of brother that would\u2019ve given his life to save them if he had to.\u201d They\u2019ve also just tweeted this message about Dorn. Former St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch knew Dorn for 30 years, and he said: \u201cHe was very dedicated to youth, especially disadvantaged youth. He wanted to see them succeed. He wanted to be a role model for those young men and women to go into law enforcement. \u201cHe was a fun guy, a happy guy. You never had to wonder what he was thinking when somebody did something incredibly stupid like a crime because he would just say it as he saw it.\u201d Eric Trump is up and tweeting as well - and he\u2019s just retweeted a string of angry tweets from his father last night, where the president confirmed that this year\u2019s Republican National Convention will not now be taking place in North Carolina. Donald Trump says it is because the Democrat state governor Roy Cooper won\u2019t guarantee that all coronavirus restrictions will be lifted in the state in time for the event. Trump had been threatening to move the location of the event for some time. In a rare statement of condemnation of the actions of officers in a fellow democracy, British police leaders have said they are \u201cappalled and horrified\u201d by the killing of George Floyd. The statement is from Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, Mike Cunningham, Chief Executive of the College of Policing and Paul Griffiths, President of the Police Superintendents\u2019 Association. It says: \u201cWe stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and horrified by the way George Floyd lost his life. Justice and accountability should follow. \u201cWe are also appalled to see the violence and damage that has happened in so many US cities since then. Our hearts go out to all those affected by these terrible events and hope that peace and order will soon be restored. \u201cIn the UK we have a long established tradition of policing by consent, working in communities to prevent crime and solve problems. Officers are trained to use force proportionately, lawfully and only when absolutely necessary. We strive to continuously learn and improve. We will tackle bias, racism or discrimination wherever we find it. \u201cPolicing is complex and challenging and sometimes we fall short. When we do, we are not afraid to shine a light on injustices or to be held to account.\u201d The statement urges those in the UK who want to protest to obey lockdown rules restricting how many people can gather together. My colleague Matthew Teague has been in Fairhope, Alabama, speaking to evangelical Christians about that controversial Donald Trump photo with the bible from earlier in the week. \u201cIt was the coolest thing he could do. What more could he do, wear blue jeans and ride in on a horse?\u201d said one of them, interpreting it with the symbolism of the Israelites walking seven times around Jericho, whose walls then came crashing down. You can read Matthew\u2019s full report here: Turkey\u2019s state-run news agency has reported that at least 29 demonstrators were detained in Istanbul who had gathered to denounce police violence and to stand in solidarity with protesters in the United States. Anadolu Agency said riot police broke up the demonstration late Tuesday after the group of about 50 activists ignored calls to disperse. Reports says that they were carrying images of George Floyd - and photos from the event show the pictures of him left behind on the ground in the Turkish capital. One political development overnight that you might have missed with all the attention on street protests, is that controversial Iowa Republican congressman Steve King lost his re-election race to the state senator Randy Feenstra. The nine-term conservative congressman, who was repeatedly reprimanded by leaders in his own party for racist rhetoric and interactions with white nationalists faced four Republican primary challengers - and lost. You can read more about it here: The president is up and tweeting, and attacking \u201cpoorly run &amp; managed\u201d states in comparison to Texas, which he is praising while also touting the southern border wall which he says is going up \u201cfast\u201d. There\u2019s some interesting sports stories related to the protests and police violence floating around already today. Real Salt Lake defender Nedum Onuoha has come out to say that he never goes out and feels 100% safe while in the US. \u201cIn the UK I\u2019m more comfortable because if something happens it probably will not be deadly. But over here because of their rights it\u2019s more common that altercations become deadly,\u201d the 33-year-old added. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable but when it comes to any kind of brutality, if it\u2019s from the police, if they read me the wrong way then my life could be taken. I feel that every single day.\u201d Winnipeg Jets captain Blake Wheeler, meanwhile, has added further to his words on the situation, telling reporters: \u201cWe have to be as involved in this as black athletes. It can\u2019t just be their fight. I wish that I was more involved sooner than I was. I wish that it didn\u2019t take me this long to get behind it in a meaningful way. I want to be part of the change going forward.\u201d And there\u2019s a worrying development with Oklahoma State linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga announcing on social media that he has tested positive for Covid-19 after attending a protest in Tulsa. There are concerns that the widespread protests in the US and elsewhere will reverse attempts to get the coronavirus under control. Meanwhile back in the US, the US Park Police (USPP) has defended its forceful clearing of protesters for a controversial Trump photo-op on Monday. In a statement, the agency accused \u201cviolent protestors\u201d of \u201cthrowing projectiles including bricks, frozen water bottles and caustic liquids\u201d. It denied that tear gas was used and said officers instead \u201cemployed the use of smoke canisters and pepper balls\u201d. As my colleague Oliver Holt pointed out in our earlier live blog, that statement does not tally with multiple reports on the ground that day. This nearly-two hour video from Reuters shows a peaceful protest pushed back. An investigative reporter in DC, Nathan Baca, also picked up a canister at the scene that does appear to cause irritation. There\u2019s no doubting the international impact of the protests over George Floyd\u2019s killing. Last night a new mural by street artist Akse was unveiled in the Northern Quarter of England\u2019s Manchester. Local council buildings in the area were also lit up in purple in Floyd\u2019s memory. Several US news organisations are reporting that Tuesday night\u2019s protests have been the calmest in days. Clearly that is not the case in Portland and Seattle, where police have been dispersing people with force, but it may point towards a nationwide drop in confrontations. The New York Times reported that while protesters defied curfews, the violence has ebbed. Crowds in Washington DC, it said, \u201cremained peaceful in a mood that appeared to be taking hold in other cities, too. When a few demonstrators began to rock the fence, they were quickly stopped. \u2018Use your words,\u2019 two women yelled. \u2018Don\u2019t do that.\u2019\u201d The Washington Post has also reported an easing of tensions, while the Associated Press said the nation\u2019s streets were the \u201ccalmest in days\u201d. It is unclear if this is due to the protesters themselves or more due to a change in law enforcement strategies. There have certainly been some striking photos of uniformed officers \u201ctaking the knee\u201d at demonstrations coming in from around the country. Pope Francis isn\u2019t the only foreign voice speaking about the protests and violence in the US today. If you missed it from our earlier live blog, my colleague Philip Oltermann in Germany reported that Germany\u2019s foreign minister has criticised Donald Trump\u2019s threat to use the US military against protesters in his own country, saying \u201cdemocrats must never escalate \u2013 even with their words\u201d. \u201cInstead of pouring oil into the fire, we should seek reconciliation\u201d, Heiko Maas told Der Spiegel news website. \u201cInstead of allowing ourselves to be divided, we should stand shoulder to shoulder against radical extremists.\u201d Earlier in the week, the Social Democrat politician had described the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police as \u201ccruel and shocking\u201d. Associated Press reports that in the Vatican, Pope Francis has addressed the killing of George Floyd, saying he has \u201cwitnessed with great concern the disturbing social unrest\u201d in the United States, and calling for national reconciliation. \u201cMy friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,\u201d he said during his weekly Wednesday audience, which was being held in the presence of bishops alone due to the coronavirus restrictions on gatherings. At the same time, the pontiff warned \u201cnothing is gained by violence and so much is lost.\u201d The pope said he was praying \u201cfor the repose of George Floyd and all those who have lost their lives as a result of the sin of racism\u201d and issued his condolences for all those who grieve their loss. Last night was the first public appearance in Minneapolis from the people most closely affected by the death of George Floyd: his immediate family. \u201cI wanted everybody to know that this is what those officers took from \u2026\u201d George Floyd\u2019s widow Roxie Washington struggled to find the words while holding back sobs last night. As her daughter Gianna looked up at her, she said: \u201cAt the end of the day, they get to go home and be with their families. Gianna does not have a father. He will never see her grow up, graduate. He will never walk her down the aisle.\u201d Protests continued across the country \u2013 and around the world. Here are the key points: Tens of thousands attended a memorial for George Floyd in his home town of Houston. Members of Floyd\u2019s family were in attendance, alongside the mayor, the police chief and a group of protesters on horseback, with attendees paying respects to a \u201cgentle giant\u201d Although details of each incident are still unclear, the death toll from the protests in the US has reached at least 11. Protests in Washington were responded to more peacefully than in recent days, however, the capital remains on high alert, with about 1,600 US soldiers moved to the DC region, according to the Pentagon. Derrick Johnson, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), has written for the Guardian saying: \u201cThe expendability of Black lives is not a flaw in the system; it is the system. We are meant to die or, at the very least, we are not meant to be protected, to be respected, to be valued, to be considered fully human. The NFL has been accused of hypocrisy with its public anti-racism statements after the high profile treatment of Colin Kaepernick\u2019s protests. Inspired by the US demonstrations, 20,000 people defy a ban to rally in the streets of French capital Paris, with a focus on justice for Adama Traore, whose death four years ago has been a rallying cause against police brutality in France.

We are on the cusp of <a href=\"https://www.who.int/features/factfiles/polio/en/\">eradicating polio</a> \u2013 an achievable goal that will not only fulfil a moral obligation to the world\u2019s most vulnerable, but reap cumulative <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/two-out-of-three-wild-poliovirus-strains-eradicated\">savings of $14b</a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/two-out-of-three-wild-poliovirus-strains-eradicated\">n</a> by 2050 if we finish the job.

      "bodyText": "Google any list of the most successful public health interventions of this century or the last, and vaccines will be at the very top. Infectious diseases such as smallpox, measles, diphtheria and pertussis (whooping cough) were once prevalent and killed indiscriminately. Smallpox is now eradicated, polio is on its way out, and measles, diphtheria, pertussis and a wide range of other preventable diseases have been decimated in places where proven vaccines are both affordable and accessible. Enter Covid-19, which has skyrocketed vaccines to the top of the global agenda. Right now, we don\u2019t know how to beat this \u201cnovel\u201d virus that is cutting its swath through human populations for the first time in history. What we do know is that our best chance lies with the discovery of a vaccine. Every day brings a sliver of news \u2013 about a vaccine candidate that shows some promise in animal testing or one that could advance to human trials \u2013 and the world waits with bated breath in urgent hope that scientists and researchers will make the breakthrough that can save all of us from this disease that is devastating our communities and economies.

      "bodyText": "Good evening, here are the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Elias Visontay and it\u2019s Thursday 4 June. Morrison government unveils $25,000 homebuilder stimulus The Australian government will fund grants worth $25,000 for eligible singles and couples planning to build or renovate homes between June and the end of December, with the uncapped program estimated to cost taxpayers $688m. To be eligible for the grants, singles need to earn $125,000 a year or less based on a 2018-19 tax return or later, and couples need to earn under $200,000. Building contracts need to be executed between 4 June and 31 December 2020. While announcing the scheme in Googong, located in the electorate of Eden-Monaro that is preparing for a byelection, Scott Morrison was interrupted by a homeowner shouting at media to get off his lawn. Universities to close campuses and shed thousands of jobs Several regional Australian universities are planning to shut campuses while others are set to announce hundreds of job losses in coming weeks to deal with the sharp falls in revenue due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Without access to jobkeeper \u2013 the sector has been specifically excluded by the Morrison government \u2013 universities are frantically working on strategies to deal with up to $16bn in revenue shortfalls from the loss of international student fees. Most expect the situation will continue to get worse into 2021. Experts say the number of job losses over the 38 universities could reach into the tens of thousands and would affect administrative staff to professors. New Zealand says it will eliminate coronavirus by 15 June New Zealand finally has a date for when it will achieve its lofty goal of elimination of Covid-19: 15 June. New Zealand has followed an elimination policy path since the arrival of the virus, eschewing lighter approaches by countries including Australia. On Thursday, health officials announced they had found no new cases of the virus for the 13th straight day, from thousands of tests. Just one person in New Zealand has Covid-19, an Aucklander currently isolating who is due to be asymptomatic this week, should the virus follow a normal course. The news comes as Canberra airport opened a register of interest for direct flights to Wellington as a trial of the New Zealand travel bubble, to leave as early as 1 July. Qantas and Jetstar to scale up flights in June and July Qantas has announced the airline and its low-cost carrier Jetstar will scale up flights on domestic and regional routes in June and July. Capacity will increase to 15% of pre-coronavirus levels, or more than 300 return flights a week by the end of June, the airline says. It could return to 40% of its pre-pandemic capacity by the end of July providing state borders reopen. Australia\u2019s flag carrier is currently operating domestic capacity at just 5% of pre-coronavirus levels following government restrictions on travel and has stood down two-thirds of its 30,000-member workforce until the end of June. Few new cases across states No community-derived Covid-19 cases in New South Wales have been uncovered for an eighth straight day, as two returning travellers increased the state\u2019s total. However in Victoria, authorities are concerned a second wave of the pandemic could sweep the state with protesters set to ignore Covid-19 rules and new cases still being identified. Eight new cases were announced on Thursday. In Western Australia, tourist hotspots in the state\u2019s north are ready to welcome back visitors after authorities agreed to lift coronavirus-related biosecurity restrictions. Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and the ACT recorded no new cases on Thursday. Covid commission chief distances himself from leaked report on gas expansion The former Fortescue Metals chief running Scott Morrison\u2019s Covid-19 coordination commission, Nev Power, has distanced himself from a controversial leaked report recommending Australian taxpayers underwrite a massive expansion of the domestic gas industry. Appearing on Thursday before a Senate committee, Power said the report, revealed by Guardian Australia late last month, should not be considered the view of the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission. He intimated the report was a draft from the manufacturing taskforce that had been superseded by later advice.

      "body": "<p>\u201cThis year we have to drink all the beer,\u201d Joshua Kimmich says, his tone deadpan as he ponders how weird it would be for Bayern Munich not to have their traditional beer-throwing celebration in front of their supporters if they win the Bundesliga this season. \u201cI cannot imagine it now. I just know that it is strange if you win a game at the Allianz Arena and cannot celebrate with your fans. But we don\u2019t have the choice now.\u201d</p> <p>Bayern\u2019s outstanding midfielder can be forgiven for his confidence. The German champions were motoring before the coronavirus pandemic brought football to a halt in March and they have effortlessly picked up the pace since the Bundesliga season resumed last month, gliding seven points clear of Borussia Dortmund at the top of the table since returning to action.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/03/joshua-kimmich-wants-white-players-to-join-black-teammates-protests\">Joshua Kimmich wants white players to join black teammates' protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Kimmich suggests that Bayern are not quite up to full speed, the numbers suggest otherwise: four successive victories, 13 goals scored, only two conceded. Hansi Flick\u2019s side are closing in on an eighth consecutive title and could still emulate the treble-winning class of 2013. Kimmich has been pivotal to their awesome form, knitting everything together in midfield and surprising even himself when he scored a lovely chip in the crucial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/26/borussia-dortmund-bayern-munich-bundesliga-der-klassiker-report\" title=\"\">1-0 away win against Dortmund</a> last week.</p> <p>Yet it was a disorienting occasion when the two biggest sides in Germany met at the Signal Iduna Park, with the match behind closed doors and the Yellow Wall empty. Germany has been the first major league to allow football to return but it feels surreal without supporters present.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"449b72330c675f44ead1d64001cdd4427d09a6c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/449b72330c675f44ead1d64001cdd4427d09a6c8/0_0_3631_2285/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The enormous \u2018Yellow Wall\u2019 stand was empty as Bayern took on Dortmund at Signal Iduna Park last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"629\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The enormous \u2018Yellow Wall\u2019 stand was empty as Bayern took on Dortmund at Signal Iduna Park last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandre Sim\u00f5es/Borussia Dortmund/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNormally you have more adrenaline and tension when you see 80,000 fans, screaming after every corner or chance,\u201d Kimmich says. \u201cYou have to push yourself and your teammates. Normally when there are fans you are focused just because of that. You feel mistakes more. Also you feel more if you score a goal. It\u2019s more emotional when there are fans.\u201d</p> <p>The Germany international thinks it is harder for home teams \u2013 there have been 18 away wins in 36 games since the Bundesliga returned \u2013 and players have had to adjust to follow physical distancing measures. \u201cWe are in the hotel with face masks,\u201d Kimmich says. \u201cOn the bus when we drive to the game, when we sit together in the hotel and restaurants, everyone sits alone. It\u2019s really different. In the locker room, we have two-metre distance, or more than one metre.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u00a0play\u00a0football\u00a0to have fun, and we have fun as a team. It is not just about winning 1-0</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Premier League is due to resume this month and it has been noticeable that players in Germany are sustaining more muscle injuries, though Kimmich is unsure if the lay\u2011off has changed the pattern during games. \u201cIt was OK for us because it was like a third pre\u2011season. We worked a lot, first at home with the cyber-training and after in smaller groups, then with the whole team. Now we have the benefit. </p> <p>\u201cThe physical factor is really important for us. I don\u2019t know the difference between the normal games and these matches, if we run more or less, or it\u2019s more intensive or less. We haven\u2019t had muscle injuries yet, but I think it could be a problem when the new season starts because we won\u2019t get a long holiday.\u201d</p> <p>Kimmich, who feels football\u2019s return has lifted morale in Germany, was not worried before the big restart. \u201cThere was a health protocol. We knew at first that social life was resuming and then it was possible to play football again. We had the green light from the government. We are tested every three or four days and every day before the games. It is really safe.</p> <p>\u201cWe are the role model for other countries. Not everybody thinks that it\u2019s good football is back. But the system is good. We have to be distanced from each other, we have to wear masks, we have to take showers at home and not at the training camp.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"826d77969c8dcd818b005ad0770f6f5222a2d559\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/826d77969c8dcd818b005ad0770f6f5222a2d559/0_51_2109_1265/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joshua Kimmich takes a throw-in as his manager, Hansi Flick, looks on.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joshua Kimmich takes a throw-in as his manager, Hansi Flick, looks on.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kimmich is asked what Premier League players should expect without fans. \u201cYou can speak with each other. You can hear what the coach is screaming on the touchline. It is really different when you walk on the pitch. It is like a friendly, or the under-17s. You\u2019re just on the pitch and you start. </p> <p>\u201cNormally I enjoy it when you walk out and see the atmosphere. This is maybe what I miss the most but the positive thing is you can speak to everybody and the focus is more on the game. There is no big show from the players any more \u2013 lying on the ground and screaming.</p> <p>\u201cI can feel that I am less emotional when I speak to the referee. Maybe I am not that \u2018pushed\u2019 from the fans. When they are screaming you are more emotional and maybe you speak in another way with the referee. Now you can be more calm and speak in a normal way. You don\u2019t have to shout at him and he doesn\u2019t have to shout back.\u201d</p> <p>Kimmich rarely looks ruffled on the pitch. The 25-year-old burst on to the scene at right-back but was a midfielder in his youth.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThis year we have to drink all the beer,\u201d Joshua Kimmich says, his tone deadpan as he ponders how weird it would be for Bayern Munich not to have their traditional beer-throwing celebration in front of their supporters if they win the Bundesliga this season. \u201cI cannot imagine it now. I just know that it is strange if you win a game at the Allianz Arena and cannot celebrate with your fans. But we don\u2019t have the choice now.\u201d Bayern\u2019s outstanding midfielder can be forgiven for his confidence. The German champions were motoring before the coronavirus pandemic brought football to a halt in March and they have effortlessly picked up the pace since the Bundesliga season resumed last month, gliding seven points clear of Borussia Dortmund at the top of the table since returning to action. While Kimmich suggests that Bayern are not quite up to full speed, the numbers suggest otherwise: four successive victories, 13 goals scored, only two conceded. Hansi Flick\u2019s side are closing in on an eighth consecutive title and could still emulate the treble-winning class of 2013. Kimmich has been pivotal to their awesome form, knitting everything together in midfield and surprising even himself when he scored a lovely chip in the crucial 1-0 away win against Dortmund last week. Yet it was a disorienting occasion when the two biggest sides in Germany met at the Signal Iduna Park, with the match behind closed doors and the Yellow Wall empty. Germany has been the first major league to allow football to return but it feels surreal without supporters present. \u201cNormally you have more adrenaline and tension when you see 80,000 fans, screaming after every corner or chance,\u201d Kimmich says. \u201cYou have to push yourself and your teammates. Normally when there are fans you are focused just because of that. You feel mistakes more. Also you feel more if you score a goal. It\u2019s more emotional when there are fans.\u201d The Germany international thinks it is harder for home teams \u2013 there have been 18 away wins in 36 games since the Bundesliga returned \u2013 and players have had to adjust to follow physical distancing measures. \u201cWe are in the hotel with face masks,\u201d Kimmich says. \u201cOn the bus when we drive to the game, when we sit together in the hotel and restaurants, everyone sits alone. It\u2019s really different. In the locker room, we have two-metre distance, or more than one metre.\u201d The Premier League is due to resume this month and it has been noticeable that players in Germany are sustaining more muscle injuries, though Kimmich is unsure if the lay\u2011off has changed the pattern during games. \u201cIt was OK for us because it was like a third pre\u2011season. We worked a lot, first at home with the cyber-training and after in smaller groups, then with the whole team. Now we have the benefit. \u201cThe physical factor is really important for us. I don\u2019t know the difference between the normal games and these matches, if we run more or less, or it\u2019s more intensive or less. We haven\u2019t had muscle injuries yet, but I think it could be a problem when the new season starts because we won\u2019t get a long holiday.\u201d Kimmich, who feels football\u2019s return has lifted morale in Germany, was not worried before the big restart. \u201cThere was a health protocol. We knew at first that social life was resuming and then it was possible to play football again. We had the green light from the government. We are tested every three or four days and every day before the games. It is really safe. \u201cWe are the role model for other countries. Not everybody thinks that it\u2019s good football is back. But the system is good. We have to be distanced from each other, we have to wear masks, we have to take showers at home and not at the training camp.\u201d Kimmich is asked what Premier League players should expect without fans. \u201cYou can speak with each other. You can hear what the coach is screaming on the touchline. It is really different when you walk on the pitch. It is like a friendly, or the under-17s. You\u2019re just on the pitch and you start. \u201cNormally I enjoy it when you walk out and see the atmosphere. This is maybe what I miss the most but the positive thing is you can speak to everybody and the focus is more on the game. There is no big show from the players any more \u2013 lying on the ground and screaming. \u201cI can feel that I am less emotional when I speak to the referee. Maybe I am not that \u2018pushed\u2019 from the fans. When they are screaming you are more emotional and maybe you speak in another way with the referee. Now you can be more calm and speak in a normal way. You don\u2019t have to shout at him and he doesn\u2019t have to shout back.\u201d Kimmich rarely looks ruffled on the pitch. The 25-year-old burst on to the scene at right-back but was a midfielder in his youth. He has flourished in that position under Flick, who has revived Bayern since replacing Niko Kovac last November. \u201cThe coach gives us a good feeling, we press high,\u201d Kimmich says. \u201cWe want to have good possession and most of all it is fun. You play football to have fun and you can see this on the pitch \u2013 we have fun as a team. With our style of playing, it is not just about winning 1-0.\u201d Kimmich\u2019s partnership with Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara sets the tone and he displayed his confidence when he caught Dortmund\u2019s goalkeeper, Roman B\u00fcrki, off his line with that clever chip. \u201cIt was not planned and I have never scored a goal like this before. I thought about it. We did a lot of shooting in training, where we worked in smaller groups. The angle is easier for the goalkeeper when he goes out, so in training I saw that maybe this was possible to try in the game. I tried it and \u2026 yeah!\u201d There are bound to be more celebrations at Bayern, who visit Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday. They have a German Cup semi-final against Eintracht Frankfurt next week and will expect to reach the Champions League quarter-finals at Chelsea\u2019s expense if the competition resumes in August. Bayern thumped Frank Lampard\u2019s side 3-0 at Stamford Bridge in the first leg of their last-16 tie in February. That was an ominous show of intent from a club seeking their first European crown in seven years, though Kimmich errs on the side of caution after being asked if anyone can match Bayern at the moment. \u201cThere is no football in Europe,\u201d he says, deadpan again. \u201cBut I feel we are the best team in Germany. We have two tough games in the league. If we win them, I am sure we will be the Bundesliga champions.\u201d",

It was taken by a friend of mine in May 1989 from the roof of Beijing\u2019s Museum of Chinese History. He allowed me to share it as long as his identity was concealed, knowing that in China, this visual testament to a still taboo event could land him in jail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/the-us-needs-to-stand-up-for-hong-kong-to-deter-chinas-crackdowns\">The US needs to stand up for Hong Kong to deter China's crackdowns | Michael H Fuch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A year on from the 30th anniversary, as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s tyranny endangers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/china-proposes-controversial-national-security-law-for-hong-kong\">lives and freedoms</a> across the world, the photograph and the suppressed truth it embodies are even more significant.</p> <p>For 31 years, the CCP has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/04/china-tiananmen-square-beijing\">buried the truth</a> about Tiananmen. In 1989 it branded the nationwide peaceful pro-democracy movement a \u201ccounter-revolutionary riot\u201d, and on 4 June, sent tanks to clear the square, then crush and gun down unarmed citizens in the surrounding streets. It said the massacre was essential for China\u2019s future order and prosperity. It claimed only 241 people died, when unofficial estimates are many times higher. Then it outlawed any further mention of the event.</p> <p>The message to the Chinese people was: the mass movement never took place; those peaceful protesters were thugs. Only the party can restore order and make you rich. Keep quiet, forget the past. Forget democracy and freedom. For the sake of stability and economic growth, the state can murder civilians.</p> <p>But the underlying truth was simpler: dictators will always put their political survival above human life. They will not rest until they have perverted every truth and obliterated all possibility of dissent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"236f0cca1cfec627227352f7e52c0bd8e7083b5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/236f0cca1cfec627227352f7e52c0bd8e7083b5d/0_4_1263_758/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View of Tiananmen Square during the student protest of 1989. \u2018It was taken by a friend of mine in May 1989 from the roof of Beijing\u2019s Museum of Chinese History\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View of Tiananmen Square during the student protest of 1989. \u2018It was taken by a friend of mine in May 1989 from the roof of Beijing\u2019s Museum of Chinese History\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This photograph survives though, and stubbornly resists. It confirms that this moment in history did take place; it had a past and a future. Looking at it now, I am returned immediately to one of those tents: a young hunger striker lying asleep on a blanket beside me, clutching a pale blue notebook in her hand; students who\u2019d just arrived from a provincial city sitting crammed in a neighbouring shelter, gobbling steamed dumplings donated by a Beijing stallholder; outside, cries for freedom and democracy and the sirens of volunteer ambulances rushing hunger strikers to hospital for treatment.</p> <p>This moment, caught in freeze frame, contains life, hope, colour, movement. But it also contains death. Unknown to all of us who were in the square at the time, in the Great Hall of the People that loomed silently behind us, soldiers of the People\u2019s Liberation Army were hiding with bayonets, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/01/tiananmen-square-25-years-every-person-victim-massacre\">waiting for the order to strike</a>.</p> <p>Today, Tiananmen Square is a place of oblivion, a memory hole scrutinised by police cameras, suspended from history. China is an economic giant, but the lies and murder have never stopped. The party has continued to use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inciting_subversion_of_state_power\">\u201csubversion of state power\u201d</a> clauses in the law to deny citizens their constitutional right to freedom of speech and of demonstration.

      "bodyText": "To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre last year, I posted a photograph online of a night scene showing the mass hunger strike that took place there. It was taken by a friend of mine in May 1989 from the roof of Beijing\u2019s Museum of Chinese History. He allowed me to share it as long as his identity was concealed, knowing that in China, this visual testament to a still taboo event could land him in jail. A year on from the 30th anniversary, as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s tyranny endangers lives and freedoms across the world, the photograph and the suppressed truth it embodies are even more significant. For 31 years, the CCP has buried the truth about Tiananmen. In 1989 it branded the nationwide peaceful pro-democracy movement a \u201ccounter-revolutionary riot\u201d, and on 4 June, sent tanks to clear the square, then crush and gun down unarmed citizens in the surrounding streets. It said the massacre was essential for China\u2019s future order and prosperity. It claimed only 241 people died, when unofficial estimates are many times higher. Then it outlawed any further mention of the event. The message to the Chinese people was: the mass movement never took place; those peaceful protesters were thugs. Only the party can restore order and make you rich. Keep quiet, forget the past. Forget democracy and freedom. For the sake of stability and economic growth, the state can murder civilians. But the underlying truth was simpler: dictators will always put their political survival above human life. They will not rest until they have perverted every truth and obliterated all possibility of dissent. This photograph survives though, and stubbornly resists. It confirms that this moment in history did take place; it had a past and a future. Looking at it now, I am returned immediately to one of those tents: a young hunger striker lying asleep on a blanket beside me, clutching a pale blue notebook in her hand; students who\u2019d just arrived from a provincial city sitting crammed in a neighbouring shelter, gobbling steamed dumplings donated by a Beijing stallholder; outside, cries for freedom and democracy and the sirens of volunteer ambulances rushing hunger strikers to hospital for treatment. This moment, caught in freeze frame, contains life, hope, colour, movement. But it also contains death. Unknown to all of us who were in the square at the time, in the Great Hall of the People that loomed silently behind us, soldiers of the People\u2019s Liberation Army were hiding with bayonets, waiting for the order to strike. Today, Tiananmen Square is a place of oblivion, a memory hole scrutinised by police cameras, suspended from history. China is an economic giant, but the lies and murder have never stopped. The party has continued to use \u201csubversion of state power\u201d clauses in the law to deny citizens their constitutional right to freedom of speech and of demonstration. Dissidents have been silenced, killed or, like me, forced into exile. In Xinjiang province, for the sake of \u201cpublic security\u201d, an estimated 1.5 million Muslim Uighurs are being arbitrarily detained in secretive re-education camps, whose high boundary walls recall the Soviet gulags and Dachau. When the coronavirus broke out in Wuhan, Chinese authorities tried again to cover up the truth. The whistleblowing doctor, Li Wenliang, was accused of \u201csubverting the social order\u201d for warning his friends about the dangers of the new disease. Evidence was destroyed, the true death toll under-reported, and citizen journalists covering the outbreak were disappeared. If the Chinese government had been as open and transparent as it professed, how many of the current 388,000 deaths worldwide could have been avoided? It is striking that it is populist leaders who share Xi Jinping\u2019s disregard for the truth that have handled the pandemic the worst. Until now, the only place under Chinese rule where Tiananmen\u2019s victims could be mourned and its ideals celebrated was Hong Kong. But the CCP are now intent on stubbing out this last pocket of freedom. Following the approval of the new national security law, which bans \u201csubversion, terrorism and treason\u201d, the mass vigil in Victoria Park, the most vivid symbol of the territory\u2019s autonomy, has this year been banned for the first time. After my first novel was banned in China, Hong Kong became my refuge for 10 years. Today I am more concerned than I have ever been that the CCP will enact another Tiananmen on Hong Kong\u2019s streets. Whether it happens dramatically with armoured tanks, or more covertly, over years, as it has in Tibet and Xinjiang, Hong Kong\u2019s unique spirit and character will be assailed as the CCP attempts to draw it deeper into its net. All around the world, people are finding it hard to breathe as the virus that originally emerged in Wuhan spreads through the air, and the boots of demagogues everywhere stamp down on human necks. In China and Hong Kong, the only source of hope will be the stubborn refusal to forget, and the fierce clinging to the humane ideals of the peacerful protesters who filled Tiananmen Square in 1989. \u2022 Ma Jian was born in Qingdao, China.

Announcing measures to drag Europe\u2019s largest economy out of recession as lockdown measures are removed, Angela Merkel\u2019s government said it would use the package of sweeping temporary tax cuts and increase benefits to turbocharge its recovery. Measures included a cut in VAT until the end of this year and substantial payments for every child in the country designed to help ordinary German families, alongside the launch of a \u20ac50bn fund to tackle global heating and finance new technologies. A state financial incentive to buy an electric car has been doubled to \u20ac6,000. Against a backdrop of rising unemployment and with Germany already in a technical recession before Covid-19 struck, Merkel said a \u201cbold response\u201d was required to secure jobs and keep the economy running.

This could be a particular boost for bars, restaurants, hotels and other hospitality businesses. \u20ac10bn for municipalities struggling with lower tax receipts, with public spending on infrastructure and housing. Up until now, countries around the world had largely announced emergency financial support to cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus outbreak rather than jump-start a recovery. Germany\u2019s package of measures comes on top of a \u20ac750bn rescue package agreed in March. It included loan guarantees and direct spending measures such as furlough wage subsidies. Germany had typically taken a conservative approach to tax and spending policy in recent years, despite repeated calls to loosen the purse strings to boost the economy as growth faltered. Merkel\u2019s government came under pressure earlier this year to spend after overseeing a record \u20ac13.5bn budget surplus last year while the country\u2019s economy slowed. Berlin\u2019s latest plans, however, come as more countries lift lockdown controls and attempt to reboot their economies as the world slides into its deepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The British chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is understood to be drawing up plans for a summer financial statement to revitalise the UK economy, which is likely to focus on infrastructure spending and job creation schemes. Three former British chancellors told Sunak on Wednesday to prepare for 1980s levels of unemployment across the country as the coronavirus crash causes widespread job losses. Alistair Darling, Labour\u2019s chancellor during the 2008 financial crisis, said Sunak should also consider temporary VAT cuts similar to those used more than a decade ago during the financial crisis. The former chancellors also suggested more funding for green growth, job support and retraining for the newly unemployed would also be vital for Britain\u2019s recovery.",

It envisions millions of Palestinians living in demilitarised enclaves, mostly surrounded by Israel.</p> <p>Even so, some settlers have argued Israel should unilaterally annex territory without agreeing to any of the clauses in Trump\u2019s plan that they see as concessions to the Palestinians.</p> <p>Netanyahu, who met settler leaders this week to hear their grievances, has expressed irritation with Elhayani. \u201cPresident Trump is a great friend of Israel\u2019s. He has led historic moves for Israel\u2019s benefit,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cIt is regrettable that instead of showing gratitude, there are those who are denying his friendship.\u201d</p> <p>The speaker of Israel\u2019s parliament, Yariv Levin, a Netanyahu ally, said Elhayani\u2019s remarks were \u201crude and irresponsible\u201d.</p> <p>Under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/netanyahu-takes-office-in-deal-that-could-see-west-bank-annexation\">a unity government deal</a> signed with his former political rival Benny Gantz, Netanyahu has pushed to bring plans for annexation&nbsp;to the cabinet for discussion as soon as 1 July.</p> <p>Speaking in the Knesset before being sworn in last month, Netanyahu <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/netanyahu-takes-office-in-deal-that-could-see-west-bank-annexation\">said</a> the move would be \u201canother glorious chapter in the history of Zionism\u201d.</p> <p>However, much uncertainty remains around whether Netanyahu will move ahead swiftly, and whether he wants to take such a controversial and potentially explosive step so soon after retaking office.</p> <p>Israeli forces captured the West Bank from Jordanian forces in 1967, although Palestinians have limited self-rule over some parts. Today, Israel retains control over the West Bank areas it plans to annex, and settlers enjoy the same rights and most of the services as Israelis living in Israel \u2013 some argue Israel has de facto annexed the territory already.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the country is enjoying a period when many world powers, including some Arab states, are curtailing their public criticism following half a century of occupation.</p> <p>Netanyahu has long boasted that <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/netanyahu-israeli-ties-to-arab-world-stronger-without-the-palestinians-574509\">he sidelined</a> the Palestinians on the world stage, and annexation could threaten that. The Palestinian leadership, which pre-emptively rejected Trump\u2019s plan as biased, has recently launched a campaign to draw up international pressure.</p> <p>Anshel Pfeffer, a journalist for the Haaretz newspaper, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-on-annexation-netanyahu-and-the-settlers-have-never-been-on-the-same-page-1.8891365\">wrote</a> that Netanyahu might in fact welcome the settler disagreements as he could use it as a \u201csmokescreen\u201d to postpone the move.</p> <p>\u201cHe talks of July 1 as an \u2018unmissable\u2019 date but won\u2019t detail how he plans to extend Israeli sovereignty. There\u2019s no map. No draft legislation. No timetable,\u201d said Pfeffer, who wrote a biography on Netanyahu. \u201cUltimately, the difference between Netanyahu and the settlers\u2019 aims are that his is a personal-political project dedicated to perpetuating his hold on power.\u201d</p> <p>Questions have also been raised around whether Washington backs unilateral moves. While the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has said annexation is ultimately \u201can Israeli decision\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-talks-annexation-with-kushner-us-said-to-want-to-slow-the-process/\">local media</a> have reported that US officials want to slow the process while it deals with domestic protests and the coronavirus pandemic.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Benjamin Netanyahu is facing outspoken resistance to his proposal to annex parts of the occupied Palestinian territories from some of the people the move was advertised as benefiting \u2013 Israeli settlers. The prime minister has pledged to formally extend Israel\u2019s territory over 30% of the occupied West Bank, including all Jewish settlements, as soon as next month, implementing part of Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East \u201cvision for peace\u201d. Despite the US plan being widely seen as a gift to Israel\u2019s far right and lauded by Netanyahu as a \u201chistoric opportunity\u201d for Israel to take the land permanently, settler leaders are fearful of clauses within it that suggest the potential for a Palestinian state. David Elhayani, the chair of the Yesha Council, an umbrella group representing Jewish settlers, has twice said this week that Trump is no friend of Israel. \u201cUltimately, he presented a plan that endangers the existence of the state of Israel and, in that case, you\u2019re no friend of mine,\u201d Elhayani told Army Radio on Thursday. Trump\u2019s plan offers the potential for Palestinian self-rule, but only after strict conditions are met. It envisions millions of Palestinians living in demilitarised enclaves, mostly surrounded by Israel. Even so, some settlers have argued Israel should unilaterally annex territory without agreeing to any of the clauses in Trump\u2019s plan that they see as concessions to the Palestinians. Netanyahu, who met settler leaders this week to hear their grievances, has expressed irritation with Elhayani. \u201cPresident Trump is a great friend of Israel\u2019s. He has led historic moves for Israel\u2019s benefit,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cIt is regrettable that instead of showing gratitude, there are those who are denying his friendship.\u201d The speaker of Israel\u2019s parliament, Yariv Levin, a Netanyahu ally, said Elhayani\u2019s remarks were \u201crude and irresponsible\u201d. Under a unity government deal signed with his former political rival Benny Gantz, Netanyahu has pushed to bring plans for annexation to the cabinet for discussion as soon as 1 July. Speaking in the Knesset before being sworn in last month, Netanyahu said the move would be \u201canother glorious chapter in the history of Zionism\u201d. However, much uncertainty remains around whether Netanyahu will move ahead swiftly, and whether he wants to take such a controversial and potentially explosive step so soon after retaking office. Israeli forces captured the West Bank from Jordanian forces in 1967, although Palestinians have limited self-rule over some parts. Today, Israel retains control over the West Bank areas it plans to annex, and settlers enjoy the same rights and most of the services as Israelis living in Israel \u2013 some argue Israel has de facto annexed the territory already. Meanwhile, the country is enjoying a period when many world powers, including some Arab states, are curtailing their public criticism following half a century of occupation. Netanyahu has long boasted that he sidelined the Palestinians on the world stage, and annexation could threaten that. The Palestinian leadership, which pre-emptively rejected Trump\u2019s plan as biased, has recently launched a campaign to draw up international pressure. Anshel Pfeffer, a journalist for the Haaretz newspaper, wrote that Netanyahu might in fact welcome the settler disagreements as he could use it as a \u201csmokescreen\u201d to postpone the move. \u201cHe talks of July 1 as an \u2018unmissable\u2019 date but won\u2019t detail how he plans to extend Israeli sovereignty. There\u2019s no map. No draft legislation. No timetable,\u201d said Pfeffer, who wrote a biography on Netanyahu. \u201cUltimately, the difference between Netanyahu and the settlers\u2019 aims are that his is a personal-political project dedicated to perpetuating his hold on power.\u201d Questions have also been raised around whether Washington backs unilateral moves. While the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has said annexation is ultimately \u201can Israeli decision\u201d, local media have reported that US officials want to slow the process while it deals with domestic protests and the coronavirus pandemic.",

      "bodyText": "A union representing hundreds of clerks, security guards and kitchen staff in parliament is threatening strike action following chaotic scenes on the parliamentary estate as MPs queued to vote on Tuesday. Officials from the PCS union have told parliamentary authorities that they could recommend balloting their members following the failure of MPs to distance themselves from staff as some waited for more than an hour to cast their votes. The union is especially concerned because more than a third of their members in parliament are BAME. People from ethnic minorities are at a higher risk of dying from coronavirus according to Public Health England. The development came as ministers come under increasing pressure to ditch its return to a physical parliament after weeks of allowing MPs to attend remotely via video link. Critics rubbished the government\u2019s current arrangements on Wednesday night after the business secretary, Alok Sharma, confirmed he was being tested for Covid-19 after appearing to be unwell while delivering a speech to the Commons. Government sources confirmed that the house authorities are looking at alternative methods of allowing MPs to vote that could speed up the voting process. Chaotic scenes unfolded in the Commons on Tuesday when MPs formed a long queue snaking through parliament so they could maintain physical distancing while voting on the motion. Union officials said it resulted in a series of complaints from members. One member complained about a lack of physical distancing at and around the underground entrance to the Commons, where MPs were photographed by colleagues standing less than a metre away from each other. \u201cIt was a breeding ground for infection. Supermarkets have better Covid management in place,\u201d the source said. A security source said that the risk assessment shown to some staff showed that the parliamentary authorities do not have a method of controlling the number of people on the estate. \u201cThe risk assessment is only there to facilitate a poor decision by the government,\u201d the source said. PCS officials wrote to the parliamentary authorities saying that a failure to comply with five tests, could result in industrial action. The five tests include a promise to track and trace those in contact with an infected person, regular Covid-19 tests for staff, and a pledge to carry out a Covid-19 risk assessment including an equality assessment to examine the impact on BAME workers. Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of PCS, which claims to have around 800 members across the Palace of Westminster, said: \u201cThe decision to scrap the hybrid parliament has been a disaster. \u201cWe will support our members wholeheartedly if they decide to take action and the blame will squarely lie with [the leader of the Commons] Jacob Rees-Mogg.\u201d Sharma\u2019s potential case of Covid-19 in the chamber came a day after MPs approved the government\u2019s plan to end virtual voting in the Commons. MPs are due to debate a motion laid by Rees-Mogg on Thursday to allow those who are shielding and those aged over 70 to vote by proxy. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said it would be premature to suggest Sharma had the virus. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Lewis said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be premature because Alok, who I wish well and hope he recovers quickly, may well have had severe hay fever, we\u2019re not sure yet.\u201d Government sources said MPs could abandon the system of filing through the chamber to cast their votes, which led to long queues. According to the BBC\u2019s Newsnight, one option being examined would be to let MPs swipe their security cards on a reader in the division lobbies, where they traditionally assemble. A House of Commons spokesperson said: \u201cOur priority is to ensure that those on the estate are safe while parliamentary business is\u202ffacilitated. We are taking every step possible to limit the number of staff who have to physically return to the\u202fbuilding and are meeting regularly with representatives of the trade unions.\u201d",

Yes, the Roosters are the reigning premiers. But few could have foreseen a result of this magnitude. The Roosters were dominant from go to whoa, passing with fluency and monstering the Broncos with their attacking muscle. Ten tries to nothing tells part of the story, but there isn\u2019t a chapter that speaks well of the Broncos. Sixty-four percent possession to the visitors and 39 completed sets to 20 are other takeouts that highlight the Roosters\u2019 supremacy.</p> <p>Just one spot on the ladder separated these teams before the game but now one team is heading north and the other south. This was the Broncos\u2019 biggest defeat, the first time they\u2019ve been held scoreless at Suncorp Stadium and, just for good measure, the first time in NRL history we\u2019ve seen a 59-0 scoreline. It was just one of those nights. And to think The Chooks did all this without the game\u2019s best player, James Tedesco. Scary.</p> <p>Thanks for your company. Let\u2019s do it all again tomorrow when the Storm host the Rabbitohs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22a1db51b9cf32173da45714f2030c093a98b7ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22a1db51b9cf32173da45714f2030c093a98b7ea/0_179_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brisbane Broncos v Sydney Roosters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sydney Roosters celebrate yet another try in their record-breaking win over Brisbane Broncos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren England/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed8df648f0893539f4cff69\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T11:51:20.646Z\">12.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FT: Brisbane Broncos 0-59 Sydney Roosters</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Broncos can\u2019t get a late try and nor did they deserve to.

They\u2019ll have to do it without fullback James Tedesco, who awoke this morning with an elevated temperature. In these times of the coronavirus, that\u2019s enough to rule you out. </p> <p>Speaking of Covid-19 and sport, let\u2019s remove hats once again in honour of the NRL and the man now running the game, Peter V\u2019landys.

      "bodyText": "Yes, the Broncos were undermanned. Yes, the Roosters are the reigning premiers. But few could have foreseen a result of this magnitude. The Roosters were dominant from go to whoa, passing with fluency and monstering the Broncos with their attacking muscle. Ten tries to nothing tells part of the story, but there isn\u2019t a chapter that speaks well of the Broncos. Sixty-four percent possession to the visitors and 39 completed sets to 20 are other takeouts that highlight the Roosters\u2019 supremacy. Just one spot on the ladder separated these teams before the game but now one team is heading north and the other south. This was the Broncos\u2019 biggest defeat, the first time they\u2019ve been held scoreless at Suncorp Stadium and, just for good measure, the first time in NRL history we\u2019ve seen a 59-0 scoreline. It was just one of those nights. And to think The Chooks did all this without the game\u2019s best player, James Tedesco. Scary. Thanks for your company. Let\u2019s do it all again tomorrow when the Storm host the Rabbitohs. The Broncos can\u2019t get a late try and nor did they deserve to. This was a mismatch from start to finish, an annihilation. All credit to the Roosters, who were a class apart. A landslide in tri-colours. 78 mins: Pictures coming through of Radley and his strapped and iced elbow, not wrist. He\u2019s smiling, though, so that\u2019s something. The Broncos are close here and get a fresh set 20 metres out after a penalty. And now a Chooks knock-on gives the Broncos a chance to score in the final minute. But, no, this just isn\u2019t in the script. No dice, Brisbane. 74 mins: And now for something completely different ... a Sydney Roosters try! The Chooks are passing at will, almost unchallenged, and Keary does as he pleases, links with Josh Morris before Brett Morris adds his name to the scorer\u2019s list. Shelling peas would be harder than this. And now Flanagan converts from an acute angle. This is all shades of wrong for Brisbane. The Roosters can do no wrong. 74 mins: Radley\u2019s in a bit of trouble here, clutching at his right wrist after becoming entangled in a tackle with Milford. Brisbane then go on a rare attacking run which is derailed by a knock-on, which is duly challenged by the captain. Which is duly overruled. As you were. 70 mins: The pressure continues to mount and though Boyd gathers, Crichton carries him in goal to hand possession back to the Roosters. From the restart it\u2019s more of the same, passes linking as if attached by a chain before Tupou charges over at the left corner and runs inside to make Flanagan\u2019s conversion a simple one. The 50 is up. Raise your bats, Chookmen. Just take a look at that scoreline. Incredible. 68 mins: The Broncos complete a set but far from convincingly, and - ho-hum - Tupou collects the kick to spark another attacking move, which is helped by a ruck infringement that resets the tackle count. Nothing comes from it but even if the scores remain as they are, the Broncos are staring down the barrel of their biggest defeat. 63 mins: And the Roosters advance again, this time Crichton charging from dummy half and using sheer force of will, plus some momentum, to edge his way over the line. That\u2019s now nine tries for the Chooks. The Broncos have never been held scoreless at Suncorp. They\u2019re about to be, methinks. 61 mins: No Try! The Roosters are celebrating yet another try but replays indicate a faint knock-on after a Keary high-ball. 58 mins: Another forward thrust down the left is initially contained by the Broncos but Keary has enough time to switch direction, waltz into the middle and offload to Collins who scores just his second career try. Yes, the Chooks are now sharing it around. Take a ticket, lads. 53 mins: A ruck infringement resets the tackle count 10 metres out for Sydney but a rare communication error then turns the ball over and back in Brisbane hands. But normal service is soon resumed. Friend produces a deft little kick but the ball comes back after a penalty. And now another infringement resets the tackle count yet again. And again! But this time Arthars is sent to the sin-bin. How many times can you infringe, how many times can you concede penalties? Enough! 50 mins: Keary dribbles in a nice kick but Isaako handles with care to defuse the threat. Brett Morris was bearing down hard and emerges from the tackle with blood pouring out of his mouth. Not sure he knows or cares about that. 47 mins: ANOTHER handling error from Brisbane, this time 10 metres out from the Sydney line, releases the pressure for the Roosters and hands them back the ball. We head to the other end of the ground at speed but a forward pass lets Brisbane off the hook. 44 mins: A barging, bullocking, irresistible run from Liu after a fast play-the-ball opens up the Broncos like a can of baked beans. The big man palms off to Keary, who turns on the gas to score the Chooks\u2019 sixth try. This is all coming a little too easy for the Roosters. Poor tackling from a Broncos outfit bereft of confidence, energy and ideas. 41 mins: And we\u2019re back. My eldest son, en route to his bedroom for a well-earned kip, glanced at the scoreline on the TV and chuckled. \u201cIs there a mercy rule in the NRL,\u201d he asked. No, but there should be. We start the second half as we ended the first, the Roosters building pressure on both flanks. Tupou looks set to clutch a high ball just inside the try line but Arthars takes a good grab to snuff out the move. It would be churlish to say anything other than \u2018all played well\u2019 in that first half for the Roosters, but there were some standouts. Radley is running amok, Flanagan is on fire and the Morris brothers are dead-set carving it up. Brett Morris, in particular, is doing as he pleases and doing it at both ends of the ground. Looks every inch a world-class fullback. Who needs James Tedesco? A Keary field goal in the dying seconds of the first half adds just one point to the tally, but it\u2019s illustrative of just how arrogantly the Roosters are putting the Broncos away tonight. Five tries to zip - should be more - 21 completed sets to nine, 70% possession and - wait for it - 1,167 all-run metres to 523. The visitors might as well be playing against the cardboard cutouts adorning the stands. 37 mins: Penalty for Roosters after the Broncos obstructed the kick-chase and they go for the jugular. Brett Morris goes for gold, hits the deck in the tackle and looks set to reach over the line only for the Broncos to win the battle and regain possession. Six completed sets to 19 at the minute. A shellacking. 35 mins: The Chooks look like they\u2019ve scored again courtesy of Josh Morris but the bunker says no try, pointing to an obstruction by Cordner. Not much in that at all. The mercy rule in action? The Roosters play the ball in fine blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it fashion and the Broncos are caught napping, leaving Flanagan to score a try between the posts, unmarked and untouched. This is now officially out of hand. 29 mins: Brisbane get a penalty for a \u201cknee in the face\u201d and for the first time tonight the Roosters are under pressure. Passes are strung together and Croft goes aerial, with Boyd destined to get on the end of it but his laconic attempt to gain control amounts to nothing. 25 mins: A handling error inside the Broncos\u2019 own 20 yet again hands the momentum to the Roosters. And it descends into a numbers game, the Chooks gaining metres galore with their tackles and passing with such precision that you know what\u2019s going to happen before it even has. They\u2019re pretty much queuing up to score a try and now it\u2019s Crichton\u2019s turn in the limelight. Another conversion by Flanagan and Brisbane are in a world of pain right now. They have nothing. Nada. 23 mins: This is the best moment for Brisbane, with Haas going on a bit of a run and forcing the Chooks into defensive mode for the first time. Oates is on down the left and looks like he\u2019s a chance but Brett Morris mows him down with a crunching tackle. The Roosters No 5 is having a night out at fullback. 18 mins: Errors galore from Brisbane and now Flegler coughs up the ball. The Roosters charge forward and the tackle count gets reset after four tackles, inviting Radley to change direction and make a mad dash to the line. Try No 3, conversion No 2. The Broncos look tired and clueless. Total mismatch. The Roosters have enjoyed 71% of the possession. Huh? Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen Brisbane with the ball. Here\u2019s the Manu try. Who\u2019d be a cameraman! 13 mins: The Broncos can\u2019t make ground by foot so it\u2019s left to the boot again but again Tupou is up to the task. And the Chooks are away again. Ripper of a set, hard running are sure passing. The ball yo-yos to the other end, so Brisbane get some breathing space, but again the Roosters get mobile. Forwards are killing them. Friend\u2019s kick then goes a bit too long, handing Brisbane a chance to steady. 9 mins: Those Chooks forwards are heaping pressure on the Broncos; they\u2019re gaining metres with every tackle. A fresh set of six awarded - ON THE LAST TACKLE! - makes the outcome almost inevitable as the Roosters toss it around like it\u2019s a training drill and the ball ends up with Manu, who touches down in the right corner. Brett Morris is making his influence felt in a big way. Flanagan gets his kicking boot on and the Chooks are out to a 10-point advantage. This could get silly. 4 mins: The Roosters have been building pressure and the passes are lightning fast from dummy half, the Morris brothers finishing the job with Brett offloading a one-hander to Josh who twists and turns his way over. Ominous signs here and we\u2019ve only just begun. Crook conversion attempt from Flanagan, however, and what should be a six-point lead is only four. 3 mins: The Broncos try to gain advantage by foot but Tupou is solid under the descending ball. And now a mad scramble a metre out from the Broncos\u2019 line; flick passes everywhere and the Chooks are almost over but the Broncos hold firm. Scrum for the Roosters. 1 min: And we\u2019re away. JWH tries to go for an early run but is mobbed by a bevvy of Broncos. Thursday night footy. Doesn\u2019t get much better. We\u2019re five minutes away. Just looking back over the team sheets. Those Roosters forwards are scary. How on earth will the Broncos match them? Insert perplexed emoji here. Ben Te\u2019o is on his way back to Brissie.

If Brisbane can get past the Roosters tonight, we definitely have a new kid in town and he\u2019s coloured blue and gold. But that won\u2019t be easy. The Chooks were back to something like their best against South Sydney and can continue their charge into the eight with victory in the Broncos\u2019 back yard. They\u2019ll have to do it without fullback James Tedesco, who awoke this morning with an elevated temperature. In these times of the coronavirus, that\u2019s enough to rule you out. Speaking of Covid-19 and sport, let\u2019s remove hats once again in honour of the NRL and the man now running the game, Peter V\u2019landys. They said it couldn\u2019t, shouldn\u2019t be done, but done it is and if viewing figures are anything to go by, the armchair public of Australia is chuffed to bits. No need to be so salty, Jeff.",

Kemi Badenoch, the minister for women and equalities, told the Commons she wanted any action the government takes to be driven by evidence, and it was not \u201ceasy to go directly from analysis to making recommendations\u201d. The government-commissioned investigation found that people of Bangladeshi background in England are twice as likely as white Britons to die if they contract Covid-19, and other BAME groups face an increased risk of up to 50%. The report, published on Tuesday, was quickly criticised for failing to investigate possible reasons for the disparities or make recommendations on how to address them. Responding to a Commons urgent question on the matter, Badenoch said that while it was important that the government understands the key drivers of these disparities, it was also vital that \u201cwe\u2019re not taking action which is not warranted by the evidence\u201d. Gill Furniss, the shadow women and equalities minister, was one of several politicians to criticise the report for failing to make any recommendations.

It says any recommendations from the promised second phase report being led by the junior equalities minister \u201cwill almost certainly be too late and could amount to the government kicking the issue into the long grass\u201d. Core has put forward its own recommendations, including ensuring all key workers have access to personal protective equipment, scrapping the no recourse to public funds condition imposed on migrants with limited leave, or those without leave to remain, and abolishing data sharing between the NHS and Home Office.

      "bodyText": "Virgin Atlantic has announced plans to resume scheduled passenger flights from the UK on 20 July. The carrier, whose future has been in the balance since the coronavirus outbreak, will restart operations with flights from London Heathrow to New York, Los Angeles, Orlando, Hong Kong and Shanghai. It said it would soon announce more destinations for August as countries begin to relax travel restrictions. It said it would continue dedicated cargo operations. Virgin said additional measures would be put in place at airports and onboard aircraft to ensure safety, including health questionnaires, temperature screening and packs including masks and hand sanitiser for passengers. Juha Jarvinen, Virgin Atlantic\u2019s chief commercial officer, said: \u201cAs the Covid-19 crisis stabilises and demand slowly returns, we are looking forward to welcoming our customers back onboard and flying them safely to their favourite destinations. To ensure the health and safety of our customers and our people, we\u2019re introducing new measures at every point in the journey to offer peace of mind when taking to the skies with us.\u201d He added: \u201cOur planned first flights will be to Orlando and Hong Kong on 20 July. However, we are monitoring external conditions extremely closely, in particular the travel restrictions many countries have in place, including the 14-day quarantine policy for travellers entering the UK.\u201d EasyJet said this week it would restart flights from the UK to Europe from July. British Airways has also said it will resume services in July, although it is reviewing it plans in the light of the government\u2019s quarantine measures due to come into force next week.",

Nearly 60% of employees were not covered by social insurance. In other coronavirus developments around the world: Spain wants to welcome back British tourists from 1 July, but said that would depend on the UK\u2019s 14-day quarantine plan for arrivals, including returning UK citizens, and on the British authorities rescinding advice on non-essential foreign travel. France said it would cancel its traditional 14 July Bastille Day military parade and replace it with a ceremony to pay tribute to care workers. Russia\u2019s relatively low official death toll was further brought into question after St Petersburg issued 32% more death certificates in May than in the same month last year. The number of confirmed cases in Afghanistan passed 18,000, with more than 300 deaths, amid a continued surge of transmissions in Kabul. Pakistan reported a record single-day high in coronavirus deaths (82) and new cases (4,688), saying it was due to increased testing. The World Health Organization\u2019s director for Africa said the continent\u2019s 162,622 confirmed coronavirus cases and 4,604 deaths was \u201cbroadly accurate\u201d, but the African Union health agency said the continent needs to triple its testing. A further 1.9 million people filed for unemployment benefits in the US last week, bringing the total number of claims to more than 42m since the pandemic hit. In Japan, Tokyo\u2019s governor said it may be necessary to stage a \u201csimplified\u201d Olympics next year owing to the impact of the pandemic. China said foreign airlines blocked from operating in the country could resume limited flights, a day after Washington suspended all Chinese travel into and out of the US. In Latin America, Mexico announced more than 1,000 deaths in a day for the first time and Brazil, the region\u2019s worst-hit country, reported a record 1,349.",

The shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, said ministers needed the government to follow up its emergency Covid-19 support package with changes to its business loan schemes and targeted help for sectors badly hit by the pandemic. Miliband\u2019s call came on a day that carmaker Aston Martin announced the loss of 500 jobs and car dealership Lookers announced 1,500 redundancies. Lookers has made extensive use of the government\u2019s wage subsidies. The announcements followed Wednesday\u2019s news of 3,000 job cuts at the Restaurant Group.

Miliband said more was needed, including a speeding up of loans to business, more help for the hardest hit sectors and an economic recovery plan. He said: \u201cWe now need a second phase of support, which further reforms the loans system and provides additional help for sectors like hospitality, tourism and the arts that will take longer to reopen and recover. We also need a plan for recovery which helps our economy out of recession as soon as possible. \u201cThe fate of businesses up and down the country is in the government\u2019s hands.\u201d Labour was broadly supportive of the measures taken by ministers in the early stages of the crisis but in the past few weeks has become more critical of the government\u2019s response. Miliband said Labour supported the insolvency bill but said the latest figures showed the government\u2019s loans schemes were still not working nearly well enough for UK businesses. The Treasury says the flow of lending to small businesses has improved since Sunak announced \u201cbounce-back\u201d loans last month, under which small businesses can borrow up to \u00a350,000 interest-free for a year with a 100% state guarantee. Miliband said bounce-back loans were also supposed to improve access to the government\u2019s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme but the latest official figures showed the weekly approval rate falling. More than 40,000 businesses were either still waiting or had been rejected for assistance through the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS).

      "body": "<p>Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen strongly to a new peak this year, despite the impact of the global effects of the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere reached 417.2 parts per million in May, 2.4ppm higher than the peak of 414.8ppm in 2019, according to readings from the Mauna Loa observatory in the US.</p> <p>Without worldwide lockdowns intended to slow the spread of Covid-19, the rise might have reached 2.8ppm, according to Ralph Keeling, a professor at the <a href=\"https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/\">Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a>. He said it was likely they had played a small role, but that the difference was too small to show up against other factors causing year-to-year fluctuations.</p> <p>\u201cPeople may be surprised to hear that the response to the coronavirus outbreak hasn\u2019t done more to influence CO2 levels,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the buildup of CO2 is a bit like trash in a landfill. As we keep emitting, it keeps piling up. The crisis has slowed emissions, but not enough to show up perceptibly at Mauna Loa. What will matter much more is the trajectory we take coming out of this situation.\u201d</p> <p>Daily emissions of carbon dioxide fell by an average of about 17% around the world in early April, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/lockdowns-trigger-dramatic-fall-global-carbon-emissions\">a comprehensive study </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/lockdowns-trigger-dramatic-fall-global-carbon-emissions\"> last month</a>. As lockdowns are eased, however, the fall in emissions for the year as a whole is only likely to be only between 4% and 7% compared with 2019. That will make no appreciable difference to the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/steep-fall-emissions-during-coronavirus-no-cause-for-celebration\"> world\u2019s ability to meet the goals of the Paris agreement</a>, and keep global heating below the threshold of 2C that scientists say is necessary to stave off catastrophic effects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/index-html-9-zip/giv-3902eKmXhDb43n62/\" data-alt=\"The Keeling curve\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/index-html-9-zip/giv-3902eKmXhDb43n62/\">The Keeling curve</a> </figure>  <p>If emissions reductions of 20% to 30% were sustained for six to 12 months, then the rate of increase of CO2 measured at Mauna Loa would slow, according to the Scripps scientists.</p> <p>This year\u2019s rise is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/04/latest-data-shows-steep-rises-in-co2-for-seventh-year\">slightly weaker than last year\u2019s</a>, but matches the average annual rise for the past decade. The amount of carbon fluctuates based on various factors, including the effects of the El Ni\u00f1o weather system in the Pacific.</p> <p>Carbon dioxide tends to peak each year in late May, when the impacts of the northern hemisphere spring have yet to take effect, so the month\u2019s data is compared from year to year. Measurements have been taken continuously at the remote Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii since 1958, providing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/05/why-the-guardian-is-putting-global-co2-levels-in-the-weather-forecast\">vital information for climate scientists</a>.</p> <p>The latest data comes from Scripps scientists at the University of California San Diego and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

      "bodyText": "Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen strongly to a new peak this year, despite the impact of the global effects of the coronavirus crisis. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere reached 417.2 parts per million in May, 2.4ppm higher than the peak of 414.8ppm in 2019, according to readings from the Mauna Loa observatory in the US. Without worldwide lockdowns intended to slow the spread of Covid-19, the rise might have reached 2.8ppm, according to Ralph Keeling, a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He said it was likely they had played a small role, but that the difference was too small to show up against other factors causing year-to-year fluctuations. \u201cPeople may be surprised to hear that the response to the coronavirus outbreak hasn\u2019t done more to influence CO2 levels,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the buildup of CO2 is a bit like trash in a landfill. As we keep emitting, it keeps piling up. The crisis has slowed emissions, but not enough to show up perceptibly at Mauna Loa. What will matter much more is the trajectory we take coming out of this situation.\u201d Daily emissions of carbon dioxide fell by an average of about 17% around the world in early April, according to the a comprehensive study last month. As lockdowns are eased, however, the fall in emissions for the year as a whole is only likely to be only between 4% and 7% compared with 2019. That will make no appreciable difference to the world\u2019s ability to meet the goals of the Paris agreement, and keep global heating below the threshold of 2C that scientists say is necessary to stave off catastrophic effects. If emissions reductions of 20% to 30% were sustained for six to 12 months, then the rate of increase of CO2 measured at Mauna Loa would slow, according to the Scripps scientists. This year\u2019s rise is slightly weaker than last year\u2019s, but matches the average annual rise for the past decade. The amount of carbon fluctuates based on various factors, including the effects of the El Ni\u00f1o weather system in the Pacific. Carbon dioxide tends to peak each year in late May, when the impacts of the northern hemisphere spring have yet to take effect, so the month\u2019s data is compared from year to year. Measurements have been taken continuously at the remote Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii since 1958, providing vital information for climate scientists. The latest data comes from Scripps scientists at the University of California San Diego and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They found that levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere first rose above 400ppm in 2014. The annual rate of growth in emissions has been speeding up. In the 1960s, the annual growth averaged about 0.8ppm, doubling to 1.6ppm a year in the 1980s and remaining steady at 1.5ppm in the 1990s. The average growth rate increased to about 2.0ppm a year in the 2000s, and has risen further to about 2.4ppm during the last decade. Environmental campaigners said the continued rise in emissions showed how urgently a green recovery from Covid-19 crisis was needed. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, called on the British government to do more as hosts of the next UN climate talks, Cop26, now postponed until 2021. \u201cJust a few months of lower emissions were never likely to make a dent in the hundreds of billions tonnes of carbon that have built up over a century and a half of burning fossil fuels,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the drop in emissions caused by the pandemic will remain just a blip unless governments get serious about building a cleaner, healthier and safer world.\u201d Muna Suleiman, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201c It\u2019s clear that climate breakdown isn\u2019t a distant idea, it\u2019s here right now, and we have to treat it like the emergency it is.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Just under a fortnight ago, council leaders across England received an email containing three attachments. It had been sent on behalf of Nadine Dorries, the health minister and former I\u2019m A Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out Of Here! contestant.</p> <p>Official material related to Covid-19 has frequently been full of numerical scales, shaded shapes and perplexing diagrams, and so it proved this time. As well as the promise of \u201can integrated and world-class Covid-19 test-and-trace service\u201d, one of the documents featured four circles in different shades of green, and the words \u201ctest\u201d, \u201cenable\u201d, \u201ccontain\u201d and \u201ctrace\u201d. Close by were two lines of text that sounded important, but baffled some of the people who read them.</p> <p>\u201cContinuing data capture and information loop at each stage that flows through Joint Biosecurity Centre to recommend actions \u2026 Underpinned by a huge public engagement exercise to build trust and participation.\u201d</p> <p>Over the previous few weeks, the government had begun to announce details of a new system that would define how it dealt with Covid-19 in the immediate future. Dido Harding, the former chief executive of the phone company TalkTalk, had been appointed to lead the test-and-trace effort. The outsourcing giant Serco and call-centre multinational Sitel were recruiting and training tens of thousands of people who would contact people by phone, while the smartphone app intended to be at the new system\u2019s core was being trialled in the Isle of Wight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c838201bbf856e019515e42d4d759ad41f0c20a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c838201bbf856e019515e42d4d759ad41f0c20a/0_362_7470_4485/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dido Harding.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dido Harding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pippa Fowles/10 Downing Street/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given that new local outbreaks of the coronavirus would inevitably demand the attention of people on the ground, there had been rising frustration about the apparent lack of a role for councils in the government\u2019s approach. Now, though, there was to be a \u201ccentral\u201d role for local authorities in \u201csupporting the new test-and-trace service across England\u201d, and an extra \u00a3300m from Whitehall to fund their new responsibilities.</p> <p>The following week, Matt Hancock said future flare-ups would be met with \u201clocal lockdowns\u201d, an announcement that came on the same day that the health secretary also heralded the early launch of the national test-and-trace system.</p> <p>But many of the local politicians and officials who will apparently play a key role in making everything work say hugely important questions remain unanswered. Nick Forbes, the Labour leader of Newcastle city council, says: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what this system looks like, we don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s going to cost, we don\u2019t know what money we\u2019re getting. The government is way behind the curve here. We\u2019ve only started to scratch the surface of what it all means.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I will accept the responsibility if they give me the powers\u2019</h2> <p>The new testing and tracing regime is branded with the logo of the NHS. It involves the government agency Public Health England, and official material on testing and tracing and local outbreaks identifies seven organisations and agencies that will also be involved, ranging from health protection boards and local strategic coordinating groups to outbreak engagement boards and local resilience forums. From the perspective of many people working at the grassroots, this is part of the problem. \u201cEverything feels so fragmented,\u201d one local government insider told me this week. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re trying to stick it all back together again.\u201d</p> <p>The basics of what testing, tracing and isolating entails are clear enough. If someone develops possible symptoms of the virus, they must self-isolate for at least seven days and register for a test. If that test comes back positive, leaving aside the possible operations of an app that will be introduced nationally \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d, they will then have to share detailed information with the authorities.</p> <p>This will include details of the people they live with, anyone they have been within 2 metres of for 15 minutes or longer, and places they have recently visited. In turn, people who have been close to anyone infected \u201cwill be told to begin self-isolation for 14 days from your last contact with the person who has tested positive\u201d.</p> <p>Linked to these complicated arrangements are proposals for what the government calls \u201clocal outbreak control plans\u201d, so far focused on care homes, schools&nbsp;and places such as sheltered housing developments, and what&nbsp;official documents term \u201cdormitories for migrant workers\u201d. This is one of the areas where local authorities will seemingly be crucial, along with \u201csupporting vulnerable people to get help to self-isolate\u201d.</p> <p>The Department of Health and Social Care is initially working \u201cintensively\u201d with 11 \u201cbeacon\u201d areas of England \u2013 including Leeds, Newcastle and Leicestershire \u2013 and has told local politicians and officials across England that they \u201cneed to develop local outbreak plans in June\u201d.</p> <p>Things seem to be moving. But inescapable truths hang over everything, not least that the lockdown has been loosened before many of the important elements of the testing, tracing and isolating system are in place.</p> <p>People in local government say they were encouraged by the appointment of Tom Riordan, the chief executive of Leeds city council, to a senior role in the testing and tracing system in mid-May. Nonetheless, big questions remain. Forbes says that as well as his uncertainties about local lockdowns (\u201cWe don\u2019t even have the power to close down a school at the moment, let alone lock down an area of a city\u201d), he has other worries.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a government which has tried to create a hostile environment. There\u2019s huge fear in many BAME communities that their data will be passed on. And if communities don\u2019t have the confidence to engage with the testing and tracing work, then it\u2019s going to fail.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2513abd17a158b73c27e809edabf4d4909d3ea97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2513abd17a158b73c27e809edabf4d4909d3ea97/0_136_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle council.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle council.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the other side of the River Tyne, Alice Wiseman is working flat-out in the borough of Gateshead, a coronavirus hotspot. She is a director of public health, and therefore charged by the government with defining how local authorities will \u201cidentify and contain outbreaks and protect the public\u2019s health\u201d. She too is still waiting for clarity on an array of issues.</p> <p>For weeks, Gateshead has run its own testing programme from labs in a local hospital. At the same time, a nationally run testing facility administered by the outsourcing firm Deloitte has been in operation \u2013 first from the car park of Gateshead\u2019s shuttered branch of Ikea, and then across the river in Newcastle. It has since been joined by a walk-in national testing centre three miles from the city centre.</p> <p>Wiseman says it has taken her eight weeks to access data from the nationally run testing system, and that even then the information is not detailed enough to be of much use. As of this week she can access information about Covid-19 infections across the whole of the north-east of England broken down by gender, age and some information about such \u201csettings\u201d as schools, hospitals and prisons. But she says she still has far too little information about cases in Gateshead from the national testing system, other than crude figures showing the number of people who have tested positive.</p> <p>She also says the testing results concerned are not available in anything like real time, which risks the virus spreading. Indeed, though the Department of Health insists that \u201capproximately 90% of people now receive a result within 48 hours of their test\u201d, she says she is still having conversations about results taking more than 72 hours to arrive with individuals, before they are then collated into official data. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a picture of the issues in our local area since the start, and we don\u2019t have one now.\u201d</p> <p>In Leicestershire, the Conservative leader of the county council is also awaiting answers. Nick Rushton says that when he has talked with ministers, a term he has heard is \u201clocal political accountability\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf we\u2019ve got local accountability, I want local responsibility,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, for example, if I had an outbreak in a factory where there\u2019s a lot of people, I don\u2019t want to say: \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve got an outbreak and we need to shut the factory and isolate all those people,\u2019 and then have to phone up the secretary of state and ask them if I can do it. If they want me to do it, I will accept that responsibility if they give me those powers locally.\u201d</p> <p>In response to this point, the Department of Health said it \u201cwill shortly be issuing guidance on how local and national government can work to ensure local outbreaks can be contained\u201d.</p> <p>Rushton says Dorries \u201cseems very keen to help us, on a Zoom call. But we need to see the colour of her money. Because we don\u2019t know how much we\u2019re going to get to do this.\u201d</p> <p>Though the government has provided an extra \u00a33.2bn in emergency Covid-19 funding for councils, and the Department of Health insists they have the resources they need to \u201ctackle the immediate pressures they have told us they are facing\u201d, Rushton\u2019s authority has so far spent twice as much on the effects of Covid-19 as it has been given by ministers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s extremely concerning. Hopefully they\u2019ll realise just how dire the situation will be next year. What you\u2019ll have to do is cut services, it\u2019s as simple as that. If you don\u2019t have the money \u2026 you just have to stop doing things.\u201d</p> <p>Rushton says Leicestershire has enough reserves to cope with any financial crisis, but scores of councils do not. And if the government insists that they take on all these new responsibilities but does not adequately fund them, the combination could tip many places into bankruptcy.</p> <p>In Leeds, the city council leader, Judith Blake, says the financial gap left by the virus on her finances will be around \u00a3160m. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very serious indeed,\u201d she says. She also expresses scepticism about whether she and her colleagues will be able to respond to crisis as they would like. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect that the government is going to be giving us the powers we need any time soon. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s in their DNA.

      "bodyText": "Just under a fortnight ago, council leaders across England received an email containing three attachments. It had been sent on behalf of Nadine Dorries, the health minister and former I\u2019m A Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out Of Here! contestant. Official material related to Covid-19 has frequently been full of numerical scales, shaded shapes and perplexing diagrams, and so it proved this time. As well as the promise of \u201can integrated and world-class Covid-19 test-and-trace service\u201d, one of the documents featured four circles in different shades of green, and the words \u201ctest\u201d, \u201cenable\u201d, \u201ccontain\u201d and \u201ctrace\u201d. Close by were two lines of text that sounded important, but baffled some of the people who read them. \u201cContinuing data capture and information loop at each stage that flows through Joint Biosecurity Centre to recommend actions \u2026 Underpinned by a huge public engagement exercise to build trust and participation.\u201d Over the previous few weeks, the government had begun to announce details of a new system that would define how it dealt with Covid-19 in the immediate future. Dido Harding, the former chief executive of the phone company TalkTalk, had been appointed to lead the test-and-trace effort. The outsourcing giant Serco and call-centre multinational Sitel were recruiting and training tens of thousands of people who would contact people by phone, while the smartphone app intended to be at the new system\u2019s core was being trialled in the Isle of Wight. Given that new local outbreaks of the coronavirus would inevitably demand the attention of people on the ground, there had been rising frustration about the apparent lack of a role for councils in the government\u2019s approach. Now, though, there was to be a \u201ccentral\u201d role for local authorities in \u201csupporting the new test-and-trace service across England\u201d, and an extra \u00a3300m from Whitehall to fund their new responsibilities. The following week, Matt Hancock said future flare-ups would be met with \u201clocal lockdowns\u201d, an announcement that came on the same day that the health secretary also heralded the early launch of the national test-and-trace system. But many of the local politicians and officials who will apparently play a key role in making everything work say hugely important questions remain unanswered. Nick Forbes, the Labour leader of Newcastle city council, says: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what this system looks like, we don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s going to cost, we don\u2019t know what money we\u2019re getting. The government is way behind the curve here. We\u2019ve only started to scratch the surface of what it all means.\u201d \u2018I will accept the responsibility if they give me the powers\u2019 The new testing and tracing regime is branded with the logo of the NHS. It involves the government agency Public Health England, and official material on testing and tracing and local outbreaks identifies seven organisations and agencies that will also be involved, ranging from health protection boards and local strategic coordinating groups to outbreak engagement boards and local resilience forums. From the perspective of many people working at the grassroots, this is part of the problem. \u201cEverything feels so fragmented,\u201d one local government insider told me this week. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re trying to stick it all back together again.\u201d The basics of what testing, tracing and isolating entails are clear enough. If someone develops possible symptoms of the virus, they must self-isolate for at least seven days and register for a test. If that test comes back positive, leaving aside the possible operations of an app that will be introduced nationally \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d, they will then have to share detailed information with the authorities. This will include details of the people they live with, anyone they have been within 2 metres of for 15 minutes or longer, and places they have recently visited. In turn, people who have been close to anyone infected \u201cwill be told to begin self-isolation for 14 days from your last contact with the person who has tested positive\u201d. Linked to these complicated arrangements are proposals for what the government calls \u201clocal outbreak control plans\u201d, so far focused on care homes, schools and places such as sheltered housing developments, and what official documents term \u201cdormitories for migrant workers\u201d. This is one of the areas where local authorities will seemingly be crucial, along with \u201csupporting vulnerable people to get help to self-isolate\u201d. The Department of Health and Social Care is initially working \u201cintensively\u201d with 11 \u201cbeacon\u201d areas of England \u2013 including Leeds, Newcastle and Leicestershire \u2013 and has told local politicians and officials across England that they \u201cneed to develop local outbreak plans in June\u201d. Things seem to be moving. But inescapable truths hang over everything, not least that the lockdown has been loosened before many of the important elements of the testing, tracing and isolating system are in place. People in local government say they were encouraged by the appointment of Tom Riordan, the chief executive of Leeds city council, to a senior role in the testing and tracing system in mid-May. Nonetheless, big questions remain. Forbes says that as well as his uncertainties about local lockdowns (\u201cWe don\u2019t even have the power to close down a school at the moment, let alone lock down an area of a city\u201d), he has other worries. \u201cThis is a government which has tried to create a hostile environment. There\u2019s huge fear in many BAME communities that their data will be passed on. And if communities don\u2019t have the confidence to engage with the testing and tracing work, then it\u2019s going to fail.\u201d On the other side of the River Tyne, Alice Wiseman is working flat-out in the borough of Gateshead, a coronavirus hotspot. She is a director of public health, and therefore charged by the government with defining how local authorities will \u201cidentify and contain outbreaks and protect the public\u2019s health\u201d. She too is still waiting for clarity on an array of issues. For weeks, Gateshead has run its own testing programme from labs in a local hospital. At the same time, a nationally run testing facility administered by the outsourcing firm Deloitte has been in operation \u2013 first from the car park of Gateshead\u2019s shuttered branch of Ikea, and then across the river in Newcastle. It has since been joined by a walk-in national testing centre three miles from the city centre. Wiseman says it has taken her eight weeks to access data from the nationally run testing system, and that even then the information is not detailed enough to be of much use. As of this week she can access information about Covid-19 infections across the whole of the north-east of England broken down by gender, age and some information about such \u201csettings\u201d as schools, hospitals and prisons. But she says she still has far too little information about cases in Gateshead from the national testing system, other than crude figures showing the number of people who have tested positive. She also says the testing results concerned are not available in anything like real time, which risks the virus spreading. Indeed, though the Department of Health insists that \u201capproximately 90% of people now receive a result within 48 hours of their test\u201d, she says she is still having conversations about results taking more than 72 hours to arrive with individuals, before they are then collated into official data. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a picture of the issues in our local area since the start, and we don\u2019t have one now.\u201d In Leicestershire, the Conservative leader of the county council is also awaiting answers. Nick Rushton says that when he has talked with ministers, a term he has heard is \u201clocal political accountability\u201d. \u201cIf we\u2019ve got local accountability, I want local responsibility,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, for example, if I had an outbreak in a factory where there\u2019s a lot of people, I don\u2019t want to say: \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve got an outbreak and we need to shut the factory and isolate all those people,\u2019 and then have to phone up the secretary of state and ask them if I can do it. If they want me to do it, I will accept that responsibility if they give me those powers locally.\u201d In response to this point, the Department of Health said it \u201cwill shortly be issuing guidance on how local and national government can work to ensure local outbreaks can be contained\u201d. Rushton says Dorries \u201cseems very keen to help us, on a Zoom call. But we need to see the colour of her money. Because we don\u2019t know how much we\u2019re going to get to do this.\u201d Though the government has provided an extra \u00a33.2bn in emergency Covid-19 funding for councils, and the Department of Health insists they have the resources they need to \u201ctackle the immediate pressures they have told us they are facing\u201d, Rushton\u2019s authority has so far spent twice as much on the effects of Covid-19 as it has been given by ministers. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely concerning. Hopefully they\u2019ll realise just how dire the situation will be next year. What you\u2019ll have to do is cut services, it\u2019s as simple as that. If you don\u2019t have the money \u2026 you just have to stop doing things.\u201d Rushton says Leicestershire has enough reserves to cope with any financial crisis, but scores of councils do not. And if the government insists that they take on all these new responsibilities but does not adequately fund them, the combination could tip many places into bankruptcy. In Leeds, the city council leader, Judith Blake, says the financial gap left by the virus on her finances will be around \u00a3160m. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very serious indeed,\u201d she says. She also expresses scepticism about whether she and her colleagues will be able to respond to crisis as they would like. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect that the government is going to be giving us the powers we need any time soon. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s in their DNA. It\u2019s a cultural issue.\u201d \u2018The government doesn\u2019t seem to want to let go\u2019 A source within the new national testing and tracing system says the involvement of councils came \u201ctoo late, without a doubt\u201d, but that over the last few weeks the government\u2019s turn towards local authorities has made a \u201cpalpable difference\u201d. They speak with guarded optimism, but also say there is an ongoing tension between what ministers say in public and how people working locally have to put plans into practice. \u201cEvery night you hear from a secretary of state or the chancellor or the prime minister, and they want an announcement to make. So they almost manufacture things. If they consulted with people, they would still end up doing things, but at least there\u2019d be buy-in, and warnings to people on the ground,\u201d the source says. On Wednesday the Daily Telegraph reported that \u201ca shake-up in Downing Street will see the government\u2019s entire approach to the pandemic run by two centrally run committees\u201d. This was not the kind of news that people trying to get cities, counties and boroughs through this crisis wanted to hear. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that we\u2019ve only recently been seen as a resource to help the country get through this crisis,\u201d says Forbes. \u201cAnd even now, the chains of centralisation are still being rattled.

      "bodyText": "The number of suspected modern slavery victims identified in the UK has fallen for the first time in four years due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Home Office has said. Officials said the decrease \u201cis understood to have been influenced by the effects of restrictions implemented in the UK as part of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d. The UK\u2019s national referral mechanism (NRM), the official system through which victims of modern slavery are identified and provided with support, received 2,871 referrals of potential victims in the first quarter of 2020 \u2013 a 14% fall from the previous three months. This is the first quarter-on-quarter fall since 2016. Travel restrictions by other countries on people coming to the UK, increasing numbers of people self-isolating and businesses shutting after the lockdown on 23 March are understood to be some of the factors behind the decline. Ministers have said people referred through the NRM will continue to be able to access support and government-funded accommodation through the pandemic. Potential victims would usually be assisted to find new accommodation after 45 days, but will be able to remain for three months to protect them from Covid-19. Last year, the number of suspected modern slavery victims in the UK hit a record high, with more than 10,000 potential victims of trafficking, slavery and forced labour identified. While referrals in 2020 have fallen compared with the previous quarter, they are still up by 33% from the first quarter of 2019, when there were 2,154 referrals. Of the 2,871 potential victims, 61% (1,737) said they had been exploited in the UK, while a quarter (755) said this took place overseas. Labour exploitation was most commonly reported by adults, the majority of whom were male. For suspected child victims, criminal exploitation was most common, which the Home Office said was \u201cpartially driven\u201d by an increase in the identification of county lines drugs cases. UK nationals accounted for a quarter (756) of all potential victims referred. The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, Christine Jardine, said: \u201cThe extent of modern slavery here in the UK is shocking. As coronavirus has spread, so has modern slavery yet the government is failing to act on this rise we have seen since last year. \u201cThe fact that some of the most vulnerable in our society are being left at risk shows the urgent need for the government to act.\u201d",

In a highly globalised economy closing borders may seem unpalatable, but perhaps we have now learned our lessons the hard way. \u2022 Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh \u2022 This article was amended on 7 June 2020 because an earlier version referred to New York, rather than the US, in a list of countries that passengers could arrive from. This has been corrected.",

Under Grayling\u2019s widely derided shake-up in 2014, the probation sector was separated into a public sector organisation managing high-risk criminals and 21 private companies responsible for the supervision of 150,000 low- to medium-risk offenders. Last year the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) announced that all offender management would be brought under the state-run National Probation Service (NPS), while contracts for rehabilitation services such as the provision of unpaid work and accredited programmes were to be offered up to the private and voluntary sector. But the Guardian can reveal that the government suspended the competition for contracts last week and after an internal MoJ review it is considering renationalising probation services in their entirety. Stakeholders have expressed a belief that this signals the end of the private sector involvement in probation that was spearheaded by Grayling when he was justice secretary. The current justice secretary, Robert Buckland, is understood to have cancelled calls to stakeholders on Wednesday to apprise them of the situation. An MoJ spokesperson said: \u201cReforming probation to improve public protection and reduce reoffending remains one of our top priorities and we are assessing whether any changes to our current plans are required in light of the coronavirus pandemic. No decisions have been made.\u201d Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP who recently reaffirmed her bid to become party leader, said: \u201cThe privatisation of probation has been a total and utter disaster.

Meanwhile, former vice-president Joe Biden and senior Democratic officials are strongly considering a partially or completely virtual convention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/joe-biden-george-floyd-protests\">Can Joe Biden convince protesters he would be a 'transformational' president?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a stark illustration of how the two men \u2013 and their parties \u2013 are reacting to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the 2020 race. Trump wants to get back to business as usual in the physical world while Biden and his staff are navigating a new world mostly online.</p> <p>Even as America cautiously reopens from its most quarantined pandemic days, Trump has traveled across the country and been plotting campaign events and an upcoming in-person fundraiser.</p> <p>Biden has been far more cautious, continuing to host online fundraisers while his team have said they are listening to health experts on how quickly to revert back to pre-coronavirus campaigning.</p> <p>When he has delivered speeches or made public appearances, Trump has refused to wear a mask. Biden has made a point of appearing masked in public, a deliberate contrast to Trump.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s in Biden\u2019s interest that the campaign is a referendum on the president and not a choice,\u201d said Republican David Kochel, who was a top adviser for Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cSo if I was Team Biden I would probably be doing the same thing, which is being as low-key as possible, sending a more calm and reassuring message. But I don\u2019t think that Biden needs to get out and try and hold a 10,000-person rally. It\u2019s not his forte anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Kochel added that Trump\u2019s approach made sense for him as well.</p> <p>\u201cThe Trump strategy really makes sense as well because he really does feed off of those rallies \u2013 the energy that he gets from them,\u201d Kochel said. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting platform for him to launch into his detractors and his rivals and without that platform I think it\u2019s not as easy for him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af9841366cf986fb230e3e48c945b44c37518cbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af9841366cf986fb230e3e48c945b44c37518cbd/0_206_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump wants this year\u2019s Republican convention to replicate the crowded, in-person atmosphere of the 2016 version.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump wants this year\u2019s Republican convention to replicate the crowded, in-person atmosphere of the 2016 version.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Wilking/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both Biden and Trump have made appearances in public since the protests sparked by George Floyd\u2019s death have rocked the nation with scenes of unrest. Both have delivered remarks addressing those protests. But where Biden\u2019s public appearances and comments have largely been about calling for reform, Trump has pushed a \u201claw and order\u201d agenda \u2013 although he has publicly acknowledged Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>Biden is reportedly expected to attend Floyd\u2019s funeral next week. On Friday Trump is slated to travel to Maine to tour where he will tour a nasal swab facility.</p> <p>The differing approaches extend to fundraisers as well. According to a list obtained by the Guardian, all of Biden\u2019s upcoming fundraising events are virtual. By contrast, Trump and his team are plotting in-person fundraisers, according to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/29/trump-schedules-in-person-fundraisers-as-shackles-come-off-289798\">Politico</a>.</p> <p>Ignoring the pandemic is also handy for a president whose response to a disaster that has killed 100,000 Americans and seen 40 million people lose their jobs has been widely slammed as chaotic and ineffective. Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s caution emphasizes the reality that the coronavirus remains an ongoing challenge for the government.</p> <p>\u201cProtesting aside, it\u2019s a tricky time because as we\u2019re seeing, yes some states are starting to open back up but, as we\u2019re seeing, the number of cases is going back up in those places. Just from a campaign perspective, trying to assess what you can do without putting people in danger [is important],\u201d said the Democratic strategist Karen Finney, who served as a senior communications adviser for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.</p> <p>Finney added that she doubted voters would rally around Trump\u2019s approach to campaigning like the pandemic never happened. Americans are having to accept that this entire election cycle will be unlike other ones, Finney said.</p> <p>\u201cI think this is also part of us accepting that it\u2019s all going to be very different, voting is going to be different,\u201d Finney added. \u201cWe may have to settle in and be prepared that we may not have a set answer on election night. It may be a two- or three-day process.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump team and the president himself have wanted to turn Biden\u2019s social distancing and virtual campaigning into a liability.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump wants to be nominated by a Republican national convention with all the trappings of a normal, packed event: the thronging crowds, the balloon drop, the scores of sideshow events. Meanwhile, former vice-president Joe Biden and senior Democratic officials are strongly considering a partially or completely virtual convention. It is a stark illustration of how the two men \u2013 and their parties \u2013 are reacting to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the 2020 race. Trump wants to get back to business as usual in the physical world while Biden and his staff are navigating a new world mostly online. Even as America cautiously reopens from its most quarantined pandemic days, Trump has traveled across the country and been plotting campaign events and an upcoming in-person fundraiser. Biden has been far more cautious, continuing to host online fundraisers while his team have said they are listening to health experts on how quickly to revert back to pre-coronavirus campaigning. When he has delivered speeches or made public appearances, Trump has refused to wear a mask. Biden has made a point of appearing masked in public, a deliberate contrast to Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s in Biden\u2019s interest that the campaign is a referendum on the president and not a choice,\u201d said Republican David Kochel, who was a top adviser for Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cSo if I was Team Biden I would probably be doing the same thing, which is being as low-key as possible, sending a more calm and reassuring message. But I don\u2019t think that Biden needs to get out and try and hold a 10,000-person rally. It\u2019s not his forte anyway.\u201d Kochel added that Trump\u2019s approach made sense for him as well. \u201cThe Trump strategy really makes sense as well because he really does feed off of those rallies \u2013 the energy that he gets from them,\u201d Kochel said. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting platform for him to launch into his detractors and his rivals and without that platform I think it\u2019s not as easy for him.\u201d Both Biden and Trump have made appearances in public since the protests sparked by George Floyd\u2019s death have rocked the nation with scenes of unrest. Both have delivered remarks addressing those protests. But where Biden\u2019s public appearances and comments have largely been about calling for reform, Trump has pushed a \u201claw and order\u201d agenda \u2013 although he has publicly acknowledged Floyd\u2019s death. Biden is reportedly expected to attend Floyd\u2019s funeral next week. On Friday Trump is slated to travel to Maine to tour where he will tour a nasal swab facility. The differing approaches extend to fundraisers as well. According to a list obtained by the Guardian, all of Biden\u2019s upcoming fundraising events are virtual. By contrast, Trump and his team are plotting in-person fundraisers, according to Politico. Ignoring the pandemic is also handy for a president whose response to a disaster that has killed 100,000 Americans and seen 40 million people lose their jobs has been widely slammed as chaotic and ineffective. Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s caution emphasizes the reality that the coronavirus remains an ongoing challenge for the government. \u201cProtesting aside, it\u2019s a tricky time because as we\u2019re seeing, yes some states are starting to open back up but, as we\u2019re seeing, the number of cases is going back up in those places. Just from a campaign perspective, trying to assess what you can do without putting people in danger [is important],\u201d said the Democratic strategist Karen Finney, who served as a senior communications adviser for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Finney added that she doubted voters would rally around Trump\u2019s approach to campaigning like the pandemic never happened. Americans are having to accept that this entire election cycle will be unlike other ones, Finney said. \u201cI think this is also part of us accepting that it\u2019s all going to be very different, voting is going to be different,\u201d Finney added. \u201cWe may have to settle in and be prepared that we may not have a set answer on election night. It may be a two- or three-day process.\u201d The Trump team and the president himself have wanted to turn Biden\u2019s social distancing and virtual campaigning into a liability. Trump has dinged his likely rival as dotty and out of touch. Trump allies hope that if the president is confidently crisscrossing the country without a mask, doing campaign events, that will also offer a stark contrast with Biden. They hope he will appear weak to voters. Finney, though, said the reason Trump has been attacking Biden on the Democrat\u2019s caution is because so far it has helped Biden develop a healthy lead in the polls. \u201cThe reason Trump is attacking [Biden] is because the basement strategy has been very successful and effective,\u201d Finney said. Biden, Finney said, has been able to create virtual events that have been effective. \u201cHe\u2019s been able to deliver a clear, consistent message that actually is resonating with what people hear in this time of crisis and speaking to our fears and our concerns but also trying to put forward a positive message.\u201d",

The idea that the issues BLM are protesting about are specific only to the US is farcical, as though race or policing are not global phenomena by their very nature; as though we don\u2019t see similar dynamics in Brazil, or Australia, or even Britain.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Of course, there are certain force multipliers in the US that increase the scale of its problems; we do not have prisons the size of small towns or police officers walking around with AR-15s in Britain. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-video-report\">George Floyd</a> showed that police do not need guns to take life. Floyd\u2019s chilling final cries of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d are not only the same words uttered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/eric-garner-nypd-chokehold-homicide\">Eric Garner</a> as he was being choked by police officers in New York in 2014, but also by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-29998050\">Jimmy Mubenga</a> who in 2010 died on a plane on a Heathrow runway while being restrained by three immigration officers (an inquest into his death found he had been unlawfully killed, but the&nbsp;immigration officers were later acquitted of manslaughter).

The officers had taken to abusing Oluwale whenever he was spotted, and famously wrote \u201cWog\u201d by his nationality on his arrest sheet. When Oluwale died after being in their custody, they faced charges of manslaughter. During the trial these charges were dropped to assault.

Saving some money for a rainy day is one thing but running surpluses worth 8% of national output was unnecessary and harmful to the global economy.</p> \n<p>Nobody can accuse Europe\u2019s biggest economy of stinting on this occasion.

It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully.

      "bodyText": "And in one bound she was transformed. For Angela Merkel, the days of being lampooned as the archetypal Swabian housewife keeping tight control over the purse strings are over. Now, courtesy of a \u20ac130bn (\u00a3116bn) stimulus package, she is the spend, spend, spend chancellor. Make no mistake, much of the past criticism of Germany\u2019s frugal approach to government spending and budget deficits was justified. Saving some money for a rainy day is one thing but running surpluses worth 8% of national output was unnecessary and harmful to the global economy. Nobody can accuse Europe\u2019s biggest economy of stinting on this occasion. The package was bigger than expected and, at about 4% of GDP, doubles the size of Germany\u2019s tax and spending stimulus since the start of the crisis. Germany showed the rest of Europe what was needed to limit the spread of the virus: a decentralised testing programme; a manufacturing sector capable of producing medical equipment quickly; and a political system that prizes results over grandstanding. Now it is showing other countries how to do the recovery. It is not just a question of money, important though that is.

      "body": "<p>A junior doctor says he has been overwhelmed with donations after running a marathon on his way home from his hospital shift to raise money for vital personal protection equipment (PPE).</p> <p>Dr Kieran Togher, 25, who works at the Luton and Dunstable hospital, ran to his home in Enfield after work on Wednesday, an exact distance of 26.3 miles (42km), to raise money for <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/helpcovidcrisisrescueuk\">Covid Crisis Rescue UK </a>.</p> <p>Togher gave himself just three weeks to prepare for the feat, and has never run more than 10km competitively before.</p> <p>After completing his challenge he said he was grateful for the support, \u201cnot only [from] my nearest and dearest but also people who have no idea who I am\u201d.</p> <p>Explaining his motivation ahead of his run, he said: \u201cUnfortunately, due to years of neglect, we have been caught short in our supplies of PPE by the coronavirus pandemic. Even senior consultants have been driven to using makeshift PPE for protection, or worse, have had nothing at all.</p> <p>\u201cWe have already lost several healthcare professionals across the country, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/16/hospital-says-baby-of-nurse-who-died-from-covid-19-doing-well\">Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong,</a> a young nurse at Luton &amp; Dunstable hospital where I work, who has left behind a husband and newborn child.</p> <p>\u201cBut PPE doesn\u2019t only protect us, it protects you too.\u201d</p> <p>So far his appeal has raised almost \u00a33,000, three times his target, for Covid Crisis Rescue UK, a small group run by two doctors raising money to buy PPE for frontline healthcare staff. He said they were \u201cundertaking an inspiring operation to get PPE to where it\u2019s needed, bypassing the bureaucracy and red tape that has been hampering efforts across the country\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not just to hospitals, but to overlooked healthcare centres, including domestic abuse shelters, care homes, hospices and ambulance services.\u201d</p> <h2>Helping Big Issue vendors</h2> <p>Celebrities including actors Ray Winstone and Hugh Jackman, and writer-director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/armandoiannucci\">Armando Iannucci,</a> are among the stars who have offered prizes in a <a href=\"https://www.bigissue.com/\">Big Issue</a> raffle to help support its vendors during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The magazine, which offers homeless and vulnerably-housed people in the UK a way to earn income, has seen crucial sales hit since lockdown.</p> <p>The editor, Paul McNamee, said: \u201cSince the end of March we\u2019ve been going all-out to completely change, and save, the Big Issue during the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve come so far, with the generous support of the public. But the battle is not over, nor is it won. We have one more big idea.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://thebigissueraffle.co.uk/\">The Big Raffle </a>prize draw opened on Thursday. Winstone has offered to record a personalised video message in the style of his favourite characters. Jackman will send a personal message to a winner. Iannacci is giving four people the chance to take part in an hour-long conversation with him in a topic of their choosing.</p> <p>TV presenter Lorraine Kelly is offering a winner the chance to go backstage at her ITV programme, as well as going for breakfast with her afterwards.</p> <h2>Emotional reunion</h2> <p>A video of an NHS healthcare worker\u2019s emotional reunion with her young daughters after nine weeks apart due to the pandemic has gone viral on social media.</p> <p>Suzie Vaughan, 43, from King\u2019s Lynn, Norfolk, who works as an operating department practitioner in the intensive care unit at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in the town, had spent more than two months separated from Bella, 9, and Hettie, 7, who are staying with her sister.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-06-02/watch-medic-mum-reunited-with-daughters-after-nine-weeks-apart/\">The heartwarming video</a> showed her creeping up behind them as they watched TV, unaware she was there. There were tears of joy as they finally hugged.</p> <p>Vaughan said initially she had thought they would only be apart for a maximum of one month, \u201cbut nobody knew at the beginning of this how it was going to go.</p> <p>\u201cIt was amazing to see them again. I missed the girls terribly. When they started crying I felt so bad but so relieved I was back with them.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A junior doctor says he has been overwhelmed with donations after running a marathon on his way home from his hospital shift to raise money for vital personal protection equipment (PPE). Dr Kieran Togher, 25, who works at the Luton and Dunstable hospital, ran to his home in Enfield after work on Wednesday, an exact distance of 26.3 miles (42km), to raise money for Covid Crisis Rescue UK . Togher gave himself just three weeks to prepare for the feat, and has never run more than 10km competitively before. After completing his challenge he said he was grateful for the support, \u201cnot only [from] my nearest and dearest but also people who have no idea who I am\u201d. Explaining his motivation ahead of his run, he said: \u201cUnfortunately, due to years of neglect, we have been caught short in our supplies of PPE by the coronavirus pandemic. Even senior consultants have been driven to using makeshift PPE for protection, or worse, have had nothing at all. \u201cWe have already lost several healthcare professionals across the country, including Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong, a young nurse at Luton &amp; Dunstable hospital where I work, who has left behind a husband and newborn child. \u201cBut PPE doesn\u2019t only protect us, it protects you too.\u201d So far his appeal has raised almost \u00a33,000, three times his target, for Covid Crisis Rescue UK, a small group run by two doctors raising money to buy PPE for frontline healthcare staff. He said they were \u201cundertaking an inspiring operation to get PPE to where it\u2019s needed, bypassing the bureaucracy and red tape that has been hampering efforts across the country\u201d. \u201cThis is not just to hospitals, but to overlooked healthcare centres, including domestic abuse shelters, care homes, hospices and ambulance services.\u201d Helping Big Issue vendors Celebrities including actors Ray Winstone and Hugh Jackman, and writer-director Armando Iannucci, are among the stars who have offered prizes in a Big Issue raffle to help support its vendors during the coronavirus pandemic. The magazine, which offers homeless and vulnerably-housed people in the UK a way to earn income, has seen crucial sales hit since lockdown. The editor, Paul McNamee, said: \u201cSince the end of March we\u2019ve been going all-out to completely change, and save, the Big Issue during the Covid-19 crisis. \u201cWe\u2019ve come so far, with the generous support of the public. But the battle is not over, nor is it won. We have one more big idea.\u201d The Big Raffle prize draw opened on Thursday. Winstone has offered to record a personalised video message in the style of his favourite characters. Jackman will send a personal message to a winner. Iannacci is giving four people the chance to take part in an hour-long conversation with him in a topic of their choosing. TV presenter Lorraine Kelly is offering a winner the chance to go backstage at her ITV programme, as well as going for breakfast with her afterwards. Emotional reunion A video of an NHS healthcare worker\u2019s emotional reunion with her young daughters after nine weeks apart due to the pandemic has gone viral on social media. Suzie Vaughan, 43, from King\u2019s Lynn, Norfolk, who works as an operating department practitioner in the intensive care unit at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in the town, had spent more than two months separated from Bella, 9, and Hettie, 7, who are staying with her sister. The heartwarming video showed her creeping up behind them as they watched TV, unaware she was there. There were tears of joy as they finally hugged. Vaughan said initially she had thought they would only be apart for a maximum of one month, \u201cbut nobody knew at the beginning of this how it was going to go. \u201cIt was amazing to see them again. I missed the girls terribly. When they started crying I felt so bad but so relieved I was back with them.\u201d",

Tony Prestedge, the chief operating officer of the NHS scheme, admitted in a webinar to staff that the programme would be \u201cimperfect\u201d at launch, adding that he hoped it would be operational at a world-class level within three to four months. It comes as a leaked email from the chief executive of Serco \u2013 one of the main companies contracted to deliver the service \u2013 revealed how he doubted the scheme would evolve smoothly but said he wanted it to \u201ccement the position of the private sector\u201d in the NHS supply chain.

      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank has ramped up its coronavirus pandemic response by agreeing to inject an additional \u20ac600bn (\u00a3539.5bn) of emergency financial support into the Eurozone economy. Faced with the deepest recession in living memory and rapidly rising job losses across the single currency bloc, the ECB said it would increase the size of its quantitative easing bond-buying programme to \u20ac1.35tn. The central bank also said it would extend the scheme, known as the pandemic emergency purchase programme, until at least June 2021 to support the recovery of the eurozone\u2019s stricken economy. Launched in March at the onset of the crisis with a target to buy \u20ac750bn of government bonds and high-quality corporate debt, the scheme is designed to help lower the cost of borrowing for countries, businesses and households within the single currency bloc. Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB, said the eurozone was undergoing an \u201cunprecedented contraction\u201d as Covid-19 and the lockdown measures used to contain it bring the world economy to an effective standstill. The ECB kept its key interest rate unchanged at zero and said it would remain there until inflation comes closer to its 2% target. Against a backdrop of plunging global oil prices, inflation has dropped close to zero and is expected to remain subdued this year as the global economy struggles to rebound from Covid-19. Lagarde said the central bank stood ready to use every tool in its arsenal to support the return to growth across the eurozone. \u201cIn the current rapidly evolving economic environment, the governing council remains fully committed to doing everything necessary within its mandate,\u201d she said. The eurozone economy plunged by 3.8% in the first three months of the year and is expected to fall further again in the second quarter. Largarde said the central bank expected a return to growth in the three months to September, although cautioned the overall speed and scale of the rebound remained highly uncertain. She said the recovery would depend on the extent to which the coronavirus is contained and the impact on households and businesses is cushioned. Substantially revising down its growth forecasts for the next three years, the central bank said it expected annual economic growth in the single currency bloc of 8.7% in 2020, before a rebound to 2021 to 5.2 and by 3.3% in 2022.",

The question today is whether it will be expanded or whether the central bank will hold fire until July.<br></p> <p>Many analysts expect the ECB to up buying by \u20ac500bn, as purchases at their current rate are expected to run out by October. <br></p> <p> <strong>Derek Halpenny</strong>, head of research at <strong>MUFG</strong>, an investment bank, said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> We think today is the day in which the ECB needs to reinforce the perception of European authorities finally getting to grips with the scale of the Covid-19 hit with further QE action.</p> <p> A failure to act today would imply consideration is being given to only running the program until September which would result in considerable anxiety amongst investorsthat would result in an immediatetightening of financial market conditions. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Seema Shah, </strong>chief strategist at <strong>Principal Global Investors</strong>, said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite the ECB only having spent a third of the \u20ac750bn [Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme], anything less than a \u20ac500bn expansion will be a disappointment and could undo the recent weeks of market strength. Although equity markets seem to believe a V-shaped economic recovery is underway, the reality is that the euro area economy continues to struggle under the weight of the coronavirus crisis and the ECB cannot afford to delay additional stimulus. </p> </blockquote> <p>Focus is also on whether the bank will expand purchases to include \u201cfallen angels\u201d - companies that have lost their investment-grade ratings during the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>That would give the ECB more room for manoeuvre and help parts of the economy that might need it more.<br></p> <h2>Thoughts on the eurozone\u2019s fiscal stimulus<br></h2> <p>The EU is wending its way towards a recovery fund to pull together governments across the bloc into a massive fiscal stimulus. But with sensitivities around the politics of risk sharing (opposed by some northern European countries), Lagarde has a delicate balance to strike.<br></p> <p><strong>Commerzbank </strong>told clients that the desire to keep pressure up on governments could lead to the ECB delaying its QE announcement:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It will be a very close call with the hawks potentially swaying a consensus-minded President Lagarde to defer the announcement, also to keep pressure on the politicians to deliver on the EU Commission\u2019s \u20ac750bn Next Generation EU Fund. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Paul Donovan</strong>, an analyst at investment bank <strong>UBS</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>ECB President Lagarde will be happy that someone is doing fiscal stimulus (as the pandemic is a problem for fiscal policy, not central bank policy). Today\u2019s meeting should continue to emphasise the need for quantitative policy to support financial markets and ensure sufficient liquidity in the economy. <br></p> </blockquote> <h2>Updated economic forecasts</h2> <p>Everyone and their dog knows that the eurozone economy is in recession, but the question is how deep is it. </p> <p>Lagarde has already dismissed the \u201cmild\u201d scenario of a 5% fall in output this year. That leaves a decline of between 8% and 12% in GDP - twice as deep as after the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>If inflation forecasts are also weak that would support the case for more stimulus from the ECB.<br></p> <h2>The German court ruling</h2> <p>Looming over the ECB\u2019s bond purchases is the German constitutional court ruling that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/05/jolt-to-eurozone-as-german-court-warns-against-central-bank-stimulus\">may have exceeded its mandate</a> by directly financing government spending. The Karlsruhe court said the ECB must carry out a \u201cproportionality assessment\u201d within three months in its 5 May ruling.<br></p> <p>Lagarde has insisted the ruling will leave the bank \u201cundeterred\u201d in battling the crisis. Acting now could make it less likely that any support is withdrawn at a later date.<br></p> <p>Principal\u2019s Shah said:<strong><br></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Close attention will also be paid to any hints that that last month\u2019s German Constitutional Court ruling will tie the ECB\u2019s hands in future, with the euro\u2019s longest winning streak in six years at risk. A defiant tone, dispelling those concerns, would serve Lagarde \u2013 and the euro \u2013 well. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed8bab08f082107f453a86f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T09:27:47.776Z\">10.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There is some interesting detail on the Bank of England\u2019s response to the pandemic on financial markets in a <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2020/andrew-hauser-speech-hosted-by-bloomberg-via-webinar\">speech just published by Andrew Hauser</a>, the executive director for markets at Threadneedle Street.</strong></p> <p> While a lot ofthe speech is backward-looking at the big moments of the crisis, Hauser said that \u201cfurther financial instability cannot be ruled out\u201d as the pandemic\u2019s effects continue to be felt on markets.

      "bodyText": "British pharma giant AstraZeneca announced it would now be able to supply more than two billion doses of its potential coronavirus vaccine, thanks to a string of manufacturing deals The Bank of England published a list of the large companies who have borrowed government-backed loans through its Covid corporate finance facility (CCFF) so far. It included a raft of household names including Tottenham Hotspur, easyJet, Nissan, Marks &amp; Spencer, Greggs and Burberry The European Central Bank unveiled a new \u20ac600bn bond buying programme, in a larger expansion of stimulus measures than many investors had expected. It came as ECB president Christine Lagarde said the eurozone was experiencing an unprecedented slump On the other side of the Atlantic, another 1.88m Americans made jobless claims during the week of 30 May. That was above the 1.8m expected by economists on average UK car sales halved due to the coronavirus lockdown, with just over half a million registrations in the first five months compared with more than one million at this point last year Meanwhile, the UK construction industry experienced its third worst month for production on record. The construction PMI rose from its record low of 8.2 in April to 28.9 in May, according to data firm IHS Markit That\u2019s all from us today. We\u2019ll be back from 8am tomorrow. Thank you for reading and stay safe -KM A final question from Bloomberg, on whether AstraZeneca is looking at further partnerships to help manufacture even more than 2 billion doses. AstraZeneca\u2019s boss says they will continue looking at this over the next two months, but says it would make sense for society to bet on two to three different other solutions \u2018not just our vaccine.\u2019 He expects other vaccines to also pop up, since they\u2019re not sure which one will work. He mentions another potential Covid-19 vaccine being developed by rival Pfizer, for example. He\u2019ll certainly look at additional capacity, but at 2 billion doses, Soriot says he thinks they\u2019re already making a big impact. This is what a healthy, successful pharma industry can deliver, Soriot says. It means companies are able to step up and come to help. We\u2019re funding this manufacturing at considerable risk, given that trials are still ongoing, Hatchett says. He stresses there is a possibility that the vaccine may not work. If that ends up being the case, manufacturing capacity would still be available and potentially could be redeployed for use by other vaccine manufacturers that use similar production processes. Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca, says he expects to know whether the vaccine works by August. He says there are two timelines, one linked to manufacturing and one around trials. \u2018If everything goes according to our intentions, we should know by August indeed,\u2019 he said. After that, vaccines could start being distributed as early as September, starting in countries including in the UK and US. We are anticipating some bottlenecks, Hatchett admits. Vials, for example, are in short supply. \u2018The more lead time we can have to address this incredibly complex logistical challenge\u2019 to distribute a vaccine when we have one, the easier it will be, Hatchett says. AstraZeneca\u2019s boss hedges his excitement over the vaccine. \u2018We will give it our best shot and we hope it will work\u2019 he said. AstraZeneca\u2019s chief executive says part of the 1 billion doses to be produced by the Serum Institute will be used in India. The remainder will be put forward for international allocation in a fair manner. Hatchett says health care workers will likely be among the first to receive potential doses of the vaccine. Vulnerable people are also likely to be the first vaccinated, particularly those who are at most at risk of severe impacts from the disease. That includes the elderly and people with medical conditions, including hypertension or diabetes. An allocation scheme is currently being developed, with the help of the WHO, he adds. We\u2019ve now moved onto the Q&amp;A portion of the press conference with AstraZeneca. Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is speaking now. He says the aim is to make sure the firms can get as much vaccine, as possible as quickly as possible, to people who need it globally. The vaccine, he adds, will be the best way to exit the pandemic. He also thanks AstraZeneca for taking steps to assure equitable access to the vaccine. Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca, is holding a press conference on the deal. He says the company is moving as fast as it can on developing the potential vaccine Soriot thanks everyone at CEPI and Gavi and the Serum Inistutue of India for their work. \u201cOur goal is not to leave anyone behind,\u201d he adds. Britain\u2019s AstraZeneca said on Thursday it would now be able to supply more than two billion doses of its potential coronavirus vaccine, thanks to a string of manufacturing deals including one with CEPI, Reuters reports. The company said it reached an agreement worth $750 million with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and Gavi to produce 300 million doses of the shot, AZD1222, and another with the Serum Institute of India to supply one billion doses for low and middle-income countries. European stock markets have ended the day in the red, according to provisional data at the close: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 dropped 0.66% Germany\u2019s DAX fell 0.5% Spain\u2019s IBEX slid 0.5% France\u2019s CAC 40 fell 0.3% Campaign group Positive Money has accused the Bank of England and Treasury of \u201cpropping up climate criminals and bad bosses with public money,\u201d through the CCFF. The group takes issue with the \u00a31.8bn provided to airlines \u201cwith no conditions attached.\u201d They point out that EasyJet recently is planning to cut 30% of its workforce and that BA is pressing ahead with up to 12,000 job cuts, despite receiving state support. Positive Monday also singled out funding of high-carbon companies, including Baker Hughes (\u00a3600m) and Schlumberger (\u00a3150m). \u201cOther companies with poor social records include G4S, which has accessed \u00a3150m through the CCFF, despite its numerous failings on human rights and delivering on public contracts,\u201d the campaigners added. Positive Money\u2019s executive director Fran Boait said: We really need to ask ourselves whether we should be propping up climate criminals and bad bosses with public money. The government must consider whether conditions which would stop firms laying off workers, avoiding tax, and fuelling the climate crisis, should be applied to these bailouts. We can\u2019t repeat the mistakes of 2008, where the banks got bailed out with no strings attached and the public got sold out. We need to use every opportunity to ensure the recovery from this crisis builds a fairer and greener society. More on Tottenham tapping state-backed loans, from the Guardian\u2019s David Hytner. Tottenham have borrowed \u00a3175m from the Bank of England to help them through the next year or so, as they respond to the financial destruction of the Covid-19 crisis. The club fear that they may lose more than \u00a3200m of revenue in the period from the start of lockdown to June 2021, including broadcast rebates, and they have sought help from the government\u2019s Covid Corporate Financing Facility, which has provided them with the unsecured loan. It is repayable in full next April at a rate of 0.5%, which is low in commercial terms, although Spurs could redraw it for another year. Spurs have been badly hit by the pandemic because they had banked on revenue streams from fans attending various events at their stadium \u2013 and not only football matches. They have had to cancel a rugby union game between Saracens and Harlequins, Anthony Joshua\u2019s world title fight against Kubrat Pulev, two NFL fixtures and England versus Australia in the rugby league Ashes. Concerts from Guns N\u2019Roses and Lady Gaga and the Capital Radio Summertime Ball have also gone. The club\u2019s chairman Daniel Levy said: We have always run this club on a self-sustaining commercial basis. I said as early as 18 March that, in all my 20 years at the club, there have been many hurdles along the way but none of this magnitude \u2013 the Covid-19 pandemic has shown itself to be the most serious of them all. The Bank of England has just published its list of the large companies who have borrowed money under its Covid corporate finance facility (CCFF). There are a lot of household names included, with football club Tottenham Hotspur among the more eye-catching. Some 53 companies have borrowed under the scheme. They will have to repay the loans, but at more favourable terms than would have been available at market rates. Here are some of the biggest names in different industries: Airlines EasyJet (\u00a3600m), a Ryanair subsidiary (\u00a3600m), British Airways (\u00a3300m), Wizz Air (\u00a3300m) Other transport FirstGroup (\u00a3300m), National Express (\u00a3300m), Stagecoach Group (\u00a3300m), Carnival (\u00a325m) Automotive and aerospace JCB (\u00a3600m), Nissan (\u00a3600m), Toyota (\u00a3365m), Rolls-Royce (\u00a3300m), car dealer Inchcape (\u00a3100m), Honda (\u00a375m), aerospace manufacturer Meggitt (\u00a360m), truckmaker Paccar (\u00a3170m) Retail Westfield (\u00a3600m), John Lewis (\u00a3300m), Marks &amp; Spencer (260m), Greggs (\u00a3150m), Asos (\u00a3100m) Other household names Chanel (\u00a3600m), Burberry (\u00a3300m), Intercontinental Hotels Group (\u00a3600m), Tottenham Hotspur (\u00a3175m), the National Trust (\u00a330m) Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG) has confirmed it has begun consultations over redundancies at the 19 hotels in England, Scotland and Wales which it directly manages or leases. IHG is expected to make at least 20 people redundant at each property, which is why it has begun the consultation process, although it does not intend to keep any of the hotels permanently closed. Five of the hotels affected by the planned redundancies are in Scotland and include Kimpton Blythswood Square and Grand Central in Glasgow, as well as Kimpton Charlotte Square, InterContinental The George and Crowne Plaza in Edinburgh. IHG operates around 350 locations in the UK, the vast majority of which are franchises. Bryan Simpson, an organiser for trade union Unite called the proposal \u201cpremature, ill conceived, and unjustified\u201d. A spokesperson for IHG said: This is a very difficult time for our industry, and we have done everything to protect and retain jobs for as long as possible. Most of our hotels in the UK are currently closed and while we are looking forward to welcoming guests back when we can reopen, it will take time for travel and tourism to return to pre-coronavirus levels. The US jobless numbers have weighted down Wall Street, with markets slumping at the open. The S&amp;P 500 lost 0.46%, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.33%, and the Nasdaq lost 0.33%. You may have missed it during the flurry of news from the ECB, but there was more poor data from the US. Another 1.9m Americans claimed jobless benefits during the week of 30 May, taking the total number to an astonishing 42.6m. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy, said: Initial jobless claims fell to 1,877,000 in the week ending May 30th, from 2,126,000, but the pace of decline has begun to stall a little, with claims still at an otherwise unprecedented level. Ashworth expects the US unemployment rate to rise above 20% in data to be published tomorrow. That\u2019s a truly enormous number of people without work - and all in an election year as well. The European commission\u2019s proposal for a pandemic recovery fund should not be seen in isolation, Lagarde says. She does not doubt the determination of European leaders at large to respond to the pandemic, she says. And with a slightly barbed question Lagarde says she will \u201coccasionally take the liberty to read things\u201d from her notes. And with that the press conference is over. Inflation was \u201cclearly in the birth certificate\u201d of PEPP, Lagarde says - after a question on whether it was added as a post-hoc justification of the policy. The purchases were front-loaded as part of its short-term response to the crisis, Lagarde highlights. Asset purchases are needed in all eurozone jurisdictions to support monetary policy, Lagarde says in answer to a question on why German debt was relatively highly represented in recent purchases. On deflation, Lagarde says the ECB has discussed \u201cdisinflation\u201d (which is not quite the same thing), and that is why they have used the most \u201cefficient, effective and flexible\u201d of the tools at her disposal. Lagarde is very firm in expressing confidence that the asset purchase programme is legal, after another question about the German constitutional court ruling. There is broad agreement that the stimulus is perfectly adequate, Lagarde says. Lagarde says the pandemic stimulus has demonstrated that it is a very successful programme. It has prevented a \u201cdownward spiral\u201d in growth and inflation, Lagarde says. Asked whether the ECB has considered junk bonds (those that are not rated as investment-grade), Christine Lagarde said the central bank will continue to observe the situation, but that the monetary policymakers had not discussed it further than that. On the German constitutional court\u2019s ruling against its asset purchases, Lagarde said: \u201cWe have indeed taken note of the judgement... and we are confident that a good solution will be found.\u201d She expects \u201ca good solution that will not compromise the ECB\u2019s independence\u201d, European law, or the primacy of the European Court of Justice, which has ratified the programme. Lagarde says the ECB \u201cstrong welcomes\u201d the European commission\u2019s proposals for a fiscal stimulus through a recovery fund. And now we are into the Q&amp;A. Inflation will decline over the coming months, remaining subdued through to the end of the year, Lagarde says. Lower demand will suppress inflation, and it will only be partially counterbalanced by higher prices from supply constraints, she says. ECB forecasts suggest the annual rate of inflation will be 0.3% in 2020, 0.8% in 2021 and 1.3% in 2022. That would leave it far below the ECB\u2019s 2% inflation target throughout the whole forecast period - suggesting that stimulus will be deemed appropriate for a while yet. Back on Christine Lagarde, the ECB will do \u201ceverything necessary\u201d to support the eurozone economy, she says. There has been some bottoming out of the downturn in May, but growth will start to rebound in the third quarter as lockdown restrictions ease, she says. However, the pace of recovery is very uncertain, she says. New ECB forecasts suggest that annual GDP growth will fall by 8.7% in 2020 and rebound by 2021 to 5.2%, followed by 3.3% in 2022. Risks around that forecasts are biased to the \u201cdownside\u201d, she says. Breaking off briefly from the ECB, another 1.88m Americans made jobless claims during the week of 30 May. That was above the 1.8m expected by economists on average. US stock market futures have been dented by the data. European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde says the eurozone is experiencing an unprecedented slump. The pandemic has created an unprecented contraction, Lagarde says. There has been a significant fall in spending from consumers and businesses. There are some signs of the slump \u201cbottoming out\u201d but they are \u201ctepid\u201d compared to the pace of the slump. There will be a \u201cgradual reopening\u201d, she says. You can watch Christine Lagarde speak here: More investors react: Neil Williams, senior economic adviser to the international business of Federated Hermes, said: The ECB is turning up its monetary hose. Extending and ramping-up its asset purchases by \u20ac600bn means it can continue running QE in 2021 at over \u20ac100bn per month. This is way up on the \u20ac20bn run-rate pre-virus, and even the \u20ac80bn during its own, 2015 euro-crisis. Hopefully, with flexibility pledged on issuers\u2019 buying limits, there won\u2019t be too much push-back from the Governing Council and Germany\u2019s Constitutional Court. After lagging the US and UK, the fiscal box is now opening. Further budget amendments in Germany, France, and Italy suggest they\u2019ll have to \u2018stomach\u2019 2020 deficits closer to the European Commission\u2019s projected 7.0%, 9.9%, and 11.1% of GDP. Most telling of all are efforts to push through the \u20ac750bn \u2018Recovery Fund\u2019, targeting grants and loans toward most affected euro members. While controversial to those wary of debt-sharing, in practice, highly indebted members like Italy and Greece, vulnerable to rising debt-service costs, have especial interest in resisting a volte face that destabilises the euro. Marchel Alexandrovich, senior European financial economist at Jefferies, said: This response shows the scale of the challenge facing the ECB to get the economy through this recession and to get inflation back up to 2%. There were no adjustments to the composition of its Corporate Bond Purchase Programme, or changes to the tiering multiple applied to bank deposits. But in the Q&amp;A, expect Lagarde to be extremely dovish, to focus on the downside risks to the outlook and to stress that all options in terms of future policy moves remain very much open. Hinesh Patel, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, said: While it is no surprise to see interest rates left untouched, we were expecting less of an increase in the pandemic bond buying programme given economies across Europe are beginning to reopen and the worst of the crisis appears to be in the rear-view mirror. Needless to say this should be another positive for risk assets, at a time when equities in particular have already rallied strongly from their lows in March. Investors will be watching Europe with interest going forward as valuations remain on the cheaper side compared to other regions and remains under-owned by international investors. If Christine Lagarde continues to placate big businesses\u2019 borrowing costs like this, we should see a positive return environment for investors as the economy gets going again. What a (actually relatively small) difference \u20ac600bn makes: the before and after pictures show European stock markets pushing into the green. However, the euro is giving up some of its snap gains - although it is still up by 0.1% for the day against the US dollar. We will see how it fares during Christine Lagarde\u2019s press conference, in a few minutes. Former ECB vice-president Vitor Const\u00e2ncio appears to approve of the central bank\u2019s move, describing it as \u201cahead of the curve\u201d. Some early reactions from economists to the larger-than-expected stimulus. Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany, said: An increase of the PEPP programme by 600bn euro and the reinvestment of the PEPP proceeds underlines the ECB\u2019s determination to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019. Today\u2019s decision should dent any future speculation about whether or not the ECB is willing to play its role as the lender of last resort for the Eurozone. Similar sentiments from Mohamed El-Erian, the influential chief economic adviser at Allianz, the insurer: Viraj Patel, a global macro strategist at Arkera, said: Here is the move from the euro after the announcement, as traders appeared to welcome the support for the eurozone economy (even if looser monetary policy should theoretically dent the currency: And here is the move in Italian bond yields. Clearly investors believe the ECB is saying that it won\u2019t let Italian borrowing costs to spiral out of control. The positive surprise from the ECB has boosted assets across Europe. European stock markets have turned positive after the ECB surprised investors. The Euro Stoxx 600 index, which tracks big companies across the region, has gained 0.1%. Bank shares have been boosted as well. The euro has also reversed its earlier losses against the US dollar: one euro now buys $1.1260, a gain of half a cent from earlier. European government bond yields have also fallen, with Germany\u2019s 10-year Bund yield down by 0.02 percentage points to 0.36%. Yields move inversely to prices, so the rise indicated increased demand for the debt. Italian government bond yields also fell strongly, down 0.15 percentage points to 1.4%, the lowest since 30 March. There are six points in the European Central Bank\u2019s announcement. Here is a summary: Another \u20ac600bn (\u00a3536bn) in bond purchases, taking the pandemic emergency purchase programme up to \u20ac1.35tn. Purchases will take place until at least the end of June 2021, or until the \u201ccoronavirus crisis phase\u201d is over. The stock of assets bought will not shrink until at least the end of 2022. Purchases will continue at a monthly pace of \u20ac20bn, plus another \u20ac120bn spread out until the end of the year. The balance sheet of assets bought will not shrink until the ECB starts to raise interest rates - suggesting the stimulus measures will be in place until there truly is a proper recovery. Key interest rates remained unchanged. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively. The expansion of bond purchases means the total pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) will be worth \u20ac1.35tn - a massive stimulus. The ECB\u2019s governing council, which controls monetary policy, said: In response to the pandemic-related downward revision to inflation over the projection horizon, the PEPP expansion will further ease the general monetary policy stance, supporting funding conditions in the real economy, especially for businesses and households. The purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. This allows the governing council to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy. Interest rates remained unchanged, as expected by analysts. The full ECB announcement can be read here. The European Central Bank has unveiled a new \u20ac600bn bond buying programme, in a larger expansion of stimulus measures than many investors had expected. Purchases will continue until the end of June 2021, the ECB said in a statement. Analysts had expected \u20ac500bn in quantitative easing stimulus. More details to follow. A quick note before the ECB announcement: the UK\u2019s Office for Budget Responsibility has revised down the cost of the job retention scheme: A quick look at US stock market futures suggests that the negativity is going to spread across the Atlantic. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both suggest stocks will fall by 0.4%, although the Nasdaq is set for a more comfortable time, declining by only 0.2%. The FTSE 100 has been the strongest performer of large European indices so far on Thursday morning, down by 0.3%. Stock markets in France, Germany and Italy are down by between 0.8% and 1% as we await the European Central Bank\u2019s latest monetary policy decision at 12:45pm BST. The euro has fallen by 0.3% against the US dollar at $1.1205, while it is flat against the pound. The European Central Bank is widely expected to extend its huge quantitative easing programme as it tries to stimulate the economy. The initial interest rate announcement is due at 12:45pm BST, with ECB president Christine Lagarde to address the press conference in Frankfurt at 1:30pm BST. Here are some of the things to look out for: Bond purchase increases Quantitative easing was the centrepiece of the ECB\u2019s initial response to the pandemic, with \u20ac750bn in bond buying announced on 18 March. The question today is whether it will be expanded or whether the central bank will hold fire until July. Many analysts expect the ECB to up buying by \u20ac500bn, as purchases at their current rate are expected to run out by October. Derek Halpenny, head of research at MUFG, an investment bank, said: We think today is the day in which the ECB needs to reinforce the perception of European authorities finally getting to grips with the scale of the Covid-19 hit with further QE action. A failure to act today would imply consideration is being given to only running the program until September which would result in considerable anxiety amongst investorsthat would result in an immediatetightening of financial market conditions. Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said: Despite the ECB only having spent a third of the \u20ac750bn [Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme], anything less than a \u20ac500bn expansion will be a disappointment and could undo the recent weeks of market strength. Although equity markets seem to believe a V-shaped economic recovery is underway, the reality is that the euro area economy continues to struggle under the weight of the coronavirus crisis and the ECB cannot afford to delay additional stimulus. Focus is also on whether the bank will expand purchases to include \u201cfallen angels\u201d - companies that have lost their investment-grade ratings during the coronavirus crisis. That would give the ECB more room for manoeuvre and help parts of the economy that might need it more. Thoughts on the eurozone\u2019s fiscal stimulus The EU is wending its way towards a recovery fund to pull together governments across the bloc into a massive fiscal stimulus. But with sensitivities around the politics of risk sharing (opposed by some northern European countries), Lagarde has a delicate balance to strike. Commerzbank told clients that the desire to keep pressure up on governments could lead to the ECB delaying its QE announcement: It will be a very close call with the hawks potentially swaying a consensus-minded President Lagarde to defer the announcement, also to keep pressure on the politicians to deliver on the EU Commission\u2019s \u20ac750bn Next Generation EU Fund. Paul Donovan, an analyst at investment bank UBS, said: ECB President Lagarde will be happy that someone is doing fiscal stimulus (as the pandemic is a problem for fiscal policy, not central bank policy). Today\u2019s meeting should continue to emphasise the need for quantitative policy to support financial markets and ensure sufficient liquidity in the economy. Updated economic forecasts Everyone and their dog knows that the eurozone economy is in recession, but the question is how deep is it. Lagarde has already dismissed the \u201cmild\u201d scenario of a 5% fall in output this year. That leaves a decline of between 8% and 12% in GDP - twice as deep as after the 2008 financial crisis. If inflation forecasts are also weak that would support the case for more stimulus from the ECB. The German court ruling Looming over the ECB\u2019s bond purchases is the German constitutional court ruling that it may have exceeded its mandate by directly financing government spending. The Karlsruhe court said the ECB must carry out a \u201cproportionality assessment\u201d within three months in its 5 May ruling. Lagarde has insisted the ruling will leave the bank \u201cundeterred\u201d in battling the crisis. Acting now could make it less likely that any support is withdrawn at a later date. Principal\u2019s Shah said: Close attention will also be paid to any hints that that last month\u2019s German Constitutional Court ruling will tie the ECB\u2019s hands in future, with the euro\u2019s longest winning streak in six years at risk. A defiant tone, dispelling those concerns, would serve Lagarde \u2013 and the euro \u2013 well. There is some interesting detail on the Bank of England\u2019s response to the pandemic on financial markets in a speech just published by Andrew Hauser, the executive director for markets at Threadneedle Street. While a lot ofthe speech is backward-looking at the big moments of the crisis, Hauser said that \u201cfurther financial instability cannot be ruled out\u201d as the pandemic\u2019s effects continue to be felt on markets. He said: Financial markets could come under strain again, if there is another leg to the global infection cycle, or if economic data come out persistently worse than expected. And even if \u2013 as hoped \u2013 we escape that, the sheer scale of our interventions means we must, in time, ask ourselves hard questions about the financial markets we rely upon, and their potential to amplify the sort of \u2018dash for cash\u2019 we saw in March and April. Hauser said the sudden pre-lockdown \u2018dash for cash\u2019 was the \u201cbiggest test of core market functioning and resilience since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008-9.\u201d He tells of his experience watching a \u201cdoom loop\u201d on Treasuries markets as investors scrambled for cash, emergency talks with the Federal Reserve about the enormous dollar swap lines designed to make sure there was enough cash in the financial system, and the near breakdown of the UK gilt market. The speech also contained a handy guide to what the BoE has done during the crisis, and how it compares throughout more than 300 years of history: There was also a rapid drop in new orders received by UK construction companies, which was almost exclusively attributed to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Residential builders did slightly better during May than civil engineers or office builders, but the reading for that segment was still only 30.9. IHS Markit said: Around 64% of the survey panel reported a drop in construction activity during May, while only 21% signalled an expansion. Where growth was reported, this was mostly attributed to a limited return to work on site following shutdowns in April. In bad news for the economy as the government signals the end of the furlough scheme (paying workers\u2019 salaries), there were \u201cwidespread reports that redundancies would have been far more severe without the use of the government\u2019s jobs retention scheme\u201d. Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said: A gradual restart of work on site helped to alleviate the downturn in total UK construction output during May, but the latest survey highlighted that ongoing business closures and disruptions across the supply chain held back the extent of recovery. It seems likely that construction activity will rebound in the near-term, as adaptations to social distancing measures become more widespread and the staggered return to work takes effect. However, latest PMI data pointed to another steep reduction in new orders received by UK construction companies, with the pace of decline exceeding the equivalent measures seen in the manufacturing and service sectors. The crisis hitting the UK construction industry eased slightly in May, but the sector still saw its third-worst month recorded by a closely followed survey. The construction purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) rose from its record low of 8.2 in April to 28.9 in May, according to data firm IHS Markit. Any figure below 50.0 indicates an overall decline in output, so 28.9 is still a severe recession for the sector. The pandemic prompted the closure of sites across the country in late March. Although many returned to work through April and May, the disruption and the expectation of a worsening economy have struck the sector down. Young\u2019s pub chain intends to open all of its 276 sites by the 3 August, and is hopeful the business can \u201cbounce back\u201d once its pubs are allowed to reopen, but expects trading to be \u201cmaterially below average\u201d for the rest of the year. The company reported a \u00a313m shortfall in revenue and \u00a37.7m impact on profits due to declining trade and the 10 days of closure due to the lockdown which were covered by this trading year, which ran for 52 weeks until 30 March. The company\u2019s chief executive Patrick Dardis welcomed the government\u2019s business rates holiday, which he says will save Young\u2019s \u00a314.5m. Another interesting detail from the SMMT data: Tesla\u2019s Model 3 was the most popular car during May. That is mainly because Tesla does not rely on car showrooms to anywhere near the extent of traditional car manufacturers. However, it also illustrates the progress being made by battery electric cars, which have continued to grow strongly even during the pandemic. Battery electric car sales are up by 131% for the first five months of the year, while pure internal combustion engine (ICE) sales are sharly down. Mild hybrids though are also on the increase - they combine a small battery with an ICE, so are still relatively polluting. However, battery sales still only account for 1 in every 25 car purchases in the UK. The UK car market has halved compared to last year as the coronavirus crisis hits, with just over half a million registrations in the first five months compared with more than one million at this point last year. UK new car registrations fell -89.0% in May to their lowest level for the month since 1952, according to figures published today by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Some 20,247 cars were registered in the month, as \u201cclick and collect\u201d services, allowed from mid-month, saw some movement in the market, the trade body said. That was an improvement from the 4,321 sold in April, but still 163,477 fewer than in the same month last year. Battery electric vehicles were the only segment in which sales improved - albeit from a low base - with 429 more units registered year-on-year as pre-orders of the latest premium models were delivered to customers. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: After a second month of shutdown and the inevitable yet devastating impact on the market, this week\u2019s re-opening of dealerships is a pivotal moment for the entire industry and the thousands of people whose jobs depend on it. Customers keen to trade up into the latest, cutting-edge new cars are now able to return to showrooms and early reports suggest there is good business given the circumstances, although it is far too early to tell how demand will pan out over the coming weeks and months. Restarting this market is a crucial first step in driving the recovery of Britain\u2019s critical car manufacturers and supply chain, and to supporting the wider economy. Ensuring people have the confidence to invest in the latest vehicles will not only help them get on the move safely, but these new models will also help address some of the environmental challenges the UK faces in the long term. Just when you thought you were out, Brexit drags you back in - that seems to be the view of foreign exchange analysts on the future prospects for sterling, which is under pressure this morning. The pound had hit a one-month high of $1.2615 against the US dollar on Wednesday, but fell by 0.5% on Thursday morning back to $1.2517. Even as economists weigh economic prospects, there is very little time left for the UK to agree a wide-ranging free-trade agreement with the EU, extend the transition deal before the June deadline, or come up with a compromise of some sort. That is weighing on the pound. This is from the report by the perfectly named Jonathan Cable, from Reuters: Sterling will lose recent gains against the dollar and weaken further if Britain does not ask for an extension to its Brexit transition period by a June 30 deadline to allow more time for talks on a trade deal with the EU, a Reuters poll found. [...] \u201cThe fading prospect of an extension to the post-Brexit transition period, and the risk of supply chain disruption at the start of 2021, casts a cloud over (Britain\u2019s) GBP outlook,\u201d said James Smith at ING. \u201cBrexit is back in the spotlight. There\u2019s little to suggest we should expect any real progress, and that\u2019s one reason why we\u2019ve seen some risk premium creep back into the pound.\u201d The pound is expected to have weakened to $1.23 by end-June, according to the wider poll of over 50 foreign strategists taken this week. Car dealer Lookers, which today announced plans for 1,500 job cuts, was in trouble well before the pandemic struck, with a fraud investigation and plans to close dealerships. The Covid-19 crisis has hurt it further. It will close 12 dealerships as it returns to selling and servicing vehicles after the coronavirus shutdown, writes the Guardian\u2019s Joanna Partridge. The group, which operates 164 car dealerships, says the latest redundancies are needed to protect the long-term future of the business and it hopes to save \u00a350m a year from the job cuts. It will begin consultations on the redundancies shortly, which will reduce its workforce by almost 20%. You can read the full report here: The FTSE 100 is on track for its first decline this week. It had been buoyed earlier in the week by optimism that the world economy will recover from the pandemic faster than previously thought. However, the early selling pressure has eased somewhat, with stocks down by 0.2% on the blue-chip index. The FTSE 100 may have been helped by the weak pound, which is down by 0.4% this morning against the US dollar, trading at $1.2522. Weaker sterling flatters the earnings of FTSE 100 companies who make the majority of their revenues in other currencies. The FTSE 100 has lost 0.45% in early trade, mirroring downward moves on stock markets across Europe. Germany\u2019s Dax lost 0.7% at the open, France\u2019s Cac 40 lost 0.6% and Spain\u2019s Ibex lost 0.9%. Good morning, and welcome to our live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets. Every aspect of the car industry has been hit hard by the pandemic, with showrooms lying idle for weeks (until Monday in England) and factories shutting their gates because of health fears and parts shortages. The latest updates show that the pain is only starting to be felt in the UK. UK car sales in May were about 90% below their level at the same point in 2019, according to new preliminary data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Preliminary figures (ahead of the final release at 9am) showed that around 20,000 new cars were registered last month, up from just 4,321 in April but just a fraction of the 183,724 sold in May 2019. The weak sales show why the industry is pulling back, with two major rounds of job cuts announced this morning. Aston Martin has said 500 workers will lose their jobs, the embattled sportscar manufacturer said, as it seeks to cut costs under new chief executive Tobias Moers. The cuts reflect \u201clower than originally planned production volumes and improved productivity across the business\u201d, the company said. The redundancies will cost \u00a312m but will be part of \u00a328m in savings. Lookers, the car dealer struggling with a fraud investigation and the terrible operating environment, will cut 1,500 jobs. The company\u2019s board \u201cregrettably considers this action as being necessary in the current environment to sustain and protect the Lookers business over the long term\u201d, it said. Lookers hopes to save \u00a350m through the job cuts. The one-off cash restructuring cost will be about \u00a39m. Looking ahead, the main economic event of the day will be the European Central Bank\u2019s latest monetary policy decision - expect much more on that here throughout the day.

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Fund unveiled to access potential Covid-19 vaccine A $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) fund aimed at ensuring that poorer countries can access doses of a potential coronavirus vaccine has been unveiled at a virtual summit hosted by the UK. The announcement was made at the third Gavi vaccine alliance replenishment summit, a virtual pledging event that raised $8.8bn, above the target of $7.6bn, to immunise 300 million children against infectious diseases like polio, diphtheria and measles within five years. Face coverings to be compulsory on public transport in England Grant Shapps, the UK\u2019s transport secretary, has announced that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in England from 15 June. He added that people can be refused permission to travel if they do not comply and could be fined. Low Covid-19 figures for Africa \u201cbroadly accurate\u201d \u2013 WHO The World Health Organization\u2019s director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, has said current statistics for the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the continent are broadly accurate, amid concerns that low levels of testing, poor infrastructure and a lack of cooperation from some governments may have been disguising the true extent of the disease\u2019s spread. There are around 162,622 confirmed cases in Africa, with 4,604 deaths. US pandemic jobless claims pass 42 million Another 1.9 million people filed for unemployment benefits in the United States last week as the total number of claims passed 42 million since the coronavirus pandemic hit. The pace of layoffs has slowed dramatically from its peak of 6.6m a week at the start of April, as states begin to relax quarantine orders, and last week was the ninth consecutive week of declines in new claims. But the scale of layoffs remains high. Iran reaches new peak in coronavirus transmission Health authorities in Iran have reported 3,574 new cases of coronavirus, the highest daily count since the outbreak began in the country in February. The previous high of 3,186, recorded on 30 March, was surpassed on the fourth consecutive day of daily caseloads that have topped 3,000. Bastille Day military parade cancelled in France Authorities in France have cancelled the 2020 Bastille Day military parade due to physical distancing requirements. Rather than the traditional march of soldiers and military hardware down the Champs-Elysees on 14 July, there will be a smaller ceremony at the Place de la Concorde, the presidency said. Spain hoping to welcome British tourists on 1 July Spain wants to welcome British tourists back as soon as its airports reopen to foreign visitors on 1 July, but has warned much will depend on the UK\u2019s 14-day coronavirus quarantine for those returning from abroad and on the British authorities rescinding advice on non-essential foreign travel. Spain\u2019s tourism minister, Mar\u00eda Reyes Maroto, said the country will begin hosting foreign visitors from 22 June, when the current state of emergency ends and land borders with France and Portugal reopen. Sweden eases domestic travel restrictions Restrictions on domestic travel will be eased in Sweden from 13 June, the prime minister, Stefan L\u00f6fven, has said, despite signs that coronavirus infections are increasing in parts of the country. With the number of deaths and people treated at intensive care falling, L\u00f6fven said that Swedes who were symptom-free could now plan visits to their summer cottages or relatives in other parts of the country. Norway bars George Floyd protests over Covid-19 fears Activists in Norway have been refused permission to hold solidarity rallies in support of protests in the US over the police killing of George Floyd, because of fears of the spread of coronavirus. Mohamed Awil, the president of the African student association UiO, said rallies had been planned in Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim, but local authorities said they could not allow more than 50 people to gather in one place without a dispensation from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. New Zealand says it will eliminate coronavirus by 15 June New Zealand has a date for when it will achieve its goal of elimination of Covid-19: 15 June. On Thursday, health officials announced they had found no new cases of the virus for the 13th straight day, from thousands of tests.",

The departmental pushback has come in responses to questions on-notice from the Senate committee examining the government\u2019s response to the pandemic. Controversy has been escalating about the potential for conflicts of interest among the commissioners handpicked by the prime minister to provide advice at the height of the coronavirus crisis. The high-powered coordination commission, headed by the former Fortescue Metals chief Nev Power, has a broad remit, advising the government on all non-health aspects of its pandemic response. But concerns have been raised about the lack of transparency of the group\u2019s deliberations, and the absence of a conventional governance framework for a taxpayer-funded enterprise. The NCCC has a budget of more than $5m, and all but one of the commissioners are being paid for their advice. In addition to Power, the commissioners are Greg Combet, Jane Halton, Paul Little, Catherine Tanna and David Thodey. The leadership position of Power has raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest because the commission has promoted gas development as a key way to boost economic growth after the coronavirus crisis. Guardian Australia last month revealed a leaked draft report by a taskforce advising the NCCC that recommended Australian taxpayers underwrite a massive expansion of the domestic gas industry, although Power has subsequently characterised that report as an early draft. Power has stepped aside from his position as deputy chairman of a gas company, Strike Energy, but the chairman made it clear during an appearance before the Senate committee on Thursday that he had not recused himself from NCCC discussions about developing gas during the Covid recovery. Officials supporting the work of the commissioners have told the Senate committee all commissioners are required to make disclosures about potential conflicts of interest given many are company directors. Commissioners are required to declare conflicts at the start of every meeting, and in addition to the standard declaration, commissioners had to disclose more specific conflicts as they worked through proposals. In response to follow-up questions from the Senate committee, officials from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet say each member has provided a written declaration to the department in confidence, recording their private interests, and those of their immediate family members. The declarations have been shared among the commissioners \u201cto ensure maximum transparency\u201d. The department says it has identified any significant interests which may give rise to potential conflicts of interest, \u201cand has reminded members to remain alert to discussions to ensure that where a potential conflict might arise, appropriate arrangements can be put in place, such as recusal of specific deliberations\u201d. It says each commission member has provided an undertaking to not use any information that they gain in the course of their official duties as a member of the commission for personal gain. Commissioners have also agreed to refrain from buying, selling or other trading of Australian investments while a member of the commission. But the department is refusing to release the declarations publicly. Morrison\u2019s department told the Senate committee: \u201cCommission members\u2019 declarations are provided in confidence and contain sensitive personal information related to themselves and members of their immediate families \u2013 the disclosure of which may unreasonably infringe the privacy of the individuals concerned\u201d.",

Our health may be under threat and our livelihoods at risk, but we\u2019ve had time to witness wild things, even if just from our bedroom window. Birdwatching, anyone? As restrictions ease we can now plan low-impact wilderness encounters a little further afield \u2013 even with state border closures in place. Spot shy platypuses at Tidbinbilla nature reserve Where: 45-minute drive south of Canberra, not public transport accessible. When: Open now, with some restrictions. Derived from the Ngunnawal word meaning \u201ca place where boys were made men\u201d, Tidbinbilla nature reserve is part of the Australian Alps national parks and includes wetlands, grasslands, forest and woodland sub-alpine habitats. Explore its 22 marked trails to see kangaroos, koalas, platypuses, potoroos, wallaroos, possums, wombats, echidnas, emus, lyrebirds and reptiles and discover its breeding programs for endangered northern corroboree frogs, brush-tailed rock wallabies and eastern bettongs. There are also regular guided activities to learn more about the animals and local Aboriginal culture. Wander under koalas at Wildlife Wonders Where: Near Apollo Bay, a little under three hours\u2019 drive south-west of Melbourne. Public transport is available to Colac (train) or Apollo Bay (train and bus). When: Wildlife Wonders will open for the first time later in spring 2020, follow updates here. Developed by Victoria\u2019s award-winning Conservation Ecology Centre and designed by Brian Massey, landscape designer of New Zealand\u2019s Hobbiton, Wildlife Wonders (opening in the Spring) is a trailblazing ecotourism experience offering thoughtful encounters with the flora and fauna of the Otways region in a natural, feral predator-free setting. Qualified ecologist guides will give wildlife insights as they show visitors koalas dozing in gum trees, potoroos and bandicoots foraging on the ferny forest floors and kangaroos grazing on grasslands overlooking the Southern Ocean. All funds from visits will be invested into local conservation and research programs.

Many fear this year\u2019s commemoration of the events of 4 June 1989 might be Hong Kong\u2019s last, as China has approved a plan to impose national security laws on the semi-autonomous city that would prevent and punish \u201cacts and activities\u201d that threaten national security. The police had for the first time in three decades banned the annual candlelight vigil in Victoria Park, citing the coronavirus pandemic. Unlike past years, no organised ceremony was allowed on Thursday as police refused to give activists a permit. Police loudhailers repeatedly played a message warning people against participating in unapproved gatherings, although only small groups of police stood guard outside the park and did not stop people from entering. Mourners young and old held candle lights and chanted slogans. Unlike past years when they mostly called for the vindication of the 1989 movement, many were shouting slogans calling for independence from China, such as \u201cHong Kong Independence, only way!\u201d, \u201cHong Kong, build our own nation!\u201d and \u201cFree Hong Kong, democracy now!\u201d Some burst into choruses of the unofficial anthem of the anti-government protests: \u201cGlory to Hong Kong.\u201d \u201cWhat happened in Tiananmen showed the true nature of the Communist party,\u201d said Lawrence, a 25-year-old retailer, who said he would not be intimidated by the national security laws. \u201cInstead of being silenced, I\u2019d rather sacrifice myself for freedom. If we have no freedom, it makes no difference whether you\u2019re in jail or not.\u201d Smaller gatherings were held in various spots across Hong Kong on Thursday night. After the ban on the vigil in Victoria Park, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which has organised the vigil for the past 30 years, asked Hongkongers to hold individual commemorations wherever they were in the city. The rallies were largely peaceful, with the exception of the shopping district Mong Kok, where several people were subdued by police after barriers and traffic cones were thrown onto the road. Earlier in the day, Hong Kong\u2019s legislature passed a law criminalising the mockery of China\u2019s national anthem. The law was passed with 41 votes for and one against. Those who were able to vote were largely from the pro-Beijing camp, as pro-democracy lawmakers were taking part in a noisy last-minute protest that meant they could not vote. \u201cA murderous state stinks for ever,\u201d they shouted. The voting took place hastily late on Thursday afternoon after a pause of four hours. An earlier session was suspended after pro-democracy lawmakers Eddie Chu and Ray Chan tried to cause the bill to be delayed by protesting and throwing pungent liquid on the floor. The law prohibits behaviours that \u201cinsult\u201d or misuse the Chinese national anthem, including \u201cpublicly and intentionally\u201d altering its lyrics or score, and playing or singing it in a \u201cdistorted or disrespectful way\u201d. Offences are punishable with a fine of HK$50,000 (\u00a35,150) and up to three years in jail. It also stipulates that the anthem should be included in school education to teach students \u201cthe history and spirit of the national anthem\u201d. Critics fear that the vague definitions of terms like \u201cinsult\u201d and \u201cderogatory\u201d in the legislation could threaten freedom of expression in Hong Kong.

That would be impossible,\u201d said the Democratic Coalition, an opposition party, in a statement. \u201cBut mourning about Trianon can no longer be the focus of Hungarian politics, because, apart from the fact it leads nowhere, it paralyses, makes it incapable of action; it also consumes the moral and political power of the homeland.\u201d</p>",

Signed in the aftermath of the first world war, the treaty still forms a major part of Hungary\u2019s national identity and memories of the harsh settlement have helped fuel the nationalist agenda of the current prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 K\u00f6v\u00e9r, the parliament speaker and a close ally of Orb\u00e1n, said young Hungarians should \u201cengrave in their hearts and minds\u201d the lessons of Trianon. \u201cWe Hungarians can\u2019t change the past, we can only change its most painful consequences,\u201d he said, in a special parliamentary session devoted to the anniversary. The treaty, formalised on 4 June 1920, was one of several signed after the first world war and imposed by the victorious allies on the defeated Central Powers. It stripped Hungary of three-fifths of the territory, and two-thirds of the population, it had controlled as part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. \u201cTrianon \u2013 the word and the subject matter \u2013 has been stirring passions in our country for a hundred years,\u201d said G\u00e1bor Koltay, the director of a rock opera about Trianon that premiered in Budapest two years ago. A huge monument to \u201cnational solidarity\u201d constructed near Hungary\u2019s parliament in central Budapest was to be unveiled on Thursday, but the ceremony was postponed due to coronavirus restrictions. It bears the Hungarian name of every settlement in \u201cGreater Hungary\u201d, the majority of which are now situated in neighbouring countries. \u201cTrianon trauma\u201d is felt across the political spectrum in Hungary, but Orb\u00e1n has harnessed these feelings during the past decade and used them in his quest to show Hungary as a resurgent nation, and to keep out migrants and supposed \u201cglobalist influences\u201d. While never speaking directly about reclaiming lost territory, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government has made Hungarian minority populations in neighbouring countries a cornerstone of its foreign policy, pumping money into cultural centres, media outlets, churches and football clubs in the region and handing out Hungarian passports to those who want them. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Hungarians have taken up the offer, and the vast majority have cast votes for Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party, cementing its control over Hungarian politics. Last month, Orb\u00e1n caused consternation in a number of regional capitals by posting a map of historical Hungary on his Facebook page as part of a post wishing students good luck with their history exams. Slovenia\u2019s president, Borut Pahor, expressed \u201crejection and concern\u201d over the map. The rights of Hungarian minorities have caused tension in relations with both Romania and Ukraine in recent years. Opposition politicians have also condemned Trianon as unfair but said that, 100 years later, the discussion should move on. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to forget Trianon. That would be impossible,\u201d said the Democratic Coalition, an opposition party, in a statement. \u201cBut mourning about Trianon can no longer be the focus of Hungarian politics, because, apart from the fact it leads nowhere, it paralyses, makes it incapable of action; it also consumes the moral and political power of the homeland.\u201d",

Families in England have no access to sanitation, refuse collection, or water for drinking, cooking, showering and washing clothes, the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) for Gypsies, Travellers and Roma (GRT) said in a letter to the Local Government Association. Some local authorities have directed vulnerable Travellers to uncleaned public toilets with no hand-washing facilities, the letter said, while others are attempting to evict camps. It stressed that these basic facilities were needed for communities to physically distance, self-isolate and follow guidelines on hand washing and hygiene. One Irish Traveller, Catherine*, who lives with her sister and two children, aged 12 and two, in south-east England, moved from an overcrowded site because she was worried about the risk of catching the virus from others.

FFT stressed that the majority of people on unauthorised encampments would prefer to be on a site, but are unable to do so because of a chronic shortage of pitches caused by the failure by local authorities to identify land in local plans where Travellers can stop. Alison Blackwood, manager of Southwark Traveller Action Group, has been involved in getting a water stand pipe set up at a Traveller site in Hertfordshire, which had no access to running water. \u201cIt does seem in this day and age, and in the middle of a crisis like this, that for some people not to have access to running water is quite shocking,\u201d she said.

As early as 3 February one of the key bodies advising the government on its approach to tackling the pandemic, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) concluded there was some evidence to support the wearing of masks by those with symptoms to prevent transmission.

The group highlighted the risk that wearing masks could make people feel invincible and therefore be less likely to adhere to other rules around socialising and staying at home. At the time, some also had concerns that recommending the wider use of face masks could exacerbate the acute shortages of PPE among healthcare workers that the UK was grappling with earlier in the pandemic.</p> <h2>Has the science on face masks changed?</h2> <p>Previously, the government has defended its decision not to recommend the use of face masks \u2013 while other countries have urged people to adopt masks \u2013 saying: \u201cFor the majority of people in more general settings, there is little evidence of widespread benefit of using face masks to prevent transmission.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/face-masks-to-be-made-compulsory-on-public-transport-in-england\">Thursday\u2019s announcement</a>, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said: \u201cThe evidence suggests that face coverings offer some, albeit limited, protection against the virus.\u201d</p> <p>So has the science changed? Although there have been concerted efforts to answer the question of whether face masks make a difference, there has not been a dramatic shift in the science: there is some evidence of a benefit, but it remains fairly weak.</p> <p>This week, the Lancet <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext\">published the most comprehensive paper</a> to date on the subject, a systematic review of 172 studies looking at the role of physical distancing measures, face masks, and eye protection to prevent transmission. It found weak support for the use of face coverings, with the risk of infection or transmission when wearing a mask being estimated at 3% versus 17% when not wearing a mask. Evidence in the study was looking mainly at mask use within households, rather than on public transport, and the authors note that the certainty of the evidence is low and other measures, such as physical distancing, are by far the most effective at reducing the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>The science is still uncertain, but as the most robust infection control measures are lifted, the more marginal gains that may be achieved through the use of face coverings may have simply become more relevant.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on&nbsp;5 June 2020 to clarify that the requirement to wear face masks on public transport applies in England, not the UK.</p>",

Previously, the government has defended its decision not to recommend the use of face masks \u2013 while other countries have urged people to adopt masks \u2013 saying: \u201cFor the majority of people in more general settings, there is little evidence of widespread benefit of using face masks to prevent transmission.\u201d In Thursday\u2019s announcement, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said: \u201cThe evidence suggests that face coverings offer some, albeit limited, protection against the virus.\u201d So has the science changed? Although there have been concerted efforts to answer the question of whether face masks make a difference, there has not been a dramatic shift in the science: there is some evidence of a benefit, but it remains fairly weak. This week, the Lancet published the most comprehensive paper to date on the subject, a systematic review of 172 studies looking at the role of physical distancing measures, face masks, and eye protection to prevent transmission. It found weak support for the use of face coverings, with the risk of infection or transmission when wearing a mask being estimated at 3% versus 17% when not wearing a mask. Evidence in the study was looking mainly at mask use within households, rather than on public transport, and the authors note that the certainty of the evidence is low and other measures, such as physical distancing, are by far the most effective at reducing the spread of coronavirus. The science is still uncertain, but as the most robust infection control measures are lifted, the more marginal gains that may be achieved through the use of face coverings may have simply become more relevant. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 June 2020 to clarify that the requirement to wear face masks on public transport applies in England, not the UK.",

      "body": "<p>Ensuring that every passenger on public transport wears a face covering will require a significant change to current behaviour \u2013 and potentially an uphill battle.</p> \n<p>A Guardian survey suggests that fewer than four in 10 people currently wear one, with young and middle-aged men the least likely to use them on trains, buses, trams and the tube.</p> \n<p>The survey of almost 800 travellers in Manchester, Glasgow and London carried out this week found that in some areas as few as 10% of passengers wear face coverings.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"77142d5a-0bf3-4a80-b538-c47a11b57f6a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.</p>\n    <p>The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.</p>\n    <p>The WHO says masks should be made of three layers \u2013 with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It also showed that outside London, the use of face coverings fell dramatically, although most of the public transport used was still quiet, reflecting the current status of lockdown restrictions.</p> \n<p>Of 465 passengers on London tube carriages and buses on a variety of routes on Tuesday , less than a third of men and half of women were wearing face coverings. White men in particular were less likely to cover their faces.</p> \n<p>In Manchester on Wednesday, only 10% of travellers on trams and buses surveyed \u2013 22 out of 212 \u2013 wore face coverings. And on trains and around the subway in Glasgow on Thursday, fewer than one in five \u2013 18 out of 98 \u2013 were wearing face coverings.</p> \n<p>Phoebe, a 20-year-old Chinese student, said she didn\u2019t understand why more people were not wearing face coverings. \u201cI\u2019m staying in London with my grandma while I\u2019m studying here,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put her at risk so I always wear a mask when I travel. Wearing a mask is about being considerate towards others. That takes no effort at all. I don\u2019t understand why some people believe it is not a good idea to wear a mask.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unlike countries such as France, Vietnam and the Czech Republic, where mask-wearing is compulsory in some or all public spaces, the government\u2019s advice has until now appeared hesitant and uncertain.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/09/young-men-more-like-than-women-to-break-lockdown-rules-uk-survey\">Research</a> has shown that young men are more likely to breach lockdown rules than young women - and according to the Guardian\u2019s research, they also seem less likely to wear face coverings than other groups.</p> \n<p>Young and middle-aged white men in London were least likely to be wearing a face covering among those we surveyed, with just 18% wearing them.</p> \n<p>One mask-wearing hospital consultant interviewed by the Guardian while on the tube to work at the Whittington hospital in north London, expressed alarm at the low numbers of people wearing masks while travelling. \u201cIf two people are close to each other on public transport and both are wearing masks the risk of transmitting the virus is reduced by 90% ,\u201d he said. </p> \n<p>The consultant, from an Asian background, condemned the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic as chaotic, saying that it had only recently acknowledged the increased risk the virus poses to black and minority ethnic communities. He said that its refusal to learn from other countries in terms of policies like mask wearing in public was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d.</p> \n<p>Among the 265 men in the London survey 70% \u2013 186 \u2013 were not wearing masks.

      "bodyText": "Ensuring that every passenger on public transport wears a face covering will require a significant change to current behaviour \u2013 and potentially an uphill battle. A Guardian survey suggests that fewer than four in 10 people currently wear one, with young and middle-aged men the least likely to use them on trains, buses, trams and the tube. The survey of almost 800 travellers in Manchester, Glasgow and London carried out this week found that in some areas as few as 10% of passengers wear face coverings. It also showed that outside London, the use of face coverings fell dramatically, although most of the public transport used was still quiet, reflecting the current status of lockdown restrictions. Of 465 passengers on London tube carriages and buses on a variety of routes on Tuesday , less than a third of men and half of women were wearing face coverings. White men in particular were less likely to cover their faces. In Manchester on Wednesday, only 10% of travellers on trams and buses surveyed \u2013 22 out of 212 \u2013 wore face coverings. And on trains and around the subway in Glasgow on Thursday, fewer than one in five \u2013 18 out of 98 \u2013 were wearing face coverings. Phoebe, a 20-year-old Chinese student, said she didn\u2019t understand why more people were not wearing face coverings. \u201cI\u2019m staying in London with my grandma while I\u2019m studying here,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put her at risk so I always wear a mask when I travel. Wearing a mask is about being considerate towards others. That takes no effort at all. I don\u2019t understand why some people believe it is not a good idea to wear a mask.\u201d Unlike countries such as France, Vietnam and the Czech Republic, where mask-wearing is compulsory in some or all public spaces, the government\u2019s advice has until now appeared hesitant and uncertain. Research has shown that young men are more likely to breach lockdown rules than young women - and according to the Guardian\u2019s research, they also seem less likely to wear face coverings than other groups. Young and middle-aged white men in London were least likely to be wearing a face covering among those we surveyed, with just 18% wearing them. One mask-wearing hospital consultant interviewed by the Guardian while on the tube to work at the Whittington hospital in north London, expressed alarm at the low numbers of people wearing masks while travelling. \u201cIf two people are close to each other on public transport and both are wearing masks the risk of transmitting the virus is reduced by 90% ,\u201d he said. The consultant, from an Asian background, condemned the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic as chaotic, saying that it had only recently acknowledged the increased risk the virus poses to black and minority ethnic communities. He said that its refusal to learn from other countries in terms of policies like mask wearing in public was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d. Among the 265 men in the London survey 70% \u2013 186 \u2013 were not wearing masks. The figure for the 192 women surveyed who chose not to wear masks was 100 out of 192 \u2013 52%. A minority of passengers on buses and tubes in London who we surveyed were older people; the vast majority were young and middle-aged. We broke down our data into three ethnic groups \u2013 black, white and Asian. Only 18% of all the 126 white men we observed travelling \u2013 29 \u2013 wore masks, compared with 39% of Asian men \u2013 17 out of 43 and the 29% of black men \u2013 14 out of 48. Frazer Blackley, 55, travelling on London Underground\u2019s Northern Line, said that he did have a mask but didn\u2019t wear it when the tube was quiet, only if it got crowded. One man, a retired psychologist, said he wasn\u2019t convinced of the efficacy of masks, but carried one in his pocket which he put on sometimes \u201cto provide reassurance\u201d to other members of the public. Mask-wearing among women from all ethnic groups was higher than for men and more consistent across ethnic groups with 43% \u2013 48 out of 111 white women travelling \u2013 wearing masks, along with 43% of Asian women \u2013 17 out of 39 \u2013 and 37% of black women \u2013 nine out of 24 women travelling. Of the 212 people surveyed in Manchester, travelling from Whitefield in north Manchester to affluent Didsbury in the south through the city centre and including MediaCity, 190 people from all ages and backgrounds were not wearing face coverings. Of the 22 that did, 13 were men with three appearing to be middle-aged. Of the women surveyed, young white women were the most likely to wear a face covering. In Glasgow, out of 98 travellers, 18 were wearing face coverings, usually ready-made reusable masks rather than scarves or other cloth items. They were worn by an equal number of men and women, and mainly by middle-aged people. Of the travellers observed, the sexes were evenly split; around half were younger people, and the vast majority were white. Of those not wearing masks, similarly around half were younger people and just over half were men. While different scientists have reached different conclusions about the efficacy of masks, the consensus is in favour of mask wearing. Commenting on the findings of the Guardian survey, Prof Trish Greenhalgh from the University of Oxford said: \u201cThe evidence on face coverings is contested but my own interpretation is that is stacks up strongly in favour.

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Alok Sharma, the business secretary, has not yet received the results of his coronavirus test, the PM\u2019s spokesman said.</strong> Sharma was tested after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/business-secretary-alok-sharma-coronavirus-test-speech-commons\">falling ill while delivering a speech to MPs from the dispatch box in the Commons yesterday.</a> The spokesman said that, if Sharma did test positive, he would work with the government\u2019s new test and trace system.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman played down the likelihood of Boris Johnson being asked to self-isolate if Sharma does test positive - even though the two men attended a meeting together yesterday - but did not rule it out</strong>. The 45-minute meeting, which was also attended by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, took place in the cabinet room at No 10. The spokesman said that the meeting, like all meetings at No 10, was \u201cproperly socially distanced\u201d and that the participants stayed more than 2 metres apart. The spokesman said that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works#people-who-develop-symptoms-of-coronavirus\">the test and trace guidance </a>was \u201cnot as simple as saying if you have been in a room with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus you are required to self-isolate\u201d. People have to self-isolate if they have had face-to-face contact, at a distance of less than 1 metre, with someone who tests positive, or if they have spent more than 15 minutes within two metres of that person. But the spokesman did not go as far as saying that he was confident that Johnson would not be asked to self-isolate if Sharma tested positive. Asked if Johnson would comply if he were asked to self-isolate, the spokesman said: \u201cWe would follow the advice given by the medical experts.\u201d The spokesman also said that the cabinet room was \u201cvigorously cleaned\u201d yesterday, but that that was usual practice and happened every day.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Downing Street is not reconsidering the government\u2019s move to abandon virtual sittings of the House of Commons in the light of Sharma\u2019s illness, the spokesman said.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman refused to deny a report on Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches last night saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster?page=with:block-5ed638158f084df971c8e2ac#block-5ed638158f084df971c8e2ac\">Johnson told his Italian counterpart on 13 March that he wanted \u201cherd immunity\u201d.</a></strong> Asked about the report, the spokesman said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The position of the government is that herd immunity has never been its policy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But the spokesman did not deny that Johnson had said the words attributed to him in the programme and, when asked if he was willing to clarify this directly with the PM, he suggested there was no need because he had made the position clear.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said 171,829 tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am yesterday.</strong> But the government had the capacity to carry out 220,213, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman confirmed <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/03/exclusive-tens-thousands-covid-19-tests-voided-decision-send/\">the Telegraph story (paywall)</a> saying that tens of thousands of coronavirus tests were returned void after being sent to a US laboratory for analysis.</strong> He said 67,000 tests had been sent to the US, and 29,500 were returned void.

He said in total 4.2m tests had been carried out.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman denied<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/03/exclusive-hairdressers-could-reopen-month-plans-barbers-stylists/\"> a Telegraph report (paywall) </a>claiming hairdressers in England could be allowed to open as early as 15 June.</strong> He said the ambition was to reopen them from July at the earliest.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman did not challenge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/03/two-in-five-schools-in-england-yet-to-reopen-to-any-more-pupils\">a Guardian report</a> saying that in some areas up to 90% of primary schools remained closed this week, even though schools in England are meant to be reopening for some year groups.</strong> One survey suggests 44% of English primaries remained closed. The spokesman said that what happened this week was \u201cbroadly ... in line with expectations\u201d and that \u201cwe expect that attendance will grow over time\u201d. He said official attendance figures would be published next week.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government has ruled out running the school meal voucher system in England over the summer holidays.</strong> But there will be a \u00a39m programme offering some pupils activities and meals, said the spokesman, who also hinted it might be expanded.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government did not agree with the suggestion from Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, that the Covid-19 virus was man-made.</strong> Dearlove made the claim <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/03/exclusive-coronavirus-began-accident-disease-escaped-chinese/\">in an interview with the Telegraph.</a> \u201cWe have seen no evidence that the virus is man-made,\u201d the spokesman said.

In an email to constituents sent out on Thursday 28 May, after Durham police gave their view, he adopted a tone that was very different from the one taken by Braverman a few days earlier.

That may be because some politicians are calculating that what the public really wants most at the end of all this is not change, but something approximating to what life was like before. Boris Johnson has said nothing at all about how the crisis could be a catalyst for progressive change.

      "bodyText": "Wearing face masks is to be made compulsory on public transport in England from 15 June. The move was welcomed by the unions, with Unite saying this should become the \u201cnew normal\u201d, though Labour said this should have been done two months ago and the government had been far too slow to act. Grant Shapps said he expected the devolved administrations to introduce a similar face covering rule. Earlier today, Nicola Sturgeon said she was considering making the wearing of face masks mandatory on public transport and in shops in Scotland and reminded Scots that this is already advised. The government\u2019s coronavirus economic measures are set to cost \u00a3132.5bn, according to the OBR. That is a rise of 7.5% on estimates made last month on the expected cost of measures including the furlough scheme and grants for the self-employed. The business secretary Alok Sharma received a negative test result for Covid-19. The R number in Scotland has dropped to between 0.7 and 0.9. It was previously between 0.7 and 1. Sturgeon said however that it was \u201cfragile\u201d and stressed the need for caution with easing lockdown measures as new cases continue to be recorded every day. The UK death toll approaches 40,000 as a further 176 fatalities were recorded, bringing the total to 39,904. That\u2019s it from us here in the UK. If you would like to continue following the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. The UK death toll has risen to 39,904, the DHSC said. That is a rise of 176, and just 86 off the 40,000 milestone. There were no new cases of Covid-19 confirmed among prisoners in the most recent 24-hour period, the first time figures have flatlined since the lockdown was announced. As at 5pm on Wednesday, 479 prisoners had tested positive across 79 prisons, marking no change in the previous 24 hours, Ministry of Justice figures show, while the number of infected workers increased by four to 944 across 105 prisons, a rise of less than 0.5%. The figures are not live cases and include those who have recovered. There are around 80,000 prisoners across 117 prisons in England and Wales, and around 33,000 staff working in public sector prisons. At least 23 prisoners and nine staff are known to have died, as well as one prison escort driver and one NHS trust employee working in a secure training centre. The current regime, under which family visits are banned, time spent out of cells reduced to about 30 minutes a day, prison transfers suspended and new arrivals quarantined for 14 days, has been hailed a success by ministers, as deaths and infection rates behind bars have been significantly lower than expected. On Tuesday, the Ministry of Justice unveiled its plan for recovery within the prison estate, with the potential to restart prison visits in July. Labour says the face coverings rule should have been introduced earlier. This is from Jim McMahon, the shadow transport secretary. This is just another example of the government being slow to act. Two months ago, Labour immediately backed the mayor of London\u2019s call for face coverings on public transport to be compulsory. Yet only now Tory ministers are acting. Two months after first raising this with government we are still yet to hear whether drivers will be issued with gloves, masks, and other PPE items as standard, what specification this PPE should be and, if there isn\u2019t sufficient PPE, whether buses should still run. We can\u2019t go on like this. We need a comprehensive transport plan to get our public transport moving, to protect staff and to protect passengers. And this is from Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London. I\u2019m pleased that our lobbying has paid off and the government has finally seen sense and made it mandatory for people to wear face coverings on public transport. This is something I and others have been calling on ministers to do for some time, and is in line with a large body of evidence that they can help stop the spread of coronavirus. I encourage anyone travelling on public transport, or anywhere you can\u2019t keep a safe two metre distance, to wear a face covering, but from Monday 15 June, everyone must wear a covering over their nose and mouth for the entirety of any journeys made using the public transport network. This will be mandatory and will help everyone be safer. Alok Sharma has received a negative result after being tested for coronavirus, his spokeswoman said. She said: Business secretary Alok Sharma has received a negative result after being tested for coronavirus yesterday. Mr Sharma would like to thank the parliamentary authorities and Speaker and also for the kind words from parliamentary colleagues and others who have expressed their well wishes over the last 24 hours. Whilst others raise concerns about potential confusion over face covering guidance in different parts of the UK, Nicola Sturgeon is reminding Scots that the Scottish government already strongly advises their use on public transport and in shops (whereas, the Shapps announcement for England only applies to public transport). There is still some uncertainty about passengers on cross-border trains and buses but in reality the difference between the Scottish and English regimes is a fine. It remains to be seen what difference that extra push makes to commuters, many of whom, anecdotal evidence suggests, remain unwilling to wear face coverings for travel. The unions favour face coverings being made compulsory because ONS figures show that transport workers who have regular contact with members of the public are at particularly high risk of dying from coronavirus. This chart, from this ONS report, shows that bus drivers are more than twice as likely to die from coronavirus as average working-age men. And the Unite union, which represents 80,000 bus workers, has also welcomed the announcement. This is from Bobby Norton, its national officer for public transport. This is the right move from the government. The wearing of face coverings has been shown to reduce transmission of Covid-19. It will improve safety for both drivers and passengers. With no imminent cure for Covid-19 or a vaccine becoming available, the wearing of face coverings on public transport should become the new normal. In the short-term, the government should follow the lead of various parts of Yorkshire and London and impose a reduced maximum capacity on all buses to further reduce the danger of infection. Unite is committed to working with the government and bus operators to ensure that, as infection rates fall and the lockdown further eases and bus usage increases, passengers and drivers are not placed at risk. Trade unions have welcomed the government\u2019s announcement about making the wearing of face coverings compulsory on public transport from 15 June. All three major rail unions are in favour. This is from Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT). The RMT has been campaigning for compulsory wearing of masks on public transport and this is long overdue, but we fear this announcement is being driven not by safety concerns but by the premature easing of the lockdown which is swelling passenger numbers and making social distancing on transport increasingly impossible By themselves, face masks are nowhere near enough to protect passengers and worker safety on public transport. They need to be combined with preventing non-essential travel and compulsory enforcement of two-metre social distancing. This is from Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, which represents train drivers. This is a sensible step by the secretary of state for transport. We have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain\u2019s train, and tube, network is done in a safe and controlled manner - to help spread the loading, and maintain social distancing - for the safety of passengers and staff. The instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network. And this is from Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the TSSA transport union. This is a welcome step by the government which will lower the transmission of this deadly virus among those using public transport in the weeks and months to come. However, it\u2019s also important to stress that people must not interpret the use of a face covering as a licence to breach social distancing measures as lockdown eases. A physical distance of at least two metres between passengers and/or staff must be maintained at all times as this remains the most effective measure to control the spread of Covid-19. Scottish ministers are paving the way for cuts in the size and number of Scotland\u2019s universities and colleges after announcing a review of \u201cfuture provision and sustainability\u201d due to the coronavirus crisis. Richard Lochhead, the Scottish education minister, said he had commissioned the Scottish Funding Council to review the funding, provision and delivery of teaching and research across the higher and further education sectors. He said the SFC, the government agency that funds and polices the country\u2019s colleges and universities, had forecast operating deficits of between \u00a3383m and \u00a3651m in the next academic year due to the lost income from overseas students, rental and research income and the costs of providing socially-distanced teaching. University executives had already expected the SFC to review of the affordability and size of Scotland\u2019s higher and further education sectors, before the pandemic shattered their funding model, with guarantees free tuition for Scottish and EU citizens. The SFC does not fully fund the costs of Scottish and EU places, and expects universities and colleges to cross-subsidise those costs by attracting increasing numbers of overseas and rest of the UK students who are charged full tuition. That overseas market is expected to collapse because of the coronavirus, while the UK government has announced it plans to cap the number of English students allowed to go to Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish universities. UK ministers have also rejected pleas for a multi-billion pound bail-out of universities, intensifying their financial problems. Lochhead said: Our colleges and universities are showing tremendous adaptability and ingenuity in meeting the challenges of Covid-19, yet we know the financial impact could run to hundreds of millions of pounds in lost income. [I] am clear we will need to shift to meet those challenges, so the Scottish Funding Council will look at how its existing models of funding, governance and delivery can exploit new opportunities and continue to support our world class further and higher education systems. Q: Are tourist locations at particular risk from coronavirus when lockdown is relaxed? Shapps says that to answer that question we need to know how the virus will continue to spread. There is a danger of people getting complacent, he says. But the virus is still very much with us. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Q: Why were care home patients discharged from hospitals only tested from mid-April? And why won\u2019t the government release detailed figures for patients going back into care homes? Shapps says a lot of decisions were taken early on. He says a majority of care homes nationwide do not have any cases of covid. In some areas that has not been the case, he says. That will have to be reviewed, he says. He says, overall, the number of care home deaths has been lower than in Europe. Q: What message would you give to people thinking of going to the coast this weekend? And what help are you providing for the hospitality industry? Shapps says the cooler weather will help. But the message remains the same: stay alert means keep 2 metres away from people, he says. As for the hospitality industry, Shapps says the government has stood behind companies. But the best way to help them is by defeating the virus, he says. Q: Has Scotland agreed the use of masks on public transport? Or will passengers have to put them on as they cross the border? Shapps says this is a measure for England. He says it is up to the devolved administrations to decide what they do. He says normally countries decide to move together, so he does not think we will end up with a confusing situation for passengers. Hendy says he would expect passengers to be wearing masks when they get on a train, and again when they get off. Shapps says he expects Scotland and Wales to introduce similar face coverings rule for rail passengers. Shapps says he has spoken to Alok Sharma, the business secretary, this afternoon. He says Sharma has been working from home, and sounded fine. The PM always kept 2 metres away from him, he says. He says Sharma is still waiting for the results of his coronavirus test. And Shapps defends the decision to bring MPs back to the Commons. There is a lot of secondary legislation they need to work on, he says. Q: Bangladeshis in Bradford have been telling us that they are most at risk of dying from coronavirus. What is the specific advice for BME people at risk from Covid-19? Shapps says Public Health England published a report on this yesterday. Kemi Badenoch is leading a review to turn that report into recommendations for action. He says the terms of reference for that have just been published. They are here. Q: Will people be fined if they do not wear face coverings? Shapps says it will be a condition of travel. But other powers will be available. Ultimately people could be fined, he says. But he says he expects fines won\u2019t really be needed. Hendy says the same applied with the alcohol ban on TfL. Asked about quarantine, Shapps says, now that the death numbers have fallen, no one wants to see them go up again. Q: Will rail workers have to police this new face coverings rule? And will people be fined if they don\u2019t comply? Shapps says it will be a condition of travel. The government has worked closely with the unions, he says. He says it is in everyone\u2019s interests to make this work. Hendy says he was transport commissioner for London in 2008 when the ban on alcohol was introduced. The same question was asked. But in fact people complied. He says he expects the same thing to happen here. Shapps says face coverings will be available at stations for people who have forgotten. And volunteers will be there to remind people. Charlotte asks about travel companies refusing to give people refunds for cancelled trips. Shapps says travel companies do have a responsibility to pay the money back. Trading standards can look into breaches, he says. He says he will be encouraging them to pay people back. It is not acceptable for them to just hold on to people\u2019s money, he says. Alex from Canterbury asks what will be done to protect renters from being evicted once the current ban on evictions runs out. Shapps says the government has tried to protect jobs. It wants to get people back into work, he says. He says schemes like the furlough one have some time to run. Shapps says history shows how quickly we can adapt, as we did when trains, cars and planes became available for transport. Now we stand on the verge of a new transport revolution - a green transport revolution, he says. Shapps says a \u00a350 fix-your-bike voucher will be introduced to encourage more people to start using bikes. Shapps says people will be refused travel if they do not comply. But he says he expects most passengers will be happy to comply. Face coverings on public transport will be compulsory from 15 June in England to help stop the transmission of coronavirus as more people go back to work, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has said. The government will require people to wear face coverings on buses, trains, tubes and other modes of public transport from that date, when non-essential shops are likely to reopen. However, it will not apply to people entering shops, despite the current guidance saying face coverings should be worn in enclosed public places. Ministers are bringing in the policy due to concerns about the difficulties of physical distancing on crowded public transport, despite people being asked to use other ways of travelling, to space out, face away from each other and travel at staggered times. A senior government source said it would help stop asymptomatic people passing the virus on to others and also \u201cact as a visible reminder\u201d of the need for distancing and measures like handwashing. Under the conditions of carriage, fines may be imposed for anyone who flouts the new rules. First, if you can work from home, you should do so, Shapps says. If you can\u2019t, you should try to avoid the rush hour, he says. Second, he says from 15 June face coverings will be mandatory on public transport. Many other countries have done this, he says. He says this will apply to buses, trains, aircraft and ferries. Face coverings help protect fellow passengers, he says. Shapps says the road to recovery must be cautiously managed. They must avoid a second spike, he says. He says the government is also encouraging people to use other forms of transport, apart from public transport. But the next easing of restrictions will occur (in England) on Monday 15 June. That will put more pressure on public transport, he says. So today he says he will announce measures to keep people safe. Shapps is here. He starts with the latest slides. Here are the transport use figures. Shapps says he is pleased to see cycling is up. Here are the death figures. He says these figures show that the fight against coronavirus still goes on. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, is taking the UK government\u2019s afternoon press conference. It is due to start very soon. He will be appearing with Sir Peter Hendy, chair of Network Rail. All the media questions today will come from regional journalists, not national ones. More and more people are making living wills in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, a charity has said. Compassion in Dying, which helps people prepare for the end of life, says it has seen a \u201cdramatic surge\u201d in the number of people who want to let relatives know what should happen if they become critically ill. Officials urged people to make sure that living wills were signed, witnessed and copies given to relatives and doctors. Davina Hehir, director of policy and legal strategy at Compassion in Dying, said: Since the coronavirus outbreak, there has been a dramatic surge in people making living wills to refuse certain life-sustaining treatments should they become critically ill with Covid-19 or another illness. We urge those who are sensibly taking the time to consider what they do and do not want at the end of life to ensure that their living will is signed, witnessed and that copies are shared with their loved ones and GP. Charlie Falconer, a former Labour lord chancellor, says that if Suella Braverman, the attorney general, can\u2019t see what was wrong with her pro Dominic Cummings tweet (see 10.34am), she does not understand her job. The Department of Health in Northern Ireland has also published its latest estimate of R, the reproduction number, for Northern Ireland. It is between 0.7 and 0.9 - the same as in Scotland. (See 2pm.) On 12 May, in its plan (pdf) for relaxing the lockdown, the Northern Ireland executive said it then estimated that R was at 0.8. Not much seems to have changed, except that it is now stating the figure with a bit more uncertainty ... Sir Keir Starmer has written an open letter to Boris Johnson challenging him to explain what the UK government is doing to support those Americans protesting against the killing of George Floyd. He asks for information about what concerns have been raised with Washington about the way peaceful protests are being suppressed, as well as for an assurance that exported British riot equipment is not being used by the US authorities in this way. Starmer says: The death of George Floyd has justifiably prompted anger and a burning desire for fundamental change. The UK must be clear in showing that we understand this frustration and that we are ready to stand together with those who seek to tackle the injustice and inequality that remains within all our societies. Black Lives Matter UK has announced a protest in response to Public Health England\u2019s report which confirmed black Britons are up to four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than their white counterparts. Among other causes, the report (pdf) points to socioeconomic deprivation within ethnic minority communities and barriers to accessing healthcare. With many returning to work in the phased reopening of the economy, the campaigners want to know how those most affected, especially black key workers, will be protected. They are demanding that the government investigates the root causes of disparities in health for black people and people of colour and provides a roadmap with individual, community and structural interventions. The campaigners are calling for a doorstep protest, so people who don\u2019t feel comfortable protesting outside due to the pandemic can take part. People will be urged to play Jimmy Cliff\u2019s The Harder They Come at 7pm this evening, with the time slot a reference to the \u201cclap for carers\u201d campaign, since BAME people are overrepresented in the NHS and other essential services. Dr Rochelle Burgess, a PhD lecturer in global health at UCL, said: The findings of the PHE report are not really a surprise to anyone who is a person of colour in this country, or the world. It is painfully clear that none of this data will change without action at an individual level and structural change. Our governments need to do both, and they need to do it now. Birmingham city council has urged demonstrators to keep 2 metres apart during a Black Lives Matter demonstration in the city centre this afternoon. Hundreds have indicated they will attend the rally in Victoria Square from 4pm, including the Aston Villa defender Tyrone Mings. It comes after pockets of protesters clashed with police as thousands of people gathered in central London on Wednesday, and abandoned social distancing, for a BLM demonstration in response to the death of George Floyd in the US. The West Midlands police assistant chief constable, Matt Ward, said: Our aim is to allow and facilitate peaceful protest, and therefore we are not going to stop people coming out on to the streets if they\u2019ve got legitimate concerns they want to share. You can still protest while maintaining social distancing. Birmingham city council said it supports the BLM movement but urged protesters to keep 2 metres apart and stay in groups of six or fewer. Hundreds of on-street parking bays in Glasgow city centre will be suspended to allow 25km of extra space for pedestrians to maintain physical distance. The council has announced the short-term suspension of one-third of the city\u2019s 2,000 on-street parking spaces in order to widen footways, which will be done with funding administered by Sustrans Scotland. Plans are also being drawn up to create park-and-stride and park-and-cycle facilities at satellite car parks in different parts of the city, but there will be no reduction in the number of disabled parking bays in the city centre. The council leader, Susan Aitken, said: The easing of the pandemic lockdown means that repurposing our streets is not just an ambition but a matter of urgency. People need the safe space and confidence to observe physical distancing, get on with their lives and accelerate our recovery. The lives of security guards, cleaners and maintenance workers are being put at risk by the premature reopening of parliament, the prime minister has been told. A union representing more than 800 parliamentary staff has written to Boris Johnson voicing their safety concerns following this week\u2019s return to physical voting and attendance by MPs. The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said the nature of their members\u2019 jobs meant they were more likely to be at risk from Covid-19. The letter said many members had been expected to continue working throughout the crisis without adequate access to PPE and without proper consultation with their employers over their rights at work. The self-isolation of the business secretary, Alok Sharma, after he become unwell in parliament on Wednesday showed how the risk to MPs and all staff remained very high, the PCS said. The general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said in the letter that social distancing and the observing of pathways broke down during voting by MPs earlier this week. Staff believe they (and MPs) are now at increased risk of contracting Covid-19 and this, in turn, is impacting on the mental wellbeing of our members working on the estate. Many people can work from home, but those working as security guards, cleaners, catering staff, do not have the ability to do this. These dedicated workers are on the frontline in parliament and across government departments, putting their lives at risk. We believe parliament has opened too soon and the lives of PCS members, and those of our sister unions, are being put at risk unnecessarily. We would therefore be grateful for your urgent intervention in this matter; the safety of our members and all of those working on and attending the parliamentary estate is paramount. One more person with coronavirus has died in Northern Ireland, taking the total recorded by the Department of Health - a toll primarily accounting for hospital deaths - to 535. There have been another 33 confirmed cases of the virus, bringing the total since the outbreak began to 4,773. NHS England has announced 115 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 27,159. The full figures are here. Of the 115 new deaths announced on Thursday: - 24 occurred on 3 June - 49 occurred on 2 June - nine occurred on 1 June The figures also show 25 of the new deaths took place in May, seven occurred in April, and the remaining one death took place on 20 March. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for postmortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated. The figures published on Thursday by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number of hospital deaths on a single day, with a current total of 899. The government is expected to spend \u00a3132.5bn on coronavirus policy interventions, up 7.5% on previous estimates last month, according to the fiscal watchdog. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said it expects spending on furlough schemes and grants to the self-employed will cost an estimated \u00a3132.5bn in this financial year, rising from \u00a3123.2bn at the last update on 14 May. Officials have previously said the extra spending was helping to partially offset the plunging GDP used to measure growth. The OBR also estimated last month that the deficit could hit \u00a3300bn this year, with a scenario of a three-month lockdown and three months of restrictions being eased. But there are now fears that once the money dries up the UK could face unemployment levels not seen since the 1980s. The OBR said: The government\u2019s economic policy response to the coronavirus crisis ... will have substantial direct budgetary costs. But the measures are designed specifically to support the economy through this temporary shock, and so they should help prevent greater economic and fiscal damage in the long term. It added that the new numbers have been calculated as more data and spending information becomes available, but warns that further updates may be needed. The OBR said it will focus its forecasts on the cash impacts from policies, for example the grants scheme for self-employed workers affected by the lockdown. Longer-term costs to the economy will be factored in at a later date, the OBR said, adding: How the impacts are recorded in the public finances is a matter for the ONS, and that is a further source of uncertainty until those classification decisions are made. Breaking out some of the costing estimates, it said the furlough scheme bill is expected to increase by \u00a34bn compared with last month\u2019s estimates. The gross costs for the furlough scheme is cut from \u00a363bn to \u00a360bn, once the new arrangements are brought in from August under which employers must contribute to furloughed staff bills. But tax receipts from the scheme have been revised down, bringing a net cost of \u00a354bn, compared with \u00a350bn in the previous estimates. A final self-employment grant due to launch in August is also included, bringing the estimated total cost for the payments to \u00a315bn, up from \u00a310.5bn. Other added costs include \u00a3100m for removing import duties on medical products and a further \u00a3100m on bringing VAT for PPE to 0%. All other estimates were left unchanged from the 14 May update. In the Commons the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has approved an emergency debate on how the House of Commons operates during the coronavirus pandemic. It will take place on Monday. The request for the debate was submitted by the Lib Dem MP Alistair Carmichael, who represents Orkney and Shetland. In the debate on the new arrangements on Tuesday, he explained why expecting MPs to attend the Commons in person was so unreasonable for someone with a constituency like his. He said: In order for me to get here today, it required a journey of 18 hours, starting with an aeroplane, a taxi, a normal train and four hours in Edinburgh waiting for a sleeper train that I picked up at 1 o\u2019clock this morning to arrive at Euston at 8am. I cannot and will not do that every week. Apart from anything else, the return journey will be 26 hours long and would require me then to go into self-isolation for 14 days \u2013 the only responsible way to live in a community such as mine. Having come here, I am here for the duration, because I cannot go back until it is safe to my family and my community for me to do so. And, in tweets this afternoon, Carmichael says the illness of Alok Sharma (the SoS in the second tweet below) makes the case for a rethink even stronger. Public Health Wales said a further eight people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths in Wales to 1,379. And another 35 people have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases there to 14,238. At her daily press briefing on Thursday, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that she is considering making the wearing of face coverings mandatory. She said that, while the scientific advice was \u201cnot overwhelming\u201d, she wanted to strongly encourage people to wear face coverings in situations where physical distancing was difficult like in shops and on public transport. The first minister said: Particularly in the future when more people are back at work and using public transport we will want to see people, where they can, wearing a face covering. If we have to change the status of the advice to make that happen then that has clearly got to be something that we are prepared to keep under consideration. She added: I understand why some people may not want to wear face coverings, it\u2019s not the most comfortable thing to do. I\u2019ve been open all along that the scientific advice on this is not overwhelming, but there is a benefit to be had if you wear a face covering in an enclosed space where physical distancing is a bit more difficult that there is some evidence that you wearing a face covering can protect someone else if you have the virus and you are not symptomatic ... [I] really want to strongly encourage people to please consider this very carefully. At her press briefing in Edinburgh Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said that the reproduction number in Scotland, R, has dropped to between 0.7 and 0.9. Previously R (a measure of how widely the virus spreads from an individual) was between 0.7 and 1. Ministers say it is essential that it remains below 1 because above 1 every person infected spreads the virus to more than one other person (to two people if R is at 2 etc). For the UK as a whole the most recent estimate, issued last Friday, is between 0.7 and 0.9. The new Scottish estimate does not take into account the impact of the modest relaxation of lockdown in Scotland, and Sturgeon stressed it was important to remain cautious. She said: I can\u2019t stress enough how fragile it still remains because we are seeing new cases in most health board areas every day. It remains relatively steady which underlines our caution and care which we need to take. Boris Johnson has opened the virtual Gavi global vaccine alliance summit being hosted by the UK. In his speech, he said he hoped it would provide a \u201cmoment when the world comes together - uniting humanity in the fight against disease\u201d. He went on: To defeat the coronavirus we must focus our collective ingenuity on the search for a vaccine and ensure that countries, pharmaceutical companies and international partners - like the World Health Organisation - co-operate on a scale beyond anything we have seen before. We must use the collective purchasing power of Gavi, the vaccine alliance, to make that future vaccine affordable and available to all who need it. If we are to make this the beginning of a new era of global health collaboration, we must also replenish the funding for the vaccines we already have - strengthening the routine immunisation against preventable diseases in the poorest countries. Turning back to Suella Braverman\u2019s comment about her tweet in defence of Dominic Cummings earlier (see 10.34am), these are from Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project. The Downing Street lobby briefing has finished. Here are the main points. Alok Sharma, the business secretary, has not yet received the results of his coronavirus test, the PM\u2019s spokesman said. Sharma was tested after falling ill while delivering a speech to MPs from the dispatch box in the Commons yesterday. The spokesman said that, if Sharma did test positive, he would work with the government\u2019s new test and trace system. The spokesman played down the likelihood of Boris Johnson being asked to self-isolate if Sharma does test positive - even though the two men attended a meeting together yesterday - but did not rule it out. The 45-minute meeting, which was also attended by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, took place in the cabinet room at No 10. The spokesman said that the meeting, like all meetings at No 10, was \u201cproperly socially distanced\u201d and that the participants stayed more than 2 metres apart. The spokesman said that the test and trace guidance was \u201cnot as simple as saying if you have been in a room with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus you are required to self-isolate\u201d. People have to self-isolate if they have had face-to-face contact, at a distance of less than 1 metre, with someone who tests positive, or if they have spent more than 15 minutes within two metres of that person. But the spokesman did not go as far as saying that he was confident that Johnson would not be asked to self-isolate if Sharma tested positive. Asked if Johnson would comply if he were asked to self-isolate, the spokesman said: \u201cWe would follow the advice given by the medical experts.\u201d The spokesman also said that the cabinet room was \u201cvigorously cleaned\u201d yesterday, but that that was usual practice and happened every day. Downing Street is not reconsidering the government\u2019s move to abandon virtual sittings of the House of Commons in the light of Sharma\u2019s illness, the spokesman said. The spokesman refused to deny a report on Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches last night saying Johnson told his Italian counterpart on 13 March that he wanted \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Asked about the report, the spokesman said: The position of the government is that herd immunity has never been its policy. But the spokesman did not deny that Johnson had said the words attributed to him in the programme and, when asked if he was willing to clarify this directly with the PM, he suggested there was no need because he had made the position clear. The spokesman said 171,829 tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am yesterday. But the government had the capacity to carry out 220,213, he said. The spokesman confirmed the Telegraph story (paywall) saying that tens of thousands of coronavirus tests were returned void after being sent to a US laboratory for analysis. He said 67,000 tests had been sent to the US, and 29,500 were returned void. The laboratory was not being used again, he said. He said in total 4.2m tests had been carried out. The spokesman denied a Telegraph report (paywall) claiming hairdressers in England could be allowed to open as early as 15 June. He said the ambition was to reopen them from July at the earliest. The spokesman did not challenge a Guardian report saying that in some areas up to 90% of primary schools remained closed this week, even though schools in England are meant to be reopening for some year groups. One survey suggests 44% of English primaries remained closed. The spokesman said that what happened this week was \u201cbroadly ... in line with expectations\u201d and that \u201cwe expect that attendance will grow over time\u201d. He said official attendance figures would be published next week. The spokesman said the government has ruled out running the school meal voucher system in England over the summer holidays. But there will be a \u00a39m programme offering some pupils activities and meals, said the spokesman, who also hinted it might be expanded. The spokesman said the government did not agree with the suggestion from Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, that the Covid-19 virus was man-made. Dearlove made the claim in an interview with the Telegraph. \u201cWe have seen no evidence that the virus is man-made,\u201d the spokesman said. But the spokesman did not rule out Dearlove\u2019s theory that the virus escaped from a laboratory. He said an independent inquiry was needed to establish where it came from. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, will take the afternoon press conference, the spokesman said. The questions will come from regional media, not national media. In case you missed it ... In this week\u2019s episode of the Bafta-nominated Anywhere But Westminster series, the team return to Middlesbrough, which has had one of the highest infection rates in the UK. Far away from ministerial briefings and political intrigue, Covid-19 has worsened already ingrained problems: biting hardship, precarious work and the feeling that government has left people to sink or swim. There is hope and energy at the grassroots but can things really change? Beginning her daily briefing, the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announces that there have been nine deaths from coronavirus registered in Scotland over the past 24 hours \u2013 the first time since 27 March that the number of daily deaths has been in single figures \u2013 bringing the total there to 2,395. As of 9am this morning there were 15,553 positive cases confirmed, an increase of 49 since yesterday, but a decrease of six in intensive care and a decrease of 21 confirmed cases in hospital. Sturgeon also emphasised that, ahead of a weekend of \u201cmore traditionally Scottish weather\u201d, it was still imperative not to go into other people\u2019s houses, and to continue to meet only outdoors and at a two metre distance. A scientific adviser to the government has cast doubt over the effectiveness of a blanket quarantine for visitors to the UK. Prof Robert Dingwall, a member of a sub-group of Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies), made the comments after the home secretary, Priti Patel, came under pressure from MPs over the plans which come into force in England on Monday legally requiring most people arriving in the UK to self-isolate for 14 days. She insisted the idea was \u201cbacked by science\u201d, was \u201cessential\u201d to save lives and crucial to make sure gains made in fighting the virus were not lost. But Prof Dingwall told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: We are not seeing new clusters that are taking off from people who have been travelling abroad. I think we would really need to get the level in this country significantly further down before quarantine started to become a useful measure. Even then, we would have to see something that is targeted on countries with a significantly higher level of community transmission than ourselves - and there aren\u2019t too many of those around, I\u2019m afraid. Prof Dingwall, a Nottingham Trent University academic who is a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) which reports to Sage, added: If you\u2019re a holiday destination in Europe in a country that has worked really hard to get its levels of community transmission down and you\u2019re perhaps looking forward to seeing the end of the virus circulating, apart from in isolated outbreaks, then you have to wonder would they really want to welcome a load of British tourists from a country which hasn\u2019t fully got this virus under control yet? Extra work by firefighters in response to the Covid-19 crisis, including helping to deliver health supplies, has been extended until July and could last until the end of August, it has been announced. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said an agreement reached in March allowing firefighters to assist ambulance services, deliver vital supplies to the elderly and vulnerable and move the bodies of the deceased would continue. A number of other activities have been agreed, including assembling personal protective equipment and training care home staff in infection, prevention and control. The government\u2019s track and trace programme could be illegal, privacy campaigners say. The Open Rights Group has filed a legal complaint to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office over the programme, which it says breaches GDPR. The complaint notes that, almost a week after it was launched, the government has still not filed a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for the programme with the ICO. The document, legally required before \u201chigh risk\u201d data processing can begin, would explain the government\u2019s view of the risks it faces, and explain how it hopes to mitigate them. \u201cGiven the system is experimental and the sensitive nature and scale of the data being processed, a DPIA was required before processing commenced,\u201d the ORG said in a statement. \u201c[Public Health England] and the NHS confirmed that a DPIA has not been conducted, in breach of those GDPR requirements.\u201d Jim Killock, the ORG\u2019s executive director, said: The ICO must act to enforce the law. The government is moving too fast, and breaking things as a result. If they carry on in this manner, public confidence will be undermined, and people will refuse to engage with the track and trace programme. Public health objectives are being undermined by failures to get privacy and data protection basics in place. When the government began trialling the Covid contact tracing app in the Isle of Wight, it was similarly late in filing the DPIA, which drew criticism from the Information Commissioner. When eventually published, the impact assessment drew further criticism for what many perceived as a lax approach to the risks inherent in such a scheme. When judging the severity of being wrongly forced to quarantine for two weeks, for example, the impact assessment claims it is merely a \u201cmoderate\u201d harm. Those who can, should go back to work, Boris Johnson has said. But how will people get to work safely? If we take public transport, will there be enough space to physically distance? If we take the car, will the roads cope with all the extra traffic? In this Guardian explainer, Josh Toussaint-Strauss tries to figure out some answers to the UK\u2019s transport problem in the time of coronavirus, with the help of Peter Walker and Matthew Taylor. Tens of thousands of aerospace and aviation workers are set to lose their jobs as a result of the coronavirus crisis, industry experts have warned. Paul Everitt, chief executive of the ADS Group, said redundancies will be made in the coming weeks and months because of the collapse in demand for flights. He told the business, energy and industrial strategy committee it was \u201cvery difficult\u201d to see demand return quickly, so airlines and other companies will be forced to restructure or \u201cresize\u201d. Everitt said the government\u2019s controversial decision to press ahead with its quarantine plans for people arriving in the UK would lead to a further period of uncertainty for the sectors his group represents. Summer is incredibly important for airlines, so the fact that they are not able to sell tickets with confidence in July and August is a clear worry and will only mean the recovery will take longer and be more painful. The industry believed the right approach would be to put in place measures to minimise the risk of anyone getting on to an aircraft who might be affected by the virus, he added. Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK, also told MPs that one in four manufacturers were planning to make redundancies in the next few months. He voiced fears about the loss of skills in the industry, saying he had spoken to the education secretary about the need to tackle the issue. And Gareth Stace, director general of UK Steel, told the committee that the steel industry was in a \u201cdifficult position\u201d before the current crisis, with falling prices for its products and rising costs for raw materials. UK steel companies also faced higher electricity charges and business rates than competitors in other countries such as Germany, he said, adding: The government needs to build a bridge to help us through this crisis. There is no point in the government saving the steel sector from going out of business now, if it is not going to work with us and trade unions to develop a brighter and sustainable future. It is totally within the government\u2019s gift to do that. When Suella Braverman, the attorney general, posted her tweet on Saturday 23 May (see 10.34am), she was one of several senior ministers using the platform to defend Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser. At that point the Guardian and the Daily Mirror had published a story saying Cummings and his family travelled to Durham to self-isolate during the lockdown, and No 10 had only given a limited explanation for his conduct. Subsequently the Guardian and the Daily Mirror revealed that Cummings and his family went to Barnard Castle while they were in Durham. Durham police subsequently said that, if they had stopped him at the time, they would have treated this as a breach of the law. Although Tory whips were asking ministers to tweet in support of Cummings, several refused to do so, including Robert Buckland, the lord chancellor and justice secretary. In an email to constituents sent out on Thursday 28 May, after Durham police gave their view, he adopted a tone that was very different from the one taken by Braverman a few days earlier. He said that, given his constitutional role, it would not be appropriate for him to comment on the merits of an individual case. He said: After the revelations emerged over the weekend, I was glad to see Mr Cummings give an explanation as to why he acted as he did, and this has been rightly questioned by the media. Durham police have investigated the situation and have concluded that whilst there might have been a minor breach, they will take no further action. You will appreciate that owing to the operational independence of the police and my constitutional duty as lord chancellor to uphold the rule of law, it would not be appropriate for me to give a view on the merits of an individual case. I am, however, acutely conscious as to the strength of feeling on this issue, which I completely understand. This has left a deep impression on both me and colleagues in parliament and the government. The urgent question on Covid-19 disparities is now over. That\u2019s it from me (Aamna). I\u2019ll be handing the blog over to Andrew and Lucy. When asked why the Public Health Review failed to factor in the occupational discrimination faced by BAME staff, Badenoch says: \u201cPublic Health England didn\u2019t necessarily have the data ... That was something I really wanted to see because it goes somewhere to explain the gaps.\u201d Badenoch says: \u201cWe\u2019re not rushing to take into account what one specific report saying, we\u2019re looking at what all the different reports have said like the one from Public Health Scotland to make sure we find out exactly what is going on.\u201d Good morning! I\u2019m Lucy Campbell, joining the blog for the rest of the day. As always, please feel free to get in touch with news tips, stories, comments and suggestions. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ Labour MP Zarah Sultana asks whether the government will commit to a race equality strategy covering all Whitehall departments. Badenoch says the government is doing everything it can to eliminate disparities. She says there are many other groups that have been impacted, based on age and gender. \u201cI\u2019m not going to take any lessons from the honourable lady on race based and what I should be doing on that. I think this government has a record to be proud of,\u201d she adds. Labour MP Rupa Huq asks when there will be a detailed plan on how to tackle inequalities following the moving Black Lives Matter protests outside parliament yesterday. She said she was struck by a placard that said: \u201cBeing black shouldn\u2019t be a death sentence.\u201d Badenoch said we shouldn\u2019t accept statements like being black shouldn\u2019t be a death sentence in this country. It is not true. It is true that there are disparities. It is true there are other factors that can make outcomes worse. Let\u2019s look at that. But let us not in this house use statements like being black is a death sentence, which young people out here don\u2019t understand the context and then continue to believe that they live in a society that is against them when actually this is one of the best countries in the world to be a black person. Suella Braverman\u2019s claim that her tweet in defence of Dominic Cummings did not amount to any undue interference in the potential legal process (see 10.34am) has been firmly rejected by two of the most prominent legal commentators on social media. This is from David Allen Green, the FT\u2019s legal commentator. And this is from the Secret Barrister, the name used by a barrister who anonymously published a book exposing flaws in the legal system (which is brilliant, by the way). Labour MP Helen Hayes raises the case of Belly Mujinga, who died from coronavirus after she was spat at by a man. Following \u201cextensive inquiries\u201d British Transport Police decided the attack did not led to her death. Badenoch says she is \u201cextremely saddened and shocked\u201d by her death, but reiterated that the BTP were not taking further action in Belly\u2019s case because senior detectives are confident that the incident at Victoria station did not \u201clead to her contracting covid\u201d. When asked whether the government would pause the easing of the lockdown until the there is a mitigation plan in place to address inequalities with how Covid-19 has impacted certain communities, Badenoch said any easement plan was being made in conjunction with scientists. \u201cThe government has reviewed and explained guidance extensively across all sorts of occupational areas.\u201d The SNP\u2019s Joanne Cherry asks what the government will do about the current policy on no recourse to public funds. It is a condition placed on some people who enter the UK from other countries and have a temporary immigration status, which means you can\u2019t claim most benefits Badenoch said the government had taken extensive action to support families impacted by the policy. Labour MP Gill Furniss said the review fails to make a single recommendation on how to reduce the inequalities, which has meant the coronavirus pandemic has taken a bigger toll on the BAME community She said the coronavirus thrives on inequality and it is up to the government to take action and \u201cshow black lives matter\u201d. Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, is making a statement in the Commons during an urgent question on the BAME coronavirus review. Badenoch said: \u201cAs a black woman and the equalities minister, It would be odd if I did not comment on the events in the US and protests in London yesterday. Like all right minded people, regardless of their race, I was profoundly disturbed by the brutal murder of George Floyd at the hands of the police.\u201d She said the government must not pander to those who seek to inflame current tensions. \u201cWe must work together to improve the lives on BAME communities.\u201d There was a sharp fall in the number of crimes reported during the first full month of the lockdown in Scotland, with nearly a fifth fewer crimes and 29% fewer offences recorded by the police. Scotland\u2019s chief statistician said the number of crimes fell by 18% in April compared with April 2019, down by 3,823 to 17,171, while there were 6,215 fewer offences such as common assault or breach of the peace, compared with April last year, down from 21,644 to 15,449. Sexual crimes reported to the police fell by 26%, down to 781, with violent crimes down 14% and crimes of dishonesty falling by 24%. The data excludes new offences for breaching lockdown or social distancing rules linked to the coronavirus pandemic. Only fraud cases showed a notable increase, up by 38%, from 791 to 1,089 cases. The statisticians said it was not clear that was entirely due to criminals exploiting people\u2019s vulnerabilities during the crisis because procedures for recording fraud changed in April 2020, to include frauds committed outside the UK on victims within the UK. Humza Yousaf, the Scottish justice secretary, said that even so, the coronavirus crisis had contributed to the increase. He also urged women and children who had experienced domestic violence to report incidents to the police; experts fear there has been a surge in unrecorded domestic abuse cases during the lockdown. He said: While many types of crime have fallen in recent months, we know that some people have been using lockdown as a chance to commit offences, notably fraud \u2013 including targeting some of our most vulnerable citizens and exploiting businesses. We must remain vigilant to such criminals, and also to the risks of harm against those who may be living in fear of abuse and violence within their own homes. I would urge anyone who has experienced or witnessed crime to continue to report it. Some women and children may feel very isolated now, and need our help more than ever. My message to anyone experiencing domestic abuse or sexual violence is absolutely clear: while you may feel vulnerable and unseen, you are not alone. Help from police and support services is still available round the clock. In the Commons Suella Braverman, the attorney general, is taking questions. Labour\u2019s Ellie Reeves, the shadow solicitor general, asked her about the tweet she sent out defending Dominic Cummings after the Guardian and the Daily Mirror revealed that he had travelled to Durham from London during the lockdown, in apparent breach of lockdown rules. Reeves said that by sending this tweet Braverman \u201cundermined the impartiality of her role and the rule of law\u201d. Braverman did not accept this. She replied: It\u2019s plain for any reasonable observer to see that there was no question whatsoever of my having provided any public legal view on the matter ... and to suggest that that was somehow a legal opinion is simply absurd. [Reeves] should know that I have no role whatsoever to play in the day to day decisions of individual cases. I respect and have full confidence in the operational independence of the CPS and the police and I would gently encourage [Reeves] to share my support and share my confidence in them. UPDATE: Here is video from the exchange. The chief executive of the Scottish Tourism Alliance (STA), Marc Crothall, has written to the Scottish government asking ministers to consider changing social distancing guidance to keeping 1 metre apart. Current guidelines advise people stay 2 metres apart. In a plea on behalf of tourism businesses across Scotland, the STA cites the Lancet and the WHO on the relative safety of maintaining 1 metre distance and warns that the majority of its members do not believe that it will economically viable to reopen at 2 metres and would have to remain closed until guidance changed. \u201cMany may not be able to hold out until then and the difference could mean many tens of thousands of jobs being saved or lost.\u201d The letter also notes the numbers of day-trippers to countryside locations over the weekend and suggests that some tourism sectors like self-catering and static caravan holiday parks should be allowed to open soon, which \u201ccould potentially act as a \u2018safety valve\u2019, offering permitted holiday travel\u201d. On Wednesday, Boris Johnson said he was considering reducing the 2-metre rule for physical distancing despite the government\u2019s chief medical officer saying it would need to stay in place for the whole epidemic. Rowena Mason, the Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, reports: The prime minister struck an optimistic note about easing the lockdown further after demands from Tory MPs for a review of the 2-metre rule to help pubs, restaurants, cafes and other venues to reopen profitably. \u201cWe are seeing continuous falls in this disease, in deaths, in incidents,\u201d he told the daily press conference in Downing Street. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve been able to take the very cautious steps that we have. \u201cWe want to take some more steps to unlock our society and try to get back to as normal as possible. Eventually I would like to do such things as reducing the 2-metre rule, for instance.\u201d However, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, and Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical adviser, took a much more cautious tone, stressing that the UK needed to move very slowly given the current infection rate. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, is going to host a regular monthly phone-in on LBC. It will last half an hour and the first one will go out on Monday, at 9am. It will be called Call Keir and Nick Ferrari will be presenting for LBC. In doing the programme Starmer will be following in the footsteps of Boris Johnson, who held a monthly phone-in on the station when he was London mayor, and Nick Clegg, who did a weekly one when he was deputy PM. In a statement Starmer said: I\u2019m very conscious that one of my first jobs is to rebuild trust in the Labour party with the public. The best way of doing that is to listen to the public and to LBC\u2019s listeners and hear what they\u2019ve got to say. What I always get from these phone-ins is a real sense of what matters to people. Having people on, telling me what they think, is the only way to gauge what people think and to hear what their real concerns are. I\u2019m looking forward to it. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. As Philip Inman reports, in a speech yesterday Prince Charles said that the coronavirus crisis could provide \u201ca golden opportunity\u201d for the world to rethink the way the economy is run and prioritise sustainable development. Charles said: We have a golden opportunity to seize something good from this crisis. Its unprecedented shockwaves may well make people more receptive to big visions of change. The Prince of Wales has said more on this in an interview with Sky News that is out this morning. Here are the key points. Charles said that a green recovery should be at the centre of efforts to rebuild the world economy after the pandemic. He said he hoped the crisis might make people take environmental issues seriously. He said: It\u2019s only catastrophes which concentrate the mind, which means, that for once, there might be some real, real impetus to tackle all these things that have been pushed to one side because everyone said: \u2018oh it\u2019s irrelevant\u2019. For instance, you could never get the G20 to concentrate very much on agriculture, forestry or fishery because it wasn\u2019t considered very sexy. But these are crucial things. He suggested that disasters like the coronavirus pandemic were linked to the loss of biodiversity. He said: The more we erode the natural world, the more we destroy what\u2019s called biodiversity, which is the immense diversity of life, plant life, tree life, everything else. Marine life. The more we expose ourselves to this kind of danger. We\u2019ve had these other disasters with Sars and Ebola and goodness knows what else, all of these things are related to the loss of biodiversity. He said that getting coronavirus himself made him \u201cmore determined to push and shout and prod\u201d on issues he cared about. One of the things that is interesting about Charles\u2019 intervention is that, in suggesting that the coronavirus crisis should be used as a catalyst for wide-ranging economic reform, the prince is going way beyond what most politicians have been saying. That may be because some politicians are calculating that what the public really wants most at the end of all this is not change, but something approximating to what life was like before. Boris Johnson has said nothing at all about how the crisis could be a catalyst for progressive change. Sir Keir Starmer said, in the speech he gave on the day he became Labour leader, that \u201cwe cannot go back to business as usual\u201d after the pandemic, but he has not elaborated on what that might mean. One of the few political documents providing a hint as to what this new world might look like is the Welsh government\u2019s plan for relaxing the lockdown (pdf), which says: The world we are moving towards is not the pre-Covid world. We must adapt to a future with the virus in it. In doing so, we should embed some of the more positive consequences of coping with the disease such as: more sustainable ways of working and travelling, flexibilities for using IT in businesses, services and education, and a stronger emphasis on voluntary and community action. The business secretary, Alok Sharma, might have had a bout of \u201csevere hayfever\u201d when he appeared ill in the House of Commons on Wednesday, according to the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Lewis said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be premature because Alok, who I wish well and hope he recovers quickly, may well have had severe hayfever, we\u2019re not sure yet.\u201d He denied that Sharma\u2019s case supported the argument for virtual voting in the Commons to be resumed. He said: It is important for parliamentarians to be able to properly scrutinise legislation, not just for Covid but for the wider legislative agenda we have to continue with for people across the country, but to do so within proper guidelines. That\u2019s what the house authorities have set up, that\u2019s what\u2019s been working over the last few days and that\u2019s a very good thing. It highlights Alok\u2019s situation, if he has got coronavirus, why it is so important that if you are in a work environment, you have got to follow the guidelines. Lisa McNally, public health director at Sandwell council in the West Midlands, said she was surprised the lockdown had been eased before the test and trace system was \u201cat full speed\u201d. She told the Today programme: This system is certainly up but I\u2019m not sure about running. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m particularly surprised, to be honest, that this system isn\u2019t running effectively in a few short days - it was never going to be, it is an enormous task. What surprises me, I guess, is that we are moving ahead so quickly with easing lockdown before the system is at full speed. We need to allow time to assess how things are going, get this system up to speed. To be honest with you, I\u2019m concerned that by the time we realise we need to hit the brakes, we will have spun off the road and be over the cliff-edge. McNally predicted the UK could be \u201cgoing back to a place we really don\u2019t want to be, which is where we were at the end of April\u201d in terms of the number of coronavirus-related infections and deaths if test and trace did not prove effective. In his first interview since the resignation of Douglas Ross over Dominic Cummings last week, the Scottish Conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw, has told BBC Radio Scotland that the prime minister\u2019s adviser had left people \u201cperplexed and angry\u201d, that his explanation for his trip to Durham during lockdown was \u201cwholly unconvincing\u201d and that \u201cI do believe that he should have gone\u201d. After Ross, the Scotland Office minister resigned, Carlaw\u2019s initial statement was considered to be fairly non-committal about Cummings\u2019 behaviour, though he firmed up his position later in the day. Carlaw was pressed on whether he had made his views clear to Boris Johnson, and whether he had as much influence on Downing Street as his predecessor Ruth Davidson, he said that \u201cwho is employed by the prime minister is a matter for the prime minister\u201d. Asked about the promotion of Milton Keynes MP Iain Stewart to the Scotland Office to replace Ross, he refused to agree it was a point of principle that Scottish MPs should represent their country. Tens of thousands of Britons have had to be retested for coronavirus following a controversial decision to send swabs to a US laboratory. Almost 30,000 Britons will have to be retested for coronavirus costing taxpayer hundreds of thousands of pounds, the Telegraph reports. Ministers admitted that 67,000 Covid-19 tests were sent to a lab in the US over 10 days at the beginning of last month, after capacity at a lab in Northern Ireland suddenly stopped processing samples. The newspaper reveals that when these tests were returned to the UK, more than four in 10 \u2014 nearly 30,000 \u2014 were \u201cvoided\u201d because of the way they had been processed. The cost to the taxpayer is likely to have run into hundreds of thousands of pounds. Morning and welcome to the UK liveblog on the coronavirus. I\u2019ll be helming the blog until Andrew and Lucy join us later this morning. The government\u2019s desperate push to reopen primary schools in England to kickstart the economy has fallen flat, reports the Guardian\u2019s Josh Halliday and Sally Weale. Figures obtained by the Guardian showed that in large parts of the north-east not a single primary school opened to more pupils on Monday, the government\u2019s target date for reopening after the 10-week lockdown. Data from 11 of the 12 biggest local authorities in the region, which has the highest Covid-19 infection rate in the UK, showed just 12% of their 856 primary schools admitted additional pupils on Monday. Across England, a National Education Union poll of members suggested, more than two in five schools (44%) decided against admitting more pupils on Monday, contrary to government expectations. In the north-west, the proportion of schools opening to more pupils was even lower, at just 8%, according to a survey by the country\u2019s biggest education union. The figures come as Priti Patel faces mounting calls to publish the scientific advice behind the 14-day quarantine period for new arrivals to the UK, after the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser declined to fully endorse such a blanket policy. Finally, the business secretary, Alok Sharma, has been tested for coronavirus after feeling unwell while delivering a statement in the House of Commons. Sharma has gone home to self-isolate following his appearance at the dispatch box earlier on Wednesday. His suspected illness is likely to cause concern about the government\u2019s decision to bring back parliament in its physical form, after weeks of allowing MPs to attend remotely via video link.",

Ministers are bringing in the policy due to concerns about the difficulties of physical distancing on crowded public transport, despite people being asked to use other ways of travelling, to space out, face away from each other and travel at staggered times. \u201cAs of Monday 15 June, face coverings will become mandatory on public transport,\u201d Shapps told the daily press conference. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings, it means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home. \u201cThe evidence suggests that wearing face coverings offers some, albeit limited, protection, against the spread of the virus.\u201d The aim of the measures is to help stop asymptomatic people passing the virus on to others and also act as a visible reminder of the need for distancing and measures such as handwashing. However, Jim McMahon, Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, said the government was being too slow to bring in the protections. \u201cTwo months ago, Labour immediately backed the mayor of London\u2019s call for face coverings on public transport to be compulsory. Yet only now Tory ministers are acting,\u201d he said. The measures come as a Guardian survey suggests that fewer than four in 10 people currently wear a face covering on public transport, with young and middle-aged men the least likely to use them on trains, buses, trams and the tube. The survey of almost 800 travellers in Manchester, Glasgow and London, carried out this week, found that in some areas as few as 10% of passengers wear face coverings. Under the conditions of carriage, fines may be imposed for anyone who flouts the new rules but there are questions about how it will be policed. Sir Peter Hendy, the Network Rail chairman, said he expects most passengers to comply with the requirement. \u201cI am not expecting a huge upsurge in railway staff having to police this,\u201d he said. \u201cI am expecting sensible passengers to do their duty and look after themselves and others.\u201d In Scotland, people are also advised to wear face masks on public transport and in enclosed public spaces. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said on Thursday that she was considering making the measure compulsory and it may be \u201cinevitable\u201d at some point, as anecdotal evidence suggests many Scots are disregarding guidance. In Wales, wearing face coverings is a matter of personal choice, while in Northern Ireland it is recommended that people \u201cshould think about using face coverings in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not possible\u201d. The differing advice means passengers not wearing a mask in Wales or Scotland on trains would have to put on a mask when crossing the border. Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 trade union, said it was a \u201csensible step\u201d. \u201cWe have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain\u2019s train, and tube, network is done in a safe and controlled manner \u2013 to help spread [the number of travellers], and maintain social distancing \u2013 for the safety of passengers and staff,\u201d he said. \u201cThe instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network.\u201d Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the TSSA travel and transport union, said it would help \u201clower the transmission of this deadly virus among those using public transport in the weeks and months to come\u201d. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s also important to stress that people must not interpret the use of a face covering as a licence to breach social-distancing measures as lockdown eases,\u201d he said. \u201cA physical distance of at least two metres between passengers and/or staff must be maintained at all times as this remains the most effective measure to control the spread of Covid-19. \u201cOur union has been pressing ministers and transport bosses for further action to protect our members on the front line, as face coverings are no substitute for protective equipment. Sadly, some bosses have yet to issue the visors and other personal protective equipment that our members require.\u201d The change in advice comes a month after the government advised people to wear a face covering in enclosed spaces where social distancing was not always possible and they came into contact with others they did not normally meet, such as on public transport or in some shops. It makes an exception for children under the age of two, who should not have their faces covered, and any children of primary school age who do not have somebody with them who is supervising them. The chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, has repeatedly stressed that face coverings are \u201cnot a substitute\u201d for physical distancing and urged the public not to buy surgical or medical masks needed for frontline carers, but to rely on scarves or DIY-type masks instead. The advice also suggests the public should wash their clothes regularly, as there is some evidence that the virus can stay on fabrics.",

As the pandemic engulfed New York City and it became the world hotpot, she said her patient caseload shifted from a diverse group of New Yorkers to predominantly black Americans.&nbsp;</p> <p>Among the <a href=\"https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.20.0116\">most important risk factors</a> for death from Covid-19 are chronic conditions, such as diabetes and uncontrolled asthma. Those disparities have been magnified by the pandemic, witnesses said.&nbsp;</p> <p>In just one example of disparities in an important risk factor, 30% of black Americans and 29% of Latino Americans reported suffering from diabetes, compared to only 17% of white Americans, according to a large 2017 study by the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2017/16_0241.htm#:~:text=Racial%2Fethnic%20differences%20in%20the%20prevalence%20of%20chronic%20diseases%20were,%25%20of%20non%2DHispanic%20whites.\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).</p> <p>\u201cLiving in this country has essentially made black Americans sick,\u201d said Blackstock. \u201cOver the last three months we have witnessed a crisis layered upon a crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThis country desperately needs a truth and reconciliation process.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Black Americans have been especially devastated by the pandemic, but the toll has cut across racial minorities in the US. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/us/coronavirus-latinos-disparity.html\">Latino Americans</a> are disproportionately likely to be infected with the disease. Native Americans have also suffered heavily. In just one example, Native Americans in Arizona make up <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/04/12/coronavirus-in-arizona-data-where-who-deaths-impact-location-cases/2979690001/\">less than 5%</a> of the population, but 14% of deaths.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cSystemic racial inequities have festered in our society for years, and are now magnified by the coronavirus,\u201d said the South Carolina Democratic congressman James Clyburn. \u201cThis racial inequity is particularly stark in healthcare, and has been laid bare by this pandemic.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Witnesses also called for better data collection to target resources to geographic areas and demographics where infection is spreading. Testing has long lagged in the federal government response. Congress passed a law requiring the administration to collect and provide certain demographic information about Covid-19 infections, but the Maryland congressman Jamie Raskin called the report \u201ca joke\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, not all lawmakers were willing to lay the disparities at the feet of structural racism.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe need to be careful when interpreting the data,\u201d said Mark Green, a Republican congressman from Tennessee. \u201cIf we draw conclusions this is all due to some race bias in healthcare, we may miss that we need to sterilize public buses.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>At the same time the subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis heard testimony, the House subcommittee on appropriations heard from Dr Robert Redfield. Redfield heads the CDC, which is responsible for controlling infectious diseases within the United States.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe must lessen the impact on African Americans, Hispanics, Latino Americans, Indians and Alaska natives,\u201d said Redfield. \u201cThis nation is not only hearing a wakeup call, we\u2019re hearing a clamoring for equity and healing.\u201d</p>",

As the pandemic engulfed New York City and it became the world hotpot, she said her patient caseload shifted from a diverse group of New Yorkers to predominantly black Americans. Among the most important risk factors for death from Covid-19 are chronic conditions, such as diabetes and uncontrolled asthma. Those disparities have been magnified by the pandemic, witnesses said. In just one example of disparities in an important risk factor, 30% of black Americans and 29% of Latino Americans reported suffering from diabetes, compared to only 17% of white Americans, according to a large 2017 study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \u201cLiving in this country has essentially made black Americans sick,\u201d said Blackstock. \u201cOver the last three months we have witnessed a crisis layered upon a crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThis country desperately needs a truth and reconciliation process.\u201d Black Americans have been especially devastated by the pandemic, but the toll has cut across racial minorities in the US. Latino Americans are disproportionately likely to be infected with the disease. Native Americans have also suffered heavily. In just one example, Native Americans in Arizona make up less than 5% of the population, but 14% of deaths. \u201cSystemic racial inequities have festered in our society for years, and are now magnified by the coronavirus,\u201d said the South Carolina Democratic congressman James Clyburn. \u201cThis racial inequity is particularly stark in healthcare, and has been laid bare by this pandemic.\u201d Witnesses also called for better data collection to target resources to geographic areas and demographics where infection is spreading. Testing has long lagged in the federal government response. Congress passed a law requiring the administration to collect and provide certain demographic information about Covid-19 infections, but the Maryland congressman Jamie Raskin called the report \u201ca joke\u201d. However, not all lawmakers were willing to lay the disparities at the feet of structural racism. \u201cWe need to be careful when interpreting the data,\u201d said Mark Green, a Republican congressman from Tennessee. \u201cIf we draw conclusions this is all due to some race bias in healthcare, we may miss that we need to sterilize public buses.\u201d At the same time the subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis heard testimony, the House subcommittee on appropriations heard from Dr Robert Redfield. Redfield heads the CDC, which is responsible for controlling infectious diseases within the United States. \u201cWe must lessen the impact on African Americans, Hispanics, Latino Americans, Indians and Alaska natives,\u201d said Redfield. \u201cThis nation is not only hearing a wakeup call, we\u2019re hearing a clamoring for equity and healing.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A few days ago, the prime minister announced that he was doing away with the daily coronavirus briefings at weekends. It was just getting too hard to find cabinet ministers who were prepared to give up their Saturdays and Sundays \u2013 even the ever loyal \u201ccut out and keep\u201d Tory boy pastiche, Robert Jenrick, was playing hard to get \u2013 and Boris Johnson sure as hell couldn\u2019t be bothered to do it himself.</p> <p>It can\u2019t be long before No 10 pursues its dream of reducing the number still further, if Thursday\u2019s showing is anything to go by. One \u2013 two at a push \u2013 a week would be just about ideal. A win-win situation that would cut the workload and save the daily embarrassment of a minister having to explain that the government really didn\u2019t have much of a clue what it was doing and was just making up policy on the hoof.</p> <p>This is no reflection on Grant Shapps, the delegated fall guy for Thursday\u2019s press briefing. Shapps may not be the brightest kid on the block, but he\u2019s always been one of the more enthusiastic and by cabinet standards has so far had a reasonable coronavirus war. He\u2019s by and large managed to curb his natural tendency to smile when reading out the death statistics and he\u2019s put in more than his fair share of shifts in trying to make news out of something that is either a non-event or a government PR disaster.</p> <p>But even the transport secretary is now running on fumes. The sheer pointlessness of his existence is now getting to him. And understandably so. Though he tries to maintain the jaunty, upbeat exterior of a man who just can\u2019t wait to upgrade the A66, his shoulders are now permanently slumped and he looks dead behind the eyes. Too much more of this and he\u2019s going to crack and do a runner. Luckily he\u2019s got plenty of aliases lined up for his new life. Bye, bye Grant. Hello Michael Green.</p> <p>Having rattled through a few slides \u2013 astonishingly the one that showed that on the previous day the UK death total had been higher than the rest of the EU27 combined had gone missing \u2013 Shapps moved on to his \u201cbreaking news\u201d announcement. It had just come to his attention that there was a nasty disease called coronavirus going round, so from 15 June&nbsp;\u2013 might as well let a few more people die rather than doing it immediately \u2013 everyone on public transport was going to have to wear face coverings.</p> <p>Well, hello. Not only had many people, including London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, been calling for such measures for weeks now, most other countries had made it law a month ago. But Grant was adamant. The UK had a reputation to maintain as the country that took measures long after they had become blindingly obvious to everyone else. It was this kind of inaction that made the UK a \u201cworld beater\u201d in international stupidity.</p> <p>Still, Shapps could see some light at the end of the tunnel. One way out of these daily press briefings would be simply to broadcast those of other European countries that had taken place weeks ago. Just imagine the possibilities. Rather than wasting his time today, we could have replayed the press conference of a month ago in which the Spanish transport secretary announced the compulsory wearing of face masks on public transport only dubbed into English with Grant\u2019s voice. Put like this, no minister would ever need to appear in public again.</p> <p>There was a caveat, though. Face coverings alone wouldn\u2019t be enough to stop the coronavirus, so it was still necessary for people not to make unnecessary journeys, and to work from home wherever possible. This from a man who had literally queued for 90 minutes on Tuesday afternoon to take part in a vote to deny fellow MPs from having a vote or taking part in parliamentary proceedings because they had health issues, caring responsibilities, large distance to travel or were self-isolating.

      "bodyText": "A few days ago, the prime minister announced that he was doing away with the daily coronavirus briefings at weekends. It was just getting too hard to find cabinet ministers who were prepared to give up their Saturdays and Sundays \u2013 even the ever loyal \u201ccut out and keep\u201d Tory boy pastiche, Robert Jenrick, was playing hard to get \u2013 and Boris Johnson sure as hell couldn\u2019t be bothered to do it himself. It can\u2019t be long before No 10 pursues its dream of reducing the number still further, if Thursday\u2019s showing is anything to go by. One \u2013 two at a push \u2013 a week would be just about ideal. A win-win situation that would cut the workload and save the daily embarrassment of a minister having to explain that the government really didn\u2019t have much of a clue what it was doing and was just making up policy on the hoof. This is no reflection on Grant Shapps, the delegated fall guy for Thursday\u2019s press briefing. Shapps may not be the brightest kid on the block, but he\u2019s always been one of the more enthusiastic and by cabinet standards has so far had a reasonable coronavirus war. He\u2019s by and large managed to curb his natural tendency to smile when reading out the death statistics and he\u2019s put in more than his fair share of shifts in trying to make news out of something that is either a non-event or a government PR disaster. But even the transport secretary is now running on fumes. The sheer pointlessness of his existence is now getting to him. And understandably so. Though he tries to maintain the jaunty, upbeat exterior of a man who just can\u2019t wait to upgrade the A66, his shoulders are now permanently slumped and he looks dead behind the eyes. Too much more of this and he\u2019s going to crack and do a runner. Luckily he\u2019s got plenty of aliases lined up for his new life. Bye, bye Grant. Hello Michael Green. Having rattled through a few slides \u2013 astonishingly the one that showed that on the previous day the UK death total had been higher than the rest of the EU27 combined had gone missing \u2013 Shapps moved on to his \u201cbreaking news\u201d announcement. It had just come to his attention that there was a nasty disease called coronavirus going round, so from 15 June \u2013 might as well let a few more people die rather than doing it immediately \u2013 everyone on public transport was going to have to wear face coverings. Well, hello. Not only had many people, including London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, been calling for such measures for weeks now, most other countries had made it law a month ago. But Grant was adamant. The UK had a reputation to maintain as the country that took measures long after they had become blindingly obvious to everyone else. It was this kind of inaction that made the UK a \u201cworld beater\u201d in international stupidity. Still, Shapps could see some light at the end of the tunnel. One way out of these daily press briefings would be simply to broadcast those of other European countries that had taken place weeks ago. Just imagine the possibilities. Rather than wasting his time today, we could have replayed the press conference of a month ago in which the Spanish transport secretary announced the compulsory wearing of face masks on public transport only dubbed into English with Grant\u2019s voice. Put like this, no minister would ever need to appear in public again. There was a caveat, though. Face coverings alone wouldn\u2019t be enough to stop the coronavirus, so it was still necessary for people not to make unnecessary journeys, and to work from home wherever possible. This from a man who had literally queued for 90 minutes on Tuesday afternoon to take part in a vote to deny fellow MPs from having a vote or taking part in parliamentary proceedings because they had health issues, caring responsibilities, large distance to travel or were self-isolating. And all this just to indulge Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s ongoing public school fantasies of entitled omnipotence. Even when challenged on this by journalists, Shapps didn\u2019t seem to think there was anything wrong in the government implementing a three-line whip to break its own public health guidelines and put MPs and parliamentary staff at risk. \u201cEr,\u201d said Shapps. \u201cWe were getting behind with secondary legislation.\u201d Then learn to use a Zoom meeting like almost everyone in the country. There\u2019s nothing to stop a committee of MPs from scrutinising legislation online. But what Jakey wants, Jakey must have. After all, whose fault is it if you don\u2019t have a second London home and a fleet of nannies? Grant had no answer to any of the other questions. He didn\u2019t know what advice the government may have for BAME people. He didn\u2019t know why we had still been sending hospital patients into care homes without being tested in the middle of April. There was just time for the transport secretary to make it clear that no one was going anywhere anytime soon. Either home or abroad.

His spokeswoman did not immediately respond when asked if the cabinet minister would have to continue to self-isolate; there are concerns that tests may not come back positive in the early stages of infection. Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs welcomed the result, but said the scare had shown the weaknesses in a return to a physical parliament where MPs have to queue to vote. Footage showed Sharma in the Commons standing close to the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, and voting just before the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock. Barry Sheerman, the Labour MP for Huddersfield, said on Twitter that he was relieved Sharma had tested negative, but that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean that the reintroduction of physical presence voting is not stupid\u201d.

Senior Conservatives, opposition groups and the equalities watchdog raised concerns that the decision to end digital voting would prevent many MPs, particularly elderly and vulnerable politicians who are shielding, from being able to vote.

The PCS union has told members who are cleaners, security guards and postroom workers in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) that the department has failed to provide sufficient evidence of safety measures, and advised them not to return to work. Sharma had attended the departmental office in Westminster on the day he fell ill and neither BEIS nor the outsourcing firm told the workers, the union claimed.

It plans to provide 400m doses before the end of 2020.</p> \n<p>AstraZeneca also struck a deal worth $750m (\u00a3595m) with two health organisations backed by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife Melinda. Those organisations, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and Gavi vaccines alliance, will help find manufacturing facilities to produce and distribute 300m doses of the vaccine, with delivery set to start by the end of the year.</p> \n<p>The new deals are aimed at guaranteeing early supply of the vaccine to lower income countries. It is as yet unclear if vaccines will work against Covid-19 but dozens of companies are in the race to develop one.</p> \n<p>AstraZeneca, which last month overtook Royal Dutch Shell to become the UK\u2019s largest company by market value, said the latest agreements were part of efforts to buildsupply chains for the potential vaccine at no profit. The company has already agreed to supply 300 million doses of the potential vaccine to the US and a further 100m to the UK, with the first deliveries expected in September.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cOur goal is not to leave anybody behind, and we\u2019ll keep working very hard \u2026 to make sure this vaccine is rapidly and widely available across the world,\u201d said Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/astrazeneca\">AstraZeneca</a>.</p> \n<p>Richard Hatchett, chief executive of CEPI, said the World Health Organization will take charge of developing a \u201crecommended allocation schemes\u201d so that the vaccines produced through the new partnerships are initially distributed to the people who need it most.</p> \n<p>That could include healthcare workers and vulnerable people who are most at risk from Covid-19, including the elderly and people with underlying health conditions<em> </em>like hypertension or diabetes, Hatchett explained. He assured the allocation process would be \u201copen and inclusive and transparent as WHO processes are.\u201d</p> \n<p>Soriot said AstraZeneca was in talks with \u201cadditional parties that could be interested\u201d in the 300 million spare doses that have yet to be called for.</p> \n<p>The vaccine, known as AZD1222, is currently in trials involving about 10,000 adult volunteers. Soriot said he expects to know whether the vaccine works when those trials come to a close in August.</p> \n<p>After that, vaccines could start being distributed as early as September.</p> \n<p>Hatchett said the search for a vaccine against Covid-19 was \u201cabsolutely the most pressing challenge of our time.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, he admitted that the organisation was taking a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d by investing in manufacturing while trials were still ongoing, and admitted there was a possibility that the vaccine may not work.</p> \n<p>However, if that ends up being the case, CEPI could offer to help other vaccine manufacturers that use similar production methods. \u201cThat is one way of managing the risk and tolerating the very large financial risk of beginning manufacturing up front,\u201d Hatchett said.</p> \n<p>\u201cObviously if the vaccine is successful, placing that early bet on the manufacturing gives a huge payout, because you end up with tens or even hundreds of millions of doses that become available at the earliest possible moment that your\u2019e sure the vaccine is safe and effective,\u201d Hatchett added.</p> \n<p>CEPI was previously working with the University of Oxford to try to develop a vaccine for Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which is another form of coronavirus.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs far as the chance of the [Covid-19] vaccine working, I would say we all have pretty good hope from what we\u2019ve seen so far, but we can\u2019t be sure of course,\u201d Soriot said.</p> \n<p>The pharmaceuticals boss&nbsp;said the company would consider further partnerships that could ramp up capacity even further, but said authorities should hedge their bets.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt would probably make sense for society to bet on two or three different technologies, not only our vaccine. So you\u2019d expect other vaccines to be made available,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll certainly look at additional capacity, but at 2bn [doses] \u2026 you\u2019d already be making a big impact,\u201d Soriot added.</p>",

AstraZeneca also struck a deal worth $750m (\u00a3595m) with two health organisations backed by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife Melinda. Those organisations, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and Gavi vaccines alliance, will help find manufacturing facilities to produce and distribute 300m doses of the vaccine, with delivery set to start by the end of the year. The new deals are aimed at guaranteeing early supply of the vaccine to lower income countries. It is as yet unclear if vaccines will work against Covid-19 but dozens of companies are in the race to develop one. AstraZeneca, which last month overtook Royal Dutch Shell to become the UK\u2019s largest company by market value, said the latest agreements were part of efforts to buildsupply chains for the potential vaccine at no profit. The company has already agreed to supply 300 million doses of the potential vaccine to the US and a further 100m to the UK, with the first deliveries expected in September. \u201cOur goal is not to leave anybody behind, and we\u2019ll keep working very hard \u2026 to make sure this vaccine is rapidly and widely available across the world,\u201d said Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca. Richard Hatchett, chief executive of CEPI, said the World Health Organization will take charge of developing a \u201crecommended allocation schemes\u201d so that the vaccines produced through the new partnerships are initially distributed to the people who need it most. That could include healthcare workers and vulnerable people who are most at risk from Covid-19, including the elderly and people with underlying health conditions like hypertension or diabetes, Hatchett explained. He assured the allocation process would be \u201copen and inclusive and transparent as WHO processes are.\u201d Soriot said AstraZeneca was in talks with \u201cadditional parties that could be interested\u201d in the 300 million spare doses that have yet to be called for. The vaccine, known as AZD1222, is currently in trials involving about 10,000 adult volunteers. Soriot said he expects to know whether the vaccine works when those trials come to a close in August. After that, vaccines could start being distributed as early as September. Hatchett said the search for a vaccine against Covid-19 was \u201cabsolutely the most pressing challenge of our time.\u201d However, he admitted that the organisation was taking a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d by investing in manufacturing while trials were still ongoing, and admitted there was a possibility that the vaccine may not work. However, if that ends up being the case, CEPI could offer to help other vaccine manufacturers that use similar production methods. \u201cThat is one way of managing the risk and tolerating the very large financial risk of beginning manufacturing up front,\u201d Hatchett said. \u201cObviously if the vaccine is successful, placing that early bet on the manufacturing gives a huge payout, because you end up with tens or even hundreds of millions of doses that become available at the earliest possible moment that your\u2019e sure the vaccine is safe and effective,\u201d Hatchett added. CEPI was previously working with the University of Oxford to try to develop a vaccine for Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which is another form of coronavirus. \u201cAs far as the chance of the [Covid-19] vaccine working, I would say we all have pretty good hope from what we\u2019ve seen so far, but we can\u2019t be sure of course,\u201d Soriot said. The pharmaceuticals boss said the company would consider further partnerships that could ramp up capacity even further, but said authorities should hedge their bets. \u201cIt would probably make sense for society to bet on two or three different technologies, not only our vaccine. So you\u2019d expect other vaccines to be made available,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll certainly look at additional capacity, but at 2bn [doses] \u2026 you\u2019d already be making a big impact,\u201d Soriot added.",

With senior staff members and the head coach, Eddie Jones, already committed to pay cuts of 25% or more, a significant reduction in the players\u2019 current \u00a323,000 match fees seems likely.</p> <p>With Sweeney also indicating his union is open to the idea of summer rugby \u2013 \u201cFrom an RFU position I think summer rugby can work\u201d \u2013&nbsp;the knock-on effects of the coronavirus outbreak look set to transform the sport from top to bottom, with almost nothing off the table. It remains conceivable the 2021 British &amp; Irish Lions tour may have to be pushed back from July to October, with a clash also looming between rescheduled Six Nations fixtures and the mooted European Champions Cup final on the weekend of 17 October.</p> <p>Sweeney has even been taking advice from senior Army officers at Sandhurst on crisis management as he seeks to steer the RFU out of the complex maze of issues affecting the sport. \u201cWe are all facing really challenging situations,\u201d he said, stressing player remuneration had to be viewed in the context of the wider economic outlook.&nbsp;\u201cClearly we need to cut costs but ... we don\u2019t have the specifics at this stage. We\u2019re in the middle of that conversation.\u201d</p> <p>On the subject of the calendar, Sweeney has already made clear a total wipeout of international rugby in Europe for the remainder of this year would have a \u201ccatastrophic impact\u201d on the game in England and cost the RFU a total of \u00a3122m in revenue. Hence the desire to stage whatever fixtures might be possible this autumn, with three options on the table.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first \u2013 and most improbable given the current issues surrounding long-haul international travel \u2013 is to proceed with the four scheduled Tests against New Zealand, Argentina, Tonga and Australia in November. If those cannot take place, there are tentative plans in place for a \u201chome and away\u201d Six Nations which would also incorporate the scheduled 2021 fixtures. The third option is for a separate \u201cfestival of rugby\u201d tournament involving the Six Nations and a couple of invitational sides.</p> <p>The deadline for confirming any revised November schedule will be August, effectively giving the global game two months in which to resolve a huge pile of conflicting priorities. As things stand, however, there is no question of the remaining 2020 Six Nations fixtures not being played, even if they clash with major European club finals in October. \u201cClosing off those four remaining games in that autumn window is very much on the cards,\u201d said Sweeney.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/04/breakdown-rising-through-crisis-will-always-be-englands-rugby-ritual\">The Breakdown | Then and now: rising through crisis will always be England's rugby ritual</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whatever happens Sweeney is optimistic that, subject to government approval, some spectators could be admitted to Twickenham. \u201cWe\u2019re still working on the basis that we will get some attendance there.\u201d</p> <p>The RFU, meanwhile, will not stand in the way of moving the Six Nations deeper into spring if required. \u201cWith regard to the Six Nations, we said from day one that if it works for the best interests of the game we would be prepared to move it, by a month or a couple of months or whatever,\u201d said Sweeney.</p> <p>For as long as physical distancing remains a compulsory requirement, however, there is no certainty as to when the community game will be able to restart. The RFU says there are three possible dates for the commencement of the club season, with the worst-case scenario involving no amateur rugby before January.</p>",

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s leading players face the increasing prospect of wage cuts and summer rugby as the sport battles to avoid financial meltdown because of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Rugby Football Union also confirmed it is open to shifting the Six Nations championship from its traditional slot in the calendar and remains hopeful of crowds being able to attend England games this autumn. With the world of rugby already suffering from the serious impact of the current shutdown the RFU\u2019s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, has acknowledged talks are ongoing with England squad members as part of enforced cost-saving plans at Twickenham. With senior staff members and the head coach, Eddie Jones, already committed to pay cuts of 25% or more, a significant reduction in the players\u2019 current \u00a323,000 match fees seems likely. With Sweeney also indicating his union is open to the idea of summer rugby \u2013 \u201cFrom an RFU position I think summer rugby can work\u201d \u2013 the knock-on effects of the coronavirus outbreak look set to transform the sport from top to bottom, with almost nothing off the table. It remains conceivable the 2021 British &amp; Irish Lions tour may have to be pushed back from July to October, with a clash also looming between rescheduled Six Nations fixtures and the mooted European Champions Cup final on the weekend of 17 October. Sweeney has even been taking advice from senior Army officers at Sandhurst on crisis management as he seeks to steer the RFU out of the complex maze of issues affecting the sport. \u201cWe are all facing really challenging situations,\u201d he said, stressing player remuneration had to be viewed in the context of the wider economic outlook. \u201cClearly we need to cut costs but ... we don\u2019t have the specifics at this stage. We\u2019re in the middle of that conversation.\u201d On the subject of the calendar, Sweeney has already made clear a total wipeout of international rugby in Europe for the remainder of this year would have a \u201ccatastrophic impact\u201d on the game in England and cost the RFU a total of \u00a3122m in revenue. Hence the desire to stage whatever fixtures might be possible this autumn, with three options on the table. The first \u2013 and most improbable given the current issues surrounding long-haul international travel \u2013 is to proceed with the four scheduled Tests against New Zealand, Argentina, Tonga and Australia in November. If those cannot take place, there are tentative plans in place for a \u201chome and away\u201d Six Nations which would also incorporate the scheduled 2021 fixtures. The third option is for a separate \u201cfestival of rugby\u201d tournament involving the Six Nations and a couple of invitational sides. The deadline for confirming any revised November schedule will be August, effectively giving the global game two months in which to resolve a huge pile of conflicting priorities. As things stand, however, there is no question of the remaining 2020 Six Nations fixtures not being played, even if they clash with major European club finals in October. \u201cClosing off those four remaining games in that autumn window is very much on the cards,\u201d said Sweeney. Whatever happens Sweeney is optimistic that, subject to government approval, some spectators could be admitted to Twickenham. \u201cWe\u2019re still working on the basis that we will get some attendance there.\u201d The RFU, meanwhile, will not stand in the way of moving the Six Nations deeper into spring if required. \u201cWith regard to the Six Nations, we said from day one that if it works for the best interests of the game we would be prepared to move it, by a month or a couple of months or whatever,\u201d said Sweeney. For as long as physical distancing remains a compulsory requirement, however, there is no certainty as to when the community game will be able to restart. The RFU says there are three possible dates for the commencement of the club season, with the worst-case scenario involving no amateur rugby before January.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 5 June. Top stories The leading medical journal the Lancet has retracted a paper responsible for halting global trials of hydroxychloroquine in relation to Covid-19, with its editor, Richard Horton, describing the data behind the research, provided by a little-known US company, Surgisphere, as \u201ca shocking example of research misconduct\u201d. Control trials established by the World Health Organization and several countries around the world had been suspended on the basis of the paper\u2019s findings but an investigation by Guardian Australia\u2019s Melissa Davey has exposed how experts around the globe had doubts about the accuracy of the data provided by Surgisphere. The family of George Floyd and invitees including the Rev Jesse Jackson have conducted a memorial service in Minneapolis, the first of three planned across the US. The civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton delivered the eulogy, calling for greater rights and protections for all Americans in dealing with the police. Meanwhile, a movement to reduce law enforcement budgets across the US has attracted \u201cunprecedented\u201d support, including from legislators, with advocates saying reinvesting the money in services would be a powerful way to reverse police brutality and killings. In Georgia, a state investigator has alleged in court that the white shooter of the black jogger Ahmaud Arbery was heard using a racial slur shortly after mortally wounding the unarmed 25-year-old. Brazil has overtaken Italy\u2019s Covid-19 tally to register the third-highest officially recorded toll globally, after a record 1,349 deaths took its number to 32,500. Mexico also reported a record daily tally of more than 1,000 deaths, with experts suggesting worse could yet be to come across Latin America in coming months. The director of Brazil\u2019s Institute for Health Policy Studies expressed his extreme worry that exiting lockdown has proceeded too prematurely, warning: \u201c[We] are going to witness hospitals collapsing in almost every state.\u201d In Iran, the government has confirmed a record daily rate of new infections \u2013 even higher than the first wave experienced in March. In the UK, the transport secretary has announced that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport from 15 June. Australia A $9.3m government scheme to deliver emergency food supplies to older Australians isolating during Covid-19 delivered just 38 of a predicted 36,000 food boxes, the Department of Health has confirmed. The opposition\u2019s aged care spokeswoman, Julie Collins, said Australians over 70 had been \u201cleft to slip through the cracks\u201d. A rival $50m Meals on Wheels program has been blamed for \u201clow demand\u201d. Commissioners handpicked by Scott Morrison for the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission are attracting scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest, with the prime minister\u2019s department refusing to release \u201cin confidence\u201d disclosures from members including the chair and former Fortescue Metals boss, Nev Power. A new national security test will be added to Australia\u2019s foreign investment regime, allowing the federal treasurer to vet any significant investments in businesses that have national security ramifications. Previously, purchases up to nearly $1.2bn could take place without screening. The world German public prosecutors investigating a new lead suspect in the Madeleine McCann abduction case believe the British girl is dead. Madeleine disappeared in Portugal in 2007, aged three, but police are still appealing to members of the public to come forward with information pertaining to the suspect. A 14-month siege of Libya\u2019s capital Tripoli by the renegade general Khalifa Haftar has been lifted after Turkish-backed troops aligned with the UN-recognised government forced the rebels to retreat to strongholds in the country\u2019s south and east. More than 300 animals and plants endemic to Canada are facing the threat of extinction, with only 10% considered \u201cglobally secure\u201d or \u201capparently secure\u201d, according to a major new study that was two years in the making. More than a century after it was torn down by a revolutionary mob, a replica of a historic 17th century statue of the Virgin Mary has been restored to its original place in Prague. The baroque figurine, erected in 1652, had been seen as a symbol of Hapsburg oppression during the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Recommended reads As humans stayed inside due to the coronavirus, many animals increasingly came outside. And with restrictions easing, writes Susan Gough Henly, from swimming with cuttlefish to walking with wombats, there\u2019s probably never been a better time for a low-impact wilderness encounter. Here\u2019s eight of the best to consider. It used to be all about cooking with coconut oil \u2013 so when did wellness advocates suddenly start peddling rightwing conspiracies, Brigid Delaney asks. \u201cMemes turning up on Maga pages were being reposted by yoga teachers who once quoted Maya Angelou but were now quoting David Icke.\u201d And while it sounds like mere silliness, when one in five young Australians thinks there\u2019s a link between 5G technology and the spread of Covid-19, it\u2019s a dangerous example of \u201cfusion paranoia\u201d. It started as an \u201cabove-average workplace comedy\u201d but Tina Fey\u2019s 30 Rock became the master of the long-running gag, writes Andrew P Street. From Jack Donaghy\u2019s dismissive refrain of \u201cgood god, Lemon\u201d to constantly evolving support characters, this trailblazing comedy is able to rise above the occasional poorly aged joke. Listen After widespread protests in the US after the killing of George Floyd, people are also taking to the streets in Australia. On this episode of Full Story, Indigenous affairs editor Lorena Allam examines Australia\u2019s shameful record on Indigenous deaths in custody. Full Story is Guardian Australia\u2019s news podcast.

Nadal stressed the game\u2019s need to \u201cbe a positive example for society\u201d, and said being responsible in the messages the game sends is a key part of that. The New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees has issued a heartfelt apology after leading US athletes included LeBron James and his own teammates criticised an interview he gave in which he stated his opposition to Colin Kaepernick\u2019s 2016 anthem protests. Chelsea appear poised to beat Liverpool to the \u00a353m signature of German international Timo Werner, with the RB Leipzig striker reportedly eyeing a five-year contract.

The couple, who were already spending about 60% of their joint monthly income on rent, explained that they could no longer afford to keep up payments. \u201cThe landlord replied that the rent was due and he could not give us a discount \u2026 Landlords are not not interested in negotiating, they just want the money.\u201d Just under a quarter of all private renters were currently worried about paying their rent, rising to 31% for households with children, according to survey findings published on Thursday by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF). It said 42% of private renters reported reduced income under the coronavirus lockdown. Approximately half of tenants who asked their landlord for a rent holiday in recent weeks have been refused, according to the Resolution Foundation. Its survey found 13% of private renters had failed to cover housing costs under lockdown, while 17% of social renters had gone into \u2013 or further into \u2013 rent arrears. There are about 8 million renters in the UK, of whom 4.5 million have private landlords, with the remainder renting from social landlords such as councils and housing associations. There are fears that without robust new protections, rent payment problems \u2013 and homelessness \u2013 will grow hugely if the unwinding of Covid-19 support programmes such as the government\u2019s job retention scheme from August leads to high levels of unemployment. A government spokesperson said it was carefully considering the next steps on how best to support tenants and landlords to ensure fairness in the rental market. \u201cThe government has taken unprecedented action to support renters during the pandemic to ensure no one can be forced from their home \u2013 we have always said we will keep these measures under review and can extend if necessary.\u201d Ministers are also under pressure to increase the amount of housing support available to tenants through universal credit and the wider benefit system. Levels of housing allowance were frozen for four years before April as part of austerity measures and have fallen way behind actual rents in many areas. Renters in a two-bedroom property who are eligible for all their rent to be covered must make up a gap between rent and housing support of up to \u00a31,750 a month in parts of London, \u00a3150 a month in Brighton and \u00a380 a month in Liverpool, the JRF said. \u2022 Due to an editing error an earlier version of this story said that 5% of tenants who had asked for a rent holiday had been refused. That should have been half of all tenants.",

The health ministry said elimination of the coronavirus could be declared 28 days after the last confirmed domestic case of the illness had left quarantine, which would be on 15 June (Wilson said the ministry\u2019s definition was especially cautious).</p> <h2>\u2018Something like normal back\u2019</h2> <p>While many other nations, Britain among them, attempt to balance easing restrictions on their stalled economies with determining acceptable levels of risk for their populations, New Zealand\u2019s government is poised to drop all rules except border controls as soon as next week. Its leaders hope the virus\u2019 spread might have been quelled altogether.</p> <p>\u201cLife is not entirely back to normal here, but we\u2019ve got something like normal back,\u201d says Shaun Hendy, a scientist at the University of Auckland, who was involved in a study used by New Zealand\u2019s health ministry that predicted tens of thousands of deaths if the virus was not contained. \u201cThere\u2019s a very high chance that we\u2019ve eliminated the disease domestically and there\u2019s so few parts of the world that have the options and choices we do.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/ardern-says-new-zealand-on-track-to-eliminate-coronavirus-ahead-of-schedule\">Ardern says New Zealand on track to eliminate coronavirus 'ahead of schedule'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The veteran science communicator said he had been \u201cliterally shaking\u201d after a breakfast television interview that took place before prime minister Jacinda Ardern strictly locked down the country on 25 March, during which he discussed his team\u2019s \u201cconfronting\u201d predictions for how the disease could spread.</p> <p>\u201cBoth doing the modelling and then telling people about it was quite terrifying and very affecting,\u201d says Hendy. At the time, about 200 people in New Zealand were confirmed to be infected with Covid-19. Then New Zealanders were barred from leaving their homes for a month and Hendy\u2019s models never came to pass.</p> <p>Now, fewer than 1,500 have been confirmed infected, and many New Zealanders still don\u2019t know anyone who is known to have had it. In Wellington, the capital, the last person confirmed to have survived the coronavirus was recorded as recovered more than three weeks ago.</p> <p>As well as the binary-code daily pattern of zero cases or one new case \u2013 a daily news conference by health officials also serves to update New Zealanders on the status of the last known patient confirmed to have it.</p> <p>The lone sufferer, an anonymous Auckland woman, is not in hospital. On the day she is declared recovered, and if no new cases are recorded before then, New Zealanders will be eager to close the book on a strange chapter in the country\u2019s history. Many seem divided between a desire to return to normal life and nerves about doing so.</p> <p>Some 487,000 people \u2013 or a 10th of the population \u2013 have registered for a government contact-tracing app and in Wellington, uptake seems piecemeal. Most businesses in Wellington provide some sort of contact tracing \u2013 very few of them using the official government app, with most preferring alternative apps or websites \u2013 and scarcely any ask to see that customers have signed in. By and large it\u2019s an honour system, suggesting a widespread presumption that the virus has vanished.</p> <h2>When can we have an elimination party?</h2> <p>But health officials have resiled from trumpeting an \u201celimination date\u201d when the country is deemed free of the coronavirus. Elimination is \u201can ongoing process\u201d, New Zealand\u2019s director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, told reporters on Wednesday. Even the top health official\u2019s naturally cautious demeanour, however, has given way to optimism at his near-daily briefings in recent weeks.</p> <p>\u201cI know there has been speculation about when we might be able to say, \u2018Here is the point we have eliminated Covid-19,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt may well be [when] there is no domestic transmission or domestic onshore infection of Covid-19, and it would be great if we reached that point and it increasingly looks like we are.\u201d</p> <p>New Zealand has drawn the world\u2019s attention as generating an exceptional approach to vanquishing the virus \u2013 which Wilson says was part luck and part action.</p> <p>\u201cIt could be that the sheer intensity of New Zealand\u2019s lockdown has given it an extra edge in this accelerated downward trend,\u201d said Wilson, the scientist, adding that the shutdown measures were \u201csome of the most intense in the world\u201d.</p> <p>New Zealand had not gotten everything right, however; the country\u2019s isolation had provided some buffer for the virus; it takes 24 hours to travel by plane to the island nation from the northern hemisphere. But mask-wearing never caught on in the country, Wilson says \u2013 officials have never recommended it \u2013 and contact tracing has been seriously lacking until it was beefed up during the strictest weeks of lockdown.</p> <p>Clear and unifying communication from prime minister Jacinda Ardern \u2013 who rallied the small nation with near-daily speeches that appealed for compassion and teamwork \u2013 was \u201ca big part of the success story\u201d, Wilson says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89a0815d380ad4ffc324e52399942db5a81b65c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89a0815d380ad4ffc324e52399942db5a81b65c7/0_148_7276_4366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children enjoy the outdoors once again in Christchurch, New Zealand.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children enjoy the outdoors once again in Christchurch, New Zealand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kai Schw\u00f6rer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the weeks have worn on, the lockdown measures have become increasingly politicised, with Ardern\u2019s detractors urging her to abandon the remaining physical distancing and gathering rules immediately, rather than waiting until next week to decide as she plans to.</p> <p>But New Zealanders have overwhelmingly supported the lockdown measures; 88% of those polled in April said they approved of the government\u2019s approach, and Ardern has soared to record approval ratings during the crisis.</p> <p>The scale of job losses has yet to be realised \u2013 Treasury predictions begin at 8.5% and stretch as high as around 25% \u2013 but some analysts said people\u2019s confidence in their government and health system was more important to stimulate spending than lifting lockdown measures.</p> <p>Shamubeel Eaqub, an economist with Sense Partners in Auckland says that when some US states reopened for business, people\u2019s wallets did not; he adds that New Zealand\u2019s stricter lockdown has not so far resulted in more job losses than in comparable countries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/vast-majority-of-new-zealanders-dont-want-to-return-to-office-after-covid-19\">Vast majority of New Zealanders don't want to return to office after Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the days of zero new cases tick by, even New Zealand\u2019s infectious disease specialists, some of whom sounded the alarm on what they said was woeful contact tracing and health system underpreparedness early in the pandemic, are urging celebration.</p> <p>\u201cCan we please start planning the Covid-19 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drayeshaverrall/status/1266180232605622272\">elimination party?</a>\u201d said one, Ayesha Verrall \u2013 a physician at the University of Otago \u2013 on Twitter, adding that a consensus was still needed on what such a date would be. \u201cBut we can start thinking about the music, venue, snacks and who is coming.\u201d</p> <p>Elimination would require strong border controls, high rates of testing, and a public health system \u201cat the ready,\u201d she added.</p> <p>\u201cBut if we make it to 28 days it would be such a massive achievement and we would deserve a party.\u201d</p>",

Its leaders hope the virus\u2019 spread might have been quelled altogether. \u201cLife is not entirely back to normal here, but we\u2019ve got something like normal back,\u201d says Shaun Hendy, a scientist at the University of Auckland, who was involved in a study used by New Zealand\u2019s health ministry that predicted tens of thousands of deaths if the virus was not contained. \u201cThere\u2019s a very high chance that we\u2019ve eliminated the disease domestically and there\u2019s so few parts of the world that have the options and choices we do.\u201d The veteran science communicator said he had been \u201cliterally shaking\u201d after a breakfast television interview that took place before prime minister Jacinda Ardern strictly locked down the country on 25 March, during which he discussed his team\u2019s \u201cconfronting\u201d predictions for how the disease could spread. \u201cBoth doing the modelling and then telling people about it was quite terrifying and very affecting,\u201d says Hendy. At the time, about 200 people in New Zealand were confirmed to be infected with Covid-19. Then New Zealanders were barred from leaving their homes for a month and Hendy\u2019s models never came to pass. Now, fewer than 1,500 have been confirmed infected, and many New Zealanders still don\u2019t know anyone who is known to have had it. In Wellington, the capital, the last person confirmed to have survived the coronavirus was recorded as recovered more than three weeks ago. As well as the binary-code daily pattern of zero cases or one new case \u2013 a daily news conference by health officials also serves to update New Zealanders on the status of the last known patient confirmed to have it. The lone sufferer, an anonymous Auckland woman, is not in hospital. On the day she is declared recovered, and if no new cases are recorded before then, New Zealanders will be eager to close the book on a strange chapter in the country\u2019s history. Many seem divided between a desire to return to normal life and nerves about doing so. Some 487,000 people \u2013 or a 10th of the population \u2013 have registered for a government contact-tracing app and in Wellington, uptake seems piecemeal. Most businesses in Wellington provide some sort of contact tracing \u2013 very few of them using the official government app, with most preferring alternative apps or websites \u2013 and scarcely any ask to see that customers have signed in. By and large it\u2019s an honour system, suggesting a widespread presumption that the virus has vanished. When can we have an elimination party? But health officials have resiled from trumpeting an \u201celimination date\u201d when the country is deemed free of the coronavirus. Elimination is \u201can ongoing process\u201d, New Zealand\u2019s director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, told reporters on Wednesday. Even the top health official\u2019s naturally cautious demeanour, however, has given way to optimism at his near-daily briefings in recent weeks. \u201cI know there has been speculation about when we might be able to say, \u2018Here is the point we have eliminated Covid-19,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt may well be [when] there is no domestic transmission or domestic onshore infection of Covid-19, and it would be great if we reached that point and it increasingly looks like we are.\u201d New Zealand has drawn the world\u2019s attention as generating an exceptional approach to vanquishing the virus \u2013 which Wilson says was part luck and part action. \u201cIt could be that the sheer intensity of New Zealand\u2019s lockdown has given it an extra edge in this accelerated downward trend,\u201d said Wilson, the scientist, adding that the shutdown measures were \u201csome of the most intense in the world\u201d. New Zealand had not gotten everything right, however; the country\u2019s isolation had provided some buffer for the virus; it takes 24 hours to travel by plane to the island nation from the northern hemisphere. But mask-wearing never caught on in the country, Wilson says \u2013 officials have never recommended it \u2013 and contact tracing has been seriously lacking until it was beefed up during the strictest weeks of lockdown. Clear and unifying communication from prime minister Jacinda Ardern \u2013 who rallied the small nation with near-daily speeches that appealed for compassion and teamwork \u2013 was \u201ca big part of the success story\u201d, Wilson says. As the weeks have worn on, the lockdown measures have become increasingly politicised, with Ardern\u2019s detractors urging her to abandon the remaining physical distancing and gathering rules immediately, rather than waiting until next week to decide as she plans to. But New Zealanders have overwhelmingly supported the lockdown measures; 88% of those polled in April said they approved of the government\u2019s approach, and Ardern has soared to record approval ratings during the crisis. The scale of job losses has yet to be realised \u2013 Treasury predictions begin at 8.5% and stretch as high as around 25% \u2013 but some analysts said people\u2019s confidence in their government and health system was more important to stimulate spending than lifting lockdown measures. Shamubeel Eaqub, an economist with Sense Partners in Auckland says that when some US states reopened for business, people\u2019s wallets did not; he adds that New Zealand\u2019s stricter lockdown has not so far resulted in more job losses than in comparable countries. As the days of zero new cases tick by, even New Zealand\u2019s infectious disease specialists, some of whom sounded the alarm on what they said was woeful contact tracing and health system underpreparedness early in the pandemic, are urging celebration. \u201cCan we please start planning the Covid-19 elimination party?\u201d said one, Ayesha Verrall \u2013 a physician at the University of Otago \u2013 on Twitter, adding that a consensus was still needed on what such a date would be. \u201cBut we can start thinking about the music, venue, snacks and who is coming.\u201d Elimination would require strong border controls, high rates of testing, and a public health system \u201cat the ready,\u201d she added. \u201cBut if we make it to 28 days it would be such a massive achievement and we would deserve a party.\u201d",

Hospitals will also face a big backlog of care for cardiac patients once they resume their full range of services.</p> \n<p>People affected by the suspension of NHS services include those waiting to have a stent fitted to unblock an artery, a pacemaker implanted or echocardiography.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The BHF is worried that postponed surgery will increase the risk of patients who are already medically vulnerable suffering complications and setbacks to their health.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople with heart and circulatory diseases are already at increased risk of dying from Covid-19, and their lives should not be put at even greater risk by missing out on treatment for their condition\u201d, said Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, the BHF\u2019s associate medical director.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt the very least 28,000 planned inpatient heart procedures have been deferred in response to the Covid-19 outbreak in England alone.

      "bodyText": "Tens of thousands of people with heart problems are at risk because they have not had potentially life-saving surgery during the coronavirus pandemic, a leading charity has said. At least 28,000 patients in England have missed out on cardiac surgery since March, when hospitals suspended many normal services to focus on Covid-19, the British Heart Foundation (BHF) says. Not undergoing treatment could damage people\u2019s health and even result in deaths. Hospitals will also face a big backlog of care for cardiac patients once they resume their full range of services. People affected by the suspension of NHS services include those waiting to have a stent fitted to unblock an artery, a pacemaker implanted or echocardiography. The BHF is worried that postponed surgery will increase the risk of patients who are already medically vulnerable suffering complications and setbacks to their health. \u201cPeople with heart and circulatory diseases are already at increased risk of dying from Covid-19, and their lives should not be put at even greater risk by missing out on treatment for their condition\u201d, said Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, the BHF\u2019s associate medical director. \u201cAt the very least 28,000 planned inpatient heart procedures have been deferred in response to the Covid-19 outbreak in England alone. This backlog will only get larger and the patients in need of treatment could get sicker as their care is delayed further. \u201cIf hospital investigations are delayed too long it can result in preventable permanent long-term complications such as heart failure,\u201d she said. A separate YouGov survey for the BHF of 1,484 people with heart problems and circulatory diseases found that 47% have found it harder to access treatment during the pandemic. Of those 41% had a planned test, operation or other procedure postponed or cancelled and 48% cited difficulty getting a face-to-face appointment. Many others were reluctant to seek NHS care because they were anxious. Forty-two per cent said they did not want to add to the pressure on the NHS during the pandemic, and 27% said they were scared they would catch Covid-19 if they went into hospital. NHS leaders have acknowledged that the suspension of so much normal care, combined with people\u2019s fear of going to A&amp;E or seeing a GP in case they catch coronavirus, may have led to some people dying. Health experts believe it will be many months before the NHS is able to start seeing the number of patients it did before the pandemic. A possible second wave of infections, the fact that many NHS staff are exhausted and constraints on the number of patients who can be in hospital because of physical distancing, will all hamper hospitals\u2019 ability to get back to normal, according to Nigel Edwards, the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust thinktank.",

class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>UK </strong>researchers have called for the use of additional coronavirus symptoms to detect new cases, reduce infections and save lives.</p> \n  <p>In a letter published in The Lancet journal, the King\u2019s College London team discussed how loss of taste and smell should form part of screening measures for the virus.</p> \n  <p>The researchers, led by Professor Tim Spector, previously reported that loss of smell and taste is a key predictor of Covid-19 in addition to the most established symptoms of a high temperature and a new, continuous cough.</p> \n  <p>On May 18, the symptoms were added to the NHS coronavirus symptoms list, weeks after experts first raised concerns that Covid-19 cases were being missed.</p> \n  <p>However, the importance of the symptom was disputed by some.</p> \n  <p>The researchers\u2019 additional analysis of the Covid Symptom Study app data and its 3.7 million users sought to quantify the clinical value of recording loss of smell in the population.</p> \n  <p>They said: \u201cAs countries slowly emerge from lockdown measures, it is imperative to correctly contact-trace infected individuals.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe believe that having added loss of smell and taste to the list of Covid-19 symptoms is of great value as it will help tracing almost 16% of cases that otherwise would have been missed.\u201d</p> \n  <p>From 76,260 people with symptoms who tested positive for coronavirus up to May 19, 28.5% never reported any fever or cough and 16% reported loss of smell but not fever or cough.</p> \n  <p>Researchers say the prevalence of loss of smell and taste was three-fold higher in individuals testing positive (65%) than in those testing negative (22%), the strongest single predictor of being infected.</p> \n  <p>They suggest this means people with loss of smell and taste should self-isolate for at least seven days or until they can be tested.</p> \n  <p>Prof Spector said: \u201cWe believe that loss of smell and taste is a very common Covid-19 symptom, and in fact occurs more often than fever and lasts longer (five days on average compared to only two for fever).</p> \n  <p>\u201cInfections could be reduced and lives saved now that this non-flu-like symptom is widely recognised and actions are taken.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The researchers suggest that policymakers should consider these findings and their implications for mass screening as part of other public health measures in key areas such as schools, hospitals, airports and care homes.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed976798f0831e23dc1967d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time

<strong>Brazil\u2019s</strong> indigenous populations with deaths caused by the disease increasing more than five-fold in the past month, according to data.</p> \n  <p> Many epidemiologists had hoped remote locations might protect the tribes, but the virus, which first took hold in state capitals of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, is increasingly devastating these far-flung communities where basic healthcare is often precarious.</p> \n  <p> Deaths among Brazil\u2019s indigenous populations rose to 182 by June 1, from 28 at the end of April, according to the Articulation of Brazil\u2019s Indigenous Peoples (APIB), a national umbrella association that brings together the country\u2019s 305 tribes.</p> \n  <p>In the village of Soror\u00f3 in southeastern Par\u00e1, tribesman

England from June 15.<br></p> \n  <p>However, face-covering measures can help prevent the spread of Covid-19 and \u201cshould not be restricted to public transport\u201d, according to BMA council chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul.</p> \n  <p>Dr Nagpaul said the risk of the virus would be \u201cmuch less\u201d if the public wears face coverings straight away instead of waiting for the mid-June start date.</p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cThe BMA recently advocated the wearing of face coverings by the public several weeks ago in areas where they cannot socially distance and believes it is right that people should be required to wear face coverings on public transport.</p> \n  <p>\u201cGiven there remains a considerable risk of infection, with thousands of new cases every day, wearing masks can reduce the spread of the virus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cNot only will this afford greater protection to the public, importantly it will protect the lives of the staff working on public transport who, as evidence suggests, are at greater risk of infection.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese important measures should not be restricted to public transport but to all areas where social distancing is not always possible - the risk will be much less if the public adopts this now - not mid-June.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed96e038f0854eb54d99115\" class=\"block\"

and nights of demonstrations in the state after the killing of George Floyd could accelerate the spread of coronavirus and urged protesters to get tested.</p> \n  <p>He noted that an estimated 30,000 people have protested in the state. <br> Officials in <strong>Chicago </strong>this week expressed similar concern, and asked protesters to quarantine themselves for 14 days.</p> \n  <p>Cuomo said his concern about increased spread of the virus during the demonstrations would not impede the state\u2019s regionally phased reopening, which is set to allow New York City to open on Monday for limited economic activity.</p> \n  <p>With more people wearing face coverings, the state has made significant progress in halting the spread, as reflected in a drop in the rate of people testing positive for the virus over the past six weeks to 2% from 26%, he said.</p> \n  <p>The number of hospitalised Covid-19 patients also continued trending lower, he added.</p> \n  <p>Cuomo said: \u201cI\u2019m not a nervous Nellie, I\u2019m just looking at the numbers.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMany wear masks. But there is no social distancing. Police are in their face ...

The airline has since said that no one was found to be infected when they boarded the plane in Doha. </p> \n  <p>Speaking on Skai TV today, professor Nikolaos Sypsas, a member of the scientific committee that advises the government, said tourism would be \u201cthe first candidate\u201d for restrictive measures being reinstated in the event of a recurrence. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWith tourism comes imported cases. Despite the efforts underway to have the least possible danger, the risk remains.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Greek authorities, enforcing emergency health protocols, suspended flights to and from Qatar and quarantined all those on board - for 14 days in the case of those who tested positive, and an initial seven days for those who tested negative. If found to be clear at the end of a week those cleared of the virus will be free to go. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe incident has shown how complicated tourism is,\u201d said professor Sypsas.

The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to underestimate the scale of the pandemic.</li> \n   <li><strong>A survey has shown increasing scepticism over governments\u2019 handling of the coronavirus crisis, with the UK suffering the biggest slump in confidence</strong>. In May, in G7 nations as a whole, 48% of respondents approved of how authorities had handled the pandemic, down from 50% in April and 54% in March.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil registered a record number of daily deaths from the novel coronavirus for a second consecutive day on Wednesday</strong>, even as city and state authorities move to open back up.

The authorities closed the borders to everybody but Spaniards, cross-border workers and truck drivers from mid-March when the country went into lockdown.</li> \n   <li><strong>China on Thursday said foreign airlines blocked from operating in the country over virus fears would be allowed to resume limited flights, lifting a de facto ban on US carriers</strong>, Agence France-Presse reports. This comes a day after Washington ordered the suspension of all Chinese travel into and out of the US.</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico overtook the United States in daily reported deaths from coronavirus for the first time on Wednesday</strong>. The health ministry registered a record 1,092 fatalities and attributed the increase to improvements in documenting the pandemic.

An EU official said it was necessary to do as the United States was doing, even if this meant losing money as many of the vaccines under development are unlikely to be eventually successful.</p> \n  <p>The bloc is ready to take higher financial risks as it fears otherwise not having rapid access to a vaccine against the virus that has killed 385,000 people worldwide. The ESI fund is run by the European Commission, the EU executive arm, which acts on behalf of the 27 EU states.</p> \n  <p>German Health Minister Jens Spahn and his colleagues from France, Italy and the Netherlands wrote to the Commission saying they had joined up to \u201cachieve the fastest and best possible outcome in negotiations with key players in the pharmaceutical industry\u201d, German newspaper Handelsblatt wrote on Thursday.<br></p> \n  <p>The paper cited government sources as saying Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands were talking to several pharmaceutical firms including AstraZeneca about government research funds and purchase guarantees.<br></p> \n  <p>AstraZeneca was not immediately available for a comment.<br></p> \n  <p>The four were also talking to Britain, Norway, Singapore and Japan about possible cooperation.</p> \n  <p>The EU is also worried that not enough doses might be available to rapidly vaccinate its population of nearly 450 million if a vaccine against the new coronavirus is developed. It is working on a vaccination strategy to give priority to the people most in need, like medics, nurses and the elderly. It remains unclear how the EU initiative will be coordinated with plans by individual member states to secure vaccines from pharmaceutical companies. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed8af3f8f0893539f4cfd51\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T08:31:08.709Z\">9.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ddb1c21a02b2565888a961744535a89f27c7f73\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ddb1c21a02b2565888a961744535a89f27c7f73/0_176_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People queue to refill their empty oxygen cylinders in Callao, Peru.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People queue to refill their empty oxygen cylinders in Callao, Peru.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ernesto Benavides/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36c3305adddd0b9a69007f59f0304cb50a07e708\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36c3305adddd0b9a69007f59f0304cb50a07e708/0_300_4495_2697/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People queue to refill their empty oxygen cylinders in Callao, Peru.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People queue to refill their empty oxygen cylinders in Callao, Peru.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ernesto Benavides/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed8a8e98f082107f453a7de\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T08:01:41.386Z\">9.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Interesting and important thread here by John Burn-Murdoch of the Financial Times, on the coronavirus data being released by the <strong>Spanish </strong>government.

In an attempt to bolster their narrative that they can run Afghanistan better than the struggling administration, the Taliban launched a campaign to tackle the virus in March. They posted images online showing insurgents distributing masks and soap to villagers - albeit without any social distancing. In one image, masked militants wearing white protective suits check residents\u2019 temperatures and explain about personal hygiene as a machine gun is seen on a nearby table.</p> \n  <p>The virus entered Afghanistan as infected migrants returned from neighbouring Iran, the region\u2019s worst-hit country, and the Taliban ordered hundreds of returnees into quarantine.<br></p> \n  <p>In some areas they controlled, the insurgents allowed government health officials to monitor the virus\u2019s spread, rare for a group blamed for the deaths of dozens of medics over the years. But in recent weeks, residents from provinces such as Kunduz, Helmand, Uruzgan and Kandahar - where the Taliban hold sway over large areas - complain they have been abandoned to their fate.</p> \n  <p>In Kunduz, where the militants fought a fierce night battle before a short nationwide ceasefire last month, insurgents have barred medics.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey said they would handle the virus on their own,\u201d said Sebghatullah, a doctor from a nearby district, worried about the residents\u2019 lack of awareness when it came to personal hygiene. </p> \n  <p>Haji Qudratullah, a resident of Helmand, said he recently saw a group of Taliban fighters film a promotional video at a neighbourhood clinic, but they never returned. \u201cI have not seen anybody do anything to raise awareness about the virus here,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1f25605d3d6c4ff37e254d2168c03456c42ebcf\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1f25605d3d6c4ff37e254d2168c03456c42ebcf/0_79_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Afghan tailor distributes free masks to the prisoners in Kandahar, Afghanistan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Muhammad Younis, right, an Afghan tailor distributes free masks to the prisoners in Kandahar, Afghanistan, last month.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Muhammad Sadiq/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Taliban commanders insist they are helping fight the virus. \u201cPeople who are suffering from high fever, cough and body pain ... are taken to Trinkot,\u201d said Hafez Mohammad, a Taliban commander, referring to the capital of Uruzgan province.</p> \n  <p>The disease is also sweeping through the Taliban itself, with several high-level militants believed to be sick, according to international media reports.

Andrei Kogankov is seven months into a four-month contract and was supposed to be replaced in mid-March in Qatar. But a few days before he arrived, Qatar imposed a lockdown and banned international flights. From there to South Korea, Japan, South Korea again and on to Singapore and Thailand, each time the same story: Lockdown. No flights. No going home.</p> \n   <p>The open-ended extension of his contract \u2014 and with it the responsibility for his 21-man crew and a ship carrying flammable cargo \u2014 is taking its toll.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWhen you are seven months on board, you are becoming physically and mentally exhausted,\u201d Kogankov said by satellite phone from Thailand. \u201cWe are working 24/7.

No, the vessel is running all the time.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Officers sign on for three to four months, the rest of the crew for around seven months. But they always have an end date. Take that away, and suddenly the prospect of endless workdays becomes a strain.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWe\u2019re gravely worried that there could be a higher increase of incidents and accidents. But we also are seeing a high level of what I would describe as anxiety and frustration,\u201d Cotton said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to get off a ship, that adds to a high level of anxiety that really is quite demoralizing.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Unless governments facilitate crew changes, Cotton warned, \u201cit\u2019s difficult for us to convince the seafarers not to take more dramatic action, and ... stop working.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed88f988f082107f453a72c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T06:07:25.113Z\">7.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Morning/evening/whatever-it-is-where-you-are everyone.

The taskforce\u2019s executive director, Associate Professor Julian Elliott, said while it was early days it was a significant step forward. Hi, Helen Sullivan joining you now. I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours. As always, I\u2019d be delighted to hear from you: please do get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com with comments, tips, questions or news from your part of the world. UK researchers have called for the use of additional coronavirus symptoms to detect new cases, reduce infections and save lives. In a letter published in The Lancet journal, the King\u2019s College London team discussed how loss of taste and smell should form part of screening measures for the virus. The researchers, led by Professor Tim Spector, previously reported that loss of smell and taste is a key predictor of Covid-19 in addition to the most established symptoms of a high temperature and a new, continuous cough. On May 18, the symptoms were added to the NHS coronavirus symptoms list, weeks after experts first raised concerns that Covid-19 cases were being missed. However, the importance of the symptom was disputed by some. The researchers\u2019 additional analysis of the Covid Symptom Study app data and its 3.7 million users sought to quantify the clinical value of recording loss of smell in the population. They said: \u201cAs countries slowly emerge from lockdown measures, it is imperative to correctly contact-trace infected individuals. \u201cWe believe that having added loss of smell and taste to the list of Covid-19 symptoms is of great value as it will help tracing almost 16% of cases that otherwise would have been missed.\u201d From 76,260 people with symptoms who tested positive for coronavirus up to May 19, 28.5% never reported any fever or cough and 16% reported loss of smell but not fever or cough. Researchers say the prevalence of loss of smell and taste was three-fold higher in individuals testing positive (65%) than in those testing negative (22%), the strongest single predictor of being infected. They suggest this means people with loss of smell and taste should self-isolate for at least seven days or until they can be tested. Prof Spector said: \u201cWe believe that loss of smell and taste is a very common Covid-19 symptom, and in fact occurs more often than fever and lasts longer (five days on average compared to only two for fever). \u201cInfections could be reduced and lives saved now that this non-flu-like symptom is widely recognised and actions are taken.\u201d The researchers suggest that policymakers should consider these findings and their implications for mass screening as part of other public health measures in key areas such as schools, hospitals, airports and care homes. Coronavirus is spreading fast through Brazil\u2019s indigenous populations with deaths caused by the disease increasing more than five-fold in the past month, according to data. Many epidemiologists had hoped remote locations might protect the tribes, but the virus, which first took hold in state capitals of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, is increasingly devastating these far-flung communities where basic healthcare is often precarious. Deaths among Brazil\u2019s indigenous populations rose to 182 by June 1, from 28 at the end of April, according to the Articulation of Brazil\u2019s Indigenous Peoples (APIB), a national umbrella association that brings together the country\u2019s 305 tribes. In the village of Soror\u00f3 in southeastern Par\u00e1, tribesman Itamar\u00e9 Suru\u00ed said one elder had died and people were falling ill but the government had not provided tests to confirm whether they have COVID-19. Compulsory face-covering measures should be introduced to \u201call areas\u201d where social distancing is not possible in the UK, the British Medical Association (BMA) said. Transport secretary Grant Shapps announced that wearing a covering will be mandatory on public transport in England from June 15. However, face-covering measures can help prevent the spread of Covid-19 and \u201cshould not be restricted to public transport\u201d, according to BMA council chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul. Dr Nagpaul said the risk of the virus would be \u201cmuch less\u201d if the public wears face coverings straight away instead of waiting for the mid-June start date. He said: \u201cThe BMA recently advocated the wearing of face coverings by the public several weeks ago in areas where they cannot socially distance and believes it is right that people should be required to wear face coverings on public transport. \u201cGiven there remains a considerable risk of infection, with thousands of new cases every day, wearing masks can reduce the spread of the virus. \u201cNot only will this afford greater protection to the public, importantly it will protect the lives of the staff working on public transport who, as evidence suggests, are at greater risk of infection. \u201cThese important measures should not be restricted to public transport but to all areas where social distancing is not always possible - the risk will be much less if the public adopts this now - not mid-June.\u201d The front page of the UK edition of The Guardian. Turkey will impose a weekend lockdown in 15 cities as part of efforts to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, the interior ministry said. In a statement, the ministry said bakeries and certain shops could operate during the lockdown. Turkey has had 167,410 Covid-19 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. Around 600 people attended a funeral in the Spanish city of Seville to honour those who have died in the pandemic. Many of the seats in Seville\u2019s cathedral were reserved for families of the victims and authorities in what is one of the largest gatherings in the country since the lockdown began in March. The cathedral, which is a World Heritage site, accommodated the mourners under strict safety conditions, as a 53-person choir led by four soloists and accompanied by 27 musicians performed Mozart\u2019s Requiem. Spain has had over 240,000 confirmed cases and in excess of 27,000 deaths, according to its official figures. Long lines of cars snaked along Austria\u2019s frontier with Slovakia on Thursday after it lifted coronavirus-related border controls but motorists found they still faced lengthy checks on the Slovakian side. Vienna has announced it was lifting the restrictions at its land borders at midnight, except on the Italian frontier. Many European countries have said they will be following suit in the coming weeks and relax travel restrictions imposed at the beginning of the pandemic. \u201cSince yesterday, the news that Austria has lifted its controls is in all our media,\u201d said a cyclist from Bratislava, surprised that Slovak authorities were stopping him at the Berg border crossing. A Slovak police officer at the crossing, which is surrounded by fields, said vehicles had been gathering on Thursday for the first time in weeks. But some of those wanting to leave Austria fell foul of rules still in force in Slovakia. Anyone entering the country needs to show they have recently tested negative for the coronavirus or undergo a mandatory two-week quarantine. The only way to avoid quarantine is to produce a document proving they have spent less than 48 hours outside Slovakia - handy for those who want to nip across to visit family or shop in Austria. \u201cToo bad! I will come back when it is fully open,\u201d said Lazlo Turkazavo, who lives in Austria and wanted to go to Slovakia but decided to turn around after crossing proved more complicated than he had expected. As for Slovaks who work in Austria, they are still waiting for trains and buses to resume full service. Some of them could be seen crossing the border on foot, dragging heavy suitcases to load them into taxis on the Austrian side. For now, some checks at the border are also still being applied by several of Austria\u2019s other neighbours. Only Slovenia and Hungary have announced they will reciprocate the reopening from Friday and let in people travelling from Austria without checks. Italy for its part has opened its borders for EU citizens, including Austrians. But Austria had not reciprocated, saying the virus was still too prevalent in its hard-hit southern neighbour. South Africa has recorded 3,267 coronavirus cases in 24 hours, the biggest increase since the pandemic hit the country. Africa\u2019s biggest industrial power now has a total of 40,792 infections, the health ministry said. It saw a rise of 56 deaths, bring the total to 848. More than half of the cases are in the Western Cape region where health services are under pressure. The fatalities worldwide has reached 388,416, according to US-based Johns Hopkins University. The US has had 107,765 deaths, the highest of any country, followed by the UK with 39,987. Jordan is set to reopen hotels and cafes, allow sporting events behind closed doors and shorten a night-time curfew from Saturday, prime minister Omar al-Razzaz said. He said that toughening enforcement of social distancing measures was to ensure there is not a resurgence of infections. The country imposed a state of emergency in March, sealing its borders and enforcing a night curfew. There have been 757 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and nine deaths. Officials say new infections have dropped to less than 10 a day over the past week. Egypt\u2019s prosecutor-general has called for urgent legal action after a man reportedly arranged female genital mutilation (FGM) for his three young daughters and told them it was a treatment for Covid-19. The father and the doctor who performed the procedures have been referred to a criminal court. The incident was reported to the authorities by their mother who is divorced from the children\u2019s father. He is said to have told the girls they were being \u201cvaccinated\u201d for coronavirus. They were then reportedly drugged and FGM was carried out on them. Madagascar\u2019s education minister was sacked after announcing a plan to buy sweets for students to take the edge off the \u201cbitter taste\u201d of a herbal tea the president claims is a coronavirus remedy. Rijasoa Andriamanana said last week she was ordering $2.2 million worth of sweets to go with the Covid-Organics concoction, which experts have warned is useless against Covid-19. She told the press that \u201ca purchase of sweets and lollipops\u201d had been made with all students in the Indian Ocean island nation to receive three each. She added that it was for the \u201cbitter taste\u201d of the drink, which president Andry Rajoelina has been promoting for export, saying it is the country\u2019s \u201cgreen gold\u201d which will \u201cchange history\u201d. The potential benefits of Covid-Organics have not been validated by any scientific study. Andriamanana defended the plan, but it was not considered by the cabinet which relieved her of her duties. A $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) fund aimed at ensuring that poorer countries can access doses of a potential coronavirus vaccine has been unveiled at a virtual summit hosted by the UK. The announcement was made at the third Gavi vaccine alliance replenishment summit, a virtual pledging event that raised $8.8bn. New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, said several days and nights of demonstrations in the state after the killing of George Floyd could accelerate the spread of the coronavirus and urged protesters to get tested. He noted that an estimated 30,000 people have protested in the state. Grant Shapps, the UK\u2019s transport secretary, has announced that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in England from 15 June. He added that people can be refused permission to travel if they do not comply and could be fined. Low Covid-19 figures for Africa are \u201cbroadly accurate\u201d, the World Health Organization\u2019s director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, has said. There were concerns that low levels of testing, poor infrastructure and a lack of cooperation from some governments may be disguising the true extent of the disease\u2019s spread. US pandemic jobless claims passed 42 million after another 1.9 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week. The pace of layoffs has slowed dramatically from its peak of 6.6m at the start of April as states begin to relax quarantines. Last week was the ninth consecutive week of declines. Three of the authors of an influential article that found hydroxychloroquine increased the risk of death in COVID-19 patients have retracted the study after concerns about the quality of the data in the study. They said that Surgisphere, the company that provided the data, would not transfer the full data set for an independent review and they \u201ccan no longer vouch for the veracity of the primary data sources.\u201d The study was published in British medical journal the Lancet last month. Greece is \u201cmore than just sea and sun,\u201d the country\u2019s prime minister said as a campaign was launched to resurrect its economy from the coronavirus lockdown. \u201cWe are opening Greece\u2019s windows and doors to the world gradually but with optimism,\u201d premier Kyriakos Mitsotakis said. \u201cWhat we want to communicate is that Greek summer...is a state of mind. \u201cThe entire world probably needs this vacation more than ever before. \u201cEnjoy your Greek summer, wherever you are.\u201d Mitsotakis said the message was designed to entice even travellers unable to visit this year, looking forward to 2021 and 2022. He has already warned the country that the economy would fall into a \u201cdeep recession\u201d this year before rebounding in 2021. France reported 44 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals over the previous 24 hours, taking the official tally to 29,065 fatalities. The health ministry tally does not include deaths in care homes and other institutions with the latest inclusive update not due till June 9. Nationwide, France now lists 1,163 serious cases of Covid-19 who are in hospital on a ventilator, 47 fewer than Wednesday. Three-quarters of those are spread over just four regions - the Ile de France including Paris, the Grand-Est, Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes and Hauts-de-France. A second round of random testing in Spain for antibodies to coronavirus indicates that a third of those infected do not develop symptoms, health authorities said. It is not possible to control an outbreak by just considering those who are symptomatic, National Epidemiological Center Director, Marina Poll\u00e1n, said. With this number of asymptomatic cases, we must follow the recommendations for personal hygiene and social distancing, Poll\u00e1n added. Results from the latest round of the nationwide testing confirmed preliminary finding published three weeks ago showing that blood tests detected the IGG antibody against the virus in only 5% of the 63,000 participants. Researchers say that means Spain is far from having developed a herd immunity to COVID-19 and is still vulnerable to more outbreaks. Over 95% of the people tested in the first round continued in the study for the second round. There will be one more round of testing before the study concludes. The Health Ministrys virus expert, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, acknowledged that regional authorities are correcting their data and said he expects the national totals of deaths and infections to undergo revisions. The nationwide applause for NHS and key workers is now taking place in the UK. At 8pm in the UK, the weekly Clap for Carers will take place. It is expected to be a scaled down nationwide applause after the founder of the initiative called for it to end last week amid concerns it was becoming politicised. Organisers have scrapped plans to mandate physical distancing during President Donald Trump\u2019s appearance at a Mount Rushmore fireworks display on 3 July and will not limit the crowd size due to coronavirus concerns, South Dakota governor, Kristi Noem, has said. The Republican governor said the National Park Service was dolling out 7,500 tickets via a lottery for the event, which marks the first time in a decade that fireworks will be set off at the memorial in recognition of Independence Day. \u201cThere will be no better place to celebrate our independence,\u201d Noem said. \u201cWe are excited that President Trump will be joining us for this event.\u201d Organisers did not reduce the number of tickets due to the coronavirus pandemic and Noem added she was not concerned that an influx of tourists would heighten the risk. Coronavirus infections are on a downward trend in the state and hospitals are prepared to handle more infections if needed, she said. The governor added that people who do not get tickets to the event will be able to gather outside the monument grounds to watch the fireworks. Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has asked the country to remain calm, a day after health officials announced more than 1,000 new Covid-19 deaths, a figure that was more than double the previous toll reported in a single day. The reason for the sudden jump in deaths was attributable to a number of factors, including confirmation and inclusion of deaths stretching back as far as 25 days, health officials said. \u201cLet there not be psychosis, let there not be fear,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said, accusing the press of fanning fears. He tried to reassure Mexicans that 1,000 deaths registered in 24 hours is \u201cno cause for alarm\u201d. The country is passing through the epidemic\u2019s most critical moment with a dramatically increasing number of confirmed and suspected infections. The jump in reported deaths came in the first week after the federal government\u2019s official social distancing period ended as the president continued a week-long tour trying to reactivate the economy. L\u00f3pez Obrador said he would recommend tightened measures if there was a surge in infections. New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, said several days and nights of demonstrations in the state after the killing of George Floyd could accelerate the spread of coronavirus and urged protesters to get tested. He noted that an estimated 30,000 people have protested in the state. Officials in Chicago this week expressed similar concern, and asked protesters to quarantine themselves for 14 days. Cuomo said his concern about increased spread of the virus during the demonstrations would not impede the state\u2019s regionally phased reopening, which is set to allow New York City to open on Monday for limited economic activity. With more people wearing face coverings, the state has made significant progress in halting the spread, as reflected in a drop in the rate of people testing positive for the virus over the past six weeks to 2% from 26%, he said. The number of hospitalised Covid-19 patients also continued trending lower, he added. Cuomo said: \u201cI\u2019m not a nervous Nellie, I\u2019m just looking at the numbers. \u201cMany wear masks. But there is no social distancing. Police are in their face ... If you were at a protest, get a test, please.\u201d A second phase of activity, which New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said could start as early as July, will include outdoor restaurant seating. Researchers in Denmark have developed a fully automated robot that can take coronavirus swabs so that healthcare professionals are not exposed to the risk of infection, Reuters reports. Researchers from Southern University of Denmark (SDU) and Lifeline Robotics hope their prototype \u2018swab robot\u2019 can soon be deployed to relieve health professionals of the potentially risky task of testing patients. When a patient presents an ID-card, the robot prepares a sampling kit, performs the swab and puts the sample in a container ready for testing, explained Thiusius Rajeeth Savarimuthu, professor of robotics at SDU. In a video, Savarimuthi tested the robot on himself. He positioned his face with his chin in a plastic frame, opened his mouth wide, and allowed a robotic arm to stick a swab into the back of his throat and rotate it. Gypsy and Traveller communities in England have been left without water and sanitation facilities during the coronavirus lockdown, writes Jessica Murray in London. Families in England have no access to sanitation, refuse collection, or water for drinking, cooking, showering and washing clothes, the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) for Gypsies, Travellers and Roma (GRT) said in a letter to the Local Government Association. Some local authorities have directed vulnerable Travellers to uncleaned public toilets with no hand-washing facilities, the letter said, while others are attempting to evict camps. It stressed that these basic facilities were needed for communities to physically distance, self-isolate and follow guidelines on hand washing and hygiene. One Irish Traveller, Catherine*, who lives with her sister and two children, aged 12 and two, in south-east England, moved from an overcrowded site because she was worried about the risk of catching the virus from others. The family are now on public land outside a transit site closed due to Covid-19, and are struggling to access water and toilet facilities. The mother said: There\u2019s no other families on there, so we could use it to isolate, but the local authority won\u2019t let us. We have to drive to get to the water, and the toilets close at 6pm. We\u2019re usually fine with a public toilet, we\u2019ve used them hundreds of times before, but we don\u2019t want to risk infection. We\u2019re worried about not having water for the kids now it\u2019s getting warmer. It feels very depressing, we\u2019ve got no toilet, no nothing. We can\u2019t drive anywhere, because we don\u2019t have anywhere to go. It feels like they just don\u2019t care about us. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: A $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) fund aimed at ensuring that poorer countries can access doses of a potential coronavirus vaccine has been unveiled at a virtual summit hosted by the UK. The announcement was made at the third Gavi vaccine alliance replenishment summit, a virtual pledging event that raised $8.8bn. Activists in Norway were refused permission to hold rallies in support of US protests over the police killing of George Floyd, because of fears of the spread of coronavirus. Mohamed Awil, the president of the African student association UiO, said rallies were planned in Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim. Grant Shapps, the UK\u2019s transport secretary, has announced that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in England from 15 June. He added that people can be refused permission to travel if they do not comply and could be fined. Low Covid-19 figures for Africa are \u201cbroadly accurate\u201d, the World Health Organization\u2019s director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, has said. There were concerns that low levels of testing, poor infrastructure and a lack of cooperation from some governments may be disguising the true extent of the disease\u2019s spread.

The pace of layoffs has slowed dramatically from its peak of 6.6m at the start of April as states begin to relax quarantines. Last week was the ninth consecutive week of declines. Iran reached a new peak in coronavirus transmissions. Health authorities in Iran have reported 3,574 new cases of coronavirus, the highest daily count since the outbreak began in the country in February. The previous high was 3,186, recorded on 30 March. Authorities in France have cancelled the 2020 Bastille Day military parade due to social distancing requirements. Rather than the traditional march of soldiers and military hardware down the Champs-Elysees on 14 July, there will be a smaller ceremony at the Place de la Concorde, the presidency said. Spain wants to welcome British tourists back as soon as its airports reopen to foreign visitors on 1 July, but has warned much will depend on the UK\u2019s 14-day coronavirus quarantine for those returning from abroad and on the British authorities rescinding advice on non-essential foreign travel. Restrictions on domestic travel will be eased in Sweden from 13 June, the prime minister, Stefan L\u00f6fven, has said, despite signs that coronavirus infections are increasing in parts of the country. New Zealand has a date for when it will achieve its goal of elimination of Covid-19: 15 June. On Thursday, health officials announced they had found no new cases of the virus for the 13th straight day, from thousands of tests. That\u2019s it from me, Damien Gayle, for another day. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The head of the UK\u2019s GCHQ eavesdropping agency said Britain\u2019s intelligence agencies are working urgently to prevent hackers from hostile states, including China, trying to steal the secrets of a potential coronavirus vaccine, writes Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor. Jeremy Fleming, said hackers \u2013 including those from hostile states \u2013 were targeting the UK\u2019s health infrastructure and some of its world-leading research labs, often by using simple techniques. \u201cWe do know that, whether it\u2019s states or criminals, they are going after things which are sensitive to us,\u201d the director general said in a rare interview to the Cheltenham science festival. \u201cSo, it\u2019s a high priority for us to protect the health sector, particularly the race to acquire a vaccine.\u201d He said hackers were often \u201clooking for pretty basic vulnerabilities\u201d such as \u201clures to get people to click on the wrong thing ... where people aren\u2019t backing up properly, or where they\u2019ve got basic passwords and so on.\u201d The chief of the signals intelligence agency did not directly name China or any other country as being behind the cyber-attacks on the NHS and British research labs, but sources indicated that Beijing was often believed to be involved. Elsewhere in the interview, which was recorded three weeks earlier, Fleming described China as, in part, \u201can intelligence adversary\u201d, and said the UK had to navigate a complex relationship with Beijing, made more acute by the pandemic. One of the world\u2019s biggest electronic music festivals, Tomorrowland in Belgium, will be held online this year because of coronavirus restrictions, the organisers have said. While Belgium, which has one of the world\u2019s worst per capita death rates from the pandemic, is slowly lifting restrictions to curb the spread of the disease, music festivals are banned until at least the end of August. Tomorrowland, which usually draws some 400,000 people to the small town of Boom, will this year take the form of a two-day \u201cdigital music festival experience\u201d. Viewers will be able to navigate eight different \u201cstages\u201d through a computer, smartphone or tablet, with organisers promising \u201cthe planet\u2019s biggest names in electronic dance music and the world\u2019s best technology in 3D design, video production and special effects\u201d. The festival\u2019s co-founder, Michiel Beers, said they hoped to capture the spirit of the event while \u201cre-inventing the festival experience\u201d. \u201cWe hope that hundreds of thousands of people will unite in a responsible way and that small Tomorrowland gatherings at people\u2019s homes - from Canada to Australia, from Japan to Brazil and everywhere in between - will be organised,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cEspecially during the weekend where normally Tomorrowland Belgium would take place, we really have the power to unite the world.\u201d Zimbabwe\u2019s government has accused two opposition activists and an MP who described torture, humiliation and repeated sexual assaults after being abducted by suspected state security services of inventing the entire episode, writes Jason Burke, the Guardian\u2019s Africa correspondent. The three women, all leaders of the Movement for Democratic Change\u2019s youth section, were arrested at a roadblock guarded by police and soldiers last month at a protest in Harare against the state\u2019s failure to provide for the poor during the country\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown last month. They then disappeared until they were found on a roadside 60 miles away from the capital two days later, badly injured and traumatised. Witnesses said masked assailants had bundled the three women into an unmarked Toyota minivan and driven them away. The women later described repeated beatings, humiliation and sexual assault at the hands of unidentified men who threatened them with further attacks if they continued their political activities. Police have since charged them with participation in an illegal demonstration. Kazembe Kazembe, Zimbabwe\u2019s home affairs minister, said on Thursday that the government \u201cdoes not permit any of its institutions and agencies to use torture, forced disappearance or abductions\u201d. According to the Herald, a state-owned newspaper, Kazembe described such methods as alien to Zimbabwe, suggesting they had been imported \u201cfrom foreign environments for the benefit of regime change sponsors\u201d. Kazembe also said examination by government doctors had not shown any injuries that matched the three women\u2019s accounts and alleged their statements showed signs of coaching. Suspected state security services have abducted dozens of pro-democracy campaigners, trade unionists and opposition officials in recent years. Most have been released after several hours, though many have been badly beaten, stripped, threatened or otherwise mistreated. An alpaca named Tyson could help deliver a knockout blow in the fight against the spread of coronavirus, Swedish scientists hope. After immunising Tyson, a 12 year-old alpaca in Germany, with virus proteins, the team at the Karolinska Institute have isolated tiny antibodies - known as nanobodies - from his blood that bind to the same part of the virus as human antibodies and could block the infection. They hope this can form the basis of a treatment for Covid-19 or eventually a vaccine against it, though the work is at an early stage. Gerald McInerney, head of the team at Karolinska said: We know that it is the antibodies that are directed to the same very, very precise part of the virus that are important and that is what we have engineered with this antibody from Tyson. In principle, all the evidence would suggest it will work very well in humans, but it is a very complex system. There were 88 new coronavirus fatalities in Italy on Thursday, up from 71 on Wednesday, bringing the death toll to 33,689, writes Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent. New infections increased by 177, down from 318 within the previous 24 hours, according to the figures from the civil protection authority. The number of people currently infected decreased by 868 to 38,429. Italy, which lifted restrictions on inter-regional travel and opened its borders to European tourists on Wednesday without the requirement to quarantine, has so far registered 234,013 coronavirus cases, including 161,895 recoveries. Authorities in France have cancelled the 2020 Bastille Day military parade due to coronavirus physical distancing requirements, AFP reports. Rather than the traditional march of soldiers and military hardware down the Champs-Elysees, this year will see a much smaller ceremony at the Place de la Concorde, the presidency said. The annual parade to mark the 14 July 1789 storming of the Bastille fortress in Paris during the French Revolution has been held on the Champs-Elysees since the first world war. This will be the first year without one since the end of the second world war. It normally starts at the Arc de Triomphe, a monument to those who fought for France, and ends at Concorde, where King Louis XVI was beheaded in 1793. This year, the square will host a military ceremony with some 2,000 participants and 2,500 guests, who will gather in strict respect of physical distancing rules. \u201cIt will be a reinvented 14th of July adapted to the circumstances,\u201d the defence minister, Florence Parly, said. The coronavirus outbreak has been a worrying time for all, and it would be a callous soul who had not fretted enough to gain a few extra lines on a furrowed brow. For people living under quarantine measures in Florida, there is now an answer, Reuters reports. Botox is back, and it\u2019s being offered at a drive-through. On 4 May, the US state allowed a partial relaxing of restrictions imposed to slow the coronavirus pandemic. That means certain elective medical procedures could resume, including Botox injections and cosmetic surgery. Michael Salzhauer, a plastic surgeon known as \u2018Dr Miami\u2019 who has also starred in a reality television show, has been conducting drive-through Botox injections in the garage of his building in the posh Miami neighbourhood of Bal Harbour. Restrictions on domestic travel will be eased in Sweden from 13 June, the prime minister, Stegan Lofven, has said, despite signs that coronavirus infections are increasing in parts of the country. With the number of deaths and people treated at intensive care falling, Lofven said that Swedes who were symptom-free could now plan visits to their summer cottages or relatives in other parts of the country. Lofven told a news conference: This decision does not mean that the danger is over. It doesn\u2019t mean that life is back to normal again, and other restrictions remain in place. If the curve showing the seriously ill turns up again, there will be new restrictions. Earlier, Sweden\u2019s public health agency said that a rise in cases reported on Thursday could not wholly be explained by increased testing. \u201cUnfortunately, in Sweden, we can see an increase in cases again,\u201d the chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, told a news conference, urging people not to ease up on physical distancing. He said the increases in new cases was seen primarily in western Sweden and among younger people. Cases among the really old have declined quite rapidly. It shows the measures taken have had an effect. There\u2019s reason to believe the decline in deaths will continue. International donors have contributed $8.8bn to a public-private partnership aimed at increasing the use of new and underused vaccines around the world, the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has announced. The UK government has today been hosting a virtual global summit in support of Gavi, the vaccine alliance. The donations from international donor governments, companies and philanthropic foundations will fund its immunisation programmes through to 2025 Gavi said the pledges had exceeded its target of $7.4bn, and would \u201chelp immunise 300 million more children in the world\u2019s poorest countries against diseases like measles, polio and diphtheria\u201d. In a speech closing the conference, Johnson said: \u201cPeople who are vaccinated protect themselves and the rest of the population by lowering the spread and risk of infection. \u201cGavi\u2019s work on routine immunisation is the strongest shield against outbreaks of infectious diseases. And so it is today and our collective efforts at this summit will now save up to 8 million lives.\u201d The prime minister earlier pledged that the UK government would remain the leading donor, paying \u00a31.65bn towards Gavi\u2019s work over the next five years. Is it safe to protest during a pandemic? Protests have erupted in many cities around the world in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, and public health experts warn of a likely uptick in Covid-19 infections. \u201cThere is the concern that protests could be super spreader events,\u201d said Kim Sue, a physician who has participated in demonstrations. And yet many health experts \u2013 aware of the risk \u2013 say they still support the protests, suggesting that police violence is its own kind of epidemic. Danielle Renwick spoke with three of them. Damien Gayle back at the controls now, with thanks to Lucy for covering my break.

Puerto Rico on Thursday reported 485 new cases of the coronavirus, but officials say 355 of those correspond to April and early May and had not been shared with the government until now. The announcement drew criticism from many who say the government lifted a two-month lockdown without taking into account those cases. The island\u2019s health department said samples involving the cases in question were taken from 31 March to 16 May and were identified by health officials and laboratories. It was not immediately clear why the 355 cases were not identified earlier. The US territory has reported a total of more than 4,500 Covid-19 cases and at least 140 deaths. Spain\u2019s total death toll from the coronavirus reached 27,133 on Thursday, health ministry data showed, five more than reported on Wednesday. The ministry has stopped providing a daily death toll but said 56 people had died from the virus over the last seven days. Confirmed cases climbed by 195 from the previous day to 240,660. Spain is implementing a new methodology for logging deaths and cases, leading to fluctuations in its statistics and frequent revisions of data which officials warn are likely to continue for some time. Ukraine is considering cancelling its visa requirement for tourists from China, Australia, New Zealand and Arab states in order to attract more visitors once lockdowns ease and bring more money into the economy, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday. The government expects the economy to shrink 12% in the second quarter after a 1.5% drop in the first quarter. Zelenskiy said: It is necessary to liberalise the visa policy: if countries cancel visa requirements for Ukrainians who come to them, we will cancel for them too. We need to compete for tourists. According to the president\u2019s communications department, a foreign tourist usually spends $120-150 a day and stays in Ukraine for an average of three to four days. Around 14 million tourists visited Ukraine in 2018. Last year, Ukraine introduced electronic visas for citizens of 52 countries, including China and Australia. A single 30-day visa costs $85. EU citizens can enter for short trips without a visa. An anti-coronavirus curfew in Senegal is to be eased and restrictions on intercity travel lifted after hundreds of people were arrested in two nights of protests. More than 200 people were arrested after demonstrations broke out in several cities, including the capital Dakar, according to interior ministry figures. Protesters were dispersed by police and gendarmes using teargas, and there were pictures on social media showing military vehicles in the street. The anger has focused on the curfew, but transport workers have also gone on strike over the travel restrictions. Speaking on state television on Thursday, the interior minister, Aly Ngouille Ndiaye, said the start of the 9.00pm to 5.00am curfew would be pushed back by two hours, to 11.00pm. \u201cFrom today, transport restrictions across the country are being lifted, with the curfew being maintained from 11pm to 5am,\u201d AFP quoted him as saying. \u201cGatherings in public or private places, restaurants, gyms, casinos will also benefit from these relaxation measures.\u201d One of the centres of unrest was Touba, Senegal\u2019s second largest city located around 200 kilometres (120 miles) east of Dakar, and the seat of a politically powerful Sufi Muslim order, the Mouride Brotherhood. Several police vehicles there were set ablaze and a coronavirus treatment centre and post office buildings were attacked, sources said. The curfew was imposed by President Macky Sall on 23 March, and has been implemented in tandem with a ban on travel between Senegal\u2019s regions. The authorities have already extended until June 30 a ban on all passenger flights to and from the country. Slovenia will from Friday lift coronavirus border restrictions for Austrians, a government spokesman said on Thursday, following a similar move by neighbouring Austria to lift border restrictions for Slovenians. Slovenia had introduced border checks and travelling restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus, including obligatory quarantine for most people entering the country. Over the past weeks it has lifted restrictions for citizens from neighbouring Croatia and Hungary. The decision on whether to lift restrictions for citizens from neighbouring Italy is also due, following the visit of the Italian foreign minister, Luigi di Maio, to Ljubljana on Saturday. Slovenia introduced lockdown in mid-March and started to gradually lift it from 20 April. In May it became the first European state to declare an end to its coronavirus epidemic but people are still obliged to keep social distance and wear face masks in indoor public spaces. The country has so far reported 1,477 coronavirus cases and 109 deaths. Ireland hopes to be able to recommend the resumption of air travel with a select number of countries in a number of weeks, the prime minister Leo Varadkar said on Thursday, telling prospective holidaymakers \u201csummer is not yet lost.\u201d Some European countries such as Germany, Spain and Austria plan to lift coronavirus-related border restrictions with neighbouring countries this month, something Ireland has been more cautious about as it slowly reopens its economy. Ireland requires anyone entering the country to self-isolate for 14 days and foresees making its first step back to non-essential travel via so-called \u201cair bridges\u201d with other countries who share low levels of coronavirus infection. Varadkar told parliament: I hope that as the world returns to a new normality, we will see international air travel resume, in the first instance through air bridges with countries that have suppressed the virus to a similar extent as ours. This however is some weeks away and it\u2019s far too soon for anyone to book their holidays yet but summer is not yet lost. Ireland has reported 1,659 deaths related to just over 25,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19. The number of cases, deaths and admissions to hospital have all been falling in recent weeks. The government is due to review the 14-day quarantine for travellers on 18 June. Airlines, in particular Ryanair, have pushed back strongly against the rules, saying they are impossible to implement. Varadkar also reiterated that he hopes to announce a speeding up of the reopening plan on Friday ahead of entering the second of five phases next week. Hello everyone. I\u2019m Lucy Campbell, taking over the blog so Damien can have a much-needed break. Please feel free to get in touch with news tips and comments as I work. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ The head of the African Union health agency has said that the continent needs to triple its rates of coronavirus testing in the coming months \u201cto move ahead of the curve\u201d as more countries ease lockdown measures. The continent has so far conducted 3.4m tests, a figure that John Nkengasong, director of the Africa centres for disease control (Africa CDC), told journalists he wants to see climb to 10m \u201cin the next two or three months\u201d. The current total translates to a rate of 1,700 tests per one million people across Africa\u2019s 54 countries, far below the UK\u2019s rate of 30,000 tests per million and Italy\u2019s 37,000, Nkengasong was quoted as saying by the French news agency AFP. As of Thursday morning, Africa had recorded 162,000 cases and 4,600 deaths, with an average of 5,400 new cases per day in the past week, Nkengasong said. Those numbers could rise as countries eased lockdown measures, he added. \u201cOur situation will likely get worse before it gets better,\u201d Nkengasong warned. \u201cAs we begin to relax some of the lockdown measures, which is part of balancing between saving lives and saving the economy, we expect to see that numbers will increase.\u201d A platform established to help African countries procure supplies to combat Covid-19 has secured 15m tests per month for the next six months, Nkengasong said. Despite this progress, he acknowledged that conducting 10m tests would still cover less than one percent of Africa\u2019s population. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen strongly to a new peak this year, despite the impact of the global effects of the coronavirus crisis, writes Fiona Harvey, the Guardian\u2019s environment correspondent. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere reached 417.2 parts per million in May, 2.4ppm higher than the peak of 414.8ppm in 2019, according to readings from the Mauna Loa observatory in the US. Without worldwide lockdowns intended to slow the spread of Covid-19, the rise might have been 2.8ppm higher, according to Ralph Keeling, a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He said it was likely the lockdowns had played a role, but that the difference was too small to show up against other factors causing year-to-year fluctuations. \u201cPeople may be surprised to hear that the response to the coronavirus outbreak hasn\u2019t done more to influence CO2 levels,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the buildup of CO2 is a bit like trash in a landfill. As we keep emitting, it keeps piling up. The crisis has slowed emissions, but not enough to show up perceptibly at Mauna Loa. What will matter much more is the trajectory we take coming out of this situation.\u201d Daily emissions of carbon dioxide fell by an average of about 17% around the world in early April, according to a comprehensive study last month. As lockdowns are eased, however, the fall in emissions for the year as a whole is only likely to be between 4% and 7% compared with 2019. That will make no appreciable difference to the world\u2019s ability to meet the goals of the Paris agreement to keep global heating below the threshold of 2C, which scientists say is necessary to stave off catastrophic effects. The World Health Organization\u2019s director for Africa has said current statistics for the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the continent are broadly accurate, amid concerns that low levels of testing, poor infrastructure and a lack of cooperation from some governments may be disguising the true extent of the disease\u2019s spread. There are currently 162,622 confirmed cases in Africa, with 4,604 deaths. Dr Matshidiso Moeti told reporters in the organisation\u2019s weekly streamed press conference that officials would know if there were high numbers of cases of infection or deaths that were going undetected, though testing remained a challenge. \u201cWe believe there is some underestimation of the cases, but we don\u2019t believe it is a multiple fold underestimation such as that one day we will find that many, many African people died of Covid-19 that were never discovered,\u201d she said. One reason was that pre-existing systems designed to pick up signs of outbreaks of other respiratory diseases, such as influenza, would have been triggered and \u201cthat did not happen.\u201d Moeti said that reported numbers of cases in many countries were rising steeply but that this was most likely to be because of more testing, especially in Ghana, Ethiopia and Senegal. \u201cIt\u2019s increasing, but not to show we are discovering a huge number of previously undetected cases,\u201d she said. In South Africa, where testing has scaled up \u201chugely\u201d, case numbers have soared since easing a strict lockdown four days ago. South Africa has reported 38,000 cases, an increase of 17,000 in two weeks, and 792 deaths. The outbreak in and around Cape Town, the western city, is the worst on the continent. Over in Greece infectious disease experts are expressing consternation over the dangers posed by tourism ahead of the country reopening to the world with the resumption of international air links on 15 June, writes Helena Smith in Athens. Anxiety over the virus being imported by visitors was highlighted earlier this week when 12 of the 91 passengers aboard a Qatar Airways flight tested positive for coronavirus upon arrival in Athens. The airline has since said that no one was found to be infected when they boarded the plane in Doha. Speaking on Skai TV today, professor Nikolaos Sypsas, a member of the scientific committee that advises the government, said tourism would be \u201cthe first candidate\u201d for restrictive measures being reinstated in the event of a recurrence. \u201cWith tourism comes imported cases. Despite the efforts underway to have the least possible danger, the risk remains.\u201d Greek authorities, enforcing emergency health protocols, suspended flights to and from Qatar and quarantined all those on board - for 14 days in the case of those who tested positive, and an initial seven days for those who tested negative. If found to be clear at the end of a week those cleared of the virus will be free to go. \u201cThe incident has shown how complicated tourism is,\u201d said professor Sypsas. As of 15 June blanket testing of plane passengers will be replaced by random \u2018spot\u2019 testing, he explained, because Greece simply didn\u2019t have the capability of testing everyone flying in and the EU had decided against endorsing such a move. \u201cPlaying with this virus is like playing with fire,\u201d the expert lamented saying it was vital that countries were separated into categories of risk. Both Albania and north Macedonia, Greece\u2019s northern neighbours, had seen a rise in confirmed coronavirus cases as a result of relaxing precautionary measures, he noted. \u201cThe biggest danger, as far as the epidemic is concerned, is complacency. The virus does not excuse any mistake, we\u2019ve learned it from other countries.\u201d So far Greece has succeeded in keeping infection rates and confirmed coronavirus cases low. But with tourism the heavy engine of their economy - generating one in five jobs and almost 25% of GDP - Greeks are now eager to reignite the sector. A tourist campaign promoting the pleasures of \u201cthe Greek summer\u201d is to be unveiled by Athens\u2019 centre right government this evening. Outdoor cinemas, keeping to customary film launches on a Thursday, also open tonight as lockdown measures continue to be eased. Iran is reluctantly confronting the possibility of a renewed political crisis as well as a health one after the latest figures showed the number of new coronavirus infections at a record high, writes Patrick Wintour, the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor. The government appeared to have brought the virus under control a month ago, but a second wave of the virus has steadily been gathering force, and according to data released by the health ministry there were 3,574 confirmed new infections in 24 hours \u2013 an increase of 440 on the previous day. The previous daily record in Iran, recorded on 30 March, was 3,186. The country was one of the first in the Middle East to be gripped by the disease. In spite of a steadily rising infection rate, authorities have been progressively lifting controls on shops, mosques, schools, offices and travel. The border with Turkey was also being opened for haulage traffic on Thursday. In recent days government spokesmen have been increasingly critical of the public, accusing them of ignoring the continued restrictions, especially in workplaces. \u201cIf the rules are not obeyed,\u201d the president, Hassan Rouhani, warned, \u201cthe government would be forced to restore the quarantine situation again, disrupting normal life and inflicting serious damage on the entire national economy.\u201d There was little immediate domestic coverage of the record infection figure. Activists in Norway have been refused permission to hold solidarity rallies in support of protests in the US over the police killing of George Floyd, because of fears of the spread of coronavirus. Mohamed Awil, the president of the African student association UiO, told the Associated Press that rallies had been planned in Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim, but that local authorities said they could not allow more than 50 people to gather in one place without a dispensation from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. The association is co-organising the rally in Oslo, where more than 15,000 people said they planned to take part in the demonstration on Thursday outside the US embassy. He said they were considering an alternative but details were not immediately available. Thousands gathered on Wednesday in support rallies in the capitals of Sweden and Finland. A video circulated on Twitter showed police in Stockholm, the Swedish capital, using irritant spray and batons against protesters. Another 1.9 million people filed for unemployment benefits in the United States last week as the total number of claims passed 42m since the coronavirus pandemic hit, writes Dominic Rushe in New York. The pace of layoffs has slowed dramatically from its peak of 6.6m at the start of April as states begin to relax quarantine orders, and last week was the ninth consecutive week of declines. But the scale of layoffs remains staggeringly high. In the worst week of the last recession \u201cjust\u201d 665,000 people filed for unemployment. Jason Reed, professor of finance at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business, said the numbers may be slowing down, but \u201cthis is unprecedented. The figures are so high that it\u2019s hard to grasp the reality.\u201d On Friday the labour department will release May\u2019s monthly jobs report. Economists are predicting unemployment will rise to close to 20% from 14.7% in April and some 8m more jobs will have been lost after a combined loss of 21.4m in March and April. The official tally would mean one in five Americans in the workforce are now out of work. The layoffs have disproportionately hit African Americans, Latinos and those without a college education. Twenty more deaths from Covid-19 were reported by Sweden on Thursday, as its government said the country was now entering the post-peak phase of its coronavirus epidemic. The health minister, Lena Hallengren, told a news conference that an additional 5.9bn crowns ($633m) would be spent to ramp up tracing of cases. All people with symptoms will be tested, while authorities will also run large-scale antibody tests to see who has had the virus. \u201cWe\u2019re entering post-peak phase in the pandemic. It gives us better chances to trace every single person,\u201d Reuters quoted Hallengren as saying. The pledge comes after criticism of Sweden\u2019s inability to ramp up testing to meet a target of 100,000 tests per week, reaching just over a third of that in the last week. In total, Sweden had tested 275,500 samples by end of last week, a much lower rate of testing than in its Nordic neighbours. Denmark has carried out more than double Sweden\u2019s total despite having only half the population. Unlike much of Europe, most schools, restaurants and businesses have remained open in Sweden, with authorities relying on voluntary measures focused on good hygiene and physical distancing to stem the outbreak. More than 4,500 people have died from Covid-19, many times more relative to the size of the population than in neighbouring Nordic countries. On Thursday, the public health agency reported 1,080 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, taking the total case load in the country so far to 41,883. Spain wants to welcome British tourists back as soon as its airports reopen to foreign visitors on 1 July, but has warned much will depend on the UK\u2019s 14-day coronavirus quarantine for those returning from abroad and on the British authorities rescinding advice on non-essential foreign travel, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent. Spain\u2019s tourism minister, Mar\u00eda Reyes Maroto, said the country will begin hosting foreign visitors from 22 June, when the current state of emergency ends and land borders with France and Portugal reopen. Two pilot schemes will also mean thousands of overseas holidaymakers, at least 6,000 of them German, begin arriving in the Balearic and Canary islands during the last two weeks of June. Questionnaires and an app will be used to track the visitors and the information gathered will help the Spanish government and tourist sector prepare for the return of all foreign visitors from the beginning of July. Maroto said Spain\u2019s message to UK tourists \u2013 its largest single national visitor group - was simple: \u201cAs soon as possible, as soon as possible! We want British tourists to come back as soon as they can.\u201d But the minister said there needed to be greater clarity from the British government about when UK tourists would be able to fly abroad, and on whether they would need to self-isolate on return. A vast database from a little-known company called Surgisphere has influenced rapid policy shifts as the world seeks treatments for Covid-19. But as researchers began to examine it more closely, they became increasingly concerned. Melissa Davey, the Guardian\u2019s Melbourne bureau chief, has written the latest instalment of our investigations into the factors driving coronavirus policy around the world. The UK will contribute \u00a31.6bn to a public-private partnership that aims to increase access to vaccination around the world, it said at an international virtual summit that is taking place today. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, said he hopes the Gavi vaccine alliance meeting will be a \u201cmoment when the world comes together - uniting humanity in the fight against disease\u201d. Johnson opening the virtual summit, said: \u201cTo defeat the coronavirus we must focus our collective ingenuity on the search for a vaccine and ensure that countries, pharmaceutical companies and international partners - like the World Health Organisation - co-operate on a scale beyond anything we have seen before. \u201cWe must use the collective purchasing power of Gavi, the vaccine alliance, to make that future vaccine affordable and available to all who need it. \u201cIf we are to make this the beginning of a new era of global health collaboration, we must also replenish the funding for the vaccines we already have - strengthening the routine immunisation against preventable diseases in the poorest countries.\u201d Johnson said the UK would remain the world\u2019s leading donor to Gavi - contributing \u00a31.65bn over the next five years. \u201cI urge you to join us, to fortify this lifesaving alliance, and inaugurate a new era of global health co-operation which I believe is now the most essential shared endeavour of our lifetimes.\u201d Today\u2019s summit is being live streamed and you can watch it in the player at the top of the blog. Pakistan reported a record single-day spike in coronavirus-related deaths with 82 new fatalities and 4,688 cases that it says resulted from increased testing in the past 24 hours, the Associated Press reports. Pakistan\u2019s outbreak has grown steadily since the country\u2019s first case in February. Since then, 1,770 people have died and 85,264 have tested positive. As many as 901 patients were listed in critical condition at hospitals on Thursday. The country has barely 3,000 intensive care beds serving a population of 220 million. On Thursday, Pakistan for the first time conducted over 20,000 tests in the past 24 hours. It has done more than 615,000 tests after increasing its testing capacity from only two labs in February. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases passed 18,000 in Afghanistan and death toll topped 300 on Thursday, as the new acting health minister pledged reforms in health sector amid a continued surge of transmission in Kabul, writes Akhtar Mohammad Makoii in Herat. According to the latest update, the health ministry has detected 787 new cases out of 1,296 tests, as six patients died overnight, pushing the total number of infections to 18,054 and the death toll to 300. There have been 1,585 recoveries. According to the ministry, 19 patients are in a critical condition in hospital. Most of the new cases were reported in Kabul, the capital, where the ministry detected 323 new cases out of 513 tests. Kabul is the country\u2019s worst affected area by number of confirmed transmissions, with 7,133 cases. The western province of Herat recorded 110 new cases out of 128 tests in the past 24 hours. Testing capacity remains low in Afghanistan and experts warn that the real figures may be much higher. Earlier this week, International Rescue Committee warned about the low testing capacity and said that the Afghan health ministry has the capacity to test 2,000 suspected patients each day, but are receiving between 10,000 and 20,000 samples each day. \u201cThat means between 80 and 90% of potential cases are not being tested. Afghanistan has one of the highest test positivity rates (40%) of all the countries where the IRC works, suggesting a high level of undetected population infection\u201d the NGO said. The southern province of Kandahar recorded 65 new positive cases. Meanwhile, at least nine civilians were killed and five others were wounded in when a roadside mine exploded in the province on Wednesday, police said. On Thursday, a newly introduced acting minister of public health, Ahmad Jawad Osmani, said in a press conference that he would bring reforms to the health sector. Osmani said the coronavirus must be fought, but also that reforms in hospitals and in other service areas must be made. He also said that the current health services do not meet the people\u2019s standards and health services need to be increased. The president, Ashraf Ghani, replaced Ferozuddin Feroz, the former health minister, after more than five years in the position. During his efforts to fight with coronavirus, Feroz tested positive and then recovered from the virus. The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, has said that temporary hospitals for patients sick with Covid-19 will remain in place in the Russian capital until mass vaccination can be carried out. In an interview with Tass, Russia\u2019s official news agency, Sobyanin said: The temporary hospitals we\u2019ve created are top-notch ones. They will stay in place until the mass vaccination of the population has been completed in case of a second wave. This reserve will enable us to restore permanent hospitals to normal routine operation with greater confidence, which is very important He claimed that Moscow had created the world\u2019s largest system for providing hospital care to people sick with Covid-19. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: New mortality data from St Petersburg has reignited questions about Russia\u2019s official Covid-19 death toll. Russia\u2019s second-largest city issued 1,552 more death certificates this May than in the previous year, a nearly 32% rise that indicates that hundreds of deaths tied to the pandemic are not reflected official statistics. Known Covid-19 cases worldwide exceeded 6.5 million, according to Johns Hopkins University. They said there have been 6,530,067 coronavirus cases confirmed worldwide and 386,392 deaths reported. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to underestimate the scale of the pandemic. A survey has shown increasing scepticism over governments\u2019 handling of the coronavirus crisis, with the UK suffering the biggest slump in confidence. In May, in G7 nations as a whole, 48% of respondents approved of how authorities had handled the pandemic, down from 50% in April and 54% in March. Brazil registered a record number of daily deaths from the novel coronavirus for a second consecutive day on Wednesday, even as city and state authorities move to open back up. The nation recorded 1,349 new deaths on Wednesday and 28,633 more cases. Brazil has now registered 32,548 deaths and 584,016 total cases. Hospitals in Armenia can no longer cope with the number of coronavirus patients, the prime minister warned on Thursday. Nikol Pashinyan, who has himself tested positive, said there could be as many as 20,000 people infected but showing no symptoms in the country, which has so far registered 11,221 cases and 176 deaths. The EU is preparing to use an emergency \u20ac2.4bn fund to make advance purchases of promising coronavirus vaccines. The move was discussed at a meeting of EU ambassadors on Wednesday, after Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands said they were speeding up negotiations with pharmaceutical companies. The governor of Tokyo, Yuriko Koike, said on Thursday it may be necessary to stage a \u201csimplified\u201d Olympics next year due to the impact of the pandemic. \u201cHolding the Olympic and Paralympic Games calls for sympathy and understanding of Tokyoites and the Japanese people,\u201d he said. The Spanish tourism minister, Reyes Maroto, has said that all restrictions on border crossings with France and Portugal will be lifted from 22 June. The authorities closed the borders to everybody but Spaniards, cross-border workers and truck drivers from mid-March when the country went into lockdown. China on Thursday said foreign airlines blocked from operating in the country over virus fears would be allowed to resume limited flights, lifting a de facto ban on US carriers, Agence France-Presse reports. This comes a day after Washington ordered the suspension of all Chinese travel into and out of the US. Mexico overtook the United States in daily reported deaths from coronavirus for the first time on Wednesday. The health ministry registered a record 1,092 fatalities and attributed the increase to improvements in documenting the pandemic. Plans to further relax social distancing measures this week were put on hold. George Floyd, the Minneapolis man who died with a policeman\u2019s knee on his neck, tested positive for coronavirus, according to a full autopsy report released by the Hennepin county medical examiner\u2019s office. The report noted that the virus was not a contributing factor in his death and that Floyd had no symptoms. Germany has unveiled a massive \u20ac130bn (\u00a3116.4bn) package of tax and spending measures designed to boost the country\u2019s economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis, writes Richard Partington, the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent. Announcing measures to drag Europe\u2019s largest economy out of recession as lockdown measures are removed, Angela Merkel\u2019s government said it would use the package of sweeping temporary tax cuts and increase benefits to turbocharge its recovery. Measures included a cut in VAT until the end of this year and substantial payments for every child in the country designed to help ordinary German families, alongside the launch of a new \u20ac50bn fund to tackle global heating and finance new technologies. A state financial incentive to buy an electic car has been doubled to \u20ac6,000. Against a backdrop of rising unemployment and with Germany already in a technical recession before Covid-19 struck, Merkel said a \u201cbold response\u201d was required to secure jobs and keep the economy running. Measures announced include: A temporary VAT cut from 19% to 16%, from 1 July until 31 December. A \u20ac300 one-off payment for every child in the country. A \u20ac50bn fund to address climate change, innovation and digital technology. A \u20ac25bn loan support programme for small firms that have seen their sales drop by more than 60% for June to August. This could be a particular boost for bars, restaurants, hotels and other hospitality busineses. \u20ac10bn for municipalities struggling with lower tax receipts, with public spending on infrastructure and housing. Up until now, countries around the world had largely announced emergency financial support to cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus outbreak rather than jump-start a recovery. Germany\u2019s package of measures comes on top of a \u20ac750bn rescue package agreed in March that included loan guarantees and direct spending measures such as furlough wage subsidies. Health authorities in Iran have reported 3,574 new cases of coronavirus, the highest daily count since the outbreak began in the country in February. The previous high of 3,186, recorded on 30 March, was surpassed on the fourth consecutive day of daily caseloads that have topped 3,000. It comes after Iran eased restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the virus, but the health ministry spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour, said that the surge in cases might be the result of wider testing rather than a second wave of infection. He said that Iran had now conducted more than a million tests. Nevertheless, the health ministry has been taking no chances and has stepped up a public health campaign in recent days reminding people to protect themselves and observe social distancing, AFP reports. There has been not been a corresponding rise in death toll. In his daily update on Thursday, Jahanpour said 59 people had died of Covid-19 over the past 24 hours, taking Iran\u2019s overall official toll to 8,071. A total of 164,270 people have tested positive for the virus. The World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for Africa is beginning its weekly briefing in a few minutes. You can watch it in the player embedded in this tweet. Speakers are Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) regional director for Africa The Hon. Safia Boly, minister of investment promotion, small and medium enterprises and national entrepreneurship, Mali Sipho Pityana, president of Business Unity South Africa, and co-chair of the Africa Regional Action Group, World Economic Forum Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, is hosting a virtual summit for vaccine development on Thursday, which will call on countries to pledge funding for vaccinations against infectious diseases, Reuters reports. Representatives of more than 50 countries, including 35 heads of state or government, will come together virtually in London to raise funds for the Gavi vaccine alliance, a public-private global health partnership. According to the UK government, the summit aims to raise at least $7.4bn (\u00a35.9bn) to help Gavi protect a further 300 million more children against infectious diseases like measles, typhoid and polio and save up to 8 million lives over the next five years. A new Covid-19 vaccine global access (Covax) facility, to be launched by Gavi at the summit, will raise money to scale up manufacturing for a future Covid-19 vaccine. Campaigners for Global Justice Now said Johnson must make any public funding for a coronavirus vaccine conditional on guarantees that people around the world will receive it, otherwise it will simply put money into the hands of big pharmaceutical companies. Heidi Chow, a campaigner with the NGO, said: If no conditions are attached to this facility, it will simply become a giant handout to big pharma. The prime minister needs to use his role as the summit host to work with Gavi and push for conditions to prevent monopolies, otherwise big pharma will be free to dictate whatever price they want while restricting supply. There should be no profiteering during a global pandemic. Governments around the world are already pouring billions into vaccine research and development but there are no safeguards that ensure any publicly funded vaccine will be produced patent-free. Any vaccine developed must be a global public good and therefore patent-free so that it is affordable for all countries and free to every person. New mortality data from Russia\u2019s second-largest city has reignited questions about whether the country\u2019s official tally has discounted thousands of deaths tied to the coronavirus outbreak, writes Andrew Roth, the Guardian\u2019s Moscow correspondent. St Petersburg issued 1,552 more death certificates this May than in the previous year, a nearly 32% rise that indicates that hundreds of deaths tied to the pandemic are not reflected in the city\u2019s official coronavirus death toll for the month of 171. It is not clear how many of those people had tested positive for the novel coronavirus or were suspected to have been infected. But statisticians and doctors have previously told the Guardian that 75% or higher of \u201cexcess deaths\u201d, the number of deaths exceeding what would regularly be expected, are likely to be tied to the coronavirus outbreak. That means potentially 1,000 additional deaths in St Petersburg in May tied to the pandemic. The new data, released by the city on Wednesday and first reported by Reuters, further indicates how Russia\u2019s conservative account of its coronavirus death toll may be missing out thousands of deaths, while feeding political talking points and informing policy decisions about tackling the outbreak and reopening the country. Russia has reported a 1.2% mortality rate from the disease, while Brazil and the US have reported higher than 5.6% and 5.8%, respectively, according to Johns Hopkins University. France posted a 15.4% mortality rate and Italy has posted a 14.4% mortality rate. But experts have said that comparing national mortality rates is misleading when reporting standards vary widely and that excess deaths are likely to give a clearer picture of the death toll from the disease. An international survey has increasing scepticism over governments\u2019 handling of the coronavirus crisis in the world\u2019s richest countries, with the UK suffering the biggest slump in confidence, Reuters reports. In May, in the Group of Seven nations as a whole, 48% of respondents approved of how authorities had handled the pandemic, down from 50% in April and 54% in March, the survey published by polling firm Kantar showed. The UK saw the biggest drop - a sharp fall of 18 points from April to 51% - while in the US, Canada, Germany, France and Italy, the declines ranged between two and six points. Japan was the only country to show an increase. Kantar said 50% of respondents across the G7 said they trusted their government to make the right decisions about the pandemic in the future, down four points from April. Just over half said they would use a contact-tracing app to help to prevent a new wave of infections. Almost two-thirds of those who said they would not use it cited privacy concerns. One in three people felt uncomfortable about returning to their workplace, a similar number said they would work at home more than before the crisis and about four in 10 said they would visit restaurants, cafes, pubs and cinemas less than before. The survey of 7,012 people was conducted between 28 May and 1 June.

Hospitals in Armenia can no longer cope with the number of coronavirus patients, the country\u2019s prime minister warned on Thursday. Nikol Pashinyan, who has himself tested positive, said there could be as many as 20,000 people infected but showing no symptoms in the country, which has so far registered 11,221 cases and 176 deaths. The health ministry said an additional 68 patients who tested positive for the virus had died from other illnesses. Last week, health officials warned that intensive care beds would soon be reserved for patients with the best chance of survival. \u201cI have got bad news,\u201d Pashinyan said in a video statement on his Facebook page. \u201cThe epidemiological situation is worsening and medical facilities cannot timely hospitalise all the coronavirus patients who need [treatment].\u201d Pashinyan has acknowledged his government failed to enforce anti-virus measures and denounced widespread quarantine violations. Armenia has already lifted a state of emergency that was imposed in March to slow the spread of the virus. Conspiracy theories and disinformation on social media undermined government efforts to fight the outbreak, according to analysts. The World Health Organization will resume clinical trials of an anti-malaria drug researchers hope may treat Covid-19, after a study of the drug published in May by a major medical journal prompted them to halt trials due to safety concerns. The paper, published in the Lancet, said hydroxychloroquine was associated with higher mortality rates and higher rates of heart problems in Covid-19 patients in hospitals around the world. The finding prompted the World Health Organization\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, to announce the hydroxychloroquine arm of its Solidarity global clinical trial would pause while the study and other findings were reviewed.

As of 12.01am local time, about two hours ago, casinos in Nevada have been allowed to open, for the first time since 18 March. There are big hopes for recovery from an unprecedented and expensive shutdown prompted by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount on the line, not only for casinos, but for the community and the state,\u201d said Alan Feldman, a longtime casino executive, now a fellow at the International Gaming Institute at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \u201cThis is an extremely important moment.\u201d Safety measures being rolled out include disinfected dice; hand sanitiser and face masks; limited numbers of players at tables; temperature checks at entrances to some resorts and touchless cellphone check-ins. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that customers will see that gaming properties invested time and effort to welcome them back to a safe and entertaining environment,\u201d state Gaming Control Board chief Sandra Douglass Morgan said on Wednesday. The regulatory board required detailed health safety plans by last week, before giving the go-ahead to reopen. \u201cIt may be a little different,\u201d MGM Resorts International chief executive Bill Hornbuckle said during a recent walk-through of the Bellagio casino floor. \u201cBut I think it will be memorable, personable and special.\u201d The Spanish tourism minister, Reyes Maroto, has said that all restrictions on border crossings with France and Portugal will be lifted from 22 June. The authorities closed the borders to everybody but Spaniards, cross-border workers and truck drivers from mid-March when the country went into lockdown. The European Union is preparing to use an emergency \u20ac2.4bn fund to make advance purchases of promising vaccines against the new coronavirus, EU officials have told Reuters. The move was discussed at a meeting of EU ambassadors on Wednesday, after Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands said they were speeding up negotiations with pharmaceutical companies to secure access to vaccines currently under development. The EU rainy-day fund, known as the Emergency Support Instrument (ESI), would also be used to increase vaccine production capacity in Europe and offer liability insurance to pharmaceutical companies, officials said, confirming a Reuters report in May. The EU\u2019s push follows moves from the United States to secure vaccines under development, including almost a third of the first 1bn doses planned for AstraZeneca\u2019s experimental COVID-19 shot. An EU official said it was necessary to do as the United States was doing, even if this meant losing money as many of the vaccines under development are unlikely to be eventually successful. The bloc is ready to take higher financial risks as it fears otherwise not having rapid access to a vaccine against the virus that has killed 385,000 people worldwide. The ESI fund is run by the European Commission, the EU executive arm, which acts on behalf of the 27 EU states. German Health Minister Jens Spahn and his colleagues from France, Italy and the Netherlands wrote to the Commission saying they had joined up to \u201cachieve the fastest and best possible outcome in negotiations with key players in the pharmaceutical industry\u201d, German newspaper Handelsblatt wrote on Thursday. The paper cited government sources as saying Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands were talking to several pharmaceutical firms including AstraZeneca about government research funds and purchase guarantees. AstraZeneca was not immediately available for a comment. The four were also talking to Britain, Norway, Singapore and Japan about possible cooperation. The EU is also worried that not enough doses might be available to rapidly vaccinate its population of nearly 450 million if a vaccine against the new coronavirus is developed. It is working on a vaccination strategy to give priority to the people most in need, like medics, nurses and the elderly. It remains unclear how the EU initiative will be coordinated with plans by individual member states to secure vaccines from pharmaceutical companies. Interesting and important thread here by John Burn-Murdoch of the Financial Times, on the coronavirus data being released by the Spanish government. In particular, the way they report Covid-19 deaths was changed last week, and has allowed the government to release artificially deflated figures (which the Guardian has written up, for example here). He also links to this article in El Pais. Uzbekistan will allow many businesses, including restaurants and cafes, clothing retailers and kindergartens, to reopen on 15 June in the latest easing of its coronavirus restrictions, the government said today. Bus routes will also start operating on the same date between some provinces in areas deemed low-risk, it said. A ban on mass events such as group prayers and concerts, and the operation of nightclubs, colleges, universities and city public transport, will remain in place. Uzbekistan, which has been divided into green, yellow and red zones depending on the rates of newly-detected Covid-19 cases, has already allowed the resumption of domestic tourism and football games behind closed doors, and domestic air flights and train services have resumed. Central Asia\u2019s most populous nation of 34 million has confirmed 3,874 coronavirus cases and 16 deaths. Russia has reported 8,831 new cases of the novel coronavirus today, taking the total number of infections across the country to 441,108. The country\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre said 169 people had died from the virus in the past 24 hours, bringing the nationwide death toll to 5,384. The Taliban boasted of their readiness to fight coronavirus when it first reached Afghanistan, but now the insurgents are struggling to curb its spread in their strongholds, reports AFP. For months, Habib Rahman, a resident of a Taliban-controlled area in the south of the country, has been unable to test whether his persistent cough is due to the virus. \u201cI have a cough, fever and chest pain,\u201d said Rahman, 32, who owns a grocery store in Helmand province. \u201cThere is neither a centre here to diagnose or treat coronavirus patients, nor is there any effort to create awareness of the disease. Official figures show Afghanistan has more than 17,000 confirmed cases, including thousands in Taliban-controlled territories. But a shortage of testing kits and medical supplies and a dilapidated health system were compounding problems in tackling the spread, said Ahmed Saeedi, an independent analyst. Years of war have left Afghanistan with a crumbling health sector, hampering the government\u2019s fight against Covid-19. In an attempt to bolster their narrative that they can run Afghanistan better than the struggling administration, the Taliban launched a campaign to tackle the virus in March. They posted images online showing insurgents distributing masks and soap to villagers - albeit without any social distancing. In one image, masked militants wearing white protective suits check residents\u2019 temperatures and explain about personal hygiene as a machine gun is seen on a nearby table. The virus entered Afghanistan as infected migrants returned from neighbouring Iran, the region\u2019s worst-hit country, and the Taliban ordered hundreds of returnees into quarantine. In some areas they controlled, the insurgents allowed government health officials to monitor the virus\u2019s spread, rare for a group blamed for the deaths of dozens of medics over the years. But in recent weeks, residents from provinces such as Kunduz, Helmand, Uruzgan and Kandahar - where the Taliban hold sway over large areas - complain they have been abandoned to their fate. In Kunduz, where the militants fought a fierce night battle before a short nationwide ceasefire last month, insurgents have barred medics. \u201cThey said they would handle the virus on their own,\u201d said Sebghatullah, a doctor from a nearby district, worried about the residents\u2019 lack of awareness when it came to personal hygiene. Haji Qudratullah, a resident of Helmand, said he recently saw a group of Taliban fighters film a promotional video at a neighbourhood clinic, but they never returned. \u201cI have not seen anybody do anything to raise awareness about the virus here,\u201d he said. Taliban commanders insist they are helping fight the virus. \u201cPeople who are suffering from high fever, cough and body pain ... are taken to Trinkot,\u201d said Hafez Mohammad, a Taliban commander, referring to the capital of Uruzgan province. The disease is also sweeping through the Taliban itself, with several high-level militants believed to be sick, according to international media reports. The group deny any of their senior leaders are ill. In his annual message marking the Eid holiday, the Taliban\u2019s top leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, urged people to seek medical help for the disease. But he also insisted the virus was caused by mankind\u2019s \u201ctransgression against Allah\u2019s religion\u201d. To stop the virus, people should \u201cseek forgiveness from Allah and stop violating his commands\u201d, Akhundzada said. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the militants had distributed booklets explaining how to prevent infections. \u201cOur mobile teams, using motorcycles, are taking people with symptoms to the hospitals,\u201d Mujahid told AFP. Experts, however, said the insurgents faced an uphill task. \u201cThere is no ambulance or a professional team that can take their samples or treat these suspected patients,\u201d health official Hamid Ahmadi said. Residents, meanwhile, say they have little information on what to do. \u201cMany people are complaining from flu-like symptoms ... we don\u2019t know why,\u201d said Haji Abdul Bari in Helmand. \u201cNobody has told us about the symptoms of corona. We don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d The governor of Tokyo, Yuriko Koike, has said today it may be necessary to a stage a \u201csimplified\u201d Olympics next year due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and that organisers were already discussing possible changes. Koike\u2019s comments come after the Yomiuri newspaper reported that various options, such as mandatory coronavirus testing and having fewer spectators, were being considered by organisers. John Coates, the head of the International Olympic Committee\u2019s (IOC) inspectorate for Tokyo, has said a lack of a defence against the new coronavirus threatened the Games and organisers had to start planning for what could be a \u201cvery different\u201d Olympics if there were no signs of Covid-19 being eradicated. Koike did not go into details but said such discussions were necessary. \u201cHolding the Olympic and Paralympic Games calls for sympathy and understanding of Tokyoites and the Japanese people,\u201d Koike told reporters. \u201cFor that, we need to rationalise what needs to be rationalised and simplify what needs to be simplified.\u201d The Yomiuri, citing government and organising committee sources, said making tests mandatory for all spectators \u2014 in addition to athletes and staff \u2014 and limiting movement in and out of the athletes village were among the options Japan would discuss with the IOC. The IOC and Japanese government in March took the unprecedented decision to delay the Games, which had been due to start in July, for a year due to the coronavirus outbreak. A further delay beyond 2021 has been ruled out. Around 700 workers at Israel\u2019s legislative body, the Knesset, were told not to come to work on Thursday after a member of parliament announced he had contracted the coronavirus, according to local media. Sami Abu Shehadeh, 44, a lawmaker for the majority-Arab Joint List alliance, said he had entered isolation after his driver tested positive for Covid-19. \u201cI appeal to anyone who was in my immediate area to go in isolation and do a test. I ask everyone to follow the instructions of the Ministry of Health,\u201d Abu Shehadeh said on Twitter. \u201cWe must all internalise that the campaign is not over yet. The virus still exists between us and the supposed return to a routine helps the virus spread in a big and fast way.\u201d Following an early and stringent lockdown, Israel was able to reduce the numbers of new daily virus cases into the low double digits. However, the country of 9 million has seen a resurgence in recent days. Dozens of schools have been closed over the past week, with several thousand students and staff told to isolate at home. Israel, which has a population of 9 million, has reported 17,343 coronavirus cases and 290 deaths. More than 593,000 people in the country have been tested for the virus, the Health Ministry said. The Associated Press have reported this morning about the crews of merchant ships, some of whom have been stranded at sea since the start of the coronavirus crisis: About 150,000 seafarers are stranded at sea in need of crew changes, according to the International Chamber of Shipping. Roughly another 150,000 are stuck on shore, waiting to get back to work. \u201cIn some ways, they\u2019ve been the forgotten army of people,\u201d said Guy Platten, secretary general of the ICS. \u201cIt\u2019s not a tenable position to keep on indefinitely. You can\u2019t just keep extending people,\u201d said Platten. With more than 80% of global trade by volume transported by sea, the world\u2019s more than 2 million merchant seafarers play a vital role. \u201cThey\u2019re out of sight and out of mind, and yet they\u2019re absolutely essential for moving the fuel, the food, the medical supplies and all the other vital goods to feed world trade,\u201d Platten said. International shipping organizations, trade unions and shipping companies are urging countries to recognize merchant crews as essential workers and allow them to travel and carry out crew changes. \u201cOur challenge now is to get a very strong message to governments. You can\u2019t expect people to move (personal protective equipment), drugs and all the issues that we need to respond to COVID, and keep cities and countries that are in lockdown fed, if you don\u2019t move cargo on ships,\u201d said Steve Cotton, General Secretary of the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation, or ITF. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to recognize the sacrifice seafarers are making for our global society. Capt. Andrei Kogankov is seven months into a four-month contract and was supposed to be replaced in mid-March in Qatar. But a few days before he arrived, Qatar imposed a lockdown and banned international flights. From there to South Korea, Japan, South Korea again and on to Singapore and Thailand, each time the same story: Lockdown. No flights. No going home. The open-ended extension of his contract \u2014 and with it the responsibility for his 21-man crew and a ship carrying flammable cargo \u2014 is taking its toll. \u201cWhen you are seven months on board, you are becoming physically and mentally exhausted,\u201d Kogankov said by satellite phone from Thailand. \u201cWe are working 24/7. We don\u2019t have, let\u2019s say, Friday night or Saturday night or weekends. No, the vessel is running all the time.\u201d Officers sign on for three to four months, the rest of the crew for around seven months. But they always have an end date. Take that away, and suddenly the prospect of endless workdays becomes a strain. \u201cWe\u2019re gravely worried that there could be a higher increase of incidents and accidents. But we also are seeing a high level of what I would describe as anxiety and frustration,\u201d Cotton said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to get off a ship, that adds to a high level of anxiety that really is quite demoralizing.\u201d Unless governments facilitate crew changes, Cotton warned, \u201cit\u2019s difficult for us to convince the seafarers not to take more dramatic action, and ... stop working.\u201d Morning/evening/whatever-it-is-where-you-are everyone. This is Simon Burnton taking on the live blog for the next few hours. If you have seen any stories that deserve our attention, or if you have any tips, comments or suggestions for our coverage then please let me know by sending me a message either to @Simon_Burnton on Twitter or via email. Thanks! That\u2019s all from me - I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague in London, Simon Burnton, who will bring you all the latest developments over the next few hours. Associated Press is exploring questions relating to the coronavirus pandemic, including: \u201cCan I get Covid-19 through my eyes or ears?\u201d. Here is the verdict: It\u2019s possible through the eyes, but not likely through the ears. As with the nose and mouth, doctors say the eyes may be a route of infection if someone with the virus coughs or sneezes nearby. Infection is also possible when rubbing your eyes with hands that have been exposed to the virus. Tears from an infected person could also spread the virus. Frequent hand washing, social distancing and the use of facial coverings in public are ways to keep the virus from spreading, including through the eyes. Glasses may also offer added protection, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Health care workers are advised to use safety goggles when treating potentially infected patients. Ears, on the other hand, are not believed to be a route of COVID-19 infection, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The skin in the outer ear canal is more like regular skin, unlike the tissue in the mouth, nose and sinuses. That creates a barrier that makes it difficult for the virus to enter, according to Dr. Benjamin Bleier at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in Boston. China on Thursday said foreign airlines blocked from operating in the country over virus fears would be allowed to resume limited flights, lifting a de facto ban on US carriers, Agence France-Presse reports. This comes a day after Washington ordered the suspension of all Chinese travel into and out of the US. The apparent decision to step back by Beijing follows rising tensions between the world\u2019s two superpowers over a series of issues including Donald Trump\u2019s accusations over China\u2019s handling of the pandemic, Hong Kong and Huawei. The latest spat was rooted in the Civil Aviation Authority of China (CAAC) deciding to impose a limit on foreign airlines based on their activity as of March 12. Because US carriers had suspended all flights by that date their cap was set at zero, while Chinese carriers\u2019 flights to the US continued. On Wednesday the US said it would block Chinese passenger flights from June 16, raising concerns of another front being opened up in the standoff between the two countries. But the CAAC on Thursday said all foreign airlines not listed in the March 12 schedule would now be able to operate one international route into China each week. Restrictions on entry to both the US and China remain in place. Relations between Washington and Beijing have become increasingly strained in recent months after Trump accused China of causing the virus intentionally, while a plan to impose a strict security law on Hong Kong has increased tensions substantially. People across almost all the world\u2019s leading rich economies have turned more sceptical about their governments\u2019 handling of the coronavirus pandemic with confidence slumping the most in Britain, Reuters reports. In May, in the G7 nations as a whole, 48% of respondents approved of how authorities had handled the pandemic, down from 50% in April and 54% in March, the survey published by polling firm Kantar showed. Britain saw the biggest drop - a sharp fall of 18 points from April to 51% - while in the United States, Canada, Germany, France and Italy, the declines ranged between two and six points. Japan was the only country to show an increase. Britain\u2019s Covid-19 death toll has surpassed 50,000, making the country one of the worst hit in the world by the pandemic. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also struggled to contain the fallout from a decision by his top advisor Dominic Cummings to undertake a long road trip to get family help at the height of the coronavirus lockdown when COVID-19 hit his household. The survey of 7,012 people was conducted between May 28 and June 1. Production companies in Turkey - known for its obsession with TV dramas - have been finding new ways to keep filming despite coronavirus restrictions, Agence France-Presse reports. The last six episodes of Tutunamayanlar, known as The Outcasts in English, were shot on video-conferencing platform Zoom, with actors going without makeup sessions or the usual costumes. Turkey\u2019s soap operas are taking the Arab world by storm, prompting TV executives to start importing Turkish series even to Latin American countries - a region more used to exporting its own \u201ctelenovelas\u201d. \u201cWe have adjusted our script accordingly, it\u2019s not like those we used to film. We have a different script, it\u2019s much more adjusted to the house setting,\u201d said Yener Yalcin, video assistant. Turkey has so far recorded 166,422 cases and 4,609 deaths. Thailand reported 17 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, all involving citizens who recently returned from abroad. The country, which has avoided a major outbreak, has recorded 3,101 cases so far. In total, there have been 58 fatalities. Mexico overtook the United States in daily reported deaths from coronavirus for the first time on Wednesday, Reuters reports. The health ministry registered a record 1,092 fatalities yesterday, and attributed the increase to improvements in documenting the pandemic. Latin American has emerged in recent weeks as a major center for coronavirus. Brazil, where the virus has hit hardest in the region, also reported a record number of deaths on Wednesday. The Mexican government had previously predicted the pandemic would peak in early May and under US pressure has begun reopening its vast auto industry, which underpins billions of dollars of business through cross-border supply chains. However, plans to further relax social distancing measures this week were put on hold in recognition of the fact that infections had not yet begun coming down. Wednesday saw a record 3,912 new infections, with the number of daily deaths more than twice the previous record of 501. The total number of known cases in Latin America\u2019s second-largest economy is now 101,238 and its tally of deaths is 11,729. Its death toll is seventh highest in the world, according to the Johns Hopkins University. The number of deaths caused by the coronavirus pandemic globally has now passed 385,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University dashboard. At total of 385,991 fatalities have been recorded worldwide. The US is the worst hit country, with 107,175 deaths, followed by the UK and Italy. For a summary of the biggest developments in the outbreak, here is the latest at a glance guide. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. Thanks for following along \u2013 and, as always, to those of you who got in touch. I\u2019m heading over to the George Floyd live blog now. My colleague Rebecca Ratcliffe will take it from here. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Known coronavirus cases pass 6.4 m. According to Johns Hopkins University, there have been 6,430,705 known coronavirus cases so far, and 385,947 deaths reported. Brazil looks to reopen despite record coronavirus deaths. Brazil registered a record number of daily deaths from the novel coronavirus for a second consecutive day, according to Health Ministry data released on Wednesday, even as city and state authorities move aggressively to open commerce back up. The nation recorded 1,349 new coronavirus deaths on Wednesday and 28,633 additional confirmed cases, the data showed. Brazil has now registered 32,548 deaths and 584,016 total confirmed cases. In Brazil, right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the virus, saying on Tuesday that death was \u201ceveryone\u2019s destiny.\u201d George Floyd had coronavirus, according to autopsy. Floyd tested positive for coronavirus, according to a full autopsy report released by the Hennepin county medical examiner\u2019s office. The report noted that the virus was not a contributing factor in his death and that Floyd was asymptomatic.KSTP news reports: \u201cA postmortem nasal swab was taken, which confirmed that Floyd was positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It is noted that Floyd was known to be positive for Covid-19 on April 3. The postmortem positivity likely reflects asymptomatic but persistent PCR positivity from previous infection, the report said.\u201d Mexico sees deaths twice as high as previous record. Mexican health authorities reported 1,092 coronavirus deaths on Wednesday, the highest toll in one day so far, with total infections surging past 100,000. The number of deaths was more than twice a previous record, and daily infections were also at an all time high of 3,912. The additions bring the total number of known cases to 101,238 and deaths to 11,729. Health authorities have previously said the real number is higher. California: rise in Covid-19 cases raises fears over reopening and protests. The number of coronavirus cases in California is on the rise after weeks of optimism that infections had slowed, raising fears that plans to reopen counties, along with mass protests against police brutality, could accelerate transmission of the virus.According to numbers from Johns Hopkins University, which has been tracking coronavirus cases and deaths, California is one of 20 states that have seen an uptick in cases in the past five days. Coronavirus crisis could cause $25tn fossil fuel industry collapse. The coronavirus outbreak could trigger a $25tn (\u00a320tn) collapse in the fossil fuel industry by accelerating a terminal decline for the world\u2019s most polluting companies.A study has found that the value of the world\u2019s fossil fuel reserves could fall by two-thirds, sooner than the industry expects, because the Covid-19 crisishas hastened the peak for oil, gas and coal demand.The looming fossil fuel collapse could pose \u201ca significant threat to global financial stability\u201d by wiping out the market value of fossil fuel companies, according to financial thinktank Carbon Tracker. Spain\u2019s congress voted to approve a sixth and final two-week extension of the country\u2019s state of emergency. It has been in effect since 14 March and Wednesday\u2019s vote means that the exceptional measures that have underpinned one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns will now remain in force until 21 June. The UK\u2019s business secretary Alok Sharma went into self-isolation after beginning to feel unwell in the House of Commons chamber.He was delivering the second reading of the corporate governance and insolvency bill. WHO reports 100,000 new cases a day for five days. The World Health Organization has received reports of 100,000 new cases of coronavirus every day for the past five days, as the outbreak gathers pace in various regions around the world, its director general has said. The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also said it has resumed trials of hydroxychloroquine, an arthritis drug that had been used to treat Covid-19 patients, after reviewing studies that apparently showed it was dangerous. In El-Arish, the provincial capital of Egypt\u2019s North Sinai, a group of women sew colourful Bedouin designs on masks to combat coronavirus, as an insurgency simmers in their restive region, AFP reports. Egypt\u2019s toll from the Covid-19 pandemic has reached over 28,600 cases, including more than 1,000 deaths, while North Sinai itself remains the bloody scene of a long-running Islamist insurgency. \u201cI learnt how to embroider when I was a young girl watching my mother,\u201d homemaker Naglaa Mohammed, 36, told AFP on a landline from El-Arish. A versatile embroiderer, she also beads garments and crafts rings and bracelets. Now with the pandemic, she has been designing face masks showcasing her Bedouin heritage. Bedouins are nomadic tribes who traditionally inhabit desert areas throughout the Arab world, from North Africa to Iraq. Many have now integrated into a more urban lifestyle. Egypt\u2019s Bedouin textile tradition of tatriz - weaving and beading rich geometric and abstract designs on garments, cushions and purses - has been passed down from generation to generation for centuries. It has survived in the Sinai Peninsula, whose north has been plagued by years of militant activity and terror attacks spearheaded by a local affiliate of the Islamic State (IS) group. In Australia, while speaking at Googong, New South Wales, about the homebuilder scheme \u2013 a new tranche of economic stimulus designed to create a pipeline of work for the construction sector \u2013 on Thursday morning, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison was interrupted by a homeowner opposite. \u2018Can everyone get off the grass please?\u2019 the unknown man said. \u2018Hey guys, I\u2019ve just reseeded that,\u2019 he added when the media pack wasn\u2019t fast enough to decamp from the plush new outdoor carpet: Germany has seen a surge in numbers of people seeking help for alcohol addiction since lockdown measures were introduced in early March, AFP reports. According to a spokesman for Alcoholics Anonymous, enquiries to the group\u2019s national helpline have roughly doubled - from about 10 calls per day to about 20. Sales of alcohol rose sharply during the initial phase of the lockdown as many people turned to drinking at home as a substitute for banned social events. Wine sales at the end of March were 34% higher than during the same week in February, and sales of spirits went up 31%, according to a study published in the Spiegel magazine. But the pandemic has also prompted many people to confront problematic alcohol use, whether through increased self-reflection or because family members finally became aware of how much they were drinking, according to the Alcoholics Anonymous spokesman. \u201cSome people use or abuse the way to work and the workplace as a drinking opportunity, and in many cases this is now no longer available,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have to start drinking at home, and then their spouse or family can see how much they really drink. They get to the point where they realise that there is no way to hide it.\u201d Alcoholics Anonymous holds about 2,000 regular meetings across Germany. A spokesman for one of the groups in Berlin said it is now getting roughly one enquiry a day, compared to one or two a month before the pandemic started. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge increase, that\u2019s definitely clear,\u201d he said. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 394 to 182,764, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Thursday. The death toll rose by 30 to 8,581, the tally showed. The Guardian\u2019s Charlotte Graham-McLay has a request \u2013 she is trying to track down New Zealand\u2019s last remaining coronavirus case, a woman who is not in hospital, but is still ill with the virus. She would like to speak to this person anonymously. Are you able to help? Her request here: New Zealand\u2019s streak of days without a new recorded case of Covid-19 \u2013 13 straight days on Thursday \u2013 isn\u2019t the only detail the public wants to know when health officials release their daily afternoon update. They\u2019re also eager to hear the status of the single person in the country who is still recovering from Covid-19. Since last Friday, only one person in New Zealand - which has had less than 1,500 confirmed cases of the virus and 22 deaths - has remained ill with the virus. They are not in hospital. But each day, we\u2019re told, they are still recovering. All we know is that the woman, aged in her 50s, lives in Auckland and was associated with a cluster of cases at St Margaret\u2019s rest home in Te Atatu. The Guardian is keen to speak anonymously to this person, who can contact our reporter Charlotte Graham-McLay by emailing charlottegrahammclay[at]gmail.com. She is also on Twitter here. Brazil registered a record number of daily deaths from the novel coronavirus for a second consecutive day, according to Health Ministry data released on Wednesday, even as city and state authorities move aggressively to open commerce back up, Reuters reports. The nation recorded 1,349 new coronavirus deaths on Wednesday and 28,633 additional confirmed cases, the data showed. Brazil has now registered 32,548 deaths and 584,016 total confirmed cases. In Brazil, right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the virus, saying on Tuesday that death was \u201ceveryone\u2019s destiny.\u201d State and local authorities that have supported quarantining measures are loosening restrictions as hunger grows and public finances, shaky in the best of times, plummet deep into the red. In Rio de Janeiro, the nation\u2019s second-largest city, many types of shops were allowed to open for the first time in months on Tuesday. \u201cFirst, we have to think of health before everything. Without doubt, we have to think about the economy with hunger and all those things, but Covid-19 is a disease that kills,\u201d said Renato Maya, a resident of Niteroi, right across the bay from Rio, as he took a city-provided coronavirus test on Wednesday. \u201cThe reopening to me seems necessary, but it needs to be done quite carefully.\u201d Podcast: From Anfield to Cheltenham: did major events cost lives? A series of high-profile sporting events went ahead as scheduled in mid-March even as Covid-19 was being declared a pandemic. The Guardian\u2019s David Conn investigates the scientific reasoning behind the decision, while Liverpool fan Simon Renoldi reflects on the loss of his father: Stuff.NZ reports that New Zealand has yet again confirmed zero new coronavirus cases: For the 13th day in a row New Zealand has no new coronavirus cases, Director General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said on Thursday. One active case still remains. Bloomfield updated the public on our coronavirus situation at a media briefing at the National Library Auditorium on Thursday. The total number of confirmed cases remains at 1154, which is the number reported to the World Health Organisation. The combined total of confirmed and probable cases remains at 1504. No-one is currently in hospital with the virus. China\u2019s civil aviation regulator will let foreign airlines currently not allowed to operate international routes to China to start once-a-week routes into a designated city from 8 June, news website The Paper reported on Thursday. The Paper, backed by the Shanghai city government, cited an order from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) that said qualifying airlines can choose the destination to which they wish to fly.

Zoom, the popular video conferencing platform, has announced it will provide end-to-end encryption after facing a litany of privacy and security concerns \u2013 but only to users who pay for it. Eric Yuan, the company\u2019s CEO, raised alarm among privacy advocates on Wednesday by saying Zoom planned to exclude free calls from end-to-end encryption so as to leave open the possibility of working with law enforcement. \u201cFree users for sure we don\u2019t want to give [end-to-end encryption] because we also want to work together with FBI, with local law enforcement in case some people use Zoom for a bad purpose,\u201d Yuan said on the call with analysts. Privacy and security experts say encryption, which secures communication so that it can only be read by the users involved, is particularly important at a time when video apps and other digital platforms are being used for sensitive issues such as organizing protests, discussing legal issues, and attending medical appointments. Floyd tested positive for coronavirus, according to a full autopsy report released by the Hennepin county medical examiner\u2019s office. The report noted that the virus was not a contributing factor in his death and that Floyd was asymptomatic. KSTP news reports: A postmortem nasal swab was taken, which confirmed that Floyd was positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It is noted that Floyd was known to be positive for COVID-19 on April 3. The postmortem positivity likely reflects asymptomatic but persistent PCR positivity from previous infection, the report said. In case you missed it earlier: the World Health Organization has received reports of 100,000 new cases of coronavirus every day for the past five days, as the outbreak gathers pace in various regions around the world, its director general has said. Opening the WHO\u2019s regular coronavirus briefing, Tedros said: More than 100,000 cases of Covid-19 have been reported to WHO for each of the past five days. The Americas continues to account for the most cases. For several weeks, the number of cases reported each day in the Americas has been more than the rest of the world put together. We are especially worried about Central and South America, where many countries are witnessing accelerating epidemics. We also see increasing numbers of cases in the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and Africa, although the numbers are much smaller. Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 cases in Europe continues to decline. Yesterday saw the fewest cases reported in Europe since 22 March. Protestors in Dakar, Senegal, set tyres on fire and threw stones at security forces on Wednesday night during protests over a nationwide dusk-to-dawn curfew imposed almost three months ago because of the coronavirus pandemic. The unrest in Senegal\u2019s capital followed similar action in the holy city of Touba a night earlier, where crowds of people torched an ambulance, threw rocks and looted office buildings. \u201cYouths took to the streets after the curfew and tangled with police officers, throwing stones and burning tires,\u201d a resident in central Dakar, who requested anonymity citing security concerns, told Reuters. There were also protests in the Kaolack region in the south of the country, a local official said. Senegal\u2019s government has not faced major opposition to its handling of the pandemic but the economy has been hard hit by measures like the overnight curfew and a ban on inter-regional travel. Senegal has confirmed almost 4,000 cases of Covid-19, including 45 deaths. Dakar and Touba, which is both a trading hub and major pilgrimage destination, have been hardest hit. The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected late last year, has tested nearly 10 million people in an unprecedented 19-day campaign to check an entire city, AP reports. It identified just 300 positive cases, all of whom had no symptoms. The city found no infections among 1,174 close contacts of the people who tested positive, suggesting they were not spreading it easily to others. That is a potentially encouraging development because of widespread concern that infected people without symptoms could be silent spreaders of the disease. It not only makes the people of Wuhan feel at ease, it also increases peoples confidence in all of China, Feng Zijian, vice director of Chinas Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told state broadcaster CCTV. There is no definitive answer yet on the level of risk posed by asymptomatic cases, with anecdotal evidence and studies to date producing conflicting answers. Wuhan was by far the hardest hit city in China, accounting for more than 80% of the countrys deaths, according to government figures. Mexican health authorities reported 1,092 coronavirus deaths on Wednesday, the highest toll in one day so far, with total infections surging past 100,000. The number of deaths was more than twice a previous record, and daily infections were also at an all time high of 3,912. The additions bring the total number of known cases to 101,238 and deaths to 11,729. Health authorities have previously said the real number is higher. The coronavirus outbreak could trigger a $25tn (\u00a320tn) collapse in the fossil fuel industry by accelerating a terminal decline for the world\u2019s most polluting companies. A study has found that the value of the world\u2019s fossil fuel reserves could fall by two-thirds, sooner than the industry expects, because the Covid-19 crisis has hastened the peak for oil, gas and coal demand. The looming fossil fuel collapse could pose \u201ca significant threat to global financial stability\u201d by wiping out the market value of fossil fuel companies, according to financial thinktank Carbon Tracker. The number of coronavirus cases in California is on the rise after weeks of optimism that infections had slowed, raising fears that plans to reopen counties, along with mass protests against police brutality, could accelerate transmission of the virus. According to numbers from Johns Hopkins University, which has been tracking coronavirus cases and deaths, California is one of 20 states that have seen an uptick in cases in the past five days. \u2018Governor, let me see my kids before I die\u2019: pressure mounts to release elderly women from prisonsRead more Just this week, daily cases of Covid-19 hit a new high across the state, topping 3,000 new daily confirmed cases for the second time in a week and contributing to the 115,000 cases and more than 4,300 deaths the state has reported since the pandemic began. California has been held up as a model for its response to the coronavirus, locking down earlier, and being slower to lift shelter-in-place orders compared to other states. But recent weeks have seen counties push back on the orders, in some cases reopening sections of the economy in defiance of orders from Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor. China reported one new coronavirus case and four new asymptomatic Covid-19 cases for 3 June, the health commission said on Thursday. The National Health Commission said all five of the cases were imported, involving travellers from overseas. For 2 June, China reported one confirmed case and 4 asymptomatic cases. China does not count asymptomatic patients, those who are infected with the coronavirus but do not exhibit symptoms, as confirmed cases. The total number of infections in China stands at 83,022. The death toll remained unchanged at 4,634. Tens of thousands of Hong Kongers are expected to mark the 31st anniversary of the military crackdown on the Tiananmen pro-democracy movement in their own localities after police banned an annual candlelit vigil that has taken place uninterrupted for 30 years, citing public health concerns. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which has organised the vigil for the past 30 years, asked Hong Kongers to hold individual commemorations through lighting candles wherever they are in the city on the anniversary. Fearing commemorations might soon be barred under the national security laws, the alliance said its members still planned to gather at Victoria Park to light candles in groups of eight, in order not to breach the government\u2019s social distancing restrictions, and planned to stream the event live online. Rights groups say the government is using Covid-19 as a pretext to stifle freedom of expression as numerous restrictions, including on swimming pools and religious gatherings, were recently lifted due to low numbers of infections. More on Germany\u2019s stimulus package: With borders slamming shut, employees kept home, and shops and restaurants forced to close to halt transmission of the coronavirus, Germany is headed for the worst recession in its post-war history. Disruptions to trade and travel have also weighed on the export powerhouse. Latest data released earlier Wednesday showed that the unemployment rate rose to 6.3% in May, the equivalent of some 2.8 million people, from 5.8% in April. With new infections sharply dropping, Europe\u2019s biggest economy began easing social restrictions in early May, allowing shops to reopen while restaurants and tourist businesses are taking the first tentative steps. Factories too are restarting their production lines. Merkel has said the support programme will help \u201cthe economy to find its feet and grow again\u201d. A controversial plan for a cash-for-clunkers scheme that also covers petrol and diesel cars did not materialise after noisy environmental protests. The youth environmental movement \u201cFridays for Future\u201d had organised some 60 protests nationwide on Tuesday, with demonstrators asked to wear masks and keep their distance in line with coronavirus-fighting measures. Meanwhile, companies in sectors hardest hit by the crisis - including hospitality, tourism and entertainment - will receive \u201cbridging help\u201d worth \u20ac25bn in total from June to August. Under the measure, restaurants, hotels or event management companies could get up to 80% of their fixed operating costs reimbursed if revenues had plunged by more than 70% compared to a year ago. In case you missed this earlier: Germany will plough \u20ac130bn (US$146 billion) into a stimulus package to kick-start an economy severely hit by the coronavirus pandemic, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday. Under the wide-ranging measures outlined in a 15-page document, value-added tax will be temporarily slashed, families will receive 300 euros for each child, while those who purchase electric cars will see a government rebate doubled to \u20ac6,000. \u201cThe size of the package will reach \u20ac130bn for 2020 to 2021, \u20ac120bn of which will be borne by the federal government,\u201d said Merkel. \u201cWe have an economic stimulus package, a package for the future and in addition, we\u2019re now dealing with our responsibility for Europe and the international dimension.\u201d Noting that millions of employees in Germany have been put on shorter working hours, Merkel said that \u201cshows how fragile the whole thing is, and why we must succeed in giving the economy a push so that jobs can be secured.\u201d \u201cWe need to get out of this crisis with an oomph,\u201d said Finance Minister Olaf Scholz. The fresh stimulus comes on top of a massive \u20ac1.1tn rescue package already agreed in March, comprising loan guarantees, subsidies and a beefed-up shorter-hours programme to avoid job cuts. To fund the unprecedented package, parliament had approved new borrowing, marking a sea change in German economic policy, upending a financial-crisis-era constitutional rule drastically limiting budget deficits. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. As always, please do get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. A \u20ac130bn (\u00a3116bn) post-lockdown stimulus package has been agreed by the coalition partners running the country, the chancellor Angela Merkel announced. The agreement paved the way for a fiscal programme that is substantially bigger than similar packages by Germany\u2019s Eurozone partners. Meanwhile the World Health Organization says that for the past five days, cases have risen by 100,000 a day worldwide. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Known coronavirus cases number around 6.4m, according to Johns Hopkins University, with the current number at 6,392,319. There have been 383,298 deaths reported so far. Spain\u2019s congress voted to approve a sixth and final two-week extension of the country\u2019s state of emergency. It has been in effect since 14 March and Wednesday\u2019s vote means that the exceptional measures that have underpinned one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns will now remain in force until 21 June. The UK\u2019s business secretary Alok Sharma went into self-isolation after beginning to feel unwell in the House of Commons chamber.He was delivering the second reading of the corporate governance and insolvency bill. The World Health Organization said it has received reports of 100,000 new cases every day for the past five days, as the outbreak gathers pace in various regions around the world. The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also said it has resumed trials of hydroxychloroquine, an arthritis drug that had been used to treat Covid-19 patients, after reviewing studies that apparently showed it was dangerous. Pakistan recorded its largest single day increase in infections, as a fourth politician died after testing positive for the virus. Mian Jamshed Kakakhel, who was a member of a provincial assembly in the north-west, died on Wednesday. Yesterday two other lawmakers died after testing positive. The number of Covid-19 deaths per capita in Sweden surpassed that of France. With 450 deaths per 1 million people, Sweden now has the seventh-worst death rate in the world, according to tallies kept on the Worldometers website. Entry checks at land borders to Austria introduced because of the pandemic will be scrapped from Thursday, except for those at the border with Italy, Austria\u2019s foreign minister announced. The controls on the Italian border will be evaluated again next week, Alexander Schallenberg told a press conference. The UK government was criticised for failing to release test and trace data. The former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, told the programme\u2019s chief, Dido Harding: \u201cI hope you understand that our frustration is that it is very hard to scrutinise what the government is doing if we\u2019re not given the data that allows us to do that.\u201d Germany will continue to warn against non-essential travel to the UK while it maintains its 14-day quarantine rules, despite removing curbs for travel to the rest of Europe. The foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said his government will scrap general travel warnings for 30 countries, including the UK, from 15 June.",

      "bodyText": "Brazil has overtaken Italy as the country with the third-highest Covid-19 death toll after a daily record of 1,473 fatalities took its total tally to more than 34,000. The figure was published by Brazil\u2019s health ministry on Thursday night and means only the United States and the United Kingdom have registered more deaths because of the pandemic. The official number of infections rose to nearly 615,000, second only to the US. In an online broadcast shortly before the numbers were released, Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro made almost no mention of the victims but continued to publicly attack efforts to slow the advance of coronavirus with quarantine measures and social distancing. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this. Nobody can take it anymore,\u201d Bolsonaro said of the shutdown efforts being implemented by state governors and mayors across Brazil. \u201cThe collateral impact will be far greater than those people who unfortunately lost their lives because of these last three months here,\u201d Bolsonaro said. The numbers \u2013 which came after Mexico reported a record daily tally of more than 1,000 deaths on Wednesday \u2013 reinforced fears that Latin America\u2019s two biggest economies, and other countries in the region, were facing a bleak few months. Mexico\u2019s death toll now stands at nearly 12,000 with the number of infections rising above 100,000 on Wednesday. Chile is also grappling with a growing crisis, this week extending a quarantine of the capital, Santiago, as the country\u2019s total number of fatalities rose to nearly 1,300. Despite the worsening situation, many parts of the region are moving towards reopening, against the advice of most medical experts. Miguel Lago, the director of Brazil\u2019s Institute for Health Policy Studies, said reopening was a mistake that was likely to cause an explosion of infections and pile further pressure on hospitals that were already struggling to cope with the pandemic. \u201cI am very worried \u2026 We are going to witness hospitals collapsing in almost every state,\u201d Lago warned. \u201cI think the worst is still to come.\u201d Coronavirus cases have now been detected in more than 70% of Brazilian cities, with the south-eastern states of Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo particularly badly hit.
