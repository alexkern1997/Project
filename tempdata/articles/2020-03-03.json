      "bodyText": "Exit polls from Israel\u2019s third election within a year suggested Benjamin Netanyahu and his rightwing allies are ahead but still one seat short of a parliamentary majority needed to form a government. The unofficial figures from three major television channels released on Monday evening showed the prime minister\u2019s Likud party with around 37 seats. Retired general Benny Gantz and his Blue and White party, which has run a campaign focused on Netanyahu\u2019s upcoming criminal corruption trial, had about 33 seats. Post-voting polls have proved unreliable in the past and minor differences could significantly alter the makeup of Israel\u2019s next government. Regardless, the polls suggested a stunning turnaround in support for the embattled leader, and he was quick to claim a victory on Twitter. \u201cWe won by believing in our own way and by the people of Israel,\u201d he said. Later speaking at an election rally in Tel Aviv he said to cheering crowds: \u201cWe stood in front of strong forces. They told us we are going to lose, that it was the end of the Netanyahu era.\u201d \u201cWe turned lemons into lemonade.\u201d In a statement, Likud said Netanyahu had spoken to all the heads of right-wing parties and \u201cagreed to form a strong national government for Israel as soon as possible\u201d. Gantz admitted \u201cdisappointment\u201d, telling supporters in Tel Aviv that he had hoped for \u201ca different result\u201d. Netanyahu could win if his alliance with smaller rightwing parties gains a 61-seat majority in the 120-seat Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament. If the official results due on Tuesday morning are the same as the exit poll, his party will only get 60 seats and Israeli politicians could again be plunged into weeks of high-stakes negotiations and even the possibility of a fourth election if the process breaks down. Responding to the exit polls, Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian envoy to the UK, said Israeli voters \u201crewarded hate, corruption &amp; the promise to annex the occupied territories,\u201d referring to Netanyahu\u2019s recent promises to take more Palestinian land. More than 6.3 million people were eligible to cast their votes in polling stations that closed at 10pm (8pm GMT). For the more than 5,500 Israelis who were under precautionary home isolation after returning from areas of the world affected by coronavirus, separate polling stations made of plastic sheeting had been set up just for them around the country. In an empty parking lot in the Jerusalem neighbourhood of Talpiot, one such booth was staffed by election officials in full white protective suits. Using a megaphone, a police officer called for the people, who wore blue gloves and face masks to reduce the chance of contamination, to enter one by one. Ten Israelis have contracted the virus and are quarantined. The health ministry, however, has urged people that it is safe to vote. Over the weekend, in the final stretch of a campaign that has increasingly descended into mudslinging, Netanyahu and Gantz ripped into each other. Netanyahu told Channel 12 that Gantz was \u201cnot fit\u201d to be prime minister. \u201cHe is weak; he\u2019s not a leader,\u201d he said. Gantz said in another interview that his opponent was acting as if he was part of a mafia. The country has been in a state of political crisis for almost 12 months after two previous general elections failed to produce a clear winner. Central to the deadlock is the Israeli prime minister, the longest-serving in the country\u2019s history, who has managed to persuade allies and even some foes that rematch after rematch is preferable to any deal that does not include him as leader. Gantz has focused his campaign on Netanyahu\u2019s alleged corruption and anti-democratic moves, but he also failed to form a government after coming out marginally ahead in the previous election. In an embarrassing blow to Gantz four days before the election, a recording emerged on Thursday of his top strategist, Israel Bachar, privately complaining to his rabbi of his boss\u2019s lack of \u201ccourage\u201d. Local press reported the rabbi had secretly recorded the conversation. Gantz fired Bachar for the comments but the words played into one of Netanyahu\u2019s biggest campaign tactics \u2013 arguing that Gantz does not have the stomach to face the country\u2019s security issues. Netanyahu\u2019s other election strategy has been to energise his hardline nationalist base, with promises of land grabs from Palestinians. On Tuesday, he announced he would go ahead with a highly controversial plan to build settlements east of Jerusalem. The plan would almost completely encircle Palestinian neighbourhoods in the holy city. The prime minister made similar appeals before the previous votes. In April, he said he would annex all current settlements, and in September he promised to go further, by claiming sovereignty over a third of the entire West Bank. He has also looked to his rightwing global ally, Donald Trump, to help him convince Israelis that he is the only leader able to garner concessions from world powers. In late January, the US president appeared to gift Netanyahu just that, revealing a \u201cvision for peace\u201d plan in the White House that read like a checklist of demands from the Israeli far right. It gave the country Jerusalem, huge swathes of the Palestinian territories and permanent security control over Palestinians, whose leadership rejected the plan as flagrantly biased. In preparation for election day, the Israeli military closed crossings with the occupied West Bank, where more than 2.5 million Palestinians live under Israeli rule but cannot vote, and Gaza, where 2 million more live under a blockade. Meanwhile, a November indictment for three major corruption cases against him has dented Netanyahu\u2019s image. Netanyahu, who denies the charges, is expected to appear in court on 17 March, the first day of his criminal trial. Ari Gorlin, who works for a software company in Jerusalem, said he had long respected Netanyahu as \u201csmart and capable\u201d but was voting for Gantz due to the corruption allegations. \u201cHe was a good leader.

      "bodyText": "After the first human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus in Australia, the federal attorney general has made clear the government already has powers to detain people \u2013 against their will if necessary \u2013 to prevent the spread of the virus. So what powers does the federal government have \u2013 whether you\u2019re in Australia already or arriving at the border \u2013 to respond to the health crisis? Human biosecurity control orders Under changes made to the Biosecurity Act in 2015, government authorities designated by the chief medical officer can make a \u201chuman biosecurity control order\u201d to require an individual to do or not do certain things. These include to: Provide contact details Regularly update an officer of their health status Restrict movement by remaining at the individual\u2019s place of residence for a specified period Undergo decontamination Provide body samples for diagnosis Undertake treatment or receive a vaccination To remain in Australia for up to 28 days; or Be isolated at a medical facility Authorities\u2019 preference is that individuals consent to the control order, which is what occurred when Australians returning from Wuhan province stayed at Howard Springs and Christmas Island. But if a person refuses there is a power for the director of human biosecurity \u2013 the chief medical officer \u2013 to compel them. An individual must comply with an isolation measure or a traveller movement measure for the first 72 hours while a direction is being sought. If an individual refuses to comply with a requirement to stay at a particular place or isolate themselves, there is a power for police to detain them. On Tuesday the attorney general, Christian Porter, said it is \u201cnot inconceivable\u201d that control orders could lead to detention if individuals refused control orders but this was intended as a \u201clast resort\u201d. He suggested the powers were most likely to be used to require people visiting sick relatives to undergo decontamination, to prevent them entering or exiting a medical clinic, or to answer questions at a hospital in the same way they do when entering or exiting Australia. Human health response zones In addition to powers to control individuals, there is a power to set a \u201chuman health response zones\u201d to apply entry and exit requirements on everyone in a particular area. Porter said if these powers are used to respond to coronavirus it would be the \u201cfirst time ever\u201d they have been used in Australia. The Diamond Princess was designated a human health zone. \u201cFor the first time really at a mass level in Australia people might be required to give me information about who they\u2019ve come in contact with at certain points in time,\u201d he said. Porter suggested places likely to be listed as human health response zones would include fever clinics \u201cwhich are designed to help people recover from the acute fever that comes with coronavirus and people entering and leaving those zones could be subject to requirements that are [compulsory]\u201d. Porter told ABC Radio National this could \u201cpotentially\u201d be applied to buildings, shopping centres and football stadiums although all designations require consultation between the chief health officer for the relevant state or territory and the director of biosecurity. At the border On Tuesday Porter explained that control orders have already been used for people attempting to enter Australia, where there is \u201ca suspicion that they might have some ailments\u201d. Detention powers under the Biosecurity Act are \u201cactually used quite regularly at our borders, at airports\u201d, he told Sky News. Human biosecurity emergency In addition to control orders, there are powers for the health minister enlivened by emergencies involving threats or harm to human health on a nationally significant scale, called human biosecurity emergencies. These powers allow the minister to \u201cdetermine any requirement that he or she is satisfied is necessary\u201d to prevent entry or spread of a disease. They are subject to safeguards that the requirement must be \u201clikely to be effective\u201d, is \u201cappropriate and adapted\u201d to its purpose and is \u201cno more restrictive or intrusive than is required in the circumstances\u201d. Offences for failing to comply are punishable by five years in prison or 300 penalty units (about $63,000, indexed to inflation); the same penalties apply to failure to comply with a control order. Civil liberties concerns In a statement the Law Council president, Pauline Wright, said it \u201cabsolutely supports\u201d action to keep Australians safe, but powers under the Biosecurity Act should be used \u201cwith the utmost caution\u201d and \u201conly \u2026 as a last resort\u201d. \u201cThe exceptional powers under the Act do not have the types of safeguards and independent oversight protections afforded to our law enforcement and security agencies\u2019 exercise of coercive powers,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile control orders in cases of infectious disease may be justified, there is no requirement for a person to actually be infected or for the officer to even reasonably believe or suspect that the person is infected, or may be infected, with a [listed human disease], before a control order can be made.\u201d Wright said orders can have a \u201csignificant impact upon a person\u2019s liberty\u201d, such as isolation or restricted movement. \u201cWhile the use of such a power may be necessary to limit the spread of potentially dangerous infectious diseases, the threshold for determining a [listed human disease] and then for imposing a control order needs to be carefully considered to ensure it achieves this purpose based on reasonable grounds.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Public schools in New South Wales have been told to stop overseas excursions amid growing concern about the spread of the coronavirus in Australia. After the first two cases of community transmission in NSW were confirmed this week, the state\u2019s education department wrote to principals instructing them to cancel or delay overseas trips. \u201cMany of our schools have planned overseas travel or excursions to occur during the year,\u201d the letter said. \u201cHowever, with the current Covid-19 situation, the safety of our students and staff is paramount and it is for this reason that all overseas excursions are required to be now placed on hold until further notice. \u201cIf you have an excursion planned for later in term one you will need to make the necessary arrangement to cancel the excursion or consider rescheduling until later in the year.\u201d Students returning from China and Iran already must self-isolate for 14 days, but banning overseas trips goes beyond the advice from the foreign affairs and trade department. The ban does not apply to independent schools, although the Catholic school sector said it would decide \u201ccase by case\u201d. Other states, including Queensland and Victoria, have no formal ban on travel although some schools have cancelled trips. \u201cAt this stage no blanket ban has been imposed with regards to overseas school excursions,\u201d the Queensland education minister, Grace Grace, said. \u201cAs with all issues relating to coronavirus, we take advice from the chief health officer and in consideration of Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advice. \u201cI am aware that some schools have reconsidered their overseas travel plans and have postponed trips until later in the year. Should the advice change to warrant a blanket ban, we will act accordingly.\u201d In Western Australia, education officials have told students to stay home if they have been in close contact with a confirmed case of coronavirus \u201cirrespective of whether they have developed symptoms\u201d. The NSW Health pandemic plan lists schools as potential overflow facilities in a worst-case scenario where hospitals are overrun. However, the plan said school closures might not be effective in stopping the spread of the virus. \u201cIt is important to note that school closures have only been shown to be moderately effective at reducing transmission rates and the timing and duration of closures would need to be carefully considered,\u201d the plan states. \u201cTherefore a range of measures designed to help reduce social mixing of students in order to reduce transmission of the pandemic virus may be considered.\u201d Last week the West Australian chief health officer, Andrew Robertson, said the state would consider closing schools if officials believed it would limit the spread of the virus. Schools would be closed only if \u201cwe believe there had been a spread in a community and that we wanted to limit that spread further in that community and felt that schools were a place that spread may be occurring\u201d. \u201cOne of the challenges here is that we don\u2019t really know what the spread will be in the community, but based on other countries we have to prepare for significant numbers of our population, whether that\u2019s tens of thousands or less numbers, it\u2019s hard to say,\u201d he said.",

All around the world people are changing their daily habits at work and at home to reduce the risk of contracting the coronavirus and prevent it from spreading. Here are some of the ways that habits are changing around the world. China In Beijing, the capital of the country where the outbreak began, red billboards tell people not to shake hands but to join their own hands together in a sign of greeting. Loudspeakers tell people to make the traditional gong shou gesture (a fist in the opposite palm) to say hello. France Newspapers have been filled with advice over how to replace handshaking \u2013 a daily formality for the French at work and kissing on the cheek, a regular greeting habit in France even between people who have only just met. Lifestyle expert Philippe Lichtfus, who has been widely cited in the media, insists that handshakes are a relatively recent development in human history that began in the Middle Ages. He says simply looking into a person\u2019s eyes can suffice as a greeting. Australia Brad Hazzard, the New South Wales health minister, advised people not to shake hands and instead give each other a pat on the back. \u201cI won\u2019t say don\u2019t kiss\u201d he said, \u201cbut you could be exercising a degree of care and caution with whom you choose to kiss.\u201d Brazil The Brazilian health ministry has recommended that citizens not share the metal straws traditionally used to consume the caffeine-rich South American drink mate, also known as chimarr\u00e3o. And a kiss \u2013 even if it is not on the mouth \u2013 is totally advised against. Germany In a sign of the times, Germany\u2019s interior minister Horst Seehofer rebuffed Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s attempt to shake hands with him on Monday, smiling and keeping both his hands to himself. They both laughed and Merkel threw her hand up in the air before taking a seat. Spain The outbreak could also hit one of Spain\u2019s most cherished traditions \u2013 the kissing of sculptures of the Virgin Mary in the week leading up to Easter. With just a month to go before the week starts, the ritual could be banned. \u201cIt is one of the measures that is on the table,\u201d said national health official Fernando Simon.

McKibbin, whose previous work on the economic impact of disease includes examining the impact of the 2002 Sars pandemic, has modelled the effects of a range of Covid-19 infection scenarios on growth in Australia and around the world. He said if the disease went global it could carve as little as 2% from Australian growth, but this would still be enough to send the economy into recession, given that GDP increased by just 1.7% in 2019. In the worst-case scenario, where the disease spreads aggressively and kills 3% of patients, Australias GDP would plunge 7.9% in the first year before quickly bouncing back. McKibbin, a professor at the Australian National University and a former board member of the Reserve Bank, cautioned that his results were very sensitive to the assumptions used, including government responses. \u201cWhile cutting interest rates is an option, the shock will require a mix of monetary, fiscal and health policy responses,\u201d he said. \u201cQuarantining affected people and reducing large-scale social interaction would be an effective response.\u201d He said the outbreak showed that no country was an island given the tight integration of the global economy. \u201cOur study suggests big economic costs in countries such as Australia can be avoided through global cooperative investment in public health in all countries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have known this for decades, yet politicians continue to ignore the scientific and economic evidence about the role of global public health in improving the quality of life and driving economic growth for us all.\u201d The crisis has already caused a plunge of more than 10% in stock markets across the globe, although shares staged a small recovery in North America on Monday night and were rallying in Australia on Tuesday, to be up almost 1.9% at lunchtime.

He announced his resignation on air, citing a conversation with NBC, and apologized for the comments he has made about women. Journalist <strong>Laura Bassett, </strong>who wrote in GQ just days ago about Matthews\u2019 inappropriate behavior towards her and his <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/chris-matthews-resigns-from-msnbc-after-accusations-of-sexism-and-harassment\">decades of inappropriate behavior</a> towards other women, wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201d </li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e5dc44a8f08e1332474e11f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T02:47:46.202Z\">2.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>\u201cWe want to win big, and Joe Biden can do that,\u201d Sen.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re wrapping up our politics live blog for tonight, as a rally for Joe Biden in Dallas, Texas, marks a new stage in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, with centrist candidates ending their campaigns and rallying for Biden against Bernie Sanders. Evening updates: Speaking at an energetic rally in Dallas, Texas, Sen. Amy Klobuchar ended her campaign and endorsed Joe endorses Biden for president, telling Americans: \u201cJoe knows you, and he will fight for you.\u201d In response, Biden quipped more than once, \u201cAmy won all the debates.\u201d Earlier, millennial mayor Pete Buttigieg endorsed Biden outside Chicken Scratch, a restaurant in Dallas. The two politicians were photographed together in Texas. Biden reportedly said that Buttigieg reminded him of his son, Beau Biden, who died from brain cancer at age 45. In his speech, still ongoing now, Biden is talking about Trump\u2019s dangerous effect on America, including how children are bullying other children and citing the president\u2019s example. \u201cJust a few days ago, the press and the pundits has declared this campaign dead,\u201d Biden said. Longtime MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews resigned. He had recently compared Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 victory in Nevada to the Nazi invasion of France, then questioned why Elizabeth Warren would suggest Mike Bloomberg was lying about an allegation a female employee made about him. He announced his resignation on air, citing a conversation with NBC, and apologized for the comments he has made about women. Journalist Laura Bassett, who wrote in GQ just days ago about Matthews\u2019 inappropriate behavior towards her and his decades of inappropriate behavior towards other women, wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201d \u201cWe want to win big, and Joe Biden can do that,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar says as she endorses Biden for president. She also criticizes \u201cpeople in the extremes who are trying to drown out people.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s go Joe!\u201d the crowd chants. Sen. Amy Klobuchar is paying tribute to her supporters and her campaign right now as she prepares to formally endorse Joe Biden. Trump wraps rally in North Carolina as Biden gains momentum in Texas President Donald Trump is already heading back to Washington after a rally for supporters in Charlotte, North Carolina, as Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden, energized by a win in South Carolina and endorsements from his previous centrist Democratic competitors, has not even begun to speak at his rally in Dallas, Texas. From Dallas, my colleague Oliver Laughland reports that Biden\u2019s rally is energized and already running an hour and a half late, and that Biden is finally about to speak. \u201cThe Biden campaign has been putting on a show of endorsements from across the state. Over a dozen local politicians; state senators, representatives and congresspeople have come out to address the crowd. We still don\u2019t know for certain if former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke will come out to endorse, or whether Pete Buttigieg, the millennial mayor who ended his campaign yesterday and endorsed Biden in front of a restaurant in Dallas earlier this evening, will make another appearance.\u201d Earlier, Biden and Buttigieg were photographed together in Texas. CBS News reported Biden compared the 38-year-old Buttigieg to his son Beau, the former attorney general of Delaware, who died of brain cancer in 2015, at age 46. Goodbye Hardball Chris, Goodbye Politics as Macho Sport? Some of the journalists and media observers tweeting about Chris Matthews\u2019 departure from Hardball described how much Matthews had represented a particular approach to political journalism that they would also like to see retired. My colleague Oliver Laughland reports that Pete Buttigeg endorsed Joe Biden for president outside Chicken Scratch, a restaurant in Dallas, rather than at the big rally Biden is holding tonight. It\u2019s not immediately clear why that\u2019s the case, though Buttigieg\u2019s senior adviser, Lis Smith, tweeted repeatedly about the difference between the \u201cbig rally\u201d in Dallas and what Buttigieg\u2019s team set up separately. More reactions to Chris Matthews resignation His history of inappropriate behavior towards women goes back decades. But some Washington political journalists are paying tribute to MSNBC host Chris Matthews. Among those praising Matthews tonight is Mother Jones reporter David Corn, who was investigated for inappropriate workplace behavior towards women in 2014, allegations that were revisited again in 2017, Politico reported that year. Matthews \u201csigned off with grace,\u201d Corn wrote. Fellow MSNBC colleagues called him a \u201cgiant\u201d and shared fond memories. I\u2019m in Dallas at a packed rally for Joe Biden. This is a large and diverse crowd that are clearly pumped to see what happens on stage tonight, as other centrists Democrats fall in line behind Biden. It\u2019s a marked contrast from some of Biden\u2019s earlier events, which critics have labelled dry and a little rambling. Before tonight, one of the major contrasts between Sanders and Biden, policy aside, has been their respective abilities to draw large crowds and excite an array of voters. Speaking in Dallas, Buttigieg endorses Biden \u201cWhen I ran for president, we made it clear that the whole idea was about rallying the country together to beat Donald Trump. And to win the era for the values that we share. And that always a goal that was much bigger than me becoming president. And it is in the name of that very same goal that I am delighted to endorse and support Joe Biden for president.\u201d Confusingly, while Buttigieg is endorsing Biden in Dallas, he did not endorse him at the main rally where Biden is speaking tonight. Reactions to Chris Matthews\u2019 Resignation from MSNBC In announcing his own retirement on air tonight, following a conversation with network executives, Chris Matthews cited a generational divide, and changing attitudes about what is appropriate in the workplace. \u201cCompliments on a woman\u2019s appearance some men, including me, might have once incorrectly thought were okay were never okay. Certainly not today. For making such comments in the past, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Matthews said. That framing is false, feminist journalist Jessica Valenti writes: \u201cHis behavior was always wrong.\u201d Tonight\u2019s theme song, as centrist Democrats literally get in formation behind Joe Biden at his Texas rally tonight in Dallas. Out of the presidential race and reportedly lining up behind Biden (and against Bernie Sanders): Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O\u2019Rourke. Beto O\u2019Rourke May Also Endorse Biden in Texas Tonight Joe Biden\u2019s rally here in Dallas is set to get underway shortly. It\u2019s expected that Amy Klobuchar, the senator from Minnesota who dropped out of the race earlier today will appear on stage with the former Vice President to offer her endorsement. There are also reports suggesting that former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg will also appear to endorse Biden. The two were pictured in Texas a short while ago. And just minutes ago, it was reported that former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke and fellow failed presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke is also set to endorse Biden. The New York Times is reporting that O\u2019Rourke may also appear at the event tonight. I just asked a Biden press person here if that\u2019s accurate and the response was: \u201cI have no idea.\u201d These centrist endorsements are coming in thick and fast now, and it appears not even people on the Biden campaign are keeping up. The veteran MSNBC host Chris Matthews announced his immediate retirement from Hardball, citing his inappropriate comments about women and a conversation with network executives. \u201cThe younger generation\u201d is \u201cimproving the workplace\u201d with \u201cbetter standards than we grew up with, fairer standards,\u201d Matthews said. Matthews said \u201ccompliments on a woman\u2019s appearance\u201d that some men, himself included, once \u201cincorrectly thought were OK, were never OK.\u201d Freelance journalist Laura Bassett wrote for GQ on 28 February about Matthews\u2019 inappropriate flirtatious remarks about her when she was on his show, part of what she described as a long history of \u201cinviting smart women onto his show, flirting with them or otherwise making them uncomfortable before or while the camera rolls, asking them a question on air and then immediately interrupting them to tell them why they\u2019re wrong.\u201d Matthews\u2019 on-air comments in the past days have sparked repeated calls for him to be fired. First, he compared Bernie Sanders\u2019 victory in the Nevada caucuses on Saturday to the Nazi invasion of France. Then, in an interview with Senator Elizabeth Warren, he repeatedly questioned why she thought rival presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg would have lied about the employee who claimed he told her to \u201ckill it\u201d when she said she was pregnant. \u201cAnd why would he lie?\u201d Matthews said. \u201cJust to protect himself?\u201d In her GQ piece, Bassett cited Matthews\u2019 interview with Warren as part of a long pattern of sexist and inappropriate behavior, and wrote that he was \u201cunfit for his job\u201d. The decision to keep \u201ca man with this flagrant bias as the anchor of a major cable-news evening show\u201d was \u201cdownright irresponsible,\u201d she wrote. After Matthews announced he was retiring, Bassett tweeted, \u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201d She wrote that she had faced \u201cinvasive, cruel and personal\u201d harassment this week in the wake of making public allegations about Matthews\u2019 behavior towards her. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all worth it if he will never have the platform to demean and objectify us again,\u201d she wrote. My colleague Oliver Laughland is in Dallas, Texas, where Joe Biden is holding a campaign event tonight and will be endorsed by Amy Klobuchar and, reportedly, Pete Buttigieg. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is holding a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina. Mike Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, is pouring almost half a billion dollars of his vast fortune into creating the most expensive nomination bid in US history. A new Guardian video breaks down the four key issues that could derail Bloomberg\u2019s campaign for the White House. You can also watch the video here. Mike Pence: \u2018I travel all the time...Use common sense and wash your hands.\u2019 At an on-camera briefing, the vice-president was asked if he would feel comfortable traveling across the country or to Disney World right now, PBS News Hour\u2019s White House Correspondent reports. \u201cI travel across country all the time,\u201d Pence said. \u201cThis is a time to use common sense and wash your hands.\u201d Alcindor also notes that Pence\u2019s count of coronavirus cases in the United States, 43, is much lower than the count by media outlets like CNN: Bloomberg is pouring money into Facebook ads about coronavirus New: between 27 February and today, Mike Bloomberg\u2019s presidential campaign spent more than $885,000 on ads about coronavirus, like the one below. None of the other presidential candidates appear to be mentioning coronavirus in their Facebook campaign ads. This data comes from my analysis of Facebook\u2019s political ad archive application programming interface, or API, which the company introduced in 2018, as one of the reforms the company introduced in the wake of revelations about how Russia used Facebook\u2019s platform to interfere in the US election. More background on how Bloomberg is spending tens of millions of dollars on close to 2bn impressions of targeted Facebook ads, and on how experts on disinformation have criticized his campaign\u2019s misleading ads. Trump unenthusiastic about giving federal funds to \u2018rich\u2019 drug companies to expedite coronavirus vaccine Trump met with pharmaceutical executives today for a briefing on efforts to develop a vaccine for coronavirus, and what the federal government could do to assist the process. Asked whether the president would considering steering additional federal funds to any of the companies present to speed up research and development of a vaccine, the president \u201cseemed cool to the idea\u201d, the White House pool reporter noted. \u201cSome of them are so rich,\u201d Trump joked about the drug companies present, \u201cthey can actually loan money to the federal government.\u201d Trump did indicate his administration would work to streamline the federal drug process to get treatments to market. Trump and Mike Pence, the vice-president, both praised the drug companies with executives present at the meeting for for pledging to share information and otherwise collaborate to more quickly development effective coronavirus treatments. \u201cYou\u2019re competitors but in this case it\u2019s different,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI love the complementary, if you can do that.\u201d The consensus update from the White House meeting was that a coronavirus vaccine would take at least a year to a year and a half to develop, according to Dr Anthony Fauci, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director. But therapeutic human trials could begin this spring, as early as April. Trump hints at further travel restrictions from \u2018certain countries\u2019 At a White House meeting today with executives from major pharmaceutical companies, Trump hinted that his administration is eyeing new travel restrictions to try to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. \u201cYes, we are,\u201d the president in response to a press question, \u201cfrom certain countries where they\u2019re having more of a breakout.\u201d He declined up name the specific countries, according to the White House pool reporter. Donald Trump supporters awaiting his campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, expressed confidence in the president\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and accused Democrats of playing political games. \u201cNobody knows what to expect but he\u2019s got a lot of people around him that know how to handle this,\u201d said Suzette Gerhardt, wearing a pink \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d cap and T-shirt. \u201cHe\u2019s listening to their advice and I believe he\u2019s doing all he can. People are criticising but it\u2019s not like they would do anything different.\u201d Gerhardt, 57, a real estate agent, added: \u201cI think the Democrats talk out of both sides of their mouths. They\u2019re exploiting it to their benefit. They haven\u2019t given him any credit on the economy, the jobs he\u2019s created or anything good he\u2019s done.\u201d Critics have suggested that the virus has brutally exposed Trump\u2019s incompetence and could ultimately cost him the election. But David Walters, 65, an electrical contractor, insisted: \u201cHe\u2019s doing as much as he can. He made some good initial decisions to not let certain people into the country. \u201cThe health secretary did a good job of explaining that this is like flu and you need to take precautions but not panic. At this point it is serious but I think they\u2019re doing a good job. I don\u2019t know what else they could do.\u201d A 51-year-old woman, who gave her name only as Rebecca J, backed the president\u2019s allegations of a hoax. \u201cI thought that was all fake news,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was saying it\u2019s not as bad as people make out. It\u2019s scary, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I\u2019m good.\u201d A 43-year-old man, who gave his name only as Scott S, rejoined: \u201cWe pray God is strong and we trust the Lord.\u201d Lois Beckett here, taking over our politics live blog on the day before Super Tuesday. In a joint statement, the heads of the justice department, the state department, the defense department, the Department of Homeland Security and other major national security agencies are warning voters to be on the lookout for disinformation and propaganda from foreign actors as they head to the polls. From the statement: \u201cForeign actors continue to try to influence public sentiment and shape voter perceptions. They spread false information and propaganda about political processes and candidates on social media in hopes to cause confusion and create doubt in our system. We remain alert and ready to respond to any efforts to disrupt the 2020 elections. We continue to make it clear to foreign actors that any effort to undermine our democratic processes will be met with sharp consequences....A well-informed and vigilant republic is the best defense against disinformation.\u201d That\u2019s it from me today. I\u2019m handing the blog over to my west coast colleague, Lois Beckett, for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Amy Klobuchar is dropping out of the Democratic presidential primary, further narrowing the field as Joe Biden attempts to consolidate the support of moderate Democrats. Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg reportedly plan to endorse Biden at his Dallas rally tonight, presenting a message of unity to voters before tomorrow\u2019s crucial Super Tuesday contests. Biden saw a wave of endorsements from prominent Democrats \u2013 including the former Senate majority leader Harry Reid, the former national security adviser Susan Rice and a number of Democratic lawmakers in Super Tuesday states. Senate Republicans are seeking to continue their investigation of Joe Biden and his family, as the former vice-president sees his primary prospects brighten. The US markets surged after last week\u2019s steep losses due to coronavirus fears, even as Washington state reported six total deaths from the disease so far. The supreme court will hear an Obamacare case in its next term, which starts in October, meaning a decision won\u2019t come until after the presidential election. Lois will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The US markets have seen a rally, despite the news that Washington state has now seen six total deaths from coronvirus. The Guardian\u2019s Graeme Wearden reports: The Dow Jones industrial average has leapt by 1,293 points, its biggest-ever points gain. That\u2019s quite a turnaround, after posting its biggest points loss on Thursday. In percentage terms, that\u2019s a 5.1% gain -- a very strong day (not a record though!). It brings some relief to investors after last week\u2019s 12.4% slump. ... Clearly traders are hoping for progress towards coordinated action tomorrow when central bankers and finance chiefs meet. Follow the Guardian\u2019s business live blog for more updates: Now that Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar have dropped out of the presidential primary, what happens to the pledged delegates they have already won? The answer to that question is a bit complicated and will matter far more if no candidate can win a majority of pledged delegates before Democrats hold their nominating convention in July. Buttigieg won 26 pledged delegates from the four early voting states, while Klobuchar won 7. The two candidates\u2019 delegates will still go to the July convention, but Buttigieg and Klobuchar would have the option to \u201crelease\u201d their delegates, allowing them to back another candidate. If they did release their delegates, those delegates would likely support Joe Biden, the candidate who Buttigieg and Klobuchar are reportedly endorsing, because the Democratic National Committee\u2019s delegate selection rules say that pledged delegates \u201cshall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\u201d Again, all of this becomes much more important if there is a contested convention, where no candidate has won a majority of pledged delegates. Then again, FiveThirtyEight currently puts the chances of a contested convention at about 2 in 3, so it could end up mattering greatly. Here\u2019s another important thing to keep in mind as we head into Super Tuesday: hundreds of thousands of people have already voted early. That could stunt the potential success of Joe Biden, who is riding a wave of momentum from his landslide victory in South Carolina and a number of endorsements from prominent Democrats. Some states, like Michigan, give voters the chance to \u201cspoil\u201d their ballots in order to obtain a new one, but Texas and California, the two biggest prizes on Super Tuesday, do not allow that. So candidates who have dropped out in the past couple days, such as Pete Buttigieg, will likely still receive thousands of votes tomorrow that could have gone elsewhere. Susan Rice, former national security adviser under Barack Obama, has also endorsed Joe Biden. Biden has picked up a number of endorsements from prominent Democrats today, most notably his former primary opponents Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. The endorsements are a clear effort by moderate and establishment Democrats to consolidate their support around Biden, as frontrunner Bernie Sanders looks to secure an insurmountable delegate lead on Super Tuesday tomorrow. Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden stand to benefit the most from Amy Klobuchar\u2019s withdrawal, according to a CBS News poll taken in January. Of course, the race has shifted considerably since the January poll was taken, so the results should be taken with a grain of salt. Regardless, those numbers will likely cause some jitters among Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters heading into Super Tuesday tomorrow. Joe Biden attacked Bernie Sanders as a threat to down-ballot Democrats in a CBS News interview set to air later today. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be enough just to beat Donald Trump. We have to win back the Senate, we have to keep the House,\u201d Biden said. The former vice president noted some vulnerable Democrats have expressed concerns that a Sanders nomination would jeopardize their own campaigns. \u201cWhether they\u2019re right or not, those people who are running for those offices think that Bernie was not likely to help them, but hurt them in their pursuit of their Senate or their House seat or their governor\u2019s seat,\u201d Biden said. Echoing his South Carolina victory speech, Biden argued voters were looking for \u201cresults\u201d rather than the \u201crevolution\u201d promised by Sanders. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a real choice that the Democrats are going to have to make between a revolution and results,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI admire Bernie, but I think that what he\u2019s proposing is he keeps going for this revolution. I think people are looking for results.\u201d Pete Buttigieg reportedly intends to endorse Joe Biden at his Dallas rally tonight, appearing alongside former opponent Amy Klobuchar. A charter flight scheduled to travel from Buttigieg\u2019s hometown of South Bend, Indiana, to Dallas had already raised eyebrows, and a source confirmed the former mayor\u2019s plans to CNN. The visual of Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar sharing a stage is clearly meant to send a message to moderates: it\u2019s time to consolidate before Super Tuesday. Joe Biden\u2019s landslide victory in South Carolina appears to have come at the exact right moment to boost his campaign as frontrunner Bernie Sanders seemed poised to secure a significant delegate lead on Super Tuesday. Biden defeated Sanders by more than 28 points on Saturday, and that performance helped quiet concerns about whether the former vice president was capable of defeating Trump. With only three days between the South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday, Biden can benefit from the momentum of his win while avoiding the closer scrutiny that may have come with a longer lag time between contests. The country will see tomorrow whether Biden can mitigate Sanders\u2019 delegate gains, but the trajectory of this primary certainly looks very different than it did four days ago. Pete Buttigieg may be joining Amy Klobuchar at Joe Biden\u2019s Dallas rally tonight, if charter plane schedules are any indication. Buttigieg and Klobuchar repeatedly sparred on the debate stage, but the pair now appear ready to come together to promote Biden as he tries to consolidate the support of moderate voters. Mike Bloomberg said he spoke to Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar after they dropped out, and the former New York mayor oddly noted that his former opponents had \u201cbehaved themselves.\u201d Even though Bloomberg said he entered the race to stop Bernie Sanders from getting the nomination, he showed no sign of dropping out to help Joe Biden further consolidate the moderate vote. \u201cI felt sorry for them, but I\u2019m in it to win it,\u201d Bloomberg said. It\u2019s a good day to be Joe Biden. The former vice president is picking up endorsements from a number of prominent Democrats today -- including former Senate majority leader Harry Reid. \u201cPresident Donald Trump has done unspeakable damage to our country, our institutions and the rule of law. Democrats need a candidate who can assemble the largest, most diverse coalition possible to defeat Trump and lead our country following the trauma of Trump\u2019s presidency,\u201d Reid said in a statement. \u201cThat candidate is Joe Biden.\u201d Reid participated in the Nevada caucuses last month, but the former Senate leader said he voted \u201cuncommitted\u201d for all three of his preferences in order to avoid putting his thumb on the scale for any candidate. However, Reid\u2019s endorsement of Biden is unsurprising considering the narrowing field. The pair worked together in the Senate for decades, and Reid has expressed doubts about Bernie Sanders\u2019 signature campaign promise, Medicare for all. The exits of Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg are undeniably good news for Joe Biden, who is trying to consolidate the support of moderate voters in the Democratic primary. But there are a few important caveats to keep in mind about Biden benefitting from Klobuchar and Buttigieg withdrawing. First, the polling is unclear about whether Biden is actually the top second choice for Klobuchar and Buttigieg supporters. Some polls indicate Bernie Sanders is popular among Buttigieg voters, for example, and the candidates\u2019 endorsements of Biden may not sway many of their supporters. Another thing to keep in mind is that Mike Bloomberg will be on the ballot tomorrow and could pick off some of the moderate voters who would otherwise be inclined to support Biden. Finally, Elizabeth Warren remains in the race, and the Massachusetts senator\u2019s campaign has expressed confidence that she will benefit from a narrowed race. All of those elements will be put to the test tomorrow, when 14 states head to the polls for Super Tuesday. Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg are really competing with each other right until the bitter end of their campaigns. Moments after news broke that Klobuchar would withdraw from the race and endorse Joe Biden, Buttigieg\u2019s campaign said he would also be endorsing the former vice president. Buttigieg reportedly spoke to Biden and former preisdent Barack Obama last night, after announcing he would suspend his campaign. The former Indiana mayor had been leaning toward endorsing Biden, and the announcement will provide Biden with another boost heading into tomorrow\u2019s crucial Super Tuesday contests. The timing of Amy Klobuchar\u2019s withdrawal also appears designed to get one last jab in at Pete Buttigieg, who dropped out last night. Klobuchar and Buttigieg presented similar arguments for why they were the best candidate to represent Democrats, claiming their Midwestern backgrounds were best suited to defeating Trump. But Klobuchar repeatedly criticized Buttigieg during Democratic debates, arguing the 38-year-old mayor was not experienced enough to become president. By dropping out a day after Buttigieg\u2019s withdrawal, Klobuchar has secured her own news cycle dedicated to her exit. Her expected endorsement of Joe Biden tonight also distinguishes her from Buttigieg, who is reportedly leaning toward backing Biden but has not done so yet. Political reporters weigh in: Amy Klobuchar\u2019s exit increases the likelihood of a two-person race for the nomination between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. Klobuchar\u2019s withdrawal also increases the stakes for Elizabeth Warren going into Super Tuesday tomorrow: Considering Klobuchar\u2019s strong performance in New Hampshire, her exit also raises even more questions about the value in two mostly white states voting first: Amy Klobuchar has reportedly informed her campaign staff she is dropping out of of the Democratic presidential primary. Klobuchar\u2019s departure leaves five candidates in the race: Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Mike Bloomberg and Tulsi Gabbard. Combined with Pete Buttigieg\u2019s exit last night, the moderate candidates appear to be looking to consolidate support around Biden before tomorrow\u2019s crucial Super Tuesday contests. Amy Klobuchar has reportedly decided to suspend her presidential campaign and endorse Joe Biden. The Minnesota senator exceeded expectations in New Hampshire, where she finished in third place, but her sixth-place performances in Nevada and South Carolina raised serious questions about her path to the nomination. A new post-South Carolina poll shows Joe Biden pulling nearly even with Bernie Sanders. According to the Morning Consult poll, Biden has climbed up to 26%, while Sanders has dropped slightly to 29%. Those numbers represent a 7-point bump for Biden and a 3-point slump for Sanders. Mike Bloomberg is holding steady in third place at 17%, but the poll is already slightly out-of-date because it includes Pete Buttigieg, who dropped out last night. The poll indicates Biden may be getting a national bump from his landslide victory in South Carolina, but the true test of his support will come tomorrow on Super Tuesday. Here\u2019s where the day stands as of now: The Supreme Court said it would take up a case challenging Obamacare in its next term, which begins in October, so a decision is not expected until after the presidential election. Pete Buttigieg is reportedly leaning toward endorsing Joe Biden after the former Indiana mayor dropped out of the presidential primary last night. Senate Republicans want to continue an investigation into the business activities of Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, as the former vice president sees his primary prospects brighten after a landslide victory in South Carolina. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Mike Bloomberg used his speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee to bash Bernie Sanders, who has refused to attend AIPAC\u2019s annual gathering. \u201cUnfortunately, not all of my fellow Democrats in this race have attended an AIPAC conference,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cOne of them, Senator Sanders, has spent 30 years boycotting this event. And as you\u2019ve heard by now, he called AIPAC a racist platform. Well let me tell you, he\u2019s dead wrong.\u201d Bloomberg touched on his own experiences as a Jewish American to warn about the dangers of anti-Semitism. \u201cAnti-Semitism is hardly the exclusive domain of any one group. It can be found on both the right and the left, on town squares and campus quads,\u201d Bloomberg said. The former New York mayor then offered implicit criticism of Trump without mentioning the president\u2019s name. \u201cBut there is one fact that we cannot ignore: Presidential leadership matters,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cIt sets a tone. It is either inclusive or exclusive, divisive or uniting, incendiary or calming.\u201d Bloomberg is the only Democratic presidential candidate attending AIPAC. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have said they won\u2019t participate, and Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar appeared by video. Texas congresswoman Veronica Escobar has endorsed Joe Biden, the latest in a stream of lawmakers from Super Tuesday states to announce support for the former vice president. Those endorsements could help Biden turn out voters in crucial states tomorrow, and they could be key to a victory if the nominating contest extends to the convention, as a Texas Tribune reporter noted: The progressive group Democracy for America has endorsed Bernie Sanders\u2019 White House bid after holding a vote among its members. Sanders won nearly 80% of the DFA membership vote, compared to 13% for second-place Elizabeth Warren. No other candidate received more than 3%. The endorsement is a bit of a slap in the face for Warren, considering the group encouraged her to launch a presidential campaign in 2016. \u201cBernie Sanders has built a powerful multi-racial, multi-generational movement and we\u2019re excited to join the campaign at this critical moment in the Democratic race,\u201d DFA chair Charles Chamberlain said in a statement. \u201cThe overwhelming support for Bernie we saw in our member vote should be a wake-up call to the broken, visionless, corporate Democratic establishment.\u201d Senate Republicans appear to be resuming efforts to investigate Joe Biden and his family, as the former vice president\u2019s primary prospects rise after his South Carolina victory. Trump\u2019s impeachment focused on whether the president and his allies pressured Ukraine to announce an investigation into Biden and his son, Hunter. The issue appeared to be abandoned in recent weeks, as Bernie Sanders simultaneously became the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. But Trump\u2019s Senate allies now seem to be resurrecting the issue as moderate Democrats look to consolidate support around Biden. Pete Buttigieg spoke to Joe Biden and Barack Obama yesterday after dropping out of the race, according to the New York Times. The Times reports: Mr. Biden asked for Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s support and the former mayor indicated he would consider the request. Mr. Buttigieg wants to sleep on the decision, he told aides, some of whom believe he should move quickly to endorse Mr. Biden. Mr. Obama did not specifically encourage Mr. Buttigieg to endorse Mr. Biden, said the official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations. But Mr. Obama did note that Mr. Buttigieg has considerable leverage at the moment and should think about how best to use it. If Buttigieg does endorse Biden today, it could give the former vice president another boost before tomorrow\u2019s crucial Super Tuesday contests. As expected, Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth has endorsed Joe Biden ahead of her state\u2019s March 17 primary. \u201cAs a combat Veteran and former Assistant VA Secretary, I know that Joe Biden won\u2019t just pay lip service to those sacrifices, he\u2019ll make sure our troops and Veterans receive the support, care and respect they\u2019ve earned,\u201d Duckworth said in a statement released by Biden\u2019s campaign. Biden has received a flood of endorsements since his landslide victory in South Carolina, as a number of Democratic lawmakers apparently try to consolidate support against Bernie Sanders. Trump defended the safety of holding campaign rallies with the coronavirus spreading, as the president prepares for another rally in the Super Tuesday state of North Carolina tonight. \u201cWell this was set up a long time ago, and others are,\u201d Trump said when asked about his rally tonight. \u201cYou could ask that to the Democrats. ... They\u2019re all having rallies, that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re campaigning. ... I think it\u2019s very safe.\u201d Elizabeth Warren has released a plan to combat coronavirus, which includes a $400 billion fiscal stimulus package to avoid an economic downturn tied to the health threat. Warren would also create an \u201cemergency paid leave program\u201d to easily allow anyone showing symptoms to get time off work and ensure Americans have free evaluation and care for coronavirus. \u201cCoronavirus is a public health emergency and a serious threat to the American economy,\u201d Warren wrote on her website. \u201cWhile it\u2019s important that our leaders communicate calmly and clearly about the situation to avoid unnecessary panic, it\u2019s just as important that we take decisive action to keep American families healthy and stabilize our economy as the virus spreads.\u201d And here\u2019s another endorsement for Joe Biden: freshman Democratic congressman Gil Cisneros of California has announced his support for the former vice president. \u201cFrom New Castle County Council to the United States Senate to the right-hand man of President Obama, Vice President Biden has proven time and time again that he has the experience and temperament to unite our country,\u201d Cisneros said in a statement released by the Biden campaign. Biden has picked up a number of endorsements from lawmakers in Super Tuesday states since his landslide victory in South Carolina, indicating the more moderate members of the party are trying to consolidate support around him. For vulnerable incumbents like Cisneros, a Biden endorsement has the added benefit of putting some distance between them and Bernie Sanders, who may be seen as too progressive in their swing districts. Trump said he will discuss a possible coronavirus vaccine with pharmaceutical executives today. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a vaccine, maybe even a cure,\u201d the president told reporters after the White House press pool was unexpectedly called in to the Oval Office. The president\u2019s meeting with pharmaceutical executives was previously supposed to focus on drug prices. Joe Biden is picking up key endorsements in March voting states, as the former vice president becomes the leading moderate candidate in the presidential primary. Biden has already secured endorsements from a number of lawmakers in Super Tuesday states like Virginia and North Carolina. Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, which has 155 pledged delegates up for grabs and will vote on March 17, will now also reportedly endorse Biden. Pete Buttigieg is likely to endorse Joe Biden\u2019s presidential bid after dropping out of the race, according to CNN. Reports emerged last night that the pair had exchanged voicemails as Buttigieg announced he would withdraw from the Democratic primary. It now appears the former Indiana mayor is leaning toward backing Biden, but it\u2019s unclear whether he will do so before tomorrow\u2019s crucial Super Tuesday contests. Polling is also muddled on whether Buttigieg\u2019s supporters are inclined to back Biden. Some surveys indicate Bernie Sanders is the second choice of most Buttigieg supporters, while other polls say those voters prefer candidates like Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. This will actually mark the third time the Supreme Court has decided the fate of Obamacare. The justices have twice upheld the healthcare law, in 2012 and 2015. Chief justice John Roberts, who was appointed by former Republican president George W Bush, memorably sided with his more liberal colleagues to keep the law in place in 2012, when Barack Obama was seeking reelection. Roberts and those four liberal justices remain on the court today, which could be a good sign for the law\u2019s future. The news of the Supreme Court taking up an Obamacare case is another reminder of how far apart the presidential candidates remain on the issue of healthcare. Bernie Sanders has said he wants to create a government-run, single-payer healthcare system, which would eliminate the need for Obamacare. But Joe Biden has said he wants to build on the former president\u2019s signature healthcare law by adding a public option to the policy. Biden took a swipe at Sanders for his stance on Obamacare while delivering his victory speech in South Carolina on Saturday. \u201cDemocrats want to nominate someone who will build on Obamacare, not scrap it,\u201d Biden told the crowd. And of course, Trump would like to repeal Obamacare altogether and replace it with something better -- but the president has provided no details on what that \u201csomething better\u201d would look like. The Supreme Court has announced it will hear a case on whether a part of Obamacare is unconstiutional. The justices said they would take up the case in their next term, which begins in October, so a decision is not expected until after the 2020 election. The healthcare law will remain in effect until then, so its future will become even more of a top concern in this year\u2019s presidential election. The announcement comes after a federal appeals court ruled in December that Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate, which requires every American to have health insurance, was unconstitutional, casting doubt upon the rest of the law. Nineteen Democratic states appealed the decision, which will now be reviewed by the Supreme Court. This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Belam. Pete Buttigieg\u2019s fourth-place finish in South Carolina on Saturday sealed his decision to withdraw from the presidential primary, as it became clear the young former mayor\u2019s struggle to appeal to voters of color would plague his candidacy on Super Tuesday. The AP reports: Less than two hours after holding what would be his final rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, Buttigieg was hunkered on the phone in a hotel near Americus, Georgia, working out the details of ending his campaign, people familiar with the conversation said. ... Having laid out a narrow but viable path to the nomination through an uncertain state-by-state fight, advisers painted a picture of a difficult road ahead. After someone interjected that Buttigieg should speak, the candidate, known for an understated deliberative style, noted effectively that if the conversation had reached that point the decision was pretty clear. Though there were details to work out about how to handle his appearances on Sunday news programs, the conversation quickly turned to the logistics of pulling down his Texas campaign events scheduled for Sunday and how to arrange for the speech in South Bend. I\u2019m just about to hand over to Joan Greve in Washington. In the meantime, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference is on today, and there\u2019s a live stream on their website. There will be speeches in the next couple of hours from vice president Mike Pence, Democratic Presidential Candidate Mike Bloomberg and Senator Cory Booker. You can watch it here. One quirk of Pete Buttigieg dropping out of the race to be the Democratic nomination at the weekend is that now Joe Biden, incredibly, is the youngest man seeking to be the Democrats\u2019 next nominee. At 77, he is younger than both Mike Bloomberg and Bernie Sanders, who are both 78. All of which makes Donald Trump\u2019s 73 years look positively sprightly. Of the remaining women, Elizabeth Warren is 70, Amy Klobuchar is 59, and Tulsi Gabbard is a very youthful 38. This looks like a chewy read to keep you busy for a bit over a coffee. Atlantic magazine have just published their cover story for April online. By George Packer, he is arguing that \u201cThe president is winning his war on American institutions\u201d. The [political class] were too sophisticated to see Trump\u2019s special political talents\u2014his instinct for every adversary\u2019s weakness, his fanatical devotion to himself, his knack for imposing his will, his sheer staying power\u2026They didn\u2019t grasp the readiness of large numbers of Americans to accept, even relish, Trump\u2019s contempt for democratic norms and basic decency. It took the arrival of such a leader to reveal how many things that had always seemed engraved in monumental stone turned out to depend on those flimsy norms, and how much the norms depended on public opinion. Their vanishing exposed the real power of the presidency. Read it here - The Atlantic: The president is winning his war on American institutions It is difficult to over-estimate the importance of Super Tuesday tomorrow. 14 states across the country \u2013 Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia \u2013 as well as one US territory (American Samoa) and Democrats abroad will cast their votes on the same day. Between them, more than a third of available delegates are up for grabs. Here\u2019s a refresher on what to expect on the night: What is Super Tuesday? Among those states, it is California which could carry the most weight. It is the first time that the state\u2019s primary has been part of the Super Tuesday line-up, and California will send a total of 495 delegates to the Democratic national convention. Here\u2019s a guide specifically for how the day will unfold on the west coast. Reuters have just published a few more details of the meeting that Donald Trump is expected to have today with drug company executives. The White House has not said which pharmaceutical makers would be at today\u2019s meeting with the president and his White House coronavirus task force. However it is now known that executives from Sanofi SA, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer Inc will attend, according to representatives for the companies. Trump, in an early morning tweet, said they would discuss \u201cprogress on a vaccine and cure.\u201d Top US health officials have said any vaccine is at least a year from hitting the market, and there is no treatment, although patients can receive supportive care. The number of coronavirus cases has ticked up in recent days, with more than 75 confirmed cases in the US, including two deaths. Both deaths occurred in Washington state where a cluster of cases is centered on a nursing home near Seattle. New York and Florida, among other U.S. states, have also confirmed cases. Some slightly unconventional reports coming out of the Trump campaign today that they are planning to fly a blimp over swing states during the summer. The blimp with Trump logos is apparently set to fly between May and July, and will encourage Trump supporters to text the campaign in a move aimed at helping to refine the campaign\u2019s data on voters in key states. There\u2019s no indication yet of what the blimp might look like - although it is unlikely to be adopting the design of the controversial Trump baby blimp that has flown over London in recent years when the president has been visiting the UK. Mike Bloomberg and president Trump are having a little tit-for-tat over on Twitter. One of Trump\u2019s early morning flurry of tweets today mentioned Bloomberg, criticising his \u201cbad debate performances\u201d and his handling of a crises when he was New York\u2019s mayor. Bloomberg has just taken a swipe back, linking to a piece from the Washington Post and describing it as a \u201cVery sad Washington Post story with your own aides trashing you and making fun of you behind your back.\u201d The piece, from a couple of days ago, was a widely shared story headlined \u201cInside Trump\u2019s frantic attempts to minimize the coronavirus crisis\u201d My colleague Julia Carrie Wong in San Francisco has an interesting dive into where employees of Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, Uber, Tesla and SpaceX, Oracle and Microsoft are donating their dollars during this election campaign. It is not perhaps a huge surprise that a workforce that skews towards youth is also, like the demographics of the race to the White House as a whole, skewing towards Bernie Sanders. California votes tomorrow, and with 415 pledged delegates on offer, it is the biggest prize for Democrats on Super Tuesday. You can have a look at the figures - and how little cash Donald Trump is raising from these people - here: As time goes on and we get closer to Super Tuesday, some people have begun to question why former president Barack Obama is yet to endorse the man who was his VP for eight years - Joe Biden. Jeff Zeleny has been looking at this, and an Obama confidant told CNN: \u201c[Obama] feels that he\u2019s singularly positioned to help unify the party at the end of this. And if he were try to put his thumb on the scale now, it would take away his ability to do so when it\u2019s most needed -- the general election.\u201d It also seems like the Obama team are concerned that an early endorsement might \u201cbackfire\u201d. You can read the full piece here - CNN: Obama tells Biden he won\u2019t endorse anybody yet Trump is up and tweeting, and confirming that he will be meeting \u201cmajor pharmaceutical companies today at the White House\u201d with regard to the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed two people in the US. The global death toll from the coronavirus outbreak exceeded 3,000 on Monday. Covid-19 has now infected more than 88,000 people and spread to more than 60 countries. Bill Kristol has come out strongly for Joe Biden this morning in The Bulwark, urging readers not to \u201coverthink your Super Tuesday vote\u201d. Though the situation is complex, the answer actually is simple. Whatever the substantive case for either Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren, and despite the flashes of electoral strength each has shown, neither is going to be the nominee. And despite what once seemed a possible, though unconventional, path to the nomination, it\u2019s not going to be Mike Bloomberg either. So it\u2019s Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden. Which means, if you\u2019re inclined toward American constitutional democracy, the rule of law, and a free economic order\u2013as well as a liberal world order anchored by the United States\u2013it\u2019s Joe Biden. It feels like one of those endorsements that might end up energising the Sanders\u2019 support base as much as it manages to shift any floating voters in Biden\u2019s direction. You can read it here - The Bulwark: The Simple Answer Senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice Theodore R Johnson has written for us, urging people not to assume that the whole of black America has spoken in South Carolina with the overwhelming victory that Joe Biden enjoyed in the state. Unlike in previous presidential primaries, black voters nationally are unlikely to coalesce behind a single candidate this early. And given the range of ideological positions among the Democratic field of candidates \u2013 from Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren further to the left and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg filling the centrist lane \u2013 the political diversity within the black electorate will find expression in ways often muted in years with presumptive nominees. You can read his piece here: \u201cYou\u2019ve probably seen more ads for Michael Bloomberg than the rest of us running for president put together\u201d says Elizabeth Warren in one of her new campaign ads. CBS News have an interesting piece here on just where the Democrats ad-spend is going before Super Tuesday. It is no surprise who is spending the most. Leading up to Super Tuesday, Bloomberg has spent more than $170 million on ads in the fourteen states holding contests\u2026Apart from Bloomberg, only Sanders is airing TV and radio ads in nearly all Super Tuesday states, a move that can be chalked up to his success in record-breaking grassroots fundraising. Buttigieg was also advertising heavily before he pulled the plug on his campaign at the weekend. Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden have been more likely to rely on Super PAC money. Warren\u2019s campaign has spent less than $2 million on ads, but the Persist PAC supporting her has splashed out $12m. Read the full analysis here - CBS News: Where are candidates spending on the airwaves before Super Tuesday? Away from the Democratic race for a moment, yesterday a federal judge ruled that Ken Cuccinelli was unlawfully appointed to lead the US Citizenship and Immigration Services agency and, as a result, lacked authority to give asylum seekers less time to prepare for initial screening interviews. Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general and an immigration hardliner, was named to a new position of \u201cprincipal deputy director\u201d in June, which immediately made him acting director because Lee Francis Cissna had just resigned. The agency grants green cards and other visas and also oversees asylum officers. US District Judge Randolph Moss in Washington found Cuccinelli\u2019s appointment violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, a 1998 law governing who is eligible to lead federal agencies in an acting capacity. The impact of the ruling wasn\u2019t immediately clear. Donald Trump has favoured temporary appointments. At Homeland Security, Chad Wolf is acting secretary, and the heads of Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services are also in acting roles. Homeland Security Department spokesperson Heather Swift said, \u201cWe obviously disagree with the court\u2019s opinion and are looking more closely at it.\u201d Cuccinelli is now acting deputy Homeland Security secretary, the department\u2019s No. 2 position. Joseph Edlow, a longtime congressional aide who joined Citizenship and Immigration Services in July, was named last month to run the agency\u2019s day-to-day operations. There will a lot of post-mortems of the Buttigieg campaign published today - here\u2019s a fine one from Elena Schneider in Politico: Buttigieg\u2019s rank-and-file supporters defied easy ideological grouping \u2014 he battled fiercely with progressive Elizabeth Warren and moderate Amy Klobuchar for voters in recent months, in addition to lobbing calls for \u201cgenerational change\u201d at Biden and Sanders. The coalition he built did not exist 14 months ago\u2026He was just two years clear of the constitutional age limit to become president. But Buttigieg burst out of obscurity on the strength of his charisma and sharp, viral answers to media questions in the opening months of the campaign. Read it here - Politico: Inside the sudden end of Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign And here\u2019s a reminder of how his campaign ended: Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaigning on Sunday also produced protest images at the historic Brown Chapel in Selma, Alabama that he probably would have rather avoided. Bloomberg\u2019s campaign has been dogged by his history of controversial statements on race, and his record on stop-and-frisk policing while he was mayor of New York. Inviting him to appear at an event commemorating one of the civil rights movement\u2019s most emotional milestones was always likely to be controversial. Sam Levine and Ankita Rao\u2019s report from the church includes quotes from those who decided to protest Bloomberg\u2019s appearance: It isn\u2019t just his record on race that risks derailing the Bloomberg bid to be a billionaire president - his troubling record with women could also pose a huge problem for him. For years he has battled claims that he\u2019s called women \u201cfat broads\u201d and \u201chorse-faced lesbians,\u201d allegedly announcing within an employee\u2019s earshot that he would like to \u201cdo that piece of meat\u201d, according to court records and other documents. (Bloomberg has denied ever saying the word \u201cmeat\u201d). An aide recalled that Bloomberg often remarked \u201cnice tits\u201d upon seeing attractive women. Lucia Graves has the latest in our series on the billionaire candidate: More than one of the Democratic challengers had difficult campaigning days on Sunday. Minnesota\u2019s Amy Klobuchar ended up cancelling a rally in her home state after protesters took over the stage over the case of a black teen sentenced to life in prison while Klobuchar was the county\u2019s top prosecutor. Klobuchar was scheduled to speak at St. Louis Park High School in suburban Minneapolis. But dozens of protesters entered the gymnasium, raised signs and chanted \u201cblack lives matter\u201d and \u201cMyon,\u201d a reference to Myon Burrell, who was convicted of the murder of 11-year-old Tyesha Edwards. Burrell was sent to prison for life following a police investigation some say was flawed. Klobuchar has said if there is new information in the case then it should be considered - a response that some activists have said doesn\u2019t go far enough. Klobuchar has struggled to win support from black voters, a major problem for her campaign, but she has rejected suggestions she drop out of the race, saying she plans to compete at least through the upcoming Super Tuesday contests. Well then, good morning. It\u2019s an absolutely crucial day of campaigning ahead of Super Tuesday - but it is a campaign that has changed shape dramatically after the events of the weekend. Firstly Joe Biden\u2019s margin of victory in South Carolina re-energised his bid for the nomination - and also showed that Bernie Sanders had failed to gain ground in a state where he was crushed by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary. Tom Steyer may have been expected to drop out after a disappointing showing on Saturday \u2013 and he did \u2013 but it was former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s withdrawal last night that radically alters the situation. Following his narrow win in Iowa, Buttigieg had already amassed more pledged delegates than Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Mike Bloomberg and Tulsi Gabbard combined - yet still couldn\u2019t see a way through to winning the nomination. It remains to be seen who Mayor Pete will endorse now - and whether we\u2019ve seen the last of him for this election cycle. Could he end up being someone\u2019s pick for VP? Today Sanders will be in Utah and Minnesota, Biden is due in Texas, and Warren will be campaigning in California. Here\u2019s our guide to Super Tuesday if you want a refresher on what is at stake. Away from the Democratic race, there\u2019s plenty going on in government. Donald Trump is meeting the Colombian president, having lunch with vice-president Mike Pence, and then meeting members of the Coronavirus Task Force. The US has confirmed approximately 60 cases of the severe respiratory illness with two deaths. The president will later be at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina. Mike Pence will be putting in an appearance at AIPAC, as will Mike Bloomberg and Joe Biden.",

Is it when you read that demand for coal will be in freefall within a decade or is it when you read that more and more people are demanding action from governments? What makes you feel optimistic?</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Donna Green</strong>:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have a (possibly unrealistic) ability to entertain the notion that people can be simultaneously incredibly smart and incredibly stupid. In the main, I suspect I am optimistic because I choose to be. I want to believe that over the long game, smart might win out over stupid.</p> <p>An example of this could be seen in Australia where the markets have succeeded despite, not because of, our federal policy. We have witnessed a surge of solar and wind energy installation as a result. </p> <p>Of course, that leads on to question global politics and economic systems.

Given the timing and nature of this kind of research, it is very early days to see any research analysis or findings from this \u2018summer of hell\u2019 season just passed. </p> <p>Frustratingly the research timeline for academic researchers does not generally allow for quick responses. Giving a quick example, generally you have to wait for an annual timeline to submit a proposal and then wait about a year to find out whether your proposal (with a success rate of about 10%) has been funded. If it is funded, usually the research budget will get cut about 10-30%. This means research analysis response times can be frustratingly slow.</p> <p>There have been some \u2018targeted research calls\u2019 that have a very tight turnaround. Last month the federal government announced $5m for research projects to respond to the bushfire crisis. This is a good start, however coming off the back of years of cuts to scientific research budgets there is a lot of ground to make up.</p> <p>We just don\u2019t really know the long-term effects of the exposure that many Australians felt over the last summer. Populations respond differently, for example. We can\u2019t easily extrapolate from studies in, for example, heavily polluted cities in China or India, because Australians in the main are not exposed to high levels of air pollution routinely. That means that our bodies are not used to the pollution and consequently often the health impacts can be more serious.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T04:07:10.273Z\">at 4.07am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5dd3bf8f086a28115b679e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T03:53:42.740Z\">3.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Via email from Rose:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>How can we protect against exacerbating further health inequities ie only rich people and wealthy workplaces (and well-funded childcare centres) being able to afford high quality air purifiers?</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Donna Green</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I wish I had a good answer for this. Just as we are currently seeing an increase in private jets being flown into Asia in response to Covid-19, there will always be inequality in the system. </p> <p>Reducing the inequality can be carried out through policy, and policies can get encouraged via grassroots pressure, especially at the local level. I would imagine local politicians might respond favourably to requests from a small percentage of their voters demanding reasonable provisions in public buildings including childcare centres, for example. They could perhaps encourage state- or territory-level policy to be reconsidered in this respect. It is tricky though as each building is different in terms of build, age, windows, usage, existing air conditioning etc.</p> <p>As important (if not more) will be real energy policy change to ensure that the kids currently in childcare centres have the best possible chance to grow up in a less climate-changed world. Given that environmental injustice already exists in Australia for air pollution and human health, attacking both the climate/energy policy angle now (as Michael Mann so eloquently discussed just before) is crucial to address future air pollution inequality.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T04:03:21.317Z\">at 4.03am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5dd2348f08e1332474e17f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T03:44:59.360Z\">3.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Is air pollution affecting mental health?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A question via comment: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Could you tell us the latest yet-to-be-published data on the effects of climate change and air pollution on mental health?</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Donna Green</strong>: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not privy to unpublished data, but there are good, recently published systematic reviews on this topic.

While natural gas (methane) produces about half as much carbon dioxide as coal per watt of power generated, there are legitimate concerns about \u2018fugitive emissions\u2019. Methane is itself a potent greenhouse gas and during the process of methane recovery (often called \u201cfracking\u201d \u2013 hydraulic fracturing) some of the methane escapes into the atmosphere. </p> <p>Since methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide on timescales of a decade or two, the leaked methane could easily offset the lower carbon dioxide emissions. Recent studies have shown both that there is a spike in the concentration of methane in the atmosphere over the past two decades (responsible for about 25% of the warming of the planet over that timeframe) and that this methane is indeed coming from natural gas extraction. Finally, investments and subsidies for natural gas crowd out investment for the true solution: renewable energy. Australia could lead the world in clean energy. It\u2019s got sun, wind, geothermal energy, etc. It\u2019s a no-brainer for Australia to move in that direction. And it\u2019s important for Australians to vote for politicians who will support the shift to renewable energy, and vote out those politicians who are instead simply doing the bidding of fossil fuel interests.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T02:21:37.242Z\">at 2.21am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5db9f48f086a28115b66ef\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T02:00:34.763Z\">2.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s a video answer we recorded earlier today from <strong>Greg Mullins.</strong></p> <p>A question from <strong>Joshua Alexander: </strong> is there a general consensus across Australia\u2019s firefighting services that climate change is making the fire season worse?</p> <p>The answer:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianAus/status/1234656353458651137\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Watch Greg Mullins&#39;s answer to this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FrontlineLive?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FrontlineLive</a> blog qs from Joshua Alexander, who has friends who are volunteer firefighters: Is there a general consensus across Australia&#39;s firefighter services that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/climatechange?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#climatechange</a> is making the fire season worse?<a href=\"https://t.co/BKFqyIYT1N\">https://t.co/BKFqyIYT1N</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/crvvain6Zi\">pic.twitter.com/crvvain6Zi</a></p>&mdash; Guardian Australia (@GuardianAus) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianAus/status/1234656353458651137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 3, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T02:03:40.306Z\">at 2.03am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5db6a28f08e1332474e0c7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T01:53:12.429Z\">1.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Has the time for 'centrist' policy passed?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A question now from Twitter: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MSackier/status/1234632098486448128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlboMP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AlboMP</a> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/insiders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#insiders</a> recently ruled out a carbon tax.

Can you tell me your thoughts on Indigenous fire management as a practice and does it have a role to play in managing wildfires in Australia?</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Greg Mullins:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yes! Cultural burning practices where they are still practised are incredibly sophisticated. It is NOT just a case of training firefighters to burn in a different way. Experts in this area understand their country \u2013 when animals and birds are nesting and reproducing, when certain plants are flowering and producing seeds. They use this knowledge of country to develop burning strategies that will invigorate rather than harm the environment.</p> <p>The basic problem, however, is that historically our Indigenous brothers and sisters have been driven off much of their country.

One of the issues we raised was that Australia\u2019s fire seasons now overlap with the US and Canada, where we source all but one of our large firefighting aircraft. Fire services had lodged a business case in 2018 for more financial support from the Australian government, but had been ignored, as had a Senate inquiry recommendation from 2016 that Australia develop its own fleet of large waterbombing aircraft.</p> <p>Disclaimer: all firefighters know that aircraft on their own cannot extinguish fires. They are another tool in the arsenal. However, they give a tactical edge by reducing fire intensity near assets to allow firefighters to get close enough to save assets, and in remote areas they can hold and contain fires until specialist remote area firefighters arrive.</p> <p>A study was published in the US last week showing that when aircraft are deployed early they can significantly reduce the ultimate size and duration of bushfires.</p> <p>We use a range of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters for different roles. The large air tankers generally don\u2019t drop directly on to flames \u2013 they lay retardant lines ahead of the flames to try to form a fire break. In extreme conditions and eucalypt forests these often only slow down the fires, as spotting (burning brands carried ahead of the fire front causing new fires) simply cross the retardant lines.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T01:15:32.769Z\">at 1.15am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5da79b8f0811db2fb026ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T00:41:09.672Z\">12.41am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianAus/status/1227785836533436417\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On 8 September 2019, historic\u00a0Binna Burra Lodge in Australia&#39;s Gold Coast hinterland was razed to the ground.

Do these forests contribute to intensifying fires? Has any research been conducted on these forests?</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Greg Mullins:</strong> <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m assuming that you mean regrowth following harvesting by forestry. The regrowth in these cases, unlike natural forests, is of a uniform age, so they are all about the same height. The danger with this is that should a high-intensity fire burn through these areas, immature trees can be killed and not regenerate. </p> <p>Because I\u2019m unsure exactly what you are referring to, I can\u2019t really comment on the intensity of fires and whether the state of regrowth contributes. However, the relationship between fuel and fire intensity is very straightforward: \u201cavailable fuel\u201d is generally considered to be leaf litter, sticks, twigs, bark, low shrubs etc that is 6mm in diameter or smaller. We weigh this to get a figure of tonnes per hectare, then can calculate fire intensity using algorithms that take into account drying, temperature, etc. If the new trees have a lot of light foliage they can contribute to fire intensity.</p> <p>The issue we have faced after a 20-year drying trend overlaid by a very serious drought is that \u201cavailable fuel\u201d is probably far more than 6mm diameter fuels, with a consequential significant increase in fire intensity, convection, spotting distances, and even pyroconvective activity (fires creating their own dry thunderstorms). <br></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T00:37:43.755Z\">at 12.37am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5da4198f0811db2fb026df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T00:28:51.794Z\">12.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This map shows the increasing severity of bushfires if carbon emissions remain high. </p> <p><strong>Greg Mullins</strong> will be here until 12pm answering more of your questions. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2020/02/frontline-fires/index.html\" data-alt=\"Map of bushfire severity\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2020/02/frontline-fires/index.html\">Map of bushfire severity</a> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e5da33c8f0811db2fb026dc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T00:25:24.372Z\">12.25am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Are we even &quot;in control&quot; of our fire season any more?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>From <strong>Lyon Lim</strong> via email: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>How can we play a role in preventing these bushfires from ever happening again?

Unfortunately the warming and drying trend caused by CO2 and greenhouse emissions has made our forests, scrublands and grasslands even more flammable. <br></p> <p>Prevention efforts can be effective for human causes (such as throwing away cigarettes, controlling burn offs, etc). However we have seen a significant increase in the number of naturally caused bushfires \u2013 specifically lightning-caused fires and \u201cdry\u201d thunderstorms. In 2016, hundreds of thousands of hectares burned in Tasmania due to lightning, and then again in 2018. Former Tasmanian fire chief Mike Brown and other veteran foresters and firefighters told me that this was unknown in previous decades.</p> <p>So, in a very real sense, we are no longer in control of the bushfire situation, something that is mirrored around the world, such as in California where they lost 18,000 homes and 100 lives in 2018, and 9,000 homes the year before. <br></p> <p>This is why I, and my 22 former fire and emergency chief colleagues who are members of Emergency Leaders for Climate Action, are asking the Australian government to take real action on the basic cause: greenhouse emissions. Over time we might then have a chance.<br></p> <p>With regard to area burned, about 21% of broadleaf forests were burned this season. That leaves a lot of bush to burn next year or subsequently. In Sydney the suburbs were not touched.

We must be a lot bolder in terms of conservation action \u2013 being more prepared, for example, to move species to reduce the risk of extinctions. </p> <p>We must also resist the knee-jerk reaction of the right wing to blame the fires on the lack of hazard reduction or national parks or \u201cgreenies\u201d. No amount of hazard reduction would have prevented some of the fires we have just seen. But in terms of conservation more generally, the government must reverse the decline in funding that has been going on since the Abbott government. We can save species, but need to spend money to do so.

The most general thing to say is that many types of crops, as well as livestock farming, will need to transition to other locations as the climate in their current location becomes unsuitable \u2013 this will mean that considerable disruption in our farming sector is ahead. </p> <p>Community urban gardens certainly have a place in cities and towns, but are unlikely to provide all the food we need for a growing population (especially considering that by 2050, we might have 10 billion mouths to feed). Shifting out of animal products to a more plant-based diet will help a lot \u2013 because producing food from animals is far less efficient than from plants. There are also some exciting fermentation technologies being developed in which animal protein is being produced from genetically modified yeast and other microorganisms.

These habitats provide important nursery grounds for prawns and fish, which in turn support turtles, dugongs and other marine life, as well as the fishing industry. Mangrove communities also filter nutrients and sediments from land runoff, act as natural buffers against storm surges, and store vast amounts of carbon. When mangroves die, this carbon is released back into the atmosphere, contributing to further changes in the climate. This type of event could certainly occur again if sea surface temperatures keep rising, as expected. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-02T23:41:51.451Z\">at 11.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5d96788f0811db2fb026b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-02T23:29:33.237Z\">11.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This graphic shows that change in water temperature Hughes is talking about. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2020/02/frontline-oceans/index.html\" data-alt=\"Change in water temperatures\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2020/02/frontline-oceans/index.html\">Change in water temperatures</a> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-02T23:41:01.822Z\">at 11.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5d96008f086a28115b6629\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-02T23:27:44.316Z\">11.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One from <strong>Phillip Sutton </strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/138586500\">via comment</a>:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What percentage of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2020/feb/24/the-dead-sea-tasmanias-underwater-forests-disappearing-in-our-lifetime\">kelp forests have been destroyed</a> in each state?

Yes, transpiration of water from the vegetation is greatly reduced, depending on how many leaves are left. This means that uptake of water from the roots is also reduced, affecting soil moisture. If there is heavy rain after the fire (such as we\u2019ve recently experienced on the east coast), more water will find its way into rivers because it is not being intercepted by the vegetation. Along with this, there may be significant loss of topsoil and nutrients. </p> <p>The nutrients in the runoff can affect water quality because they can support excessive growth of algae. Some algae can be quite toxic if ingested so there needs to be careful monitoring of drinking water in catchments under these post-fire circumstances.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-02T23:30:11.670Z\">at 11.30pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5d92f18f086a28115b6608\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-02T23:14:59.865Z\">11.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The dead sea</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s one of The Frontline stories that you can ask ecologist Prof <strong>Lesley Hughes</strong> about. </p> <p>The sea around the Tasmanian east coast used to be one of the only places in the world where you could dive among underwater forests of giant kelp.

But at the same time, to be truly pessimistic is to give up \u2013 and if we give up, we really are lost. I have come around to thinking that hope is far more than an emotion, it is also a fundamental strategy. We must go forward in hope if we are to have any chance of saving life on Earth. Ultimately this means that at times we might not express as pessimistic a view in public as we feel inside. We need to inspire and motivate, at the same time as being as honest as possible.

It\u2019s a beautiful, affecting multimedia series that looks at real people and the impacts the climate emergency is already having. Thanks so much for reading, following and asking questions of our experts. It was a great and informative discussion, to mark a stellar project, and I hope to see you all again soon. I\u2019d like to thank all our experts today for their time and incredibly detailed answers. The knowledge you have is astonishing. Thanks to Assoc Prof Donna Green, Prof Michael Mann, Greg Mullins and Prof Lesley Hughes. Sorry we couldn\u2019t get to all your reader questions. But we did manage to answer: Did our health departments make any mistakes with bushfire smoke? Are we saved if we hit net zero in 2050? Can our animals recover from the fires? Is Indigenous fire management the answer? Will community gardens save our food crops? Will bushfires affect the water cycle? Our final question for today, from Emma Coats: When do you feel optimistic that we can keep this planet in OK shape for our kids and grandkids? Is it when you read that demand for coal will be in freefall within a decade or is it when you read that more and more people are demanding action from governments? What makes you feel optimistic? Donna Green: I have a (possibly unrealistic) ability to entertain the notion that people can be simultaneously incredibly smart and incredibly stupid. In the main, I suspect I am optimistic because I choose to be. I want to believe that over the long game, smart might win out over stupid. An example of this could be seen in Australia where the markets have succeeded despite, not because of, our federal policy. We have witnessed a surge of solar and wind energy installation as a result. Of course, that leads on to question global politics and economic systems. And, specifically, the broader question of how the capitalist system is able to reduce consumption and increase equity \u2013 which is not so easily addressed. Our second-last question for today, and it is a big one. From Oskar Johnson via email: Have we quantified the number of people exposed to smoke inhalation as a result of the fires 2019-20? What long-term health effects might there be of this inhalation? Donna Green: There are a number of research projects combining census data, hospital admissions, health centre presentations and related data ongoing as we speak. Given the timing and nature of this kind of research, it is very early days to see any research analysis or findings from this \u2018summer of hell\u2019 season just passed. Frustratingly the research timeline for academic researchers does not generally allow for quick responses. Giving a quick example, generally you have to wait for an annual timeline to submit a proposal and then wait about a year to find out whether your proposal (with a success rate of about 10%) has been funded. If it is funded, usually the research budget will get cut about 10-30%. This means research analysis response times can be frustratingly slow. There have been some \u2018targeted research calls\u2019 that have a very tight turnaround. Last month the federal government announced $5m for research projects to respond to the bushfire crisis. This is a good start, however coming off the back of years of cuts to scientific research budgets there is a lot of ground to make up. We just don\u2019t really know the long-term effects of the exposure that many Australians felt over the last summer. Populations respond differently, for example. We can\u2019t easily extrapolate from studies in, for example, heavily polluted cities in China or India, because Australians in the main are not exposed to high levels of air pollution routinely. That means that our bodies are not used to the pollution and consequently often the health impacts can be more serious. Via email from Rose: How can we protect against exacerbating further health inequities ie only rich people and wealthy workplaces (and well-funded childcare centres) being able to afford high quality air purifiers? Donna Green: I wish I had a good answer for this. Just as we are currently seeing an increase in private jets being flown into Asia in response to Covid-19, there will always be inequality in the system. Reducing the inequality can be carried out through policy, and policies can get encouraged via grassroots pressure, especially at the local level. I would imagine local politicians might respond favourably to requests from a small percentage of their voters demanding reasonable provisions in public buildings including childcare centres, for example. They could perhaps encourage state- or territory-level policy to be reconsidered in this respect. It is tricky though as each building is different in terms of build, age, windows, usage, existing air conditioning etc. As important (if not more) will be real energy policy change to ensure that the kids currently in childcare centres have the best possible chance to grow up in a less climate-changed world. Given that environmental injustice already exists in Australia for air pollution and human health, attacking both the climate/energy policy angle now (as Michael Mann so eloquently discussed just before) is crucial to address future air pollution inequality. A question via comment: Could you tell us the latest yet-to-be-published data on the effects of climate change and air pollution on mental health? Donna Green: I\u2019m not privy to unpublished data, but there are good, recently published systematic reviews on this topic. For example, if you search online for \u2018Air Pollution (Particulate Matter) Exposure and Associations with Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar, Psychosis and Suicide Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\u2019. The associations between PM2.5 and ultra fines with mental health are identified in this review. It would be likely that at the end of this year you would also start to see some more research published in this area for Australia specifically given that there was a targeted funding call of $2m to support analysis of the effect of bushfire smoke and mental health last month. Other potentially useful places to look for this research include: Understanding how climate change and floods affect mental health and community wellbeing via Sydney University, or some of the work of Prof Helen Berry. From Kirsty Harris: What can citizens do in their streets and suburbs to reduce the impact of heat on their health? If part of the answer is to plant trees, what kind should we be planting, and where do we get lists of trees that will be more suitable for surviving a hotter, drier climate? Donna Green: Local councils are a good place to start asking about which trees are good for planting in your neighbourhood. Many have lists they can give you and they would be taking into consideration your local area and the ecosystem that the tree will (hopefully) grow up in. Soft landscaping which has permeable surfaces and the use of native small grasses and shrubs instead of lawns is better during droughts due to the lower water needs, and the support of local birds and other critters. As we\u2019ve also seen in many places recently, lots of hard surfaces increase run-off, especially during extreme rainfall, which increases flooding. To reduce these problems, now and for the near future, if you have a choice about upgrading gardens, these sorts of things could be kept in mind. A question from Nicola Harvey: I\u2019m a farmer who strongly believes in climate change and I really struggle in arguments with reactionaries (other farmers). What are the most important points to use in an argument about climate change, to really substantiate my argument on the reality of climate change as I end up very frustrated. Thank you. Donna Green: You are not alone! Fortunately there are a range of good websites that can provide answers to some of the more frustrating climate denier arguments. See John Cook\u2019s site or Real Climate. It\u2019s also important to realise that there are lots of similar farmers who share your frustrations and who can tailor responses appropriately. Anika Molesworth, if you don\u2019t already know her, provides excellent commentary. Via email from Tim: What effect will all the bushfire smoke have on a foetus? I\u2019ve heard that there is some disturbing evidence on this from fires in the US. Donna Green: Researchers have found that some of the smallest pollution particles (PM2.5 and ultrafines) can cross into the bloodstream (unlike larger PM10 particles that can get trapped in your nose hairs or mucus). These smaller particles, among others, are found in bushfire smoke. Because your blood circulates everywhere throughout all your body\u2019s systems, and in this case potentially crossing the placenta, there is concern that there would be impacts on foetuses. Moreover, if the mother\u2019s health is compromised by inhaling bushfire smoke, that could of course indirectly affect the health and wellbeing of the baby. Research examining the associations between exposure to pollution and stillbirths, miscarriages and pre-term delivery has been ongoing worldwide. Australian researchers are currently looking for these relationships over the past summer period to see if they can see similar relationships. From Josh via email: Did the NSW and ACT health departments respond appropriately to minimise the effects of exposure to bushfire smoke during the summer? Or should they have issued a directive that, for example, childcare centres keep children inside during the worst days? Prof Donna Green: We do know that there is \u2018no safe level\u2019 of air pollution, and that children are more susceptible than adults to air pollution, so your concerns are well founded. Many of Australia\u2019s buildings are quite \u2018leaky\u2019 so staying inside can be better than outside \u2013 but not necessarily the best place to be on the very worst pollution days. This is especially true for vulnerable populations (children, for instance). In these cases, the childcare centres and schools may not have been the best places for the kids, even if they were kept inside. It would be great if, as was recently called for, an independent national expert committee on air pollution and health was set up to develop evidence-based, accurate, practical and consistent advice on health protection against bushfire smoke. The Medical Journal of Australia has a very timely article on the need for this to happen, and quickly. See \u2018Bushfire smoke: urgent need for a national health protection strategy\u2019. Another video answer from Michael Mann: If you had the opportunity or power to change our behaviour, what would you impose as our first steps? Our first question Prof Donna Green is from Ilya via email: Don\u2019t you think that the coronavirus pandemic is a much more serious and immediate problem than climate change, considering that it can kill millions in the near future? Donna Green: Climate change has already shortened the life of \u2013 and increased the sickness of \u2013 many hundreds of thousands of people over recent years. The increase in extreme weather we have locked in to our climate system is very likely to cause many more cases of sickness and death in the future from direct and indirect impacts. A great way to visualise some of these impacts to our health can be seen in this BMJ infographic. The Covid-19 advice does suggest that this is a serious international issue and concern. It is important to keep this response in perspective, however, and rely on factually correct sources of information, for example the WHO, to know the scale and nature of the problem and the appropriate response. Millions of Australians have spent the summer in smoke but, as our Frontline story on this explored, nobody knows the impact of medium- to long-term exposure to bushfire smoke. \u201cIt can affect every system in your body,\u201d Prof Donna Green told us in February. \u201cYou\u2019re not only talking about respiratory-related and heart-related problems, people are linking it to diabetes [and] dementia.\u201d She will be online from 2pm to 3pm to answer more of your questions. Email frontline.live@theguardian.com or tweet #frontlinelive Assoc Prof Donna Green will be answering your questions from 2pm, and we\u2019ve already received a few. Prof Green is an expert on the health effects of climate change and air pollution. When it comes to air quality, you know a day is bad when you can see the smoke, and smell it. But you may not realise how bad it is until you see the graphs. The following graphics use the official NSW and ACT measurements of PM2.5 micrograms per cubic metre. On Australia\u2019s worst day, a maximum of 1,798.7 was registered at Wagga Wagga (7pm, 5 January). Beijing that day was 72.5 micrograms. Heat can kill. That is one of the first things that doctors on the climate frontline will tell you. Indigenous communities in central Australia already know it and are feeling the brunt \u2013 as Australia heats up higher than the global average. In this chapter of Frontline, doctors told us there\u2019s clear evidence that extreme heat is already killing people prematurely. You can ask Donna Green about this, and other health impacts. Our final text question and answer from Michael Mann \u2013 but there are more video questions to come. From Robert McLachlan: We\u2019ve heard a lot about tipping points in the climate system. The IPCC says that irreversible destabilisation of west Antarctica has not yet set in, and there are controversies about some others like arctic methane and the Gulf Stream. What do you see as the most urgent potential tipping points to guard against and to know more about? Michael Mann: We could be rather close to the tipping point where we commit to the melting of most of the west Antarctic ice sheet, which alone could add another 10 feet of global sea level rise. The recent observations of a large hole forming in the Thwaites glacier, which is sort of the \u201clinchpin\u201d of the west Antarctic ice sheet, adds to the concern that we are very close to this threshold. Other tipping point responses, like the slowdown of the north Atlantic \u201cconveyor belt\u201d ocean circulation, may already be under way. We\u2019ve done some work in the journal Nature that suggests this possibility (see also this commentary). Other tipping point responses \u2013 like the massive release of permafrost methane \u2013 loom with additional warming. There are many different possible warming thresholds that trigger each of these responses, and so there is no one \u201ctipping point\u201d. I prefer the analogy of a minefield that we are walking out on to, and the further we go the more danger we encounter. The only sensible policy is stop the forward lurch by getting off fossil fuels as quickly as possible. Another from Twitter: Michael Mann: Our best scientific understanding suggests that we can keep planetary warming below 1.5C if we follow a trajectory of decarbonisation that reduces carbon emissions by a factor of two by 2030 and achieves net zero emissions by 2050. There is of course some uncertainty in that number because there are uncertainties in climate model projections, but the uncertainty is probably only about plus or minus 0.2 degrees. CO2 levels in this scenario would probably peak at about 430 parts per million in the atmosphere (current levels are about 415 ppm) and slowly decline as the oceans and biosphere absorb some of the atmospheric CO2. Our best scientific understanding also suggests that temperatures will stabilise at roughly 1.5C and not rise further if we achieve these targets. That would probably prevent the worst climate change impacts from being realised. We\u2019re nearing the end of our questions for Michael Mann. A reminder that our final expert, Assoc Prof Donna Green, a specialist in the health effects of climate change and air pollution, will be here from 2pm. Get your questions in early. From Kate Ryan via email: As large corporations drive the economy and governments are more concerned with being popular, is it up to the individual to make the hard changes required? I understand ecology and the effects of our lifestyle on the natural environment but it would seem a large part of the population has no idea of the damage caused by deforestation, acidification, pollution etc. What is the best way to deliver the message? Michael Mann: Individual actions are certainly important. There are things we can all do in our daily lives that decrease our environmental footprint, and save us money, make us healthier, make us feel better about ourselves and set a good example for others. But any meaningful solution to the climate crisis involves systemic change \u2013 policies that incentivise a mass shift away from fossil fuel burning and other activities that generate carbon pollution. Such policies include carbon pricing, incentives for renewables, etc. That in turn requires electing politicians who will support those policies rather than politicians who will simply do the bidding of fossil fuel interests. Another video answer from Greg Mullins. From Alice Kelly via email: Does gas have half the greenhouse emissions of coal, from extraction to use? Michael Mann\u2019s answer: Technically yes but this is rather misleading statistic. While natural gas (methane) produces about half as much carbon dioxide as coal per watt of power generated, there are legitimate concerns about \u2018fugitive emissions\u2019. Methane is itself a potent greenhouse gas and during the process of methane recovery (often called \u201cfracking\u201d \u2013 hydraulic fracturing) some of the methane escapes into the atmosphere. Since methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide on timescales of a decade or two, the leaked methane could easily offset the lower carbon dioxide emissions. Recent studies have shown both that there is a spike in the concentration of methane in the atmosphere over the past two decades (responsible for about 25% of the warming of the planet over that timeframe) and that this methane is indeed coming from natural gas extraction. Finally, investments and subsidies for natural gas crowd out investment for the true solution: renewable energy. Australia could lead the world in clean energy. It\u2019s got sun, wind, geothermal energy, etc. It\u2019s a no-brainer for Australia to move in that direction. And it\u2019s important for Australians to vote for politicians who will support the shift to renewable energy, and vote out those politicians who are instead simply doing the bidding of fossil fuel interests. And here\u2019s a video answer we recorded earlier today from Greg Mullins. A question from Joshua Alexander: is there a general consensus across Australia\u2019s firefighting services that climate change is making the fire season worse? The answer: A question now from Twitter: Michael Mann: A price on carbon is an essential tool in levelling the playing field in the energy marketplace so that renewable energy \u2013 which doesn\u2019t have the same detrimental impact on our climate and environment \u2013 can compete fairly against fossil fuel energy. Subsidies for renewable energy and removing subsidies for fossil fuels (the Australian government subsidies the fossi- fuel industry to the tune of $1,000 a person) are also key tools here. Ironically, a carbon tax is a centrist climate policy. It embraces market economics as a means of dealing with an environmental externality, and in the past conservative governments have embraced such market-based tools. It is only recently that conservatives have opposed carbon pricing. It\u2019s also important to note that there are different ways of pricing carbon, including a carbon tax and emissions trading schemes (eg \u201ccap and trade\u201d). The Gillard government instituted the latter, but the Murdoch media labeled it a \u201ccarbon tax\u201d in an effort to reduce its popularity, and the terminology stuck. The critics claimed it would increase prices but there\u2019s no evidence that it did that. It did reduce carbon emissions on the other hand. We know that pricing carbon works, and any meaningful climate policy must include carbon pricing, along with incentives for renewable energy and other policies to help decarbonise all sectors of society. A question now from Shiann Broderick, an 18-year-old school striker who grew up in and lives in Nymboida in NSW and lost her house in the fires. How long do you think it will take populations of small birds, mammals, reptiles and gastropods like native snail species to recover back into the landscape to their prior numbers after such a catastrophic fire event over such a huge area? Michael Mann: We hear the statistic often that a billion animals were killed by this season\u2019s bushfires. But that\u2019s only vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish). When you include other genera, including insects, the number rises into trillions. This is tragic and will have long-lasting impacts on the viability of these species. Sadly some species will go extinct or become functionally extinct as a result of the bushfires. Koalas in NSW are now endangered as a result of the bushfires. If we continue to see bushfire seasons like this in years to come we will be facing more and more extinctions. This highlights the urgency of climate action, including efforts by Australia to join with, rather than oppose, the larger international efforts to act on climate. Another story from our series. A hotter world has a lot of flow-on effects: bushfires, crops, water and smoke. But one of the simplest is also the deadliest. Hotter temperatures kill people. As doctors and Indigenous residents of central Australia told us in our episode on The killer heat, it hits the body at a cellular level. From Jenny Nielsen via email: I\u2019d like to ask Prof Mann about going from a carbon-emitting economy to a carbon-absorbing economy and specifically his thoughts on Prof Tim Flannery\u2019s suggestion that large-scale economically sustainable ocean permaculture would not only address climate change but could feed the world and de-acidify the oceans. Could he also comment on other methods of \u2018drawdown\u2019 to reduce carbon in the atmosphere into the future that they\u2019d support? Michael Mann: Tim is a wise man and there is merit in what he is suggesting. Carbon \u2018drawdown\u2019 is an important part of the climate solution and there are ways to do this both with regard to the oceans and the terrestrial biosphere. When it comes to carbon drawdown, there are natural methods like sustainable permaculture, reforestation, regenerative agriculture, etc to do this, and artificial methods (like constructing millions of synthetic \u2018trees\u2019 that absorb and bury carbon). In the end, however, any efforts at drawdown are futile if we continue to load the atmosphere with 50bn tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. So any meaningful climate action must focus primarily on the decarbonisation of our economy (ie moving rapidly away from fossil fuel burning to renewable energy), but carbon drawdown can certainly aid the effort. And a question from earlier via comment: Michael Mann: Unfortunately, the Australian government\u2019s current commitments don\u2019t get us very far. They involve what some consider a dubious accounting trick (trying to get \u201ccarryover credits\u201d for somewhat meagre actions taken by Australia in response to the 1997 Kyoto Accord to reduce their current emissions reduction commitments. Indeed, the Australian negotiator helped sabotage the recent international Madrid climate meeting by insisting on this. The current government is also subsidising coal and natural gas rather than providing incentives for the renewable energy, taking Australia in the wrong direction. This is unfortunate because Australia was once a real leader when it comes to climate action. Australia was the first major industrial nation to put a price on carbon (in the form of the emissions trading scheme passed by the Gillard government) in 2011. Unfortunately it was disbanded when Tony Abbott took over as prime minister a couple years later and the current government has shown no support for pricing carbon, an essential tool in the effort to decarbonise our economy. They are not in line with efforts to limit warming to below a dangerous 1.5C. Some thoughts from our readers below the line: Our first question for Prof Michael Mann is via comment: Why do we commonly see 2050 as the year to eliminate fossil fuels and transfer to 100% clean energy rather than a more urgent date, say, in the next 10 years? It seems obvious from all the genuine literature I have read that we do not have another three decades to get our collective acts together. Michael Mann: If you look at the so-called carbon budget we have left to avoid warming the planet beyond a dangerous 1.5C and do the maths, there are certain benchmarks we need to achieve to stay on target. Achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 is one key benchmark (Zali Stegall, independent MP for Warringah in NSW, has a climate bill that focuses on that target). What is also true is that we need to bring carbon emissions down by a factor of two within the next 10 years or so to stay on target. Both this near-term target and the longer-term 2050 target are important to keep in focus when it comes to policies to decarbonise our economy and avert dangerous warming. Thanks to Greg Mullins for his time. Again, sorry we could not get to every question. Next up, climatologist and geophysicist Prof Michael Mann. Our final question for Greg Mullins is from Yindi Kalina: Thank you with all our heart for standing up and speaking out. Can you tell me your thoughts on Indigenous fire management as a practice and does it have a role to play in managing wildfires in Australia? Greg Mullins: Yes! Cultural burning practices where they are still practised are incredibly sophisticated. It is NOT just a case of training firefighters to burn in a different way. Experts in this area understand their country \u2013 when animals and birds are nesting and reproducing, when certain plants are flowering and producing seeds. They use this knowledge of country to develop burning strategies that will invigorate rather than harm the environment. The basic problem, however, is that historically our Indigenous brothers and sisters have been driven off much of their country. Therefore the deep knowledge and continuity of practice is lacking in many areas. However, there is a resurgence in this area and we need to listen to the people who understand country and can help to heal it. The major issue though is that nobody in the past 60,000 years has experienced a climate like this or fires like this. Which means we need to work together and try new approaches, with cultural burning front and centre among the possible solutions. 12 months after Fleur Magick Dennis moved to Euchareena in regional NSW in 2017, the water was turned off. One of the longest, most severe droughts in living memory is the cause \u2013 and is exacerbated by climate change. Even recent rain across the state was not enough to break it. Read Fleur and her husband Locky\u2019s story and let our experts know if you have any questions about the future of water in a changing climate. Greg Mullins will be here for a few more minutes, and climate scientist Michael Mann will be in soon to take over. Michael McGovern asks: Could a fleet of long-range large waterbomber aircraft deployed early after fires were detected have significantly reduced or eliminated the fires before they became uncontainable? Greg Mullins: Together with 22 other former fire and emergency chiefs, from April last year I tried to alert the Australian government to the seriousness of the impending bushfire threat. One of the issues we raised was that Australia\u2019s fire seasons now overlap with the US and Canada, where we source all but one of our large firefighting aircraft. Fire services had lodged a business case in 2018 for more financial support from the Australian government, but had been ignored, as had a Senate inquiry recommendation from 2016 that Australia develop its own fleet of large waterbombing aircraft. Disclaimer: all firefighters know that aircraft on their own cannot extinguish fires. They are another tool in the arsenal. However, they give a tactical edge by reducing fire intensity near assets to allow firefighters to get close enough to save assets, and in remote areas they can hold and contain fires until specialist remote area firefighters arrive. A study was published in the US last week showing that when aircraft are deployed early they can significantly reduce the ultimate size and duration of bushfires. We use a range of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters for different roles. The large air tankers generally don\u2019t drop directly on to flames \u2013 they lay retardant lines ahead of the flames to try to form a fire break. In extreme conditions and eucalypt forests these often only slow down the fires, as spotting (burning brands carried ahead of the fire front causing new fires) simply cross the retardant lines. Robert Armstrong asks: Having been in northern NSW for a few months, I noticed that the regrowth forests that were burned out did not have much resemblance to the old growth forests in national parks. The regrowth forest does not have a canopy and consists of dense, thin trees of varying height. Do these forests contribute to intensifying fires? Has any research been conducted on these forests? Greg Mullins: I\u2019m assuming that you mean regrowth following harvesting by forestry. The regrowth in these cases, unlike natural forests, is of a uniform age, so they are all about the same height. The danger with this is that should a high-intensity fire burn through these areas, immature trees can be killed and not regenerate. Because I\u2019m unsure exactly what you are referring to, I can\u2019t really comment on the intensity of fires and whether the state of regrowth contributes. However, the relationship between fuel and fire intensity is very straightforward: \u201cavailable fuel\u201d is generally considered to be leaf litter, sticks, twigs, bark, low shrubs etc that is 6mm in diameter or smaller. We weigh this to get a figure of tonnes per hectare, then can calculate fire intensity using algorithms that take into account drying, temperature, etc. If the new trees have a lot of light foliage they can contribute to fire intensity. The issue we have faced after a 20-year drying trend overlaid by a very serious drought is that \u201cavailable fuel\u201d is probably far more than 6mm diameter fuels, with a consequential significant increase in fire intensity, convection, spotting distances, and even pyroconvective activity (fires creating their own dry thunderstorms). This map shows the increasing severity of bushfires if carbon emissions remain high. Greg Mullins will be here until 12pm answering more of your questions. From Lyon Lim via email: How can we play a role in preventing these bushfires from ever happening again? Are we even in control, and have the means to avert such intense bushfires in the next fire season? With the amount of bushfires acreage burnt, would the upcoming season be that intense again? Greg Mullins: Unfortunately, as my emergency service chief colleagues and I have been trying to warn the Australian government, climate change has super-charged the bushfire problem. Australia is the driest inhabited continent, and bushfires have been here for as long as humans. Unfortunately the warming and drying trend caused by CO2 and greenhouse emissions has made our forests, scrublands and grasslands even more flammable. Prevention efforts can be effective for human causes (such as throwing away cigarettes, controlling burn offs, etc). However we have seen a significant increase in the number of naturally caused bushfires \u2013 specifically lightning-caused fires and \u201cdry\u201d thunderstorms. In 2016, hundreds of thousands of hectares burned in Tasmania due to lightning, and then again in 2018. Former Tasmanian fire chief Mike Brown and other veteran foresters and firefighters told me that this was unknown in previous decades. So, in a very real sense, we are no longer in control of the bushfire situation, something that is mirrored around the world, such as in California where they lost 18,000 homes and 100 lives in 2018, and 9,000 homes the year before. This is why I, and my 22 former fire and emergency chief colleagues who are members of Emergency Leaders for Climate Action, are asking the Australian government to take real action on the basic cause: greenhouse emissions. Over time we might then have a chance. With regard to area burned, about 21% of broadleaf forests were burned this season. That leaves a lot of bush to burn next year or subsequently. In Sydney the suburbs were not touched. Unfortunately our bushfire problem will not go away. The first installment of The Frontline looked at our horror summer \u2013 the 33 people killed, the thousands of homes lost. And as Greg just said, they were of an unprecedented intensity and scale that shocked everyone. In the Gold Coast hinterland, Tony Groom\u2019s beloved Binna Burra Lodge stood for more than 80 years. This summer it burned. It\u2019s \u201cthe kind of lush forest that doesn\u2019t usually burn\u201d. We spoke to him for our first chapter back in February. Our first question for Greg Mullins is from Mark Doyle: We need to break our of this climate stasis we are in. It requires Australians to take actual action. What\u2019s something real and immediate individuals could do to start the citizen-led ball rolling? Not a march. Mullins: Thanks for your question, Mark. I think that this summer has woken up a lot of people, including politicians, to the climate change crisis that we face. It is no longer theoretical. The scale of the bushfires, the losses, and the extreme weather conditions that drove them even surprised veteran firefighters and climate scientists. The big gap that I see is in government policy on emissions reduction: this means our energy sector, transport, manufacturing, agriculture \u2013 none have any signals from government about what needs to be done and how they can do their part. State and territory governments are all adopting net zero policies, but they need Canberra to step up to assist. We have an opportunity now: independent MP Zali Steggall will introduce a private member\u2019s bill to parliament this month based on UK legislation. It will provide a framework for action in Australia. We need our politicians to support this. Many in the Coalition understand the need but they are being bullied by the few climate deniers. We should all be calling on our federal MPs to support this bill. If necessary, they should cross the floor for climate and for the kids\u2019 futures. This is something concrete that all of us can do right now. Politicians rely on votes so they listen to voters. Come on \u201cquiet Australians\u201d: get loud! Thanks to Prof Lesley Hughes for her time and incredible expertise. From Antonio Gramsci to mangrove forests, it had it all. Sorry we couldn\u2019t get all your reader questions \u2013 but we do have more experts lined up for the rest of the day who can. A full list is here. Next up is Greg Mullins, former commissioner of Fire and Rescue NSW, volunteer firefighter and climate councillor. He\u2019ll be answering questions until 12pm. Email frontline.live@theguardian.com or tweet #frontlinelive Our final question for Lesley Hughes is from Sophie Bickford via email: Over the past decade with the understandable focus on climate change, other areas of the environment have been given less attention \u2013 nature conservation in particular. In some ways the species extinction is a crisis of the same order of magnitude as climate change \u2013 and is irreversible. Can we fix both at the same time? Hughes: I think the recent bushfire crisis has focused a lot of attention on the threats of climate change to wildlife, and the parlous state of the Australian environment in general. We must be a lot bolder in terms of conservation action \u2013 being more prepared, for example, to move species to reduce the risk of extinctions. We must also resist the knee-jerk reaction of the right wing to blame the fires on the lack of hazard reduction or national parks or \u201cgreenies\u201d. No amount of hazard reduction would have prevented some of the fires we have just seen. But in terms of conservation more generally, the government must reverse the decline in funding that has been going on since the Abbott government. We can save species, but need to spend money to do so. We can\u2019t separate the climate crisis from the extinction crisis \u2013 one is exacerbating the other, and both must be addressed simultaneously. And now our second-last question for the professor. From Micaela Ledin: For those of us who are feeling overwhelmed and helpless right now, what bigger steps can we take as individuals? (Beyond cutting plastic, less water, less driving etc). What actions, specifically, should we be demanding our government to do? Lesley Hughes: Use your vote wisely \u2013 make sure your parliamentary representatives know that climate change policy will be the number one reason determining your vote at the next election. In the meantime, add your signature to Zali Steggall\u2019s climate bill. Think about where your money is \u2013 in insurance, superannuation and banks. If your bank, insurance company or super fund is investing in fossil fuels, move your money and tell them why. The website Market Forces is a great resource to support this action. Put solar panels on your house if you can, or buy green power if you can\u2019t. Depending on your finances, consider installing battery storage and getting an electric car. Reduce your meat and dairy consumption (healthier too!). Finally, a good colleague of mine always says, \u201cUse your time, your talent, and/or your treasure.\u201d Join a like-minded community group and give them your time, donate to climate advocacy groups if you can, and volunteer your skills. In terms of demands to government: we must close down our ageing coal-fired power stations as soon as possible and support investment in renewables and new green technologies. We do actually need a climate and energy policy and we must demand that our governments be guided by facts not opinions. From Julie Bennett via email: Could the interruption to global trade with the spread of Covid-19 be the impetus for radical change in lifestyles and institutions required to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enable ecosystems time to adapt to changing temperatures? Lesley Hughes: These are very big questions, and probably best answered in hindsight! I do think that global emissions will be reduced, at least temporarily, as travel, trade, and goods production (especially in China) slows down. We saw this happen during the GFC. I suspect that once the virus emergency is over (assuming this happens) that most things will return to their previous state, but with some more attention being paid to self-sufficiency (at a country level) and a desire for economies to be less dependent on China (such as diversifying the origin of overseas university students here in Australia). But I think it\u2019s probably wishful thinking to expect this crisis to bring about a whole-world change in how we live. But really, your guess is as good as mine! And here are the statistics behind that question, from our initial story. Projected output has dropped by as much as 25% in some parts of Australia\u2019s cropping and grazing industries \u2013 and that\u2019s only at 1C of warming. We are on track for 3C. Average annual farm profits have already dropped significantly due to global heating: down by 37% in Victoria, and 35.3% in the cropping industry. A question on The lost harvest from Roan Sajko: If cropping profits continue to decline in Aus, What kind of food security situation will we be in if many plant farmers decide they can no longer sustain their businesses? Is there a good case for things like urban community gardens? Can indoor hydroponic systems save our crops? Lesley Hughes: The impacts of climate change on agriculture are extremely complex. The most general thing to say is that many types of crops, as well as livestock farming, will need to transition to other locations as the climate in their current location becomes unsuitable \u2013 this will mean that considerable disruption in our farming sector is ahead. Community urban gardens certainly have a place in cities and towns, but are unlikely to provide all the food we need for a growing population (especially considering that by 2050, we might have 10 billion mouths to feed). Shifting out of animal products to a more plant-based diet will help a lot \u2013 because producing food from animals is far less efficient than from plants. There are also some exciting fermentation technologies being developed in which animal protein is being produced from genetically modified yeast and other microorganisms. I have just had a piece on this technology in relation to dairy production come out in the Monthly (called \u201cThe milk of human genius\u201d). From Cliff Fraser via email: Trees, plants in general, absorb and sequester carbon. When a tree dies, naturally or otherwise, is the carbon released or still held in the tree remains? Lesley Hughes: After plants die they gradually decompose and, as they do so, the carbon is released back to the atmosphere. This will be a much slower process for a large tree than for a small herb. Published just yesterday, here\u2019s the final chapter of our series. It looks at how the climate emergency is changing the food we eat and crops we grow. \u201cConsumers are going to have to get used to not being able to get the fruit and vegetables they want at the price they want and the quality they want without sourcing them from overseas,\u201d Mark Howden, the director of the Australian National University\u2019s climate change institute, told us. More on that answer as well, specifically about mangroves: Lesley Hughes: Massive mortality of mangroves in the Gulf of Carpentaria occurred between late 2015 and early 2016, along a 1,000km stretch of coastline. The deaths occurred during an underwater heatwave (responsible for coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef at the same time), along with a severe drought and a temporary drop in sea level associated with a strong El Ni\u00f1o event. Approximately 7,400 hectares of mangroves from the Roper River Estuary, east to Karumba in Queensland, were affected, with some river catchments losing over 25% of their mangroves. These habitats provide important nursery grounds for prawns and fish, which in turn support turtles, dugongs and other marine life, as well as the fishing industry. Mangrove communities also filter nutrients and sediments from land runoff, act as natural buffers against storm surges, and store vast amounts of carbon. When mangroves die, this carbon is released back into the atmosphere, contributing to further changes in the climate. This type of event could certainly occur again if sea surface temperatures keep rising, as expected. This graphic shows that change in water temperature Hughes is talking about. One from Phillip Sutton via comment: What percentage of the kelp forests have been destroyed in each state? What about the massive mangrove forest loss in the NT? Will this recur? How often and with what consequences? Lesley Hughes: I\u2019m not sure the exact percentages of kelp loss in each state, but overall, these important ecosystems are in serious decline. They cover more than 71,000 sq km around the southern mainland coast and Tasmania and are highly productive, supporting rich marine biodiversity. They are facing multiple threats including underwater heatwaves, damage from boats, nutrient and sediment runoff, and overgrazing by marine herbivores. This latter threat is particularly important in Tasmania. Since the 1970s, the long-spined sea urchin (Centrostephanus rodgersii), originally a resident of the New South Wales coast, has been migrating southwards under the influence of the warming and strengthening East Australian Current. It has now established in large numbers in Tasmania where warming waters mean that the larvae can survive the winter. The urchins graze on the kelp, creating bare patches called \u201cbarrens\u201d. The habitat of over 150 species is being lost during this process, with flow-on impacts to the abalone and lobster fishing industries, worth over $100m per year in 2016. From Kerrie Davis: How will the loss of the forests from bushfires affect the water cycle in the short to medium term? I assume that the millions of hectares of burnt bushland will reduce the amount of water evaporated from the leaves and eventually form less rain. Lesley Hughes: A number of things can happen after a bushfire that affects the water cycle. Yes, transpiration of water from the vegetation is greatly reduced, depending on how many leaves are left. This means that uptake of water from the roots is also reduced, affecting soil moisture. If there is heavy rain after the fire (such as we\u2019ve recently experienced on the east coast), more water will find its way into rivers because it is not being intercepted by the vegetation. Along with this, there may be significant loss of topsoil and nutrients. The nutrients in the runoff can affect water quality because they can support excessive growth of algae. Some algae can be quite toxic if ingested so there needs to be careful monitoring of drinking water in catchments under these post-fire circumstances. Here\u2019s one of The Frontline stories that you can ask ecologist Prof Lesley Hughes about. The sea around the Tasmanian east coast used to be one of the only places in the world where you could dive among underwater forests of giant kelp. In our incredible multimedia episode \u2013 The dead sea \u2013 you can see footage of these amazing plants. But rising sea temperatures killed off the last of the forests a few years ago. In their place, a local diver, Mick Baron, says there are only sea urchins \u2013 leaving the ocean floor \u201clike an asphalt driveway\u201d. Our first question is in. ErikFrederiksen asks via comment: A few years ago a NY Times reporter wrote that some climate scientists had told him they held more pessimistic views than they felt comfortable expressing in public. My question to a scientist would be: Do you find this to be typical and do you feel this to be true about yourself? Prof Lesley Hughes (ecologist, distinguished professor of biology and pro-vice-chancellor (research) at Macquarie University) answers: The best way I can think of to answer this question is a quote from Antonio Gramsci, an Italian Marxist politician from last century who wrote about the tension between the \u201cpessimism of the intellect and the optimism of the will\u201d. What this means is that most of us (I think) simultaneously hold a lot of very negative thoughts in our heads about the consequences of climate change, as we confront the facts. But at the same time, to be truly pessimistic is to give up \u2013 and if we give up, we really are lost. I have come around to thinking that hope is far more than an emotion, it is also a fundamental strategy. We must go forward in hope if we are to have any chance of saving life on Earth. Ultimately this means that at times we might not express as pessimistic a view in public as we feel inside. We need to inspire and motivate, at the same time as being as honest as possible. This is a tightrope to walk! Hello and good morning. Over the past three weeks, Guardian Australia has been publishing The Frontline \u2013 a beautifully filmed and produced six-part multimedia series about how Australians are already living with the effects of the climate crisis. It\u2019s about real-life people whose homes have been lost. How the extreme heat in Australia is killing us. How the taps are running dry for some towns in NSW, and how the climate crisis is changing what we eat and drink. And of course, our black summer of bushfires, which killed 33 people. Now, you have a chance to ask our panel of experts about the issues raised in the series. You can ask a general question about the impacts of global heating. (How will it affect you? How it will change society? How can it be stopped?) And you can ask about any of the issues raised in The Frontline \u2013 follow-ups, clarifications, anything we left unanswered. Our panel is: 10am-11am: Prof Lesley Hughes \u2013 ecologist and distinguished professor of biology, expert on animal and plant species and ecosystems. 11am-12pm: Greg Mullins, former commissioner of Fire and Rescue NSW, expert on bushfires. 12pm-1.30pm: Prof Michael Mann, climatologist and geophysicist and a global expert on climate science. 2pm-3pm: Assoc Prof Donna Green \u2013 an expert on the health effects of climate change and air pollution. Submit your questions via email to frontline.live@theguardian.com, or tweet on the hashtag #frontlinelive. We\u2019ll publish your question here on our live blog, alongside the answer from one of our experts. And the six-part series can be found here: The new fire zone, The taps run dry, The air we breathe, The killer heat, The dead sea, The lost harvest.",

You\u2019re not going to run out of food, you might not have same choice of foods but you won\u2019t be left without.\u201d People just needed to think about what they would need for their family if they had to stay home for a couple of weeks, and purchase those goods during their next few visits to the supermarket, he said. There was no need to rush out and buy supplies, with many homes already in possession of nonperishable items like rice and pasta. The chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, along with the president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Tony Bartone, have both told people not to stockpile beyond having essential medicines and two weeks of food on hand. But this has not stopped consumers from buying up toilet paper, flour, rice and nonperishable goods in bulk. \u201cThe worst-case scenario for most people is you will become ill and need to quarantine, so you\u2019re out of action for two weeks,\u201d Bartone told Guardian Australia. \u201cThat\u2019s all you need. Two weeks worth of stuff. Most modern pantries, with the exception of fresh food, can deal with that without too much trouble. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to stock up bunkers. Certain things will become in short supply because of supply chain logistics \u2026 but there will be alternatives to circumvent shortages. If everyone goes out and panic-buys, forget supply chain issues caused by coronavirus, you\u2019ll stretch any supply. \u201cAside from the food your family might need, you might want to get a bottle of Panadol, electrolyte replacement solution, and obviously medications. Most people do already have these items, and about a month\u2019s worth of any prescription medication on hand.\u201d People have time to buy items, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the community in any big way.\u201d Professor Mary-Louise McLaws, an infection control expert with the University of New South Wales, agreed filling two to four weeks\u2019 worth of prescription medications was sensible. People could check with their pharmacist about anticipated shortages and about whether they delivered, she added. \u201cFor the average Australian, if you\u2019re on a good wage, you\u2019re not really helping those who manage week-to-week who may have a family if you stockpile months worth of goods,\u201d McLaws said. \u201cSo think carefully about what you\u2019re doing to the average Australian who is not as fortunate. It\u2019s a good time to check in on elderly neighbours and be aware of them, and if they need anything. \u201cI\u2019m not a prepper for the coronavirus because I think its unAustralian and unhelpful.\u201d Some shoppers have been opportunistic, buying items such as hand sanitiser and face masks in bulk and selling them on Gumtree and eBay. However, face masks are not recommended, except for infected people and health workers, and the main recommendation around hand hygiene is to regularly scrub hands with soap. Empty shelves in supermarkets are unlikely to remain bare for long, with major chains like Coles and Woolworths already replacing stock. A spokeswoman for Coles said the company had increased stock of long-life food and healthcare products. A Woolworths spokesman said while an increase in demand for long-life pantry items had led to partial stock shortages, these would be temporary. The health minister Greg Hunt said families should be reassured there was limited transmissibility to children and a mild impact on children it did infect. An associate professor in disaster and emergency response at Edith Cowan University, Erin Smith, said due to natural disasters that affected Australia such as bushfires, she encouraged people to think about their preparedness regardless of the coronavirus situation. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to think about the things your family would need to get by if there was a blackout for example,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s sensible and it\u2019s also practical to encourage people to be thinking about this. But we don\u2019t want panic-buying. If people rush out, prices may also increase on the limited resources left. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to go mad and go for buying months worth of supplies with nowhere to store it.\u201d",

Home lending is the normal focus when assessing whether banks have passed through the full benefit of rate cuts to their customers, but attention this time is likely to focus on loans to businesses that need relief from the coronavirus crisis. Before the announcement, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, called on the banks to pass on any rate cut in full. \u201cThere is no doubt that if the Reserve Bank were to take a decision today on cash rates that the government would absolutely expect the four big banks to come to the table and to do their bit in supporting Australians as we go through the impact of the coronavirus,\u201d he said. All four of the big banks \u2013 ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, NAB and Westpac \u2013 have told the Guardian they already have measures in place to support business customers who have taken a hit because of the crisis. Futures market traders had been banking on a cut, with ASX data showing trading on the exchange implied a 100% chance of a reduction from 0.75% to 0.5%. The probability of a cut had been tracking at between 10% and 20% last week but suddenly surged to 100% on Monday. Further out, traders expect the official cash rate to drop to 0.25% by July. Lowe has previously said that, because of the way the RBA buys and sells money at prices within a \u201ccorridor\u201d around the official rate, a cut to 0.25% would effectively mean that \u201cwe would, at that point, be dealing with zero interest rates\u201d.

However, early last month he said it was \u201cextraordinarily unlikely\u201d the measure would be needed. The RBA governor has also been clear that cuts to interest rates have nearly exhausted their ability to make a difference. Because this implies a need for the government to spend money instead, it has sparked a subterranean war between the bank and the Morrison government, which until recently has been more concerned with reaching its much-advertised budget surplus. However, Morrison has now promised a \u201cmoderate\u201d stimulus package to help the recovery of an economy already ravaged by bushfires and floods. Modelling by the veteran economist Warwick McKibbin shows the virus could slash Australia\u2019s growth by between 2% and 8% for a year, either of which would probably be enough to tip the country into recession. The outbreak has already hammered industries including tourism, education and mining that are heavily dependent on exports to China. On Tuesday, the federal government\u2019s agricultural economics unit, Abares, predicted Australia\u2019s seafood industry would take a hammering from the virus, with the value of output falling 12% this financial year, to $2.81bn. About 94% of Australia\u2019s rock lobster exports and 42% of abalone exports are to China, Abares said. It said farm production would also fall slightly due to the bushfires and the drought, dropping to $59bn from $62bn last year. Earlier on Tuesday, the Australian market opened the day up about 1.4%, its first rise after more than a week of falls caused by concerns over the economic damage caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The increase followed relief rallies on overseas markets that saw the US S&amp;P500 index soar by 4.6% and the UK\u2019s FTSE book a more modest 1.1% rise.",

The alternative would be employment and support allowance, which requires claimants to have two to three years of National Insurance contributions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b66e49d6-4e07-479e-bb6a-2a24a576d8d0\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The gig economy is based on temporary or freelance jobs. Often these are offered by app-based services like Uber or Deliveroo, where instead of a regular wage, workers get paid for the 'gigs' they do. If they aren't out working, they aren't getting paid.</p>\n    <p>Companies offering this kind of work argue that it provides people with a flexible way to be employed, whether that means doing some extra work on the side to fund studying, or to work around childcare demands.</p>\n    <p>A major drawback for workers though is the lack of protection and paid benefits such as holiday or sick pay. There are also suggestions that by the time some companies have taken a cut of payments for a service, workers aren't making the minimum wage.<br></p>\n    <p>And the roles aren't always as flexible as they first appear, with gig workers incentivised and put under pressure to work at times when a service is busier.</p>\n    <p>In 2018 the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 55 million people in the US workforce&nbsp; were 'gig workers' \u2013 more than 35% of the market.</p>\n    <p>In the UK the gig economy more than doubled in size in the three years leading up to 2019, when it&nbsp; accounted for 4.7 million workers. Up to one in seven working-age adults in the UK \u2013 about 7.5 million people \u2013 have worked via a gig economy platform at some point.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trade unions said the government\u2019s proposal was wholly inadequate, and warned that up to two million workers with no sick pay may not be able to afford to self-isolate for two weeks if they develop symptoms.</p> \n<p>They said those affected \u2013 including some care workers, hospitality staff and delivery drivers \u2013 could potentially hide their illness rather than lose pay, which could risk worsening any outbreaks.</p> \n<p>Christina McAnea, Unison assistant general secretary, said: \u201cIf they stay off work, staff need to know they have enough money to feed their families and pay rent. Waiting up to five weeks to get benefits runs the risk of them covering up symptoms.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n     <li>Advice about face masks varies.

The theoretical aim, for which there was general support across the political spectrum, was to simplify the system and increase the incentives for people to move off benefits into work. About 2 million people are currently in receipt of UC. More than 6 million will be on the benefit by the time it is fully rolled out.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How long has it been around?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The project was legislated for in 2011 under the auspices of its most vocal champion, Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith. The plan was to roll it out by 2017. However, a series of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/19/universal-credit-failings-pac-accuses-dwp\">management failures</a>, expensive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/05/universal-credit-iain-duncan-smith\">IT blunders and design faults</a>&nbsp;mean it is now seven years behind schedule, and rollout will not be complete until 2024. The government admitted that the delay was caused in part by claimants being too scared to sign up to the new benefit.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the biggest problem?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The original design set out a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2016/jun/09/debt-and-food-banks-the-legacy-of-universal-credits-long-hello\">minimum 42-day wait for a first payment</a>&nbsp;to claimants when they moved to UC (in practice this is often up to 60 days). After sustained pressure, the government announced in the autumn 2017 budget that the wait would be reduced to 35 days from February 2018. This will partially mitigate the impact on many claimants of having no income for six weeks. The wait has led to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/07/universal-credit-flaws-pushing-claimants-towards-debt-and-eviction-warning?platform=hootsuite\">rent arrears and eviction</a>s, hunger (food banks in UC areas report&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/25/food-banks-report-record-demand-amid-universal-credit-chaos\">notable increases in referrals</a>), use of expensive credit and mental distress.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Ministers have expanded the availability of hardship loans (now repayable over a year) to help new claimants while they wait for payment. Housing benefit will now continue for an extra two weeks after the start of a UC claim.

      "bodyText": "The government has been accused of failing to grasp the threat of gig economy workers spreading coronavirus, after a minister advised those with no sick pay who have to self-isolate to claim benefits instead. Downing Street is under huge pressure from trade unions and Labour to promise statutory sick pay to all workers when it unveils its coronavirus action plan, due to be published on Tuesday. But Justin Tomlinson, a work and pensions minister, said the current advice for workers with no sick pay who suspect they have the disease was to claim universal credit \u2013 which can take up to five weeks to come through. The alternative would be employment and support allowance, which requires claimants to have two to three years of National Insurance contributions. Trade unions said the government\u2019s proposal was wholly inadequate, and warned that up to two million workers with no sick pay may not be able to afford to self-isolate for two weeks if they develop symptoms. They said those affected \u2013 including some care workers, hospitality staff and delivery drivers \u2013 could potentially hide their illness rather than lose pay, which could risk worsening any outbreaks. Christina McAnea, Unison assistant general secretary, said: \u201cIf they stay off work, staff need to know they have enough money to feed their families and pay rent. Waiting up to five weeks to get benefits runs the risk of them covering up symptoms.\u201d Sue Harris, GMB legal director, added: \u201cFor workers, or the self employed, making a claim for universal credit is laborious and lengthy. If the government is serious about containing the virus it has to take steps to make sure people are able to self-isolate without the added concern of how they will pay their bills.\u201d A Downing Street source said the government was thinking about how to deal with the problem, hinting that there could be more support for those with no sick pay announced soon. But in a parliamentary answer on Monday, Tomlinson told Labour MP Alex Sobel that the current advice for gig economy and agency workers was to turn to the welfare system. \u201cThose whose employers ask them to stay away from the workplace due to coronavirus concerns, who do not qualify for Statutory Sick Pay, may be able to claim universal credit and/or new-style employment and support allowance,\u201d he said. Sobel, who himself had to self-isolate for two weeks, said the advice was \u201coutrageous\u201d and called on the government to take the situation more seriously. A government spokeswoman said hardship payments were available for people who could not afford the wait for universal credit. She added: \u201cEmployers have been urged to make sure they use their discretion and respect the medical need to self-isolate in making decisions about sick pay. \u201cAnyone not eligible to receive sick pay is able to claim universal credit and/or contributory employment and support allowance.\u201d More than a million workers in the UK gig economy on platforms such as Uber and Deliveroo face a choice of either continuing to work with symptoms that could mean they have the virus or lose all their earnings. Many are in public, highly mobile roles visiting hundreds of addresses every week delivering parcels and takeaways and carrying passengers in minicabs. \u201cSelf employed people are not eligible for sick pay,\u201d said a spokesperson for Hermes, one of the UK\u2019s largest parcel delivery firms. \u201cIf our self-employed couriers have to self-isolate we will support them in finding someone to deliver on their behalf if they do not have a substitute. Hermes will also guarantee that their rounds will be kept open for them for when they return.\u201d One courier for its rival courier giant DPD told the Guardian: \u201cPeople have all said they won\u2019t report symptoms, they will just carry on working. People never take time off DPD when they have flu and not earn any money.

But, with 150 cases now confirmed in Germany, a smiling Merkel immediately held up her hands and said: \u201cThat was the right thing to do.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"75e79d73-c9b1-4132-b0d8-b0a7e6182ce3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vvy-3x_oi84?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Coronavirus is changing social interaction, especially in the western world. Handshakes, cheek-kisses, hugs \u2013 the everyday greetings ingrained in our culture \u2013 are not as welcome as they used to be.</p> \n<p>In Italy, Angelo Borrelli, the country\u2019s special commissioner for coronavirus, has suggested that Italians\u2019 demonstrative nature could be contributing to the virus\u2019s spread, urging citizens to be \u201ca bit less expansive\u201d.</p> \n<p>Likewise in France, where the health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, has advised people to cut back on hugs and kisses, though the French president, Emmanual Macron, was seen to double-cheek kiss the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, twice during a summit in Naples on Thursday.</p> \n<p>In the UK, Public Health England has not gone quite as far. When Prof Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director for PHE, arrived at Radio 4\u2019s Today studios on Monday, presenter Mishal Husain asked if it was OK to shake hands, assuming he would say it was not.</p> \n<p>But Cosford was quite happy to, he said \u2013 though perhaps not in the future. \u201cWe do need to get to a point where we reduce social contact if we see more widespread infection,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re in the position [that] we need to continue life as normal, but we need to be prepared for the actions that we may need to take.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the meantime, good hand hygiene is the key message.</p> \n<p>\u201cScience says shaking hands is disgusting,\u201d Nicky Milner, director of medical education at Anglia Ruskin university told the Guardian. She pointed to <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/today/2008/11/03/women-have-more-diverse-hand-bacteria-men-according-cu-boulder-study\">research showing </a>on average we carry 3,200 bacteria from 150 different species on our hands. On average, we will shake hands 15,000 times in our life time, she said.</p> \n<p>A handshake transfers twice the amount of bacteria compared to the quicker fist-pump or high-five. \u201cIf you\u2019re shaking hands, you tend to put your palms together and wrap your fingers around. Whereas, when you minimise the contact between the skin, you have a small surface area in which there are micro-organisms, so transfer fewer. It\u2019s all probability,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The Japanese bow, the Thai \u201cway, where palms are pressed together in prayer-like fashion, are all healthier\u201d, she added. \u201cIn Ethiopia, they touch your elbow, then you bang opposite shoulders.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet, she cannot see such greetings becoming commonplace here in the UK. \u201cThe challenge would be the cultural shift.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the UK, the handshake is formal. It\u2019s professional. It\u2019s used in meeting and greeting. It closes business. It\u2019s such a powerful procedure that we perform. It\u2019s not just about saying hello. So that brings us back to good hand hygiene.\u201d</p> \n<p>The World Health Organization\u2019s director of pandemic disease, Sylvie Brand, meanwhile,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/01/coronavirus-latest-updates-coronavirus-live-updates-latest-news-china-wuhan-stock-markets-update-china-iran-us-australia-south-korea-japan?page=with:block-5e5be8418f086a28115b58c3#block-5e5be8418f086a28115b58c3\"> has endorsed the elbow bump, footshakes, waves and the \u201cwai\u201d as safer alternatives to shaking hands.</a></p> \n<p>Dr Adam Kucharski, associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, researches how social behaviour and immunity shapes disease transmission. On reducing handshakes and kisses, he said: \u201cObviously all these things can reduce transmission, but there\u2019s no one quick fix\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are doing a lot of modelling, and others are, to try to understand what combination [of measures] would have what effect on an outbreak.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf this becomes an outbreak, it\u2019s not going to be a matter of people making one small change to their behaviour. It\u2019s going to be series of changes across a number of aspects to their behaviour.\u201d Awareness of and modifying interaction with vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, was crucial, he said.</p> \n<p>As more people begin changing their behaviour, church communities are among those taking precautions. Congregants with coughs and flu symptoms are advised to refrain from the \u201csign of peace\u201dhandshake, and to receive the communion host in their hands, rather than on their tongues.</p> \n<p>Many Catholic priests are already choosing to deliver the host this way for all parishioners, the church said. The sign of peace would be suspended in the event of confirmed coronavirus case in any congregation. Meanwhile the Church of England advice to those with cold and flu symptoms is to refrain from taking wine from the common cup.</p> \n<p>Social <a href=\"https://jobryant.com/etiquette/\">etiquette consultant Jo Bryant,</a> believes the UK may have a slight advantage over its European nations, \u201cbecause we are a non-tactile nation, and we do like our personal space\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is new territory for etiquette,\u201d she said, advising people to \u201chang back a little\u201d, before they go in for the big handshake.</p> \n<p>Her advice: Take time, hang back, look at how the other person is approaching the interaction as well, \u201cand between the two of you, work it out\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, extended her hand to her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, at a meeting on Monday, he refused her handshake and waved her away. Pre-coronavirus, his gesture would have been the epitome of bad manners. But, with 150 cases now confirmed in Germany, a smiling Merkel immediately held up her hands and said: \u201cThat was the right thing to do.\u201d Coronavirus is changing social interaction, especially in the western world. Handshakes, cheek-kisses, hugs \u2013 the everyday greetings ingrained in our culture \u2013 are not as welcome as they used to be. In Italy, Angelo Borrelli, the country\u2019s special commissioner for coronavirus, has suggested that Italians\u2019 demonstrative nature could be contributing to the virus\u2019s spread, urging citizens to be \u201ca bit less expansive\u201d. Likewise in France, where the health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, has advised people to cut back on hugs and kisses, though the French president, Emmanual Macron, was seen to double-cheek kiss the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, twice during a summit in Naples on Thursday. In the UK, Public Health England has not gone quite as far. When Prof Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director for PHE, arrived at Radio 4\u2019s Today studios on Monday, presenter Mishal Husain asked if it was OK to shake hands, assuming he would say it was not. But Cosford was quite happy to, he said \u2013 though perhaps not in the future. \u201cWe do need to get to a point where we reduce social contact if we see more widespread infection,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re in the position [that] we need to continue life as normal, but we need to be prepared for the actions that we may need to take.\u201d In the meantime, good hand hygiene is the key message. \u201cScience says shaking hands is disgusting,\u201d Nicky Milner, director of medical education at Anglia Ruskin university told the Guardian. She pointed to research showing on average we carry 3,200 bacteria from 150 different species on our hands. On average, we will shake hands 15,000 times in our life time, she said. A handshake transfers twice the amount of bacteria compared to the quicker fist-pump or high-five. \u201cIf you\u2019re shaking hands, you tend to put your palms together and wrap your fingers around. Whereas, when you minimise the contact between the skin, you have a small surface area in which there are micro-organisms, so transfer fewer. It\u2019s all probability,\u201d she said. The Japanese bow, the Thai \u201cway, where palms are pressed together in prayer-like fashion, are all healthier\u201d, she added. \u201cIn Ethiopia, they touch your elbow, then you bang opposite shoulders.\u201d Yet, she cannot see such greetings becoming commonplace here in the UK. \u201cThe challenge would be the cultural shift.\u201d \u201cIn the UK, the handshake is formal. It\u2019s professional. It\u2019s used in meeting and greeting. It closes business. It\u2019s such a powerful procedure that we perform. It\u2019s not just about saying hello. So that brings us back to good hand hygiene.\u201d The World Health Organization\u2019s director of pandemic disease, Sylvie Brand, meanwhile, has endorsed the elbow bump, footshakes, waves and the \u201cwai\u201d as safer alternatives to shaking hands. Dr Adam Kucharski, associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, researches how social behaviour and immunity shapes disease transmission. On reducing handshakes and kisses, he said: \u201cObviously all these things can reduce transmission, but there\u2019s no one quick fix\u201d. \u201cWe are doing a lot of modelling, and others are, to try to understand what combination [of measures] would have what effect on an outbreak. \u201cIf this becomes an outbreak, it\u2019s not going to be a matter of people making one small change to their behaviour. It\u2019s going to be series of changes across a number of aspects to their behaviour.\u201d Awareness of and modifying interaction with vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, was crucial, he said. As more people begin changing their behaviour, church communities are among those taking precautions. Congregants with coughs and flu symptoms are advised to refrain from the \u201csign of peace\u201dhandshake, and to receive the communion host in their hands, rather than on their tongues. Many Catholic priests are already choosing to deliver the host this way for all parishioners, the church said. The sign of peace would be suspended in the event of confirmed coronavirus case in any congregation. Meanwhile the Church of England advice to those with cold and flu symptoms is to refrain from taking wine from the common cup. Social etiquette consultant Jo Bryant, believes the UK may have a slight advantage over its European nations, \u201cbecause we are a non-tactile nation, and we do like our personal space\u201d. \u201cThis is new territory for etiquette,\u201d she said, advising people to \u201chang back a little\u201d, before they go in for the big handshake. Her advice: Take time, hang back, look at how the other person is approaching the interaction as well, \u201cand between the two of you, work it out\u201d.",

What\u2019s more, long after the office block is demolished, that trained and educated person produces future generations of educated producers. The government suggests it may change the rules to borrow for human capital investment. Despite the orthodoxy, there is no fixed limit to what the state can borrow. Ex-chancellor George Osborne swore Britain would go bust if it lost its triple-A credit rating. He lost it, but nothing happened. His \u201cLabour maxed out the credit card\u201d line was highly persuasive to families well used to that fear, but a nonsense for governments borrowing over the long term at rock-bottom interest rates. Only strong government investment can fend off today\u2019s gathering storms and spur the austerity-stricken economy. Levelling up needs not just northern infrastructure but massive human capital investment, as the UK has one of the least educated populations among similar countries. Boris Johnson, in Churchill mode, could call for a patriotic budget to build climate defences, repair national flood damage, and prepare for the economic shocks of Brexit and coronavirus. Rousing the national spirit, he could call on the broadest shoulders to carry the heaviest tax burden in the national interest, tapping the wealth of those barely touched by the great crash of 2008 while the rest lost out for a decade. That\u2019s something most easily done by a Tory government. But why would it? For all the \u201causterity is over\u201d promises, don\u2019t hold your breath. Expect token hi-vis building projects, but little to fill the black hole created by the great austerity. This government is not Keynesian: the nature of the beast will still be thoroughly Tory. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

The government is failing to grasp the threat of gig economy workers spreading coronavirus by continuing to work because they don\u2019t get sick pay and can\u2019t afford unpaid time off, unions say. They number more than a million, and many visit hundreds of addresses every week delivering parcels and takeaways and carrying passengers in minicabs. The government has suggested they should claim benefits but that involves delays and not all would be eligible. Uber has told drivers with symptoms to stay at home but did not reply when asked how it would compensate them. In our latest wrap-up of the global situation: South Korea has declared \u201cwar\u201d on Covid-19 after recording 600 new infections, while the WHO chief has said the world is in \u201cuncharted territory\u201d but the pathogen can be contained with the right measures. At home: UK supermarkets have drawn up \u201cfeed the nation\u201d contingency plans to cope with any panic-buying, including scaling back the variety of foods and groceries available, instead focusing on maintaining supplies of staple products. Depending on how things play out, government emergency measures might include stopping mass gatherings and even a \u201clockdown\u201d of cities, with police and the army on patrol \u2013 but experts say the UK is a long way from such a scenario. A music teacher is among the three latest coronavirus cases confirmed in the UK, with the total number standing at 39. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been forced to redraw next week\u2019s budget to focus on shoring up the economy against the impact of coronavirus. Now, thank goodness for some lighter subject matter \u2013 a guide to foot-shakes and elbow-bumps as social protocols are adjusted round the world to avoid catching or spreading Covid-19. More at our live blog. * * * Not your average Tuesday \u2013 Today is Super Tuesday in the US, with 14 states (and American Samoa) to vote on who should be the Democrats\u2019 nominee against Donald Trump in the presidential election. They include California, the most populous state. Amy Klobuchar, the moderate senator from Minnesota, has dropped out of the race overnight and moved to endorse Joe Biden. Recent days\u2019 polling has shown a tightening race between Bernie Sanders and Biden \u2013 the former is currently ahead in the delegate count for the party convention, but centrist Democrats have been flocking to support the latter. * * * Trade deal is Trump change \u2013 The British economy would be at most 0.16% larger by the middle of the next decade under a comprehensive trade deal with the US, the government has admitted, laying bare the limited benefits of striking an agreement with Donald Trump. A Department for International Trade (DIT) document says the British economy stood to benefit from an \u201cambitious and comprehensive\u201d trade deal to the tune of only a fraction of GDP, equivalent to \u00a33.4bn after 15 years. Economists warned benefits would be far outstripped by losses from crashing out of the EU. * * * Bibi ahead \u2013 Benjamin Netanyahu and his rightwing allies are ahead in the Israeli election but are still one seat short of the majority needed to form a government. Exit polls from the third election in a year show that the prime minister\u2019s Likud party will win around 37 seats but that his coalition will fall short of the 61 needed for power. His opponent, Benny Gantz, leader of the Blue and White party, is predicted to win about 33 seats after a campaign focused on Netanyahu\u2019s upcoming criminal corruption trial. Netanyahu was triumphal at a party rally: \u201cWe stood in front of strong forces. They told us we are going to lose, that it was the end of the Netanyahu era. We turned lemons into lemonade.\u201d * * * Abuse bill \u2013 The government is understood to be examining ways to stop the use of the \u201crough sex\u201d defence in courts, as a long-awaited domestic abuse bill has its first reading in the Commons. The bill also includes plans to force abusers to take lie detector tests where they are deemed at high risk of causing serious harm. The legislation pledges to ban perpetrators from cross-examining their victims in court and could require councils to find safe accommodation for victims and their children. Perpetrators may be forced to take part in alcohol or drug treatment programmes. * * * \u2018Time of floods and fires\u2019 \u2013 The former BBC and Sky weather presenter Francis Wilson has said TV forecasters have a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to tell their audience that the \u201ctime of floods and fires\u201d the world is experiencing is caused by global heating: \u201cWe need to tell people to stop warming the atmosphere, to stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. That way, viewers won\u2019t lose sight of the fact that they can actually do something about it.\u201d Humans are missing out on almost three years of life expectancy because of outdoor air pollution, say researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, but more than a year could be clawed back if fossil fuel emissions were cut to zero, while cutting all controllable air pollution would gain us more than 20 months. * * * Just not cricket \u2013 Village cricketers had to play two seasons in exile and fund a \u201ctrajectory report\u201d on where their balls might land after Shropshire council failed to consult properly before allowing a house to be built on the fringes of their home ground. Describing as \u201cinjustice\u201d the treatment of Hinstock cricket club, the ombudsman has ordered the council to build and maintain a 15-metre-high boundary fence to allow it to return to its home ground. And the council is paying for the trajectory report too. Today in Focus podcast: All eyes on Super Tuesday The Guardian US political correspondent Lauren Gambino looks at which Democratic candidates are likely to dominate as we reach Super Tuesday \u2013 the biggest moment in the US election calendar apart from polling day itself. And: Polly Toynbee on the shock resignation of the Home Office permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam. Lunchtime read: Rise and fall of Greece\u2019s neo-Nazis A decade ago, the violent racist movement Golden Dawn exploited a national crisis and entered mainstream politics in Greece. The party has since been caught up in the biggest trial of Nazis since Nuremberg, and is now crumbling \u2013 but its success remains a warning. Also today, our new series This is Europe examines the factors in the rise of the far right and doubling of support for Eurosceptic parties. Sport A Six Nations TV paywall would cut the cord to thousands of rugby fans, and taking live audiences for granted in return for \u00a3300m is a huge gamble for a sport with a skinny link to the public, writes Robert Kitson. England\u2019s hopes of clinching the Six Nations title in Italy this month remain alive after tournament organisers decided against postponing any further matches owing to the coronavirus outbreak. Wales are holding their breath over the availability of the fly-half Dan Biggar for their match at Twickenham on Saturday after his club coach Chris Boyd said they must \u201cwait and see\u201d if he will be fit. With the outcome of their season hinging on their progress in the FA Cup, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta saw his faith in youth rewarded by a clinical away victory over Portsmouth. The season-opening Formula One race in Australia will go ahead despite the increasing threat from the coronavirus, organisers have stated. England\u2019s cricketers will swap handshakes for fist bumps in Sri Lanka as they look to steer clear of any illnesses and make advances in the World Test Championship. Australia\u2019s bid to win a fifth Women\u2019s Twenty20 World Cup suffered a blow with all-rounder Ellyse Perry ruled out of the remainder of the tournament due to a serious hamstring injury. And Ian Poulter has led a backlash against comments made by Paul Azinger, accusing the US TV commentator of showing \u201cdisrespect\u201d by disparaging the European Tour. Business Global shares and oil prices have extended their rebound with policymakers around the world moving to ease economic fallout from coronavirus. The latest to move was the Reserve Bank of Australia, which cut its main interest rate to a new record low of 0.5% overnight. The improved confidence supported US S&amp;P 500 futures, which rose 0.5% in early Asian trade on Tuesday, a day after the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.60%, the biggest gain since December 2018.

This is one of the reasons why the vegan designer Stella McCartney has used the fabric in place of leather in her footwear. When worn best, the oppositional qualities between the natural world and artificial fetishwear \u2013 are displayed to full effect. Think of Lady Gaga meeting the Queen in in a red puffed-sleeved latex dress and Beyonc\u00e9 walking the Met Gala red carpet in 2016 in a soft pink, floral, Atsuko Kudo X Givenchy latex dress. Madonna wore it in her \u201cS&amp;M Hollywood Squares\u201d video in 1994 as a way of silencing those who had slut-shamed her for the Sex Book and Erotica. It was a deliberate nod to the subversive and shocking nature of latex \u2013 and the sexual freedom it evokes. \u201cGood design evinces an aesthetic response,\u201d says Tyler. This is exactly what latex does: disrupts sartorial norms and creates controversy. And now, thanks to the Paris runways and Kim Kardashian West, it is an insurgent fabric once again.",

But what I do know is that you didn\u2019t really give a straight answer. When asked about it, you dismissed it as gossip.

It\u2019s probably the single largest church organisation that is known in the United States. </p> <p>And so, Brian Houston actually turned up to the White House a few months later at the invitation directly of the White House. </p> <p><strong>On that occasion, we put forward a number of names that included Brian</strong>, but not everybody whose names we put forward were invited. </p> <p>But the point about this is, I mean, they\u2019re a very large church. I mean, well known in the United States, and a lot of people in the United States came along to the services every week. </p> <p><strong>So I\u2019m not quite sure what the accusation is about that.</strong></p> <p><strong>Fordham</strong>: It was relevant because, as it turns out, he was under police investigation, and he still is, according to New South Wales police. Would it be fair to say you weren\u2019t aware of that, at the things I followed closely?</p> <p><strong>Morrison: </strong>All I know is that they\u2019re a very large and very well-attended and well-supported organisation here in Australia. </p> <p>And, you know, they\u2019re very well known in the United States, so well known that Brian was actually at the White House a few months after I was. <strong>So the president obviously didn\u2019t have an issue with it.</strong></p> <p>And that\u2019s what, I think, that\u2019s where the matter rests.</p> <p>But honestly, people chased this round and round for months and what\u2019s important is the relationship we have with the United States and it\u2019s never been better. </p> </blockquote> <p>It is worth noting that while Houston did appear at the White House with other religious leaders, he did not meet <strong>Donald Trump</strong>.

To summarise, the ABC will have to absorb cumulative budget cuts that amount to $105.9m per annum by the time we reach the 2022 financial year. This is an extraordinary strain on our ability to meet community expectations.</p> <p><strong>At this point it is not possible to absorb further cuts without an impact on jobs and services.</strong></p> <p>Which brings me to the savings challenge the ABC is faced with.

The Labor senator <strong>Katy Gallagher</strong> is drawing on evidence the ANAO gave last night about correspondence between <strong>Bridget McKenzie\u2019s</strong> office and the prime minister\u2019s office about the proposed grants. </p> <p>The ANAO said last night that at 12.35pm on 11 April (which was after the caretaker convention took effect) McKenzie\u2019s office sent another spreadsheet to the PMO with a different allocation of funds: one project had been deleted and nine were added. </p> <p>After that, a final brief went to Sports Australia at 12.43pm. Background: Previously we were only aware that McKenzie\u2019s office had communicated with the PMO on the 10 April (sending a brief that had been signed off on 4 April); and that brief had gone to Sports Australia early on the day where the parliament was prorogued. </p> <p>Gallagher wants to know whether <strong>Mathias Cormann</strong> needs to adjust any of the evidence he gave in estimates yesterday, given what the ANAO said last night. </p> <p>Cormann says he does not need to do that. He tells the committee he checked during a lunch break yesterday with McKenzie whether she signed the final brief on 4 April. (Labor has been asking, given all the traffic back and forwards between the PMO and McKenzie\u2019s office just before the election was called, whether McKenzie might have backdated the brief after having made a final decision during caretaker mode.)</p> <p>Cormann says McKenzie told him the brief was signed on 4 April \u2013 \u201cno ifs or buts\u201d. </p> <p>He signals the brief might have taken a couple of days to get to Sports Australia because she was travelling. </p> <p>As for himself: \u201cI had no involvement and no visibility over the sports grants decisions made by Senator McKenzie.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T01:08:02.351Z\">at 1.08am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5daa628f08e1332474e084\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T00:53:12.213Z\">12.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Chris Moraitis</strong>, the secretary of the Attorney General\u2019s Department, confirms it has been working for \u201cat least two years\u201d on a bill for a national integrity commission, although the first version of the bill was only produced in January 2019 because it is a \u201cmassive undertaking\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Marise Payne</strong>, who is representing the attorney general in estimates, said the government wants to \u201cenhance national integrity arrangements across the federal public sector\u201d and suggests the exposure draft legislation will be released this year.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/17/christian-porter-admits-coalition-missed-own-deadline-on-integrity-commission-legislation\">AG has admitted</a> he missed his own deadline to release it by the end of last year.<br>Payne said the government doesn\u2019t want to engage in \u201cpolicy on the run\u201d, so <strong>Murray Watt </strong>quips it is instead \u201cpolicy in the slow lane\u201d \u2013 especially when contrasted with the bill to increase penalties for putting needles in strawberries.<strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>Sarah Chidgey</strong>, the department\u2019s deputy secretary of the integrity and international group, said it has written an exposure draft bill but \u201cfinal decisions are to be made\u201d by the AG about its release.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T00:58:55.277Z\">at 12.58am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5da9a08f0811db2fb026f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T00:51:41.803Z\">12.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labor has also examined the number of family law and domestic violence reports and recommendations the government has received.</p> <p>It puts the count at six reports in five years, with 180 recommendations still to be either responded to or put into action, including the Australian Law Reform Commission Family Law System review which was handed down in March 2019.</p> <p>It\u2019s cool though. <strong>Pauline Hanson</strong> and <strong>Kevin Andrews</strong> are leading another review into the family law system, which will definitely fix it.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T00:57:53.629Z\">at 12.57am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5da8f28f086a28115b6684\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T00:48:26.257Z\">12.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in legal affairs estimates, officials have admitted the government has now been working on some sort of federal integrity bill for two years.</p> <p>No draft legislation has been produced.

I mean, we had <strong>Kristina Keneally</strong> yesterday accusing the former minister <strong>Bridget McKenzie</strong> of forging a document \u2013 I mean, accusing Bridget McKenzie under parliamentary privilege in a Senate estimates committee of a serious criminal offence with absolutely no evidence whatsoever.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jayes: </strong>But didn\u2019t we learn yesterday, attorney general. Sorry to interrupt, but didn\u2019t we learn yesterday that the prime minister changed the projects in round three of this funding scheme on the day the election was called? That stinks, doesn\u2019t it?</p> <p><strong>Porter:</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well again, your characterisation of it relies on what I\u2019ve got to say is assertions made by Labor members which don\u2019t actually bear out to the facts. On 4 April the decision by the minister was made. Now, that was clearly the case. You\u2019ve now got Labor [shadow] ministers accusing the minister of backdating that decision-making document \u2013 like, forging a document. They\u2019re accusing the minister \u2026</p> </blockquote> <p>Pressed on whether backdating briefs ever happens, Porter says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, it clearly did not happen here \u2013 the minister has quite clearly said that that\u2019s not the case. But you know, Laura, surely it\u2019s a matter of some seriousness when parliamentary privilege is used by Kristina Keneally<strong> </strong>to accuse a former minister of a criminal offence with zero evidence. And they\u2019ve got form here. The Labor party and <strong>Mark Dreyfus </strong>have overseen 10 referrals of government ministers to law enforcement agencies for investigation for criminal offences, with zero results \u2026</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jayes: </strong>As a lawyer you must be \u2013 have been embarrassed by some of the flimsy arguments that have been put forward by your side of politics as well?</p> <p><strong>Porter: </strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, the Sports grant program was run in accordance with the guideline. Now, people might take views about whether or not ministers should assert their own views as to the merit of programs over and above the views of the department. I happen to think that that is a fair and reasonable process. But I understand that people might have different views about that process.</p> <p> But allegations of criminal conduct by minsters with no evidence whatsoever to support that allegation, to me that\u2019s the problem that\u2019s emerging here. I mean, how many times does the Labor party have to make a false allegation, totally unsupported by evidence; refer it to the police, and it doesn\u2019t get investigated \u2013 for that to be an actual issue?

Come Thursday, there will be a two-week break in between sittings, then parliament returns for one week before a six-week hiatus. That\u2019s a mess of numbers \u2013 basically, there are six sitting days left until the budget is handed down in May. Not that there is a lot of legislation to discuss. Last week, the Coalition party room was shown three pieces of legislation for debate. This week it was two. The Senate isn\u2019t sitting, but still. It shows you just how empty the legislation cupboard is at the moment. And that the government is working very hard on that small-target strategy. Estimates continues tomorrow, and we will bring you all of that and more. A big thank you to Mike Bowers, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and Katharine Murphy. We are all thinking of our next-door colleagues, AAP, as we finish up today. It\u2019s a blow, not just to the industry at large but also to some very, very good people, who kept reporting even as they learned they\u2019d lost their jobs. We\u2019ll see you tomorrow morning. Take care of you. Donald Trump seems to be a fan of the Reserve Bank. I am still fuming over a senator \u2013 who \u201cdidn\u2019t believe\u201d he could be British, because he didn\u2019t feel British, ahead of the high court ruling that, yes, no matter his feelings, he was, under citizenship law, actually still British \u2013 demanding \u201cempirical evidence\u201d on anything. Kristina Keneally has put together a list of questions not answered by the Australian federal police during estimates, in terms of the Angus Taylor investigation: The AFP decided in February to discontinue the Taylor investigation. However, when questioned in Estimates about that decision and the investigation, the AFP could not answer the following questions: Did the AFP determine if the documents are a forgery? Who doctored the documents? Who downloaded the documents? When were the documents downloaded, including resolving conflicting dates from minister Taylor, whose office claimed to the Daily Telegraph that the documents were downloaded on 6 September but who said in a subsequent public statement that the documents were \u201caccessed\u201d on 9 September? Is there any evidence to support Mr Taylor\u2019s claims in public \u2013 including on the ABC\u2019s 7.30 last night \u2013 and in the parliament that the document he gave to the Daily Telegraph once existed on the City of Sydney\u2019s website? Is there any evidence that a member of Mr Taylor\u2019s staff, or any person linked to Mr Taylor, was involved in falsifying information? Did the AFP review the City of Sydney\u2019s metadata that shows that both the PDF and Word versions of the annual report have not been altered, changed or removed since they were uploaded in November 2018? Did the AFP review the City of Sydney\u2019s Google analytics data that showed there were only 13 direct downloads of the annual report from the City of Sydney website between 6-9 September? Did the AFP determine the location of the IP addresses for the 13 direct downloads of the annual report from the City of Sydney website between 6-9 September? Did the AFP determine if other methods of downloading the document occurred? For example, did the AFP examine if minister Taylor or any member of Mr Taylor\u2019s office visited the direct URL to the PDF or Word file version of the document, or shared the document via email or some kind of electronic messaging service? Did the AFP access emails and other electronic messages that the government, including Mr Taylor\u2019s own staff, have withheld from Freedom of Information requests? Did the AFP interview any of Angus Taylor\u2019s staff, including Mr Josh Manuatu? Did the AFP interview any Department of Environment staff? Did the AFP interview any of the Sydney lord mayor\u2019s staff? Did the AFP interview any of the City of Sydney staff? Why did the NSW police refer this matter to the AFP? What brief of evidence did the NSW police provide to the AFP with their referral? And the exchange itself: Murray Watt: (Quotes from Asio briefing.) Are you familiar with this information? Rosalind Croucher : Yes. Watt: (Quote about online forums promoting rightwing extremism.) Do you have any comment on that report in light of your own knowledge of rightwing extremism in Australia? Croucher: Certainly they are a matter of concern. Our national anti-racism strategy aims to deal with this. Chin Tan is the best person to answer this ... And ask Ed Santow about anti-terror laws. Watt: What\u2019s your perspective on those comments from Mr Burgess and your concerns? Ed Santow: We acknowledge that Asio and other agencies are the primary experts on this. We advise on legislative responses. Watt: Have you provided advice to government in recent times about the threat of rightwing extremism? Santow: Not specifically on rightwing extremism, but on terrorism more generally. Watt: Whether by reference to complaints to the AHRC or other means, are there any trends you can see re rightwing extremism? Croucher: Most of our complaints are about disability. Only a few are about extremism. Watt: Asio was not identifying a new threat, just an increase in the threat. Stoker: Yesterday we said it should be referred to as \u201cfar-right extremism\u201d. Watt: Why are you so defensive? Surely the term \u201cextremism\u201d provides a sufficient distinction? Stoker: We\u2019re not sensitive! I give the call to [senator] Henderson. Watt: You are a right-wing extremist. Stoker: Withdraw that! Watt: OK. Labor\u2019s Murray Watt has asked the Australian Human Rights Commission about rightwing extremism, after Asio\u2019s evidence it is on the rise. Commission president Rosalind Croucher said its anti-racism work was directed at \u201crightwing extreme views\u201d. Human rights commissioner Ed Santow said Asio and other law-enforcement agencies \u201care the primary experts on the nature and scope of threats to national security\u201d but the commission did advise the government on the legislative response. The Liberal chair, Amanda Stoker, asked Watt to refer to \u201cfar-right extremism\u201d instead of \u201crightwing extremism\u201d and noted that Asio prefers this term. This sparked a to-and-fro between the pair, with Watt accusing her of dictating how he asked questions and referring to her as \u201ccommandant Stoker\u201d. Watt suggested Stoker was sensitive because of her attendance at the conference of CPAC, a conservative US outfit transplanted to Australia which caused controversy in August. Stoker rejected the suggestion, saying she was \u201cnot sensitive, loved the conference, [it\u2019s] not a problem\u201d. Eventually Watt continued to bait Stoker, so she gave the call to Liberal Sarah Henderson, which Watt suggested proved the point that rightwing extremism was growing. He withdrew the remark. Over in estimates, Murray Watt and Amanda Stoker (who is chasing the conservative branch member vote in Queensland as she fights for her Senate spot against James McGrath) have gone head to head in the human rights section of the hearing Ed Husic on Scott Morrison\u2019s Brian Houston admission (speaking to the ABC) This is a pattern of behaviour from this Prime Minister when he belittles people asking legitimate straightforward questions. He stonewalls, takes his time, hopes it disappears, in the middle of something else going on, decides then to drop it, in one interview he does with 2GB and thinks he can get away with it. This is repeated in other major issues. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good enough. It shows you this sort of arrogance that\u2019s crept into the way he does this job. Tim Wilson on the same topic (short answer, nothing to see here) I mean, he\u2019s not avoiding it.It\u2019s putting forward a proposition that people are saying lots of things. In the end, he made it clear what has actually happened. I think frankly everyone else is focused on much more substantive issues like the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus and the challenges that Australians are facing. Discussion central in QT today: Except when it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry, Amy can\u2019t come to the blog right now. Why? Oh, she smashed her head against the desk so hard it is rolling down the parliament lawns. You\u2019ll find it lolling against the stupid, unnecessary fence. Paul Fletcher is now on Afternoon Briefing with Patricia Karvelas, where he talks about AAP closing down: Well, obviously, very troubling for the journalists who are affected and certainly my sympathies are with them. It\u2019s a response to the trends that are applying to the media and communications sector. It\u2019s a global sector, it\u2019s a digital sector, some types of content are struggling, other types of content are booming. Streaming services are booming. So businesses\u2019 media and communications sector are seeking to reposition themselves, building in areas that are growing and reallocate resources from other areas. We\u2019ve seen that in the results in recent weeks from the TV and integrated media companies, Nine Entertainment Limited, talking about their share of business, their growing share of business now coming from digital. These are trends that media and communications companies are responding to, with a view to surviving, and indeed prospering, by going into growth and withdrawing resources from the areas not growing so strongly. You know what started this? Ending the competition laws for the media space. Not doing anything about Facebook and Google ripping off stories did this. But sure \u2013 go off, Fletcher. I want to scream. The Law Council of Australia has issued a statement on the legal powers to detain and control people to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The council\u2019s president, Pauline Wright, said: We absolutely support action by the government to keep Australia safe and stop the spread of potentially dangerous infectious diseases. However, powers under the Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cth) are extraordinary and must be approached with the utmost caution and should only be used as a last resort. The exceptional powers under the act do not have the types of safeguards and independent oversight protections afforded to our law enforcement and security agencies\u2019 exercise of coercive powers. The determination of a particular disease as a listed human disease (LHD) can have significant repercussions under the bill, particularly in relation to control orders. While control orders in cases of infectious disease may be justified, there is no requirement for a person to actually be infected or for the officer to even reasonably believe or suspect that the person is infected, or may be infected, with a LHD, before a control order can be made. Control orders can potentially have a significant impact upon a person\u2019s liberty as they can, for example, require isolation or restricted movement measures to be in place. While the use of such a power may be necessary to limit the spread of potentially dangerous infectious diseases, the threshold for determining a LHD and then for imposing a control order needs to be carefully considered to ensure it achieves this purpose based on reasonable grounds. Richard Marles was on Afternoon Briefing, where Patricia Karvelas asked him about Scott Morrison\u2019s Brian Houston admission: Ultimately, the prime minister is not a straight shooter. That\u2019s the only thing you can make from this. It\u2019s good he answered the question, he should\u2019ve answered it a few months ago. In your introduction, you made the point absolutely. When he was asked about this a few months ago, he said this was just gossip. Now he accepts this is actually true. When he said it was gossip, he hasn\u2019t been straight within the Australian people. That\u2019s been the hallmark of Scott Morrison since he\u2019s been the prime minister of the country. If he\u2019s asked a difficult question, he will always double down, and the truth is not his friend. Karvelas: He has confirmed it now, he has been straight with people now. Does it matter he sought to invite the Hillsong pastor Brian Houston? Marles: That\u2019s a matter for his judgment. When we were asking the question last year, it\u2019s reasonable the Australian people get to see the judgements the prime minister makes. It\u2019s a matter for him to justify the steps he took in relation to that invitation. The critical point: last year he said this was gossip. When he said that, he was not being straight with the Australian people. What we are seeing with sports rorts and a matter of other things, when he\u2019s put in a difficult position, he does not tell the truth. Australians are seeing that now. Holy moly \u2013 I am being told there are four nuns in the gallery at the moment. Seems about right, given the way today is going. Labor shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers has held a press conference to accuse Scott Morrison of \u201cinaction and incompetence\u201d for refusing to stimulate the economy when the RBA and others were asking for it, well before the coronavirus outbreak. Coronavirus \u201cmight explain\u201d the fourth rate cut since the start of 2019 but \u201cnot the first three\u201d, Chalmers said, and the outbreak \u201cdoesn\u2019t explain or excuse the weakness\u201d evident in the economy for a while. Rate cuts have meant that savers have \u201ccopped it in the neck\u201d and have also \u201cpuffed up asset prices\u201d, he said. Chalmers noted the Reserve Bank doesn\u2019t want to resort to quantitative easing, but has had to contemplate itbecause the government is \u201csitting on its hands\u201d. He said he will not speculate on the national accounts out tomorrow, or whether Australia is headed for recession, although investment has been \u201cclearly quite weak\u201d. NAB has also announced it will pass on the rate cut, leaving just ANZ to make an announcement. Scott Morrison on 5 December: Richard Marles: My question is to the prime minister: why does the prime minister believe that he shouldn\u2019t be subject to the normal rules of integrity and accountability, demonstrated by his failure to answer questions about why he prevented any member from speaking on his union-bashing bill today, why he has repeatedly misled the parliament, why he interfered in a New South Wales police investigation into one of his own ministers, why he was sacked as CEO of Tourism Australia and why he invited his mentor Brian Houston to the White House? Scott Morrison: The Labor party like to talk big about these issues but when it comes to calling them to account and asking them to outlaw thuggish and bullying behaviour in this country, this is their reaction: smears, accusations and even attacking people\u2019s faith. I\u2019m not intimidated by the leader of the opposition or any of the Labor party members. Scott Morrison on 14 October: Richard Marles: Why won\u2019t the prime minister give a straight answer to this question: did the prime minister or his office seek to have Brian Houston invited to the White House? After initially refusing to comment on the story, deriding it as \u201cgossip\u201d, Morrison told parliament the invitations were handled by the White House and it was \u201ca matter for the White House\u201d. I think the Australian people are more interested in who Jamie Clements was inviting to dinner, and how much cash was in the wine bag,\u201d Morrison said, in reference to revelations about illegal Chinese donations made to the NSW branch of the Labor party. ... If they are suggesting anything serious, or casting any aspersions on the individual which is the subject of the question, then perhaps I suggest they go and attend that church and they explain their concerns directly to their parishioners. Scott Morrison on 2 September: PM: No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful, David. I mean there\u2019s one unpublished source, comment, coming out of allegedly\u2026\u201d David Speers: But you can clarify this? PM: Well, I don\u2019t feel the need to comment on those things, David, I really don\u2019t. If people want to put their \u2013 Speers: But why is that, though? PM: Because, David, I\u2019m not going to go into the habit of just because one journalist somewhere in the world talks to someone who won\u2019t put their name to it, and all of a sudden apparently we\u2019ve got to play \u201c20 questions\u201d. That\u2019s just not how I\u2019m going operate. If people have an established source who\u2019s prepared to put their names to things, well that\u2019s a different matter. But today, it\u2019s no big deal. Ben Fordham: Let me clear something up with you because I promised my listeners I would including some people who had been sadly victims of child sexual abuse and I\u2019ve got to keep my promise to them. It relates to your trip to Washington last year and whether or not you asked the Trump administration to invite the Hillsong founder Brian Houston to the White House state dinner. Now the reason this is of interest is because Brian Houston is under investigation by New South Wales police for not reporting child sex abuse allegations involving his father. Now this may have been a case of you not knowing at the time that Brian Houston was under investigation, I don\u2019t know. But what I do know is that you didn\u2019t really give a straight answer. When asked about it, you dismissed it as gossip. So I wanted to clear it up once and for all and keep the promise that I made to my listeners: did you seek an invitation to the White House for Brian Houston? Scott Morrison: I\u2019ve known Brian for a long time and Hillsong Church has a very big network of churches all across the United States and the ministry when it comes to the music, and so many other things have been very big. It\u2019s probably the single largest church organisation that is known in the United States. And so, Brian Houston actually turned up to the White House a few months later at the invitation directly of the White House. On that occasion, we put forward a number of names that included Brian, but not everybody whose names we put forward were invited. But the point about this is, I mean, they\u2019re a very large church. I mean, well known in the United States, and a lot of people in the United States came along to the services every week. So I\u2019m not quite sure what the accusation is about that. Fordham: It was relevant because, as it turns out, he was under police investigation, and he still is, according to New South Wales police. Would it be fair to say you weren\u2019t aware of that, at the things I followed closely? Morrison: All I know is that they\u2019re a very large and very well-attended and well-supported organisation here in Australia. And, you know, they\u2019re very well known in the United States, so well known that Brian was actually at the White House a few months after I was. So the president obviously didn\u2019t have an issue with it. And that\u2019s what, I think, that\u2019s where the matter rests. But honestly, people chased this round and round for months and what\u2019s important is the relationship we have with the United States and it\u2019s never been better. It is worth noting that while Houston did appear at the White House with other religious leaders, he did not meet Donald Trump. Trump was not there. Trump was at the state dinner, though. This is how Scott Morrison dealt with the Brian Houston story at the time: Journalist: It was reported in the Wall Street Journal that an invitation was sought to the White House for Hillsong pastor Brian Houston, who\u2019s a friend of yours, and that was not backed? Can you tell us what happened there? PM: I don\u2019t comment on gossip. J: So it\u2019s not true? J: Did you actually put a request in for him to \u2026 PM: I don\u2019t comment on gossip or stories about other stories. J: Does that mean it\u2019s not true, though? PM: It means it\u2019s gossip. J: But it \u2026 PM: It means it\u2019s gossip. J: But not true? PM: I\u2019ve answered the question. J: True or not true? He avoided answering it for months. MONTHS. Houston also denied it. And then clarified that it might be true, but he didn\u2019t know whether it was or not. Scott Morrison just admitted on Sydney radio 2GB for the first time that he put Hillsong leader Brian Houston\u2019s name forward for the White House state dinner. Morrison referred to this as \u201cgossip\u201d for months and refused to answer this question. For months. Now he\u2019s all *shrug emoji* over it. Eric Abetz covering off the big issues on his favourite day of the year. Scott Morrison ends question time with a statement on AAP, expressing his regret over the news wire closing. He thanks the reporters past and present for their service. Anthony Albanese stands on the same issue. The Labor caucus holds up handwritten \u201cThank you AAP\u201d signs. There\u2019s not enough to say about this. The ramifications for Australian media are going to be huge. The void this will leave can not be filled. ABC boss David Anderson in his opening statement to estimates: The pause in the ABC\u2019s indexation announced in 2018 will reduce the corporation\u2019s fund $84m over three years and will result in an ongoing cut of $41m per annum from 2022. It is important to remember that this comes of top of $64m of ongoing cuts that were imposed on the corporation in 2014. To summarise, the ABC will have to absorb cumulative budget cuts that amount to $105.9m per annum by the time we reach the 2022 financial year. This is an extraordinary strain on our ability to meet community expectations. At this point it is not possible to absorb further cuts without an impact on jobs and services. Which brings me to the savings challenge the ABC is faced with. Since 2014 we have had cumulative budget cuts that amount to $105.9m per annum by the time we reach the 2022 financial year. This is an extraordinary strain on our ability to meet community expectations... Later this month I will deliver the ABC\u2019s strategy for the next five years, the pathway that will guide us as we continue to deliver the very best of what Australians expect of us. We are still determining how the pressures from budget cuts will be met, but there will likely be some job losses announced as part of that strategic outlook. We are determined to continue to be an ABC that is capable, reliable and flexible to whatever demands come our way. The committee is aware that I have asked the communications minister to end the current indexation pause so we can continue to make the greatest contribution. Our chair, Ita Buttrose, and I have also raised this with the prime minister and I\u2019m pleased at the positive nature of that conversation. The Commonwealth Bank joins Westpac in passing on the full RBA rate cut. Jim Chalmers responds to the rate decision: Today\u2019s decision by the Reserve Bank to cut the cash rate to 0.5% is a new low for the cash rate and a new low for the Morrison government\u2019s economic credibility. Today\u2019s decision represents the fourth interest rate cut in 10 months, leaving the cash rate close to zero, at only one-sixth what it was during the depths of the global financial crisis. Australian families, workers and businesses were already counting the cost of Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg\u2019s inaction and ineptitude before the fires and coronavirus hit. The absence of economic leadership and an economic plan has left Australians dangerously exposed to economic risks. In his statement today, the RBA governor highlighted that unemployment has increased and that subdued wages growth \u201cis not expected to pick up for some time\u201d. While the virus will have a substantial economic impact, it doesn\u2019t explain or excuse seven years of economic mismanagement and underperformance under the Liberals and Nationals. Before the fires and the virus, growth had already deteriorated, stagnant wages were driving weak consumption, business investment and productivity were falling, and government debt and household debt had reached record highs. To sum up what ABC managing director David Anderson is saying in estimates: the $84m indexation cut will mean job losses and content cuts, but not in the regions. The ABC has completed 930 emergency broadcasts in the past financial year, which cost $3m. Future emergency broadcast responsibilities are being costed at about $5m. The national broadcaster services almost 70% of the Australian population, with more than 11 million adults tuning in, either through radio or television, or reading its sites online. There is also this in the Australian media space today. Westpac has announced it will cut its variable rate by the full 0.25 points. Jim Chalmers will hold a press conference at 3.45pm to talk about the RBA decision to cut rates. The motion will fail \u2013 it is, once again, a numbers game. Anthony Albanese is moving to suspend standing orders for this motion: That the House \u2013 1) notes that a) at 12.21 pm on 10 April 2019, senator McKenzie\u2019s office sent a letter from senator McKenzie to the prime minister attaching a list of sports rorts projects she intended to approve; b) at 8.30am on 11 April 2019, the election was called and caretaker conventions commenced; c) at 8.46am on 11 April, senator McKenzie\u2019s office emailed the approval brief dated 4 April 2019 to Sport Australia, with a list of approved projects attached; d) according to the Audit Office, between the 12.21pm email to the prime minister\u2019s office on 10 April and the 8.46am email to Sport Australia on 11 April, one project had been removed and one project had been added \u201cat the request of the prime minister\u2019s office\u201d; e) at 12.35pm on 11 April, senator McKenzie\u2019s office sent a different list of projects to the prime minister\u2019s office, with one project removed and nine new projects added; f) at 12.43pm on 11 April, senator McKenzie\u2019s office sent the approval brief dated 4 April to Sport Australia, with the final revised list of approved projects attached; g) the Audit Office found there were emails between the prime minister\u2019s office and senator McKenzie\u2019s office on 10 and 11 April \u201csorting out what the final list of approved projects would look like\u201d; h) the Audit Office confirmed that although senator McKenzie\u2019s approval brief was dated 4 April, the list of approved projects attached to the brief kept changing up until 12.43pm on 11 April; i) the prime minister has repeatedly claimed his office simply passed on information about sports grants and claimed the projects were approved on 4 April, but this new evidence proves beyond doubt: i) the prime minister was up to his neck in decisions on his corrupt sports rorts scheme; ii) the approval brief dated 4 April 2019 kept changing up until 12.43pm on 11 April; and iii) the final list of approved projects wasn\u2019t sent to Sport Australia until four hours after the election was called and caretaker conventions commenced; and 2) therefore, finds this prime minister has repeatedly and deliberately misled the parliament and the Australian people about his corrupt sports rorts scheme. Vince Connolly delivers a dixer (on a quite serious subject \u2013 child sexual abuse and exploitation) with the ham energy of a retiree in a Florida retirement home, finally allowed to shed the bank manager\u2019s tie and live their true life as an amateur thespian. Honestly \u2013 time and place, dude. Time and fricking place. Scott Morrison finishes with this: Our government are going to keep focusing on the issues that seriously matter to the Australian people. Whether it\u2019s the coronavirus, whether it\u2019s responding to the bushfire crisis, whether it\u2019s dealing with the drought, as we prepare for the budget, getting skills into Australian employees, so they can grow our economy and we bounce back strongly. Whether it\u2019s the plastics summits or getting emissions down, or providing certainty in our electricity system around the country. Those opposite want to come in here and engage in political smears, I know they\u2019re used to doing that in their own caucus against each other, but if they\u2019re not interested in the serious issues confronting the Australian people, there is no wonder why the Australian people have no confidence in the Opposition, or this Leader of the Opposition. And we get to the crux of what Anthony Albanese has been setting up: Why has the PM repeatedly told the parliament and the Australian people that the decision on the sports rorts project was made on 4 April, when the Audi office has found the list of sports rorts projects attached to that brief kept changing until hours after the election was called on 11 April? Isn\u2019t it absurd to claim a decision was made on 4 April when the list determining which projects were funded and which missed out was still changing a week later? Scott Morrison sticks to the 4 April defence: Well, the member has raised comments and statements I\u2019ve made in this house regarding this specific matter, on 4 April. Let me say what I said: The evidence provided today that Sport Australia advised the committee this morning they received a brief from senator McKenzie dated 4 April 2019. That was the evidence. That\u2019s what I said. The authority and a later question, the authority for approving the projects, was signed, dated 4 April 2019. The testimony today from Sport Australia and other response was they received a brief from senator McKenzie dated 4 April, 2019. It was authorised by the minister for April 2019, that\u2019s when the approval was given. Mr Speaker, I\u2019ve been very clear in this House about when that authority was provided for that brief, which was on 4 April. And so, Mr Speaker, I don\u2019t think it would be any clearer. The leader of the opposition seeks to come to this dispatch box and, Mr Speaker, treat question time as smear time; to treat question time as baseless assertion time. And, Mr Speaker, the Australian people can see through a leader of the opposition who is so desperate that he has to resort to smears and assertions when the real issues that Australians are facing today, Mr Speaker... Anthony Albanese: The quotes are from the audit office. In order to be relevant, he needs to talk about the audit office. Tony Smith: The prime minister has the call. He\u2019s been relevant to the question. I was listening to \u2013 I\u2019m not going to have commentary reflecting on the chair. The prime minister is being relevant to the question asked, that included a preamble. The prime minister has the call. Morrison: Well, Mr Speaker, more than a preamble, it dealt specifically with the reference to 4 April 2019, which was the specific question which was put to me about that matter. Smith: I say to the prime minister, I was actually agreeing you were relevant ... Whether it\u2019s good or bad, I said you were relevant. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: How can the prime minister possibly claim his office was only passing on information when the audit office found there were emails between his office and senator McKenzie\u2019s office on both the 10 and 11 April, and I quote the audit office, \u201csorting out what the final list of approved projects would look like\u201d. Morrison: Mr Speaker, I just simply say what I have said consistently on this matter: my office provided information based on the representations made to us, including information about other funding options and programs relevant to project proposals. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve been very consistent in these representations. The leader of the opposition can be wishin\u2019 and hopin\u2019 it was something different to that, but he\u2019s wrong. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Last Friday, on ABC TV, he was asked to confirm, and I quote, \u201cThere was no direct involvement by any of your staff members in deciding whether the money went in tandem with Bridget McKenzie\u2019s staffers\u201d, and the PM replied, \u201cOf course not\u201d. In light of evidence from the audit office that his staff sorted out the final allocations of projects over email, will the prime minister apologise for repeatedly misleading Australians and this parliament? Morrison: I don\u2019t accept the assertions of the leader of the opposition. He constantly comes to this dispatch box and makes assertions and as to what things are, Mr Speaker. And those assertion are not true. The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut official rates by 0.25% to a new record low of 0.5%. Futures market traders had been banking on a cut, with ASX data showing trading on the exchange implied a 100% chance of a reduction to 0.5%. The probability of a cut had been tracking at between 10% and 20% last week but suddenly surged to 100% on Monday. Further out, traders expect the official cash rate to drop to 0.25% by July. That brings us to a new low of 0.50%. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirm the list of sports rorts projects was changed more than four hours after the election was called and caretaker conventions commenced? Morrison: Well, the member is referring to evidence that\u2019s been put before the Senate committee. I can only advise the House, Mr Speaker, of matters that relate to the actions of my own office. And I\u2019m \u2013 I don\u2019t have knowledge when emails are sent by ministers\u2019 offices to other places. I don\u2019t have direct knowledge of those matters. Those are matters that are attended to by the ministers who have the authorising authority, Mr Speaker, for approving those programs which I have stated. ... So, in relation to issues that relate to the caretaker period, Mr Speaker, those opposite have put questions to the government about this. But, Mr Speaker, I remember the 2013 election very, very well. And I remember on that occasion the secretary of finance, David Tune, said he was given a formal direction by the then special minister of state, where they spent $6.5m in the middle, Mr Speaker, of an election campaign, advertising in the Sydney Morning Herald, in the Sydney Morning Herald, suggesting people shouldn\u2019t come to Australia illegally by boat. They ran the advertisements in the Sydney Morning Herald; I don\u2019t know what they were doing in terms of running advertisements up in Indonesia, where the boats were coming from, but it was one of the most prolific uses of political advertising by a government in an election campaign, it was absolutely disgraceful. This leader of the opposition can only throw mud \u2019cause he sits in a puddle of mud. We have lost tveeder because the ABC has gone to the RBA\u2019s rate decision. Michael McCormack is once again impersonating a statesman and it\u2019s like serving up goon from a Grange bottle. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirm that, contrary to his repeated statements that senator McKenzie alone determined sports rorts funding on 4 April, at 12.35 on the 11th of April, senator McKenzie\u2019s office sent a list of projects to the prime minister\u2019s office with one project removed and nine new projects added, and minutes later, at 12.43pm, senator McKenzie\u2019s office sent the final revised list of projects to Sport Australia? Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019m not responsible for the email service in the former minister\u2019s office... (Tanya Plibersek almost passed out she guffawed so loud \u2013 and then got thrown out.) Morrison: I refer the member to the evidence by Mr Boyd that was provided regarding the issues that he\u2019s just raised. It says that the changes made later that day \u2013 the 12.43 version \u2013 none of them were evident as being at the request of the prime minister\u2019s office, rather than the minister\u2019s office. Ed Husic has just been booted from question time for telling Greg Hunt that he has had better death stares from Julie Bishop, after heckling the health minister for not making a formal ministerial statement on coronavirus. 94a is not the punishment, it seems. AAP has had to write about its own closure, and send out the story on the wire, to all the other media outlets: Australia\u2019s AAP Newswire will close after 85 years of supplying content to national and global newspapers, broadcast outlets and digital editions. The business is no longer viable in the face of increasing free online content, CEO Bruce Davidson said on Tuesday, when confirming job losses and the cessation of output at the end of June. Australian Associated Press\u2019s Pagemasters editorial production service will also close at the end of August. AAP is owned by Nine, News Corp Australia, the West Australian and Australian Community Media. AAP chairman Campbell Reid described the newswire as Australian \u201cjournalism\u2019s first responder\u201d. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again to the prime minister: is the prime minister aware that, after the election was called, senator McKenzie\u2019s office sent not one but two emails to Sport Australia allocating sports rorts funding? One at 8.46am and another at 12.43pm? Is he also aware that the second email at 12.43pm removed one project and added nine more? Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker. The leader of the opposition has simply just set out evidence that was provided in the Senate today. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again to the prime minister: how can the prime minister claim he simply passed on information on the corrupt sports rorts scheme when the Audit Office told parliament last night the list of sports rorts projects was changed after the election was called? I quote the Audit Office here, \u201cat the request of the prime minister\u2019s office\u201d. Morrison: Mr Speaker, I simply say again ... as I\u2019ve said, Mr Speaker, in this House before, and going back to my Press Club address earlier in the year: what my office did was very straightforward. They passed on information based on the representations made to us, and that included information about other funding options or programs relevant to project proposals, Mr Speaker. That statement is completely consistent with all of the matters that have come before this House and in other places. This is an absolute travesty. An absolute travesty. It\u2019s straight into sportsrorts: Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirm that after senator McKenzie wrote to him about sports rorts on April 10 \u2013 the day before the election was called \u2013 his office requested changes to the list determining which projects were funded and which projects missed out? Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I\u2019ll confirm, as I always have on this matter, that my office provided information based on the representations made to us, including information about other funding options or programs relevant to project proposals. Tfw you\u2019ve run out of toilet paper: Anthony Albanese speaking about \u201con-rorter matters\u201d: It\u2019s 90-second statement time. Vince Connolly wants you to know he has a \u201cpersonal\u201d connection with Africa, because he has been to some countries on the continent. Ed Husic opened his statement with \u201cfriends, rorters and countrymen, lend me your taxpayer dollars\u201d. He also got in \u201cScomo and his technicolour coat of rorts\u201d. Who says no one pays attention? It\u2019s the downhill slide to question time, and about an hour before the RBA hands down its cash-rate decision. Paul J Keating has issued a statement on Paul Fletcher\u2019s suggestion that the ABC look at selling its inner-city offices in Ultimo and Southbank and look at \u201cpurpose built\u201d facilities elsewhere (for the record, both *were* purpose built for the ABC. And owning costs a lot less in the long run than renting). Anyways, from PJK: Pressure by the federal Communications minister Paul Fletcher on the ABC to explore the sale of its Sydney and Melbourne studios and premises represents nothing other than an attempt by the Liberal and National parties to fracture the ABC at its foundations, in settlement of its ideological contempt for the organisation. ...Communications minister Paul Fletcher\u2019s pressure upon the organisation to explore the sale of its Sydney and Melbourne premises is simply the Liberal and National parties coming to the conclusion that these major aggregations of staff and functions stand in the way of the preference and bias they believe is owed them or which they can otherwise procure. Australians who value the plurality of our society, and the importance of the ABC to its integrity, should resist and make known their contempt for minister Fletcher\u2019s and the government\u2019s pressure on the organisation. \u201cThe prime minister has misled parliament on at least seven different occasions, including five times in the same day,\u201d says Anthony Albanese. \u201cThis is not an accident ... this is a deliberate mislead of the Australian people.\u201d He is talking about sports rorts. The whole point of that coronavirus press conference was to tell people to stop panic-buying toilet paper and to issue a warning to the banks. Anthony Albanese is delivering the speech he has wanted to deliver on Scott Morrison for weeks, but keeps getting shut down, in the appropriation bill debate. Mark Riley gets the last question: On the basis of life going on as usual, I have a question on another subject. Previously you have said that the involvement of your office in the sports grants project was passing on representations from other offices. In evidence to the Senate last night it was revealed one of the final spreadsheets that was changed by your office to extract one project and to add another after the government ... another nine, I think it was \u2013 after the government went into caretaker mode, and subsequent to that, another nine changes were made by the minister. Haven\u2019t you misled the Australian people on this issue? Scott Morrison: Absolutely not. I will repeat exactly what I have said before, Mark, and this is exactly what occurred. This is what I said to the parliament and I will say to you here, as I said at the National Press Club: my office provided information made on the representations made to us, including information about other funding options or programs relevant to project proposals. Authorisation of the projects was provided by the minister for sport, she was the one authorised to provide those authorisations, and that is what she did and that is the fact. Why did Scott Morrison speak to Coles and Woolworths? Is he worried about supplies? I am not concerned but I thought it was important to have an understanding from those major companies about the processes they are putting in place about how they will continue delivering services to the Australian community. What they were able to feed back to me was very positive and I\u2019m pleased with the plans they have in place. The prolific nature of this has been presented on social media and things like that; it is not as widespread as those images suggest. They have got measures in place to deal with that. They\u2019re obviously some lines which will be more tested in the short term, but they are working on those. Oh, by the way, the economic impact of coronavirus is now looking U-shaped, as opposed to V-shaped. I don\u2019t know what happens if it becomes A-shaped. Scott Morrison says the economic impact of coronavirus is completely different to the global financial crisis: What you don\u2019t do is solve last week\u2019s problem. You solve today\u2019s problem, not the problem of 10 years ago. This is not the same issue as the GFC. It is a very different set of economic circumstances and issues we are seeking to address. The most important thing is the cashflow, particularly of more vulnerable small- and medium-sized enterprises; [and] the workers \u2013 those who work for those businesses \u2013 and ensuring that they are in a position to be there on the other side when the economy bounces back. And our economy is going to bounce back and Australia is going to bounce back, and I want to bounce back stronger than anywhere else in the world. A journalist (I think it is Mark Riley) attempts to ask about sports rorts and gets this response from Scott Morrison: I am happy to deal with other matters but I have to say I think coronavirus is an issue of much greater concern to Australians today than the politics of Canberra. The country\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, has clarified what \u201csocial isolation\u201d means: Social isolation should be focused on people who have returned from countries or people who have symptoms that might suggest they have picked up this \u2013 the same as you would if you think you have the flu. But if you have come back from South Korea or Italy or Iran, then we would certainly want you to practise some social distancing, not go to mass gatherings; and in that context, shaking hands ... is probably best to be avoided. We are not suggesting those practices should be considered by the broader general community. Stop stockpiling toilet paper. We are not going to run out of toilet paper. We actually make toilet paper here. You\u2019ll be just fine. And no one should need 72 rolls for two weeks. Scott Morrison is now calling on the big four banks to be more like Qantas and \u201cshow up\u201d by cutting the rate if the RBA decides to cut the cash rate: There is no doubt that if the Reserve Bank were to take a decision today on cash rates that the government would absolutely expect the four big banks to come to the table and to do their bit in supporting Australians as we go through the impact of the coronavirus. That is why, if the bank were to go down that path, they would be going down that path. And honestly, I don\u2019t see it any different to what Qantas did when we called out to Qantas and we said, \u2018We need your help. We need to get some people out of China. We need to get some people out of Japan.\u2019 And Qantas showed up \u2013 frankly, as they always do. A great Australian company. And this is the same callout, on behalf of all Australians, but if the Reserve Bank moves today then I would expect they would do the right thing by those Australians who are looking to see any support. But the Reserve Bank would be seeking to provide at this time for these reasons, but the big banks would do their bit, just like Qantas did their bit, and that they would follow through. Scott Morrison on the definitely-not-a-stimulus-don\u2019t-call-it-that economic \u201cboost\u201d: On the economic response, the Treasury is working closely together with the other relevant agencies of government to address the boost that we believe will be necessary, which I will have more to say about once we have worked through the details of that plan. It will be a targeted plan. It will be a measured plan. It will be a scalable plan. It will be targeted on the real diagnosis of the economic issue we are looking to confront here. We will ensure that we do not make the same mistakes of previous stimulus measures that have been put in place. There is a lot of learning from what happened last time and it is important as the business sector bounces back \u2013 as it will, on the other side of this. This is why this health crisis \u2013 with economic, significant economic implications \u2013 is different from a global financial crisis. There is no problem with the banking system.There is no problem, structurally, with the stability of the economy or things of that nature. This is a health crisis which has had serious disruptive impact on ... the movement of people, and of goods around the world. That obviously disrupts supply chains and has a suppressing impact on demand. Scott Morrison: Australians should continue to go about their lives and our normal way and just exercise commonsense \u2013 in the same way that you would during a severe winter season, where there may have been an outbreak of influenza or something like that. I mean, that isn\u2019t uncommon, in people exercise the same normal, commonsense decisions they would. That is what we would encourage people to do... I spoke to Coles and Woolies on the way in. They would send the same message I am sending you today: it is important that people just go about their business and their normal processes in a calm manner. They have spoken to me about the arrangements they have in place around their supply lines and things like this, but I would just urge people to be going about their business in the normal way when it comes to those matters. Scott Morrison is giving an update on Australia\u2019s response to the coronavirus. Australia is one of 75 countries impacted by the virus. Morrison: I have also, today, asked that issues around travel and border control also be reassessed again in relation to higher-risk groups from nations \u2013 that obviously includes looking at the issues in the Republic of Korea and in Italy. But I would note that those cases are quite different to some of the others because we are dealing with more advanced health systems in those places, and we will continue to look to the health advice, which has not been, up until this point, to make any changes to those arrangements. As is always the case, we will keep looking at it each and every day. Still in finance, Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher can\u2019t contain her incredulity. \u201cShe [Bridget McKenzie] signed the decision brief, and then made decisions. A week later!\u201d Mathias Cormann says he thinks we are going round in circles. Sticking with finance, Katy Gallagher is still wanting Mathias Cormann to reflect on his evidence. She tells him his evidence to estimates thus far is that decisions on sports grants were taken on 4 April, and subsequent conversations between Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office and the prime minister\u2019s office were based around the logistics for announcements. Gallagher says the ANAO\u2019s evidence makes it clear the conversations between the two offices were substantive. Grants went in and grants went out. That\u2019s the ANAO evidence. But Cormann can\u2019t help. \u201cThe answers reflect the advice I was given.\u201d Cormann says he had no visibility about the allocation of the money. \u201cNone.\u201d Labor\u2019s Mark Dreyfus has noted in a statement that attorney general Christian Porter \u201cfalsely claimed\u201d that existing state and territory integrity commissions could only examine matters where a crime had been committed. Here\u2019s the exchange between Radio National\u2019s Fran Kelly and Porter: KELLY: Well, it\u2019s an integrity commission, it\u2019s investigating matters of integrity. That doesn\u2019t necessary mean criminal offences. PORTER: That\u2019s just not correct. So, integrity commissions or corruption commissions or whatever that they\u2019re called, investigate things which are written into statute as offences. KELLY: But not the sports grants? PORTER: Neither the police nor integrity commissions investigate things that aren\u2019t offences. That\u2019s just how it works. In estimates, Sarah Chidgey, from the attorney general\u2019s department, has taken on notice whether various state independent commissions against corruption can investigate things that aren\u2019t criminal offences. She confirms the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption can investigate \u201ccorrupt conduct\u201d that may not be an offence. CHIGDEY: There are state and territory integrity commissions that can investigate things that are not offences. So Labor got what it wanted: the department contradicting the attorney general. I\u2019m not sure how far it takes us beyond that Porter\u2019s proposed model of the National Integrity Commission will not be investigating things that aren\u2019t criminal offences. It\u2019s based on expanding the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to the rest of the public sector, not the state Icacs. The Coalition has just held its joint party room \u2013 the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, has addressed the room. Coronavirus is not going anywhere soon. It\u2019s looking like sticking around for at least a year. And stimulus is on the cards, just as long as you don\u2019t call it stimulus. It\u2019s \u201ctargeting spending\u201d. Because you don\u2019t need to stimulate a healthy economy, see. See the difference? The bells are ringing for parliament. My eye twitch is twitching in time. Finance committee estimates has rolled back around to sports grants. The Labor senator Katy Gallagher is drawing on evidence the ANAO gave last night about correspondence between Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office and the prime minister\u2019s office about the proposed grants. The ANAO said last night that at 12.35pm on 11 April (which was after the caretaker convention took effect) McKenzie\u2019s office sent another spreadsheet to the PMO with a different allocation of funds: one project had been deleted and nine were added. After that, a final brief went to Sports Australia at 12.43pm. Background: Previously we were only aware that McKenzie\u2019s office had communicated with the PMO on the 10 April (sending a brief that had been signed off on 4 April); and that brief had gone to Sports Australia early on the day where the parliament was prorogued. Gallagher wants to know whether Mathias Cormann needs to adjust any of the evidence he gave in estimates yesterday, given what the ANAO said last night. Cormann says he does not need to do that. He tells the committee he checked during a lunch break yesterday with McKenzie whether she signed the final brief on 4 April. (Labor has been asking, given all the traffic back and forwards between the PMO and McKenzie\u2019s office just before the election was called, whether McKenzie might have backdated the brief after having made a final decision during caretaker mode.) Cormann says McKenzie told him the brief was signed on 4 April \u2013 \u201cno ifs or buts\u201d. He signals the brief might have taken a couple of days to get to Sports Australia because she was travelling. As for himself: \u201cI had no involvement and no visibility over the sports grants decisions made by Senator McKenzie.\u201d Chris Moraitis, the secretary of the Attorney General\u2019s Department, confirms it has been working for \u201cat least two years\u201d on a bill for a national integrity commission, although the first version of the bill was only produced in January 2019 because it is a \u201cmassive undertaking\u201d. Marise Payne, who is representing the attorney general in estimates, said the government wants to \u201cenhance national integrity arrangements across the federal public sector\u201d and suggests the exposure draft legislation will be released this year. The AG has admitted he missed his own deadline to release it by the end of last year. Payne said the government doesn\u2019t want to engage in \u201cpolicy on the run\u201d, so Murray Watt quips it is instead \u201cpolicy in the slow lane\u201d \u2013 especially when contrasted with the bill to increase penalties for putting needles in strawberries. Sarah Chidgey, the department\u2019s deputy secretary of the integrity and international group, said it has written an exposure draft bill but \u201cfinal decisions are to be made\u201d by the AG about its release. Labor has also examined the number of family law and domestic violence reports and recommendations the government has received. It puts the count at six reports in five years, with 180 recommendations still to be either responded to or put into action, including the Australian Law Reform Commission Family Law System review which was handed down in March 2019. It\u2019s cool though. Pauline Hanson and Kevin Andrews are leading another review into the family law system, which will definitely fix it. Over in legal affairs estimates, officials have admitted the government has now been working on some sort of federal integrity bill for two years. No draft legislation has been produced. The government missed its own deadline of the end of 2019 and now says you\u2019ll get it when you get it. Marise Payne defended it as not engaging in \u201cpolicy on the run\u201d, prompting Murray Watt to respond: It\u2019s not policy on the run, it\u2019s policy on the crawl. Scott Morrison has called a press conference for midday in the Blue Room. Oh good. Nineteen tranches of national security legislation in the past six or so years, but our data sets don\u2019t talk to each other. We are about two weeks away from someone seriously suggesting we just print more money. BRING BACK THE HOLEY DOLLAR Gerard Rennick seemed to invoke Alexander Hamilton when talking about issuing infrastructure bonds. Hamilton took charge of the US Treasury in 1789. He was killed in a duel with the vice-president, Aaron Burr, in 1804. Good. Times. Someone has allowed the LNP senator Gerard Rennick on Sky again. There was a vacuum after Craig Kelly was encouraged to avoid the cameras (once again) \u2013 but some voids just should not be filled. Anthony Albanese has addressed MPs about the prime minister\u2019s involvement in the sports rorts affair, saying evidence now showed that a \u201cdirect change\u201d had been made by Scott Morrison\u2019s office \u201cin direct contravention\u201d of his claims: Sports rorts now embroils the prime minister directly \u2013 it is the most direct involvement of a prime minister in a scandal that I have seen. You can\u2019t spin this: Morrison just lies. It is not conceivable when he gave answers last week that he did not know these facts. The Labor leader also talked about the bushfire agency that the government had claimed to establish, saying the agency and the $2bn fund announced to go with it \u201cdid not exist\u201d. \u201cThere has been no appropriation of that amount \u2013 there has been only $200m, 10% of what the prime minister said would be made available, has been made available,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cOn bushfires, the government says they can\u2019t get money out of the door because of the states, and yet they have had no trouble getting money out of the door when it comes to sports rorts.\u201d On the economy, Albanese said it was important to point out that the \u201ceconomy was flatlining\u201d before the bushfires and the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThe government set itself a test with the surplus, and we need to continue to point out their failures on the economy.\u201d Quick update from finance estimates this morning. Officials from the Future Fund Management Agency have told the committee they are \u201cthinking very hard\u201d about the potential impact of the coronavirus on Future Fund earnings. They say they are looking at the exposures to sectors that are likely to be hard hit by the virus, but the Future Fund is \u201chighly diversified\u201d and well positioned for this event. The Greens senator Peter Whish Wilson is also pursuing a series of questions about carbon risk. He wants to know how seriously the Future Fund is taking the challenge of exposure to fossil fuels. The official at the table says carbon risk is significant, and this is an issue the sovereign wealth fund is examining, along with many other risks. \u201cEnergy transition and global warming is a significant risk,\u201d the official says. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, says the Future Fund should be free to invest in \u201clegitimate legal businesses\u201d (apart from tobacco, which the fund no longer invests in). Whish-Wilson wonders whether Cormann understands the impact of 4C warming. Jason Wood, the assistant minister for multicultural affairs, still thinks there is nothing wrong with this post on his social media. It is still up, despite several multicultural groups calling it irresponsible. The Chinese Community Council of Australia, the National Sikh Council of Australia and the Multicultural Communities Council of NSW have joined together to call for Wood to resign or to be removed from his position by Scott Morrison. \u201cThe remarks of Jason Wood MP totally negate the great work and effort done by minister Alan Tudge,\u201d the groups\u2019 joint statement reads. \u201cIn short, Mr Wood has sabotaged the government\u2019s good work, good will and confidence when it comes to dealing with racism in Australia. All of Alan Tudge\u2019s effort has gone down the gurgle in one Facebook post. \u201cIt would not be surprising that Mr Wood\u2019s inflammatory remarks have given credibility to those people raising concerns about the Asian-American medical staff treating their children, at the Royal Children\u2019s Hospital in Melbourne last week \u2026 \u201cWe believe that Mr Wood\u2019s remarks as an assistant minister for multiculturalism is highly inappropriate ... his position in the multiculturalism portfolio is now untenable.\u201d We have a market update: With all stocks trading, the Australian market was up almost 1.6% about 10.40am. It was also left to Christian Porter to defend the sports grants program this morning, in the wake of last night\u2019s revelations. Here he is talking to Laura Jayes on Sky: Well, I must say there\u2019s been a number of, sort of, very extravagant statements made over the last several days in Senate estimates. I mean, we had Kristina Keneally yesterday accusing the former minister Bridget McKenzie of forging a document \u2013 I mean, accusing Bridget McKenzie under parliamentary privilege in a Senate estimates committee of a serious criminal offence with absolutely no evidence whatsoever. Jayes: But didn\u2019t we learn yesterday, attorney general. Sorry to interrupt, but didn\u2019t we learn yesterday that the prime minister changed the projects in round three of this funding scheme on the day the election was called? That stinks, doesn\u2019t it? Porter: Well again, your characterisation of it relies on what I\u2019ve got to say is assertions made by Labor members which don\u2019t actually bear out to the facts. On 4 April the decision by the minister was made. Now, that was clearly the case. You\u2019ve now got Labor [shadow] ministers accusing the minister of backdating that decision-making document \u2013 like, forging a document. They\u2019re accusing the minister \u2026 Pressed on whether backdating briefs ever happens, Porter says: Well, it clearly did not happen here \u2013 the minister has quite clearly said that that\u2019s not the case. But you know, Laura, surely it\u2019s a matter of some seriousness when parliamentary privilege is used by Kristina Keneally to accuse a former minister of a criminal offence with zero evidence. And they\u2019ve got form here. The Labor party and Mark Dreyfus have overseen 10 referrals of government ministers to law enforcement agencies for investigation for criminal offences, with zero results \u2026 Jayes: As a lawyer you must be \u2013 have been embarrassed by some of the flimsy arguments that have been put forward by your side of politics as well? Porter: Well, the Sports grant program was run in accordance with the guideline. Now, people might take views about whether or not ministers should assert their own views as to the merit of programs over and above the views of the department. I happen to think that that is a fair and reasonable process. But I understand that people might have different views about that process. But allegations of criminal conduct by minsters with no evidence whatsoever to support that allegation, to me that\u2019s the problem that\u2019s emerging here. I mean, how many times does the Labor party have to make a false allegation, totally unsupported by evidence; refer it to the police, and it doesn\u2019t get investigated \u2013 for that to be an actual issue? Like, 20 times, 50 times, 10 times? The Greens senator Janet Rice has been grilling the Department of Agriculture on what work it has done to model the future effects of climate change, including the scenario of four degrees warming. Rice said the department should have modelled the impact on agriculture based on forecasts from the Bureau of Meteorology that had been warning about warmer conditions for many years. The department secretary, Andrew Metcalfe, said the department was working on the issue, and had established a new division focused on climate adaptation and resilience. \u201cAustralian farmers have been adapting to Australia\u2019s climate for decades \u2013 this is not a new phenomena, we have noticed this warming trend and drying trend across the country for quite some time,\u201d Metcalfe said. But he said the department was not using the specific temperature increase of four degrees. His deputy, Matt Cahill, who is responsible for natural disaster management, said the department was doing work that acknowledged there would be changes in the Australian landscape due to climate change, but these would vary across the country. \u201cOur focus is to be able to support that, I think unilaterally looking at one scenario for the whole Australian continent is not going to help us to be able to make Australia adapt, and therefore we are looking at what are the practices that need to be put in place depending on where you are in Australia,\u201d Cahill said. Rice said the changing conditions would have a significant impact on wheat and dairy farmers, whose businesses may no longer be viable. \u201cThis has been staring us in the face and what I want to know is what is your department doing in terms of informing your stakeholders, telling the truth to the farmers of Australia that this is the future we are facing.\u201d The Liberal senator Anne Ruston accused Rice of a \u201cdoomsday rant\u201d.\u201dIt is not a doomsday rant, it is a reality,\u201d Rice said. In response, Ruston said the government was \u201cwell aware\u201d of the changing climate. \u201cThe government acknowledges that we have a changing climate, and we have committed significant funds to a number of initiatives to address both the impact on our farming community as well as the impact on our environment ... to make sure that we build resilience and adaptation into our communities to make sure they can deal ongoing with the changes in our climate.\u201d The legislation Christian Porter has been talking about today can be found here. The main game for Labor today will be the sports grants affair. Last night\u2019s email revelations between former minister Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office and the prime minister\u2019s office (new emails and new spreadsheets) opens up new avenues of questioning for Labor, and they are going to go after them. Also from estimates last night, Murray Watt was asking questions about the National Bushfire Recovery Agency in finance estimates. That \u2018national bushfire recovery fund\u2019? It doesn\u2019t officially exist, according to officials. It\u2019s a notional fund, meaning it\u2019s not recorded in the budget. That makes sense \u2013 it was set up after the budget was released. But it means that the department has had to use existing measures, like the disaster recovery allowance and payments, to prop up the \u201cfund\u201d. The Australian market has opened up more than 1%, its first rise after more than a week of falls caused by concerns about the economic damage caused by the coronavirus outbreak. This morning\u2019s increase follows relief rallies on overseas markets that saw the US S&amp;P500 index soar by 4.6% and the UK\u2019s FTSE book a more modest 1.1% rise. It comes ahead of a meeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia this afternoon at which the futures market expects interest rates to be cut from 0.75%, which is already a record low, to 0.5%. Futures market trades imply a 100% chance of a rate cut today, according to ASX data. Further out, traders expect the official cash rate to drop to 0.25% by July. Asked about whether or not we all need to stop shaking hands, Christian Porter says: Well I shook [Nine Newspapers\u2019 national political editor] David Crowe\u2019s hand when I was in the elevator \u2026 forgot, first of all, that he was a journalist \u2026 but, look, I think people will just need to be mindful, people will just need to be mindful that we\u2019re going to have a very challenging several months and perhaps towards the end of the year. And that will require some changes in the way that we behave and think and what our expectations are about a range of issues. And again, it may be at some point in time that you need orders around people coming and going from medical facilities. It may be that there are particular requirements and things that we would be very wise to do before we come and go from childcare or schools. But I think that information will flow always very swiftly and accurately from the commonwealth government, from state governments \u2013 always informed by medical advice. But I think Australians can be assured that because of the fact the government prepared the legislative and statutory framework that we can actually do things that we see might require to be done. That would have been impossible under the 1908 Quarantine Act. So we are very well prepared both in terms of resources, advice, but also in terms of the types of laws that we have at our disposal to ensure that this can run as smoothly as possible during what will no doubt be a challenging period. Christian Porter\u2019s main focus this morning though were the biosecurity laws being put into action in response to coronavirus. What do they look like for Australians? What it would most likely look like is that at a period once the disease was more prevalent in Australia, if you had something that\u2019s described as a fever clinic where people are able to coalesce and return to health after the acute fever that occurs with coronavirus \u2013 people visiting relatives or medical staff coming in and out, might be required to undergo certain requirements such as decontamination. They might be prevented from entering or exiting if it was considered that it was too dangerous for them to do so. They\u2019re the types of practical things that are likely to happen. So, the absolute extreme-case scenarios are not ones that are likely. But what is likely to happen is that people will find that there will be more refinements on them coming and going into places, particularly medical facilities. People are used to walking into hospitals in Australia and emergency department rooms, without necessarily having to go through a decontamination or being questioned. It may be that, as this disease does roll through the Australian community that those type of circumstances will change, and there\u2019ll be greater controls on people\u2019s coming and going to certain places where the disease is prevalent. Larissa Waters opened her questioning on that this morning but was shut down by government senators in the hearing. For the record, integrity bodies are more than capable of investigating matters involving integrity. It happens quite frequently. Christian Porter was also asked about whether the government\u2019s promised federal integrity commission could look at something like sports rorts, while talking to Fran Kelly on RN this morning. He says it wouldn\u2019t, because there is no criminal offence. Kelly: The government has promised us a national integrity commission. We don\u2019t have it yet. But there are complaints about your model as we as we know it now. Some legal experts say it wouldn\u2019t have the power, for instance, to investigate the so-called community sports grant scandal, because the conduct in question doesn\u2019t constitute a criminal offence. Is that correct? Porter: Well, all corruption and crime commissions have to investigate criminal offences, that that\u2019s what they do. There hasn\u2019t been any suggestion whatsoever that there\u2019s been a criminal offence committed, or reasonably suspected, by anyone with respect to the matter that you\u2019ve just mentioned. So the complaint that an integrity commission that we might design wouldn\u2019t investigate things that weren\u2019t offences.. Kelly: Well, it\u2019s an integrity commission, it\u2019s investigating matters of integrity. That doesn\u2019t necessary mean criminal offences. Porter: That\u2019s just not correct. So integrity commissions or corruption commission or whatever that they\u2019re called, investigate things which are written into statute as offences. So for instance, the model that we\u2019ve designed would be able to investigate a very wide range of commonwealth offences which attain to issues of integrity. Kelly: But not the sports grants? Porter: Neither the police nor integrity commission investigate things that aren\u2019t offences. The Reserve Bank will make its rates decision today. It is expected to cut rates to a new historic low of 0.5% \u2013 a move that it wasn\u2019t predicted to make until June. The coronavirus is biting the economy \u2013 the supply chains are impacted, and that has the government so worried, it is working up a stimulus plan of its own. Tim Watts entered a new word into the Hansard overnight: We\u2019ve seen so many rorts that they have all combined in the public mind into one great big rort \u2013 a rort so big it has its own chaotic weather system, a \u2018rort sharknado\u2019, swirling with Liberal candidates and National party donors, all trying to get their taste of the latest corrupt program. While Christian Porter has been preparing Australians for the possibility of pandemics, New Zealand\u2019s deputy prime minister, Winston Peters, has waded into the ongoing row of Australia\u2019s policy of forced deportations of non-citizens. If you were watching last Friday, you\u2019ll know that Jacinda Ardern gave Scott Morrison a scolding in Sydney about forced deportations and, if you\u2019ve been listening since, you\u2019ll know that Peter Dutton has homilised that Ardern would be stamping her foot wouldn\u2019t she because she\u2019s about to go to an election and nothing plays better in New Zealand than a bit of Aussie bashing (or insights to this effect). Peters is not amused. This morning on Radio National he accused Dutton of putting short-term domestic politics, including his own leadership ambitions, above the trans-Tasman relationship. Peters declared Dutton had implemented deportations for political reasons and for personal ambition, and Australia should be \u201cbetter than that\u201d. He said Australia\u2019s policy began with politics \u201cand we know who began it, and we know what happened when he went to run for the Liberal leadership, and he gets to the door and he knocks on it and it ends up being Scott Morrison, not Mr Dutton\u201d. \u201cWe all know the background of this, so let\u2019s not shilly-shally around. We are both better than that.\u201d This is the part of the sports grant evidence Labor will be pursuing today: At 12.35pm on 11 April, Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office sent another spreadsheet to the PMO with a different allocation of funds. One project had been removed and nine new projects were added. At 12.43pm on 11 April, McKenzie sent the revised final approval brief to Sport Australia with the same spreadsheet that was attached to the 12.35pm email to the PMO. The government went into caretaker mode at 8.30am on 11 April. It\u2019s Tuesday, which means it is party room day. Apparently only two pieces of legislation were put forward for debate in the Coalition party room today. Two. It happened late and is being overshadowed by coronavirus, but as AAP reported, the sports rorts affair is rolling on. Last night the Australian National Audit Office confirmed there was another version of the colour-coded spreadsheet (I think that makes 29 now) which was sent on the day the election was called. This spreadsheet is different to the one sent at 8.46am that day (which was about 15 minutes after the government entered caretaker mode). This one was sent at 12.43pm that day, which is well after caretaker period was entered into. Also revealed last night: Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office emailed a letter to the prime minister\u2019s office with attachments (the spreadsheet) on 12.21pm on 10 April (the day before the election was called). One project was added and another taken away. Non-government senators claim that shows the prime minister\u2019s office was involved in the decision making. Also, calm down on the toilet paper panic, people. There is no need to doomsday prep, as yet. Greg Hunt: So, there is no indication yet that there will be health advice to that effect. What is happening, I think, this is very important for the public to understand the big picture here. There is a national structure with the incident centre, the national medical stockpile ... but also all of the chief health officers and the chief medical officers from the states and commonwealth meeting every day. So they are reviewing our needs. They are reviewing our travel advisories and travel bans. They\u2019re also reviewing our domestic arrangements on a constant basis. So as circumstances dictate, we\u2019ll take the steps and we\u2019ll take them fiercely. Fearlessly. At this point, they haven\u2019t indicated there is need for change, but we\u2019re not taking anything off the table. If steps like that are required at some point then we\u2019ll provide that advice to the public in advance. At this point there is no indication of that. #sportsrorts rolls on. From AAP: The scandal surrounding the sports grants saga has deepened yet again, following revelations the federal government was still tinkering with the list of projects hours after the election was called. The list of sports grants changed more than three hours after a final, approved version was sent to Sport Australia. One version of the list of approved projects was sent from the office of then-sports minister Bridget McKenzie to Sport Australia at 8.46am on April 11. Another version \u2013 with one project removed, and nine others added \u2013 was sent from Senator McKenzie\u2019s office to the prime minister\u2019s office later that day. \u201cThe final version of the spreadsheet was circulated to Sport Australia at 12.43pm,\u201d Brian Boyd from the Australian National Audit Office told a Senate estimates hearing on Monday night. The timeline is significant because the government entered caretaker mode at 8.29am on April 11, when Scott Morrison called the election. After that time, the government is supposed to avoid making major policy decisions or entering major contracts. Senate estimates is back up and running. Today\u2019s hearings include finance and public administration, legal and constitutional affairs, environment and communications and regional and rural affairs. Labor has done a count \u2013 they think that 258 questions were taken on notice yesterday. Christian Porter also spoke to Laura Jayes about the remodelled foreign interference transparency register. Porter said he \u201cwasn\u2019t overly impressed\u201d with the early stages of how the act was applied \u2013 and by that he means the former prime minister Tony Abbott getting caught up in it. Well, I thought that was ridiculous. I thought it was poor target selection, I didn\u2019t think it represented great triage or useful application of valuable government resources and the legislation. So we\u2019ve undergone a range of changes with respect to the way in which we are applying our resources, and very much looking at the types of behaviours that might be registerable under the foreign influence transparency register. But those behaviours that occur in key sectors that potentially have the greatest concern to Australians and which Australians would most think they should know about \u2013 this is of course a transparency register. There\u2019s nothing wrong with acting on behalf of a foreign principal. And we\u2019ve had many, many registrations already under the scheme. What we\u2019re concerned about is those organisations, which would make the definition of a foreign government, private entity or foreign principal have working for them people who may be engaging in registered activities but haven\u2019t registered. So we\u2019re into a next phase. And we\u2019ve certainly brought in some specialist expertise to focus on particular areas of the Australian economy. Christian Porter had a chat to Laura Jayes on Sky this morning, explaining that while Australians might be used to being stopped at airports, they would be \u201cless used to the idea that that power might be used at a clinic that was established or at a hospital\u201d. But the reality is that these laws were updated in 2015. Prior to that our Quarantine Act dated back to 1908, and was more fit for a time when Australia got most of its vessels and incoming traffic by ocean liner. So we prepared by updating our laws in 2015 for precisely the type of circumstances, where you may have to engage in pandemic planning, which very unfortunately we are doing at the moment. The first human transmission of the coronavirus Covid-19 in Australia has resulted in biosecurity laws being used on a larger scale, meaning Australians could find themselves detained by medical authorities if they present with symptoms of the pandemic. The attorney general, Christian Porter, said the laws used to detain people at airports and other entry points could also be used to stop people elsewhere, as the government tries to keep a lid on the coronavirus spread in Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s very likely that these laws will get used on a larger scale,\u201d Porter told ABC radio RN on Tuesday morning. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very likely that Australians will encounter practices and instructions and circumstances that they have not had to encounter before.\u201d It\u2019s all based on laws from 2015, which replaced the old 100-year-old Biosecurity Act, but the powers have not yet been used on a large scale. That looks likely to change, with the government looking at all measures, including the declaration of \u201chuman health zones\u201d which could require screening for anyone looking to enter or leave a declared area. Depending on how the spread of the virus occurs, mass gatherings could also be cancelled. We are also going to be asked to enact \u201csocial distancing\u201d. Greg Hunt explained that to ABC Breakfast this morning: So, social distancing means if for example, you have been to a high-risk country or you have any symptoms, the same thing you would if you had flu or a common cold, keeping distance, practising strong personal hygiene. As well as, of course, washing your hands with soap and water. Although these are very basic things, they are very effective things at helping to contain and limit. I think the message is very clear. As a nation, as a community, we\u2019re all in this together and it\u2019s about taking care of each other, so whilst the governments, both the Australian and the state and territory governments have the role of taking care of our health system, our message to the community is, it is also about taking care of each other and that includes how we buy and how we shop. Not trying to hoard. Not trying to have more than is required. To make sure that we\u2019re being careful in our personal hygiene, but caring in our conduct towards others. Wash your hands. Stop touching your face. Sneeze or cough into your elbow. And maybe lay off the handshake/kiss on the cheek greeting for a bit (or forever \u2013 depending on the situation). Senate estimates is still continuing as well, but at this stage, it\u2019s the side act. Still, we\u2019ll have all of that and more as the day goes on. You have the usual team, plus the Guardian Australia brains trust at your disposal. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

The flooding in south Wales caused the temporary closure of its bakery and distribution centre in Treforest, as well as 40 Welsh stores.</p> <p>Greggs makes its vegan doughnuts at Treforest but the production line was damaged by floodwater, taking the treat off the menu for several weeks until it can be repaired. Despite the upheaval, sales at stores open more than a year were up 7.5% in the nine weeks to 29 February 2020.</p> <p>The update came as Greggs posted a 27% rise in 2019 pre-tax profits excluding one-off charges to \u00a3114.2m. Like-for-like sales grew by a record 9.2%.</p> <p>Roger Whiteside, Greggs chief executive, said the coronavirus outbreak could hit future sales if lots of people stopped travelling to work.</p> <p>\u201cThe bit we have no control over is demand,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is some sort of widespread contagion how might that affect the way people behave? We just don\u2019t know that really.\u201d</p> <p>Whiteside has said the company would pay staff who have to self-isolate because of coronavirus. \u201cOur default position is that we pay contract hours. We don\u2019t have any zero-contract hours,\u201d he told the BBC.</p> <p>Greggs has been a rare high street success story due to its changing menu that tapped into the growing popularity of plant-based diets with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/02/greggs-launches-vegan-sausage-roll\">vegan range which includes a sausage roll</a>, \u201csteak bake\u201d and doughnut. Despite the shift, its traditional pork sausage rolls are still one of its bestsellers, with 2.5m sold every week.</p> <p>Greggs is now trading from 2,050 shops, up nearly 100 from the previous year, and is rolling out a delivery service in partnership with Just Eat.

      "bodyText": "Greggs made record profits in 2019, the year that it launched its popular vegan sausage roll, but the Newcastle-based company said the storms and flooding that battered Britain in recent weeks have put the brakes on sales. The bakery chain said the wettest February since records began had caused a \u201csignificant\u201d slump in sales. The flooding in south Wales caused the temporary closure of its bakery and distribution centre in Treforest, as well as 40 Welsh stores. Greggs makes its vegan doughnuts at Treforest but the production line was damaged by floodwater, taking the treat off the menu for several weeks until it can be repaired. Despite the upheaval, sales at stores open more than a year were up 7.5% in the nine weeks to 29 February 2020. The update came as Greggs posted a 27% rise in 2019 pre-tax profits excluding one-off charges to \u00a3114.2m. Like-for-like sales grew by a record 9.2%. Roger Whiteside, Greggs chief executive, said the coronavirus outbreak could hit future sales if lots of people stopped travelling to work. \u201cThe bit we have no control over is demand,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is some sort of widespread contagion how might that affect the way people behave? We just don\u2019t know that really.\u201d Whiteside has said the company would pay staff who have to self-isolate because of coronavirus. \u201cOur default position is that we pay contract hours. We don\u2019t have any zero-contract hours,\u201d he told the BBC. Greggs has been a rare high street success story due to its changing menu that tapped into the growing popularity of plant-based diets with a vegan range which includes a sausage roll, \u201csteak bake\u201d and doughnut. Despite the shift, its traditional pork sausage rolls are still one of its bestsellers, with 2.5m sold every week. Greggs is now trading from 2,050 shops, up nearly 100 from the previous year, and is rolling out a delivery service in partnership with Just Eat. The company is considering paying another special dividend and will make an announcement in July. Last year, it paid out \u00a335.5m to shareholders via a special dividend. Its 25,000 staff were each handed a \u00a3300 \u201cthank you\u201d bonus in January, although some workers got to keep just a quarter of the bonus as a result of universal credit deductions. Greggs said it would share a further \u00a312.8m of profits with employees. All staff benefit from the 10% profit-share agreement.

Hazzard said the 53-year-old worked at Ryde hospital, and that any staff he had been found to be in close contact with had been sent home to isolate themselves.

But health experts and Scott <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/people-are-overreacting-experts-warn-australians-against-coronavirus-panic-buying\">Morrison said extensive stockpiling was not necessary</a>.

Toilet paper producer Kimberly-Clark said it had opened up its manufacturing line in South Australia to help replenish stock.</p> <p>\u201cThe common-sense response is to go about your business as normal. That is exactly what you heard from the chief medical officer,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cI can understand the anxiety out there in the community. That is why it is important to get information from the trusted official sources, rather than wildly speculative reports out there.\u201d</p> <p>He urged people to regularly visit the federal department of health website, to contact the <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert#information-for-the-health-sector\">coronavirus health information hotline</a>, and to listen to the commonwealth chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy.</p> <p>Murphy said people in the community did not need to change their activities. Only high-risk people \u2013 that is, people who had returned from mainland China and Iran, those with the virus, and those who had been in close contact with infected people \u2013 needed to self-isolate and report symptoms to their doctors. The rest of the community did not need to avoid shaking hands or crowds, he said.</p> <p>\u201cSo if you have come from an area where you might be at risk or you have been in contact with someone, isolate yourself, ring up your GP or your local hospital, tell them about your travel history and get advice about being tested,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWe do have a very advanced pandemic plan, we are working across every part of the health system to make sure that we are prepared for any eventuality. But at this stage, we have small numbers of cases that are controlled and the community can be reassured that there is no reason to change normal behaviours, no reason to go and panic buy and do things that are unnecessary.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison praised Australians for heeding advice to self-isolate if they had travelled to affected countries and identify themselves if they became sick, saying \u201cwe will continue to put in place the sensible measures\u201d. However, the attorney general, Christian Porter, said it was \u201cnot inconceivable\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/coronavirus-what-legal-power-does-the-australian-government-have-to-respond-to-the-threat\">that control orders might be used under the Biosecurity Act to detain people or force them into treatment to halt the virus spread</a>. A \u201chuman biosecurity control order\u201d requires people to comply with certain orders including staying at home, handing over contact details and providing body samples for diagnosis.</p> <p>On Friday, health ministers will meet with aged care home providers to discuss advice and ensure the sector is prepared.

That is exactly what you heard from the chief medical officer,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cI can understand the anxiety out there in the community. That is why it is important to get information from the trusted official sources, rather than wildly speculative reports out there.\u201d He urged people to regularly visit the federal department of health website, to contact the coronavirus health information hotline, and to listen to the commonwealth chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy. Murphy said people in the community did not need to change their activities. Only high-risk people \u2013 that is, people who had returned from mainland China and Iran, those with the virus, and those who had been in close contact with infected people \u2013 needed to self-isolate and report symptoms to their doctors. The rest of the community did not need to avoid shaking hands or crowds, he said. \u201cSo if you have come from an area where you might be at risk or you have been in contact with someone, isolate yourself, ring up your GP or your local hospital, tell them about your travel history and get advice about being tested,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWe do have a very advanced pandemic plan, we are working across every part of the health system to make sure that we are prepared for any eventuality. But at this stage, we have small numbers of cases that are controlled and the community can be reassured that there is no reason to change normal behaviours, no reason to go and panic buy and do things that are unnecessary.\u201d Morrison praised Australians for heeding advice to self-isolate if they had travelled to affected countries and identify themselves if they became sick, saying \u201cwe will continue to put in place the sensible measures\u201d. However, the attorney general, Christian Porter, said it was \u201cnot inconceivable\u201d that control orders might be used under the Biosecurity Act to detain people or force them into treatment to halt the virus spread. A \u201chuman biosecurity control order\u201d requires people to comply with certain orders including staying at home, handing over contact details and providing body samples for diagnosis. On Friday, health ministers will meet with aged care home providers to discuss advice and ensure the sector is prepared. Meanwhile, doctors will be briefed in coming days on how to respond to any sustained community transmission, including through establishing dedicated coronavirus clinics where patients could be triaged. The NSW chief medical officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said hospitals were planning to increase the number of beds and staff in intensive care units to accommodate severe cases. \u201cWe will increase ICU capacity and work is being undertaken with our districts to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can redeploy staff. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not a challenge but we\u2019ve done a lot of extensive planning.\u201d State and territory education departments, too, have been issuing notices to school principals. Public schools in NSW have been told to stop overseas excursions, while in Western Australia, education officials have told students to stay home if they have been in close contact with a confirmed case of coronavirus \u201cirrespective of whether they have developed symptoms\u201d. \u201cPrincipals are encouraged to consider the needs of students in self-imposed isolation,\u201d the WA directive states. \u201cThe health-related needs of these students is primary, however, it is important to also consider the social-emotional needs of such students. \u201cMaintaining contact with students via phone and/or the internet while they are in isolation will allow students to know the school cares about them and their well-being.\u201d Because of the risk to the economy from the virus, the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates to a record low of just 0.5%. The prime minister has called on the banks to pass on any rate cut in full.",

On Wednesday, the company announced it had \u201cmoved to apply a quantity limit on toilet paper packs,\u201d limiting customers to four per purchaser to \u201censure more customers have access to the products\u201d. \u201cIt will help shore up stock levels as suppliers ramp up local production and deliveries in response to higher than usual demand,\u201d the company said in a statement. Supermarket shelves have been stripped bare as coronavirus and the fear of being caught without a domestic essential led to dozens of people panic-buying the tissue. Also on Wednesday the Australian recycled toilet paper company Who Gives a Crap announced it had completely sold out of stock. In a statement headlined \u201choly crap\u201d the company said that \u201cpanic buying madness\u201d had exhausted its supplies. \u201cWe also want to acknowledge that these are crazy times,\u201d the company said in a statement which also encouraged its customers to remain calm. \u201cWe feel it too. We\u2019re thinking a lot about how we can do our bit to encourage kindness, empathy and calm. If you have spare rolls, see if your neighbours need some. Go and support your favourite Chinese restaurant. Watch some puppy videos.\u201d It came after the company\u2019s co-founder and chief executive Simon Griffiths had Tweeted that sales had increased by eight times, with the leafy Sydney suburbs of Mosman and Balmain the heaviest purchasers. Woolworths said the company was working to re-stock supplies with long-life food, also in high demand. \u201cThe vast majority of the products in our range remain available for our customers as normal,\u201d Woolworths said. The phenomenon has become perhaps the very definition of rolling news \u2013 #toiletpaper has been trending on Australian Twitter. Aghast shoppers have been tweeting pictures of empty shelves in supermarkets where row upon row of toilet paper once sat, and with it Twitter has been having some fun. Some shoppers were confronted with a barren sight: Even more barren: More emptiness: But where there was anger and despair \u2026 There was also observation \u2026 Others have pointed out that that\u2019s a lot of toilet paper for a few weeks: And \u2026 While a black market seems to be thriving \u2026 and \u2026 Meanwhile, some have pointed out that you don\u2019t need toilet paper to \u2026 well, clean yourself. And here\u2019s a more over-engineered version: But it hasn\u2019t all been panic and nonsense. In Adelaide, everything is very, very normal. Apparently.",

It is easy to imagine red streaks that trace the path of illness extending across the globe like in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgHATo0d3YA\" title=\"\">a Hollywood movie</a>.</p> <p>Predictably, conspiracy theories about coronavirus have spread alongside the virus itself.

And in certain respects, these can indeed be helpful. Long before Twitter existed, people would share information of uncertain veracity \u2013 otherwise known as rumours \u2013 as a survival mechanism. In the presence of an urgent threat, it was rational to collect all available information and pass it on. Through chains of transmission, masses of people distant from the initial event could be \u201cinfected\u201d with misinformation \u2013 sometimes with <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=GAVEwnwC9HgC&amp;dq=witches+mobs+rumors&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s\" title=\"\">devastating consequences</a>. Now, with the rise of social media, false rumours can spread even more rapidly.</p> <p>But the analogy between the spread of disease and the \u201cvirality\u201d of conspiracy theories is misleading in two critical ways. First, ideas can spread without direct contact. Whereas information once travelled from person to person, as diseases still do, since the advent of print capitalism people have been able to <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/quot-the-international-jew-quot\" title=\"\">propagate</a> dodgy ideas through the written word. Today, the mass media enable certain individuals to spread conspiracy theories far and wide. Anyone who is lucky enough to have a newspaper column, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/personalities/alex-jones/\" title=\"\">radio show</a> or <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/02/us/politics/trump-twitter-disinformation.html\" title=\"\">Twitter account</a> with a large following can reach extraordinary numbers of people.</p> <p>Second, people who spread conspiracy theories are not passive conduits. Unlike the carriers of an illness, they actively seek to spread them. Whereas viruses can kill, conspiracy theories, when deliberately spread by powerful actors, can cause a different type of harm: they erode political accountability. In this way, conspiracy theories can be weaponised to weaken the body politic, as if a group of people had the ability to take the common cold and turn it into Ebola.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df44e8986477a56972615095e31b9bf907ba1302\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df44e8986477a56972615095e31b9bf907ba1302/0_88_4604_2762/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Trump visits Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky last year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A fictional narrative\u2019 \u2026 President Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Take the recent impeachment hearings in the US.

This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/21/trump-impeachment-inquiry-fiona-hill-david-holmes-testimony\" title=\"\">\u201cfictional narrative\u201d</a> that Ukraine, not Russia, meddled in the election was initially <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/22/ukraine-russia-disinformation-election-trump-101895\" title=\"\">pushed by the Kremlin</a> and found favour among a small fringe of Trump supporters on social media.</p> <p>But when Trump\u2019s defenders needed a counter-narrative to explain why he summarily suspended military aid to Ukraine, the conspiracy theory blaming Ukraine fit the bill. Despite the consensus of the US intelligence community that Russia alone had meddled, prominent Trump allies with large public platforms, including Senator <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/12/09/ted-cruz-meet-press-ukrainian-interference-chuck-todd/\" title=\"\">Ted Cruz</a>, Fox News pundits and other Trump administration surrogates, voiced some version of the conspiracy theory.</p> <p>After the Ukraine canard was promoted by these public figures, it spread horizontally among Trump\u2019s supporters (and some automated bots) on Twitter in ways that resemble conventional contagion. But its rapid ascendancy owed more to the concerted efforts of influential people intent on promoting lies for the sake of political expediency, rather than to passive transmission.</p> <p>Coronavirus has many elements that make it prime material for conspiracy theories. Invisible to the naked eye, viruses have <a href=\"https://qz.com/1807049/hysteria-over-coronavirus-in-italy-is-reminiscent-of-the-black-death/\" title=\"\">long caused</a> fear and panic. Now add geopolitics to the mix: China\u2019s growing economic and political influence is already a source of anxiety among its neighbours and rival countries.

      "bodyText": "As coronavirus continues to spread and scientists project how many people are likely to be infected, there has been much talk of contagion. It is easy to imagine red streaks that trace the path of illness extending across the globe like in a Hollywood movie. Predictably, conspiracy theories about coronavirus have spread alongside the virus itself. Thousands of social media accounts linked to Russia claim the US created the coronavirus to \u201cwage economic war on China\u201d, and a US senator repeated a rumour that it began in a Chinese bio-weapons lab and not an outdoor market. When explaining why conspiracy theories spread, people often reach for metaphors of viral contagion. And in certain respects, these can indeed be helpful. Long before Twitter existed, people would share information of uncertain veracity \u2013 otherwise known as rumours \u2013 as a survival mechanism. In the presence of an urgent threat, it was rational to collect all available information and pass it on. Through chains of transmission, masses of people distant from the initial event could be \u201cinfected\u201d with misinformation \u2013 sometimes with devastating consequences. Now, with the rise of social media, false rumours can spread even more rapidly. But the analogy between the spread of disease and the \u201cvirality\u201d of conspiracy theories is misleading in two critical ways. First, ideas can spread without direct contact. Whereas information once travelled from person to person, as diseases still do, since the advent of print capitalism people have been able to propagate dodgy ideas through the written word. Today, the mass media enable certain individuals to spread conspiracy theories far and wide. Anyone who is lucky enough to have a newspaper column, radio show or Twitter account with a large following can reach extraordinary numbers of people. Second, people who spread conspiracy theories are not passive conduits. Unlike the carriers of an illness, they actively seek to spread them. Whereas viruses can kill, conspiracy theories, when deliberately spread by powerful actors, can cause a different type of harm: they erode political accountability. In this way, conspiracy theories can be weaponised to weaken the body politic, as if a group of people had the ability to take the common cold and turn it into Ebola. Take the recent impeachment hearings in the US. Witness testimony and the memo of the US president\u2019s \u201cperfect call\u201d established that Donald Trump wanted the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Ukraine\u2019s supposed interference in the 2016 election. This \u201cfictional narrative\u201d that Ukraine, not Russia, meddled in the election was initially pushed by the Kremlin and found favour among a small fringe of Trump supporters on social media. But when Trump\u2019s defenders needed a counter-narrative to explain why he summarily suspended military aid to Ukraine, the conspiracy theory blaming Ukraine fit the bill. Despite the consensus of the US intelligence community that Russia alone had meddled, prominent Trump allies with large public platforms, including Senator Ted Cruz, Fox News pundits and other Trump administration surrogates, voiced some version of the conspiracy theory. After the Ukraine canard was promoted by these public figures, it spread horizontally among Trump\u2019s supporters (and some automated bots) on Twitter in ways that resemble conventional contagion. But its rapid ascendancy owed more to the concerted efforts of influential people intent on promoting lies for the sake of political expediency, rather than to passive transmission. Coronavirus has many elements that make it prime material for conspiracy theories. Invisible to the naked eye, viruses have long caused fear and panic. Now add geopolitics to the mix: China\u2019s growing economic and political influence is already a source of anxiety among its neighbours and rival countries. The classic conspiracy theorist\u2019s question is, who benefits from this? And in the case of coronavirus, there are plenty who could gain from China\u2019s plight (although those benefits will weaken as more and more countries become affected). Finally, as the virus spreads, some governments will be tempted to cover up bad news, providing the kernel of truth that conspiracy theories thrive on. But the reach of any conspiracy theory will depend in part on who sees political advantage in spreading it \u2013 and how much influence those people have. As the coronavirus spreads to new countries, governments have resorted to conspiracy theories to distract from their own failures or to pre-empt criticism. They may target existing foes, as with Trump blaming the media for deliberately \u201cpanicking markets\u201d. Other governments might find them attractive as a way to deflect blame. President Rouhani of Iran, for example, called reports of the country\u2019s struggles to contain the virus \u201cone of the enemy\u2019s plots to bring our country into closure by spreading panic\u201d. China, meanwhile, has resorted to inflaming nationalist grievances to change the subject and has previously shown itself willing to use conspiracy theories for cynical purposes, such as in relation to the Hong Kong protests. In an age of extreme connectivity, we are exposed to more new ideas than ever but we are also vulnerable to manipulation. Conspiracy theories promoted for political gain do not kill like viruses do, but by infecting the public discourse with false or harmful ideas, they make it harder for citizens to ascertain the truth and hold politicians accountable.

If no one is saying anything then it becomes a cause of concern. It\u2019s much better to be visible and be seen by the public, even if it\u2019s just to repeat what\u2019s been said or say there\u2019s not been much change.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a09a661-0ee2-41ea-b0a0-9e1deefd9268\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Harper, now a fellow at Chatham House, said there is some risk that people become \u201cdesensitised\u201d if they are provided with too much information on how many people have been infected without sufficient context, but that transparency improved public trust.</p> \n<p>A decade on this approach is being challenged by the radically changed media environment. Major social networks, aware of past criticism of their role in spreading untruths and hysteria over health issues, have moved to get ahead of the problem and are actively engaging with the UK government to provide information.</p> \n<p>Both Facebook and Twitter are promoting official NHS guidance, providing links to NHS advice in users\u2019 feeds and when they search for coronavirus-related terms. Google, often the first port of call for health advice, is promoting official advice.</p> \n<p>The BBC, having spent recent months being attacked and stonewalled by the government, is emphasising its role in disseminating accurate, timely information about public health issues, with a spokesperson pushing the fact its coverage reaches millions of Britons with official guidance.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe know the public turns to the BBC at times like this,\u201d said a spokesperson, pointing out that nine of the corporation\u2019s 10 most-read stories online during the past week were about the virus. Also highlighted was the decision to make a special public information programme on the outbreak on Monday night.</p> \n<p>For a government that has put great weight on bypassing traditional media outlets, the outbreak has forced it to reconsider its relationship with the broadcaster. On Saturday a government minister was heard giving an interview on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack\">Radio 4\u2019s Today programme for the first time since the general election, breaking a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack\">No 10-imposed boycott</a> to deliver an update to the programmes\u2019s millions of listeners. And on Tuesday health secretary Matt Hancock appeared on the same programme ahead of the publication of the government\u2019s so-called \u2018battleplan\u2019 to combat the spread of the virus.</p> \n<p>Lord Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, said he still believed the government\u2019s communications efforts were insufficient, and had been damaged by political boycotts of Today and ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain. \u201cYou are reliant on communications in these situations, and need every media outlet necessary. You certainly shouldn\u2019t be boycotting programmes, frankly that\u2019s pretty feeble,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Kerslake added that not enough ministers had appeared in the media to support Hancock, who has been leading communications efforts on coronavirus almost single-handedly in the past few days. \u201cNo criticism of Hancock, but if I was him, I\u2019d want a bit more back-up.\u201d</p> \n<p>Harper, the former Whitehall official, accepted that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to call a meeting of the emergency planning committee Cobra may be partly for media consumption. But he said it also helps reassure the public about the seriousness of the issue: \u201cIn this case, the prime minister is seen to be in control. It is important that the machinery and the accountability for taking the decisions are seen. We have to be careful not to be too hung up on who\u2019s doing what at what point.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Elle Hunt.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Public health professionals trying to provide the nation with facts about the spread of coronavirus are battling a wave of misinformation, as they wrestle with the first major British health crisis of the smartphone era. Officials are providing regular updates to the media on the spread of the infection, but at the same time half-truths about the best way to treat the illness are already going viral on WhatsApp and other messaging services. Some are suggesting dubious herbal remedies, while one viral message \u2013 which claims to be advice from an uncle who is a Chinese doctor \u2013 mixes standard best practice with unverified claims about how best to kill the germs. While the inherently private nature of WhatsApp makes it hard to track the spread of such material or judge how many people are reading it, some of the posts seen by the Guardian use the standard language of internet chain letters and urge people to forward the advice to friends and family \u2013 circumventing the official health communications in the same manner that has allowed anti-vaccination movements to flourish online. Prof David Harper, a former chief scientist at the Department of Health, said the UK\u2019s established communications strategy for a public health crisis is to have a trusted medical figure rather than a politician deliver regular updates to the public. He said this approach worked well during the 2009 influenza pandemic: \u201cIt was decided early on that the designated person would be very visible even if there was very little to say. If no one is saying anything then it becomes a cause of concern. It\u2019s much better to be visible and be seen by the public, even if it\u2019s just to repeat what\u2019s been said or say there\u2019s not been much change.\u201d Harper, now a fellow at Chatham House, said there is some risk that people become \u201cdesensitised\u201d if they are provided with too much information on how many people have been infected without sufficient context, but that transparency improved public trust. A decade on this approach is being challenged by the radically changed media environment. Major social networks, aware of past criticism of their role in spreading untruths and hysteria over health issues, have moved to get ahead of the problem and are actively engaging with the UK government to provide information. Both Facebook and Twitter are promoting official NHS guidance, providing links to NHS advice in users\u2019 feeds and when they search for coronavirus-related terms. Google, often the first port of call for health advice, is promoting official advice. The BBC, having spent recent months being attacked and stonewalled by the government, is emphasising its role in disseminating accurate, timely information about public health issues, with a spokesperson pushing the fact its coverage reaches millions of Britons with official guidance. \u201cWe know the public turns to the BBC at times like this,\u201d said a spokesperson, pointing out that nine of the corporation\u2019s 10 most-read stories online during the past week were about the virus. Also highlighted was the decision to make a special public information programme on the outbreak on Monday night. For a government that has put great weight on bypassing traditional media outlets, the outbreak has forced it to reconsider its relationship with the broadcaster. On Saturday a government minister was heard giving an interview on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme for the first time since the general election, breaking a No 10-imposed boycott to deliver an update to the programmes\u2019s millions of listeners. And on Tuesday health secretary Matt Hancock appeared on the same programme ahead of the publication of the government\u2019s so-called \u2018battleplan\u2019 to combat the spread of the virus. Lord Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, said he still believed the government\u2019s communications efforts were insufficient, and had been damaged by political boycotts of Today and ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain. \u201cYou are reliant on communications in these situations, and need every media outlet necessary. You certainly shouldn\u2019t be boycotting programmes, frankly that\u2019s pretty feeble,\u201d he said. Kerslake added that not enough ministers had appeared in the media to support Hancock, who has been leading communications efforts on coronavirus almost single-handedly in the past few days. \u201cNo criticism of Hancock, but if I was him, I\u2019d want a bit more back-up.\u201d Harper, the former Whitehall official, accepted that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to call a meeting of the emergency planning committee Cobra may be partly for media consumption. But he said it also helps reassure the public about the seriousness of the issue: \u201cIn this case, the prime minister is seen to be in control. It is important that the machinery and the accountability for taking the decisions are seen. We have to be careful not to be too hung up on who\u2019s doing what at what point.\u201d Additional reporting by Elle Hunt.",

Affair the government would not delay stimulus but also wanted to avoid the \u201cmistakes\u201d of insulation and school infrastructure programs that helped avert the global financial crisis.</p> <p>Earlier, Morrison told reporters in Canberra:<strong> </strong>\u201cThe most important thing is the cash flow, particularly of more vulnerable small and medium-sized enterprises, the workers, those who work for those businesses, and ensuring that they\u2019re in a position to be there on the other side when the economy bounces back.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are focusing on is jobs, cash flow and investment.\u201d</p> <p>Announcing Tuesday\u2019s cut \u2013 the fourth since June last year \u2013 Lowe said the bank\u2019s board had judged that it was appropriate to ease monetary policy further \u201cto provide additional support to employment and economic activity\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe coronavirus outbreak overseas is having a significant effect on the Australian economy at present, particularly in the education and travel sectors,\u201d Lowe said.</p> <p>\u201cThe uncertainty that it is creating is also likely to affect domestic spending.\u201d</p> <p>He said the central bank would be prepared to cut again \u2013 something markets expect to happen by July \u2013 and bring official interest rates to 0.25%, a number he has previously said is effectively the same as zero.</p> <p>\u201cThe global outbreak of the coronavirus is expected to delay progress in Australia towards full employment and the inflation target,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the government was preparing to respond to the coronavirus outbreak \u201cfrom a position of relative economic weakness, not strength\u201d, pointing to sluggish growth and investment figures and rising unemployment prior to the virus outbreak and the summer bushfires.</p> <p>\u201cThe fourth interest rate cut in the last 10 months since the election is an indication that the Reserve Bank has had to do all the heavy lifting, because Scott Morrison and (the treasurer) Josh Frydenberg could not be bothered coming up with a plan for the economy, which has been floundering for some time,\u201d Chalmers said.</p> <p>\u201cThe nation is crying out for economic leadership and an economic plan and Scott Morrison, as always, has been missing in action.\u201d</p>

from Japan and South Korea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the ABC\u2019s 7.30, Morrison defended the Coalition\u2019s handling of the economy, citing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/19/scott-morrison-to-announce-38bn-infrastructure-stimulus-package\">fast-tracked infrastructure spending</a> and <a

continued to rebuff business demands to sign up to a target of net zero emissions by 2050.</p> <p>In October, Lowe said the bank had detected signs of a \u201cgentle turning point\u201d in the economy that would help stimulate Australia\u2019s persistently low economic growth and boost stagnant wages that have smashed consumer confidence.</p> <p>But on Tuesday Lowe said he also now believed Australian growth for the first three months of the year would probably be \u201cnoticeably weaker\u201d than the bank previously thought.</p> <p>More broadly, the Covid-19 outbreak also cruelled hopes of an end to a slowdown in global economic growth that started in 2018, he said.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the evolving situation, it is difficult to predict how large and long-lasting the effect will be.\u201d</p> <p>Following the rate cut, Westpac and NAB both took the unusual step of committing to pass the full cut on to small business borrowers, many of which were either losing customers due to the virus outbreak or have had their supply chains broken, as well as home lenders.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s biggest bank, the Commonwealth, cut home loan rates by the full 0.25 points while ANZ cut some rates by even more, 0.35 points.</p> <p>In an alarming development, the Australian stock market, which had been up as much as 1.8% during the day, began to slide immediately after the rate cut was announced.</p> <p>In trade following the 2.30pm announcement, the benchmark ASX200 shed 1.1 percentage points, to finish the day up just 0.69% and set up a bad day for overseas markets.</p> <p>The move came ahead of the release of economic growth figures for the three months to the end of December on Wednesday that are expected to be singed by the first few weeks of the bushfire crisis as well as revealing the impact of a shockingly poor Christmas shopping season.</p> <p>The KPMG chief economist, Brendan Rynne, predicted growth for the quarter of 0.5% \u2013 up marginally from the weak September quarter figure of 0.4%.</p> <p>\u201cThat figure is modest, but will probably begin to look impressive by the time we see the Q1 figures,\u201d which will cover the first three months of 2020, he said.</p> <p>Modelling by the veteran economist Warwick McKibbin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/coronavirus-recession-expert-modelling-shows-australian-economy-could-take-huge-hit\">shows</a> the virus could slash Australia\u2019s growth by between 2% and 8% for a year, either of which would probably be enough to tip the country into recession.</p> <p>All four of the big banks have told the Guardian they already have measures in place to support business customers who have taken a hit because of the crisis.</p> <p>Futures market traders had been banking on an interest rate cut, with ASX data showing trading on the exchange implied a 100% chance of a reduction from 0.75% to 0.5%.</p> <p>The probability of a cut had been tracking at between 10% and 20% last week but suddenly surged to 100% on Monday.</p> <p>Further out, traders expect the official cash rate to drop to 0.25% by July.</p> <p>Lowe has previously said that, because of the way the RBA buys and sells money at prices within a \u201ccorridor\u201d around the official rate, a cut to 0.25% would effectively mean that \u201cwe would, at that point, be dealing with zero interest rates\u201d.</p> <p>In November, Lowe <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-gov-2019-11-26.html\">said</a> so-called \u201cquantitative easing\u201d, where central banks buy assets such as government bonds from the private sector to prop up the economy, could be an option for Australia if rates hit 0.25%.</p> <p>However, early last month he said it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/07/reserve-bank-boss-says-coronavirus-likely-to-be-worse-than-sars-for-australian-economy\">\u201cextraordinarily unlikely\u201d</a> the measure would be needed.</p> <p>The RBA governor has also been clear that cuts to interest rates have nearly exhausted their ability to make a difference.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link

Earlier, Morrison told reporters in Canberra: \u201cThe most important thing is the cash flow, particularly of more vulnerable small and medium-sized enterprises, the workers, those who work for those businesses, and ensuring that they\u2019re in a position to be there on the other side when the economy bounces back. \u201cWhat we are focusing on is jobs, cash flow and investment.\u201d Announcing Tuesday\u2019s cut \u2013 the fourth since June last year \u2013 Lowe said the bank\u2019s board had judged that it was appropriate to ease monetary policy further \u201cto provide additional support to employment and economic activity\u201d. \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak overseas is having a significant effect on the Australian economy at present, particularly in the education and travel sectors,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cThe uncertainty that it is creating is also likely to affect domestic spending.\u201d He said the central bank would be prepared to cut again \u2013 something markets expect to happen by July \u2013 and bring official interest rates to 0.25%, a number he has previously said is effectively the same as zero. \u201cThe global outbreak of the coronavirus is expected to delay progress in Australia towards full employment and the inflation target,\u201d he said. Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the government was preparing to respond to the coronavirus outbreak \u201cfrom a position of relative economic weakness, not strength\u201d, pointing to sluggish growth and investment figures and rising unemployment prior to the virus outbreak and the summer bushfires. \u201cThe fourth interest rate cut in the last 10 months since the election is an indication that the Reserve Bank has had to do all the heavy lifting, because Scott Morrison and (the treasurer) Josh Frydenberg could not be bothered coming up with a plan for the economy, which has been floundering for some time,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cThe nation is crying out for economic leadership and an economic plan and Scott Morrison, as always, has been missing in action.\u201d On the ABC\u2019s 7.30, Morrison defended the Coalition\u2019s handling of the economy, citing fast-tracked infrastructure spending and tax cuts passed in July as evidence of its program, but continued to rebuff business demands to sign up to a target of net zero emissions by 2050. In October, Lowe said the bank had detected signs of a \u201cgentle turning point\u201d in the economy that would help stimulate Australia\u2019s persistently low economic growth and boost stagnant wages that have smashed consumer confidence. But on Tuesday Lowe said he also now believed Australian growth for the first three months of the year would probably be \u201cnoticeably weaker\u201d than the bank previously thought. More broadly, the Covid-19 outbreak also cruelled hopes of an end to a slowdown in global economic growth that started in 2018, he said. \u201cGiven the evolving situation, it is difficult to predict how large and long-lasting the effect will be.\u201d Following the rate cut, Westpac and NAB both took the unusual step of committing to pass the full cut on to small business borrowers, many of which were either losing customers due to the virus outbreak or have had their supply chains broken, as well as home lenders. Australia\u2019s biggest bank, the Commonwealth, cut home loan rates by the full 0.25 points while ANZ cut some rates by even more, 0.35 points. In an alarming development, the Australian stock market, which had been up as much as 1.8% during the day, began to slide immediately after the rate cut was announced. In trade following the 2.30pm announcement, the benchmark ASX200 shed 1.1 percentage points, to finish the day up just 0.69% and set up a bad day for overseas markets. The move came ahead of the release of economic growth figures for the three months to the end of December on Wednesday that are expected to be singed by the first few weeks of the bushfire crisis as well as revealing the impact of a shockingly poor Christmas shopping season. The KPMG chief economist, Brendan Rynne, predicted growth for the quarter of 0.5% \u2013 up marginally from the weak September quarter figure of 0.4%. \u201cThat figure is modest, but will probably begin to look impressive by the time we see the Q1 figures,\u201d which will cover the first three months of 2020, he said. Modelling by the veteran economist Warwick McKibbin shows the virus could slash Australia\u2019s growth by between 2% and 8% for a year, either of which would probably be enough to tip the country into recession. All four of the big banks have told the Guardian they already have measures in place to support business customers who have taken a hit because of the crisis. Futures market traders had been banking on an interest rate cut, with ASX data showing trading on the exchange implied a 100% chance of a reduction from 0.75% to 0.5%. The probability of a cut had been tracking at between 10% and 20% last week but suddenly surged to 100% on Monday. Further out, traders expect the official cash rate to drop to 0.25% by July. Lowe has previously said that, because of the way the RBA buys and sells money at prices within a \u201ccorridor\u201d around the official rate, a cut to 0.25% would effectively mean that \u201cwe would, at that point, be dealing with zero interest rates\u201d. In November, Lowe said so-called \u201cquantitative easing\u201d, where central banks buy assets such as government bonds from the private sector to prop up the economy, could be an option for Australia if rates hit 0.25%. However, early last month he said it was \u201cextraordinarily unlikely\u201d the measure would be needed. The RBA governor has also been clear that cuts to interest rates have nearly exhausted their ability to make a difference. Because this implies a need for the government to spend money instead, it has sparked a subterranean war between the bank and the Morrison government, which until recently has been more concerned with reaching its much-advertised budget surplus. The outbreak has already hammered industries including tourism, education and mining that are heavily dependent on exports to China. On Tuesday, the federal government\u2019s agricultural economics unit, Abares, predicted Australia\u2019s seafood industry would take a hammering from the virus, with the value of output falling 12% this financial year, to $2.81bn. About 94% of Australia\u2019s rock lobster exports and 42% of abalone exports are to China, Abares said. It said farm production would also fall slightly due to the bushfires and the drought, dropping to $59bn from $62bn last year. Earlier on Tuesday, the Australian market opened the day up about 1.4%, its first rise after more than a week of falls caused by concerns over the economic damage caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The increase followed relief rallies on overseas markets that saw the US S&amp;P500 index soar by 4.6% and the UK\u2019s FTSE book a more modest 1.1% rise.",

He said all employees were entitled to statutory sick pay if they had to self-isolate at home. \u201cWe have a statutory sick pay system in this country and self-isolating for medical reasons if you are healthy counts as being sick in the legislation,\u201d he said. Freelancers and self-employed workers could apply to the Department for Work and Pensions \u201cif they get into difficulty\u201d. Hancock said emergency legislation would make it easier to recall retired doctors and other health workers to plug gaps in hospitals and GP surgeries, \u201calso so we can get volunteers more easily into the NHS and social care\u201d. He said he accepted that more patients would need to be cared for at home instead of in hospital if the worst-case scenario came about and 2 million people needed treatment. \u201cShould the figures end up as big as that we will have to do things differently. For instance, much more care at home. And anyway, with an infectious disease, home is often the best place, especially for a disease that appears to have a relatively mild impact for most people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut of course some people will need support at home. For instance, we are currently in the middle of buying respiratory kits that can be used out of hospital at home.\u201d Talking on BBC Breakfast, Hancock said officials may have to look at restricting participation in the London Marathon because of the coronavirus outbreak but it was \u201cfar too early\u201d to make any decisions. He told Today: \u201cThe message today is that, right now, we do not need to do many of the heavy things we are talking about in the plan. but we are also setting [them] out as transparently as we possibly can so people know the sort of things we might have to do in future.\u201d",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>What should they do if they feel unwell?</h2> \n<p>They should not go to a doctor\u2019s surgery or medical facility, where they risk infecting other people, some of whom may be very vulnerable because they have health problems.

The semi-official Fars news agency said Iran was \u201caccelerating measures\u201d in the fight against the virus, stepping up the production of face masks and sterilising materials. A government spokesperson said efforts were being made to boost production of masks to 1.5m per day, Fars reported. France, Germany and the UK were among countries that pledged to send emergency medical supplies to Iran. Health authorities there said teams would be deployed on Tuesday to go house-to-house checking on residents and disinfecting streets. The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said at a briefing in Geneva on Monday that the outbreaks in Iran, South Korea, Italy, and Japan were the most worrying. \u201cWe are in uncharted territory with Covid-19,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have never before seen a respiratory pathogen that is capable of community transmission, but which can also be contained with the right measures. \u201cBut containment of Covid-19 is feasible and must remain the top priority for all countries. With early, aggressive measures, countries can stop transmission and save lives.\u201d Other developments included: China reported 125 new cases on Tuesday, its slowest daily increase in six weeks (eight times as many cases were recorded outside of China as inside in the last 24 hours). Italy, Europe\u2019s worst-hit country, recorded a spike in the number of deaths to 52 from 18 as the number of confirmed cases reached 1,835. Health officials in the US, where 91 cases have been confirmed, said six people in the Seattle area of Washington state have died of Covid-19. Washington has 18 confirmed cases, the most of any state in the US, eight of which have been linked to a nursing home in Seattle. Donald Trump signalled he was considering additional travel restrictions into America to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said on Tuesday that two chartered flights would bring 533 Hong Kong residents, including pregnant women and cancer patients, back from Wuhan. The Australian prime minister warned against panic buying, as the central bank cut interest rates to a historically low 0.5% in an attempt to protect the economy. Cruise ship passengers at R\u00e9union island were threatened by violent protests. UK supermarkets draw up plans to \u201cfeed the nation\u201d. In China, cities tightened restrictions on travellers coming from overseas. Chen Bei, the deputy secretary general of the Beijing municipal government, said on Tuesday that foreigners and Chinese nationals coming from South Korea, Iran, Japan and Italy must be quarantined for 14 days. Travellers can be quarantined at home or at a government-approved quarantine facility. Shanghai and Guangdong province have announced similar measures. Wu Qian, a spokesman for the ministry of national defence, said the government had decided to include biosecurity as part of the national security system and would speed up the drafting of a new biosafety law. \u201cThis epidemic has highlighted the importance of biosecurity,\u201d he said, according to the state-run China Daily. \u201cChina will speed up the process of building the legal and support apparatus for national biosecurity.\u201d Chinese authorities asked overseas-based citizens to reconsider or minimise their travel plans as the epidemic spreads across the world, triggering a rise in the number of imported cases arriving in the country. \u201cWe are trying to distance ourselves from the virus, but what cannot be broken is the flesh and blood relationships between overseas Chinese and their families in their home towns,\u201d said the government of Qingtian county in the south-eastern Zhejiang province.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Buttigieg and Klobuchar join centrist rush to Biden As 14 states prepare to vote in the Democratic primary on Super Tuesday, moderates have begun to unify behind Joe Biden as the candidate with the best chance of beating progressive frontrunner Bernie Sanders. Biden\u2019s erstwhile rivals Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O\u2019Rourke all endorsed the former vice-president on Monday. Yet with Sanders consolidating crucial Latino support in Texas and California, his lead may soon be insurmountable. Lost votes. Greg Palast says California\u2019s arcane rules for independent party voters could deprive Sanders of hundreds of thousands of votes. Meanwhile, some four million Californians cast early ballots before Klobuchar and Buttigieg left the race; they won\u2019t get a replacement pick. Washington state at heart of US virus outbreak with 18 cases At least six people have died as a result of the Covid-19 coronavirus in Kirkland, near Seattle, with Washington state health officials confirming another 12 cases of the disease \u2013 many linked to a nursing home in the area. As the threat of a major US outbreak grows, experts have expressed concern that the healthcare system is unprepared. South Korea has declared \u201cwar\u201d on the virus with cases in the country nearing 5,000, while the chief of the WHO has warned the world is now in \u201cuncharted territory\u201d. Grim prospects. European stock markets rebounded on Tuesday morning amid hopes of central bank intervention. But expert economic modelling of the crisis predicts a sharp hit to growth worldwide. Coronavirus etiquette. Handshakes and cheek-kisses are out, elbow-bumps are in. Caroline Davies looks at how the virus is already altering our manners. Netanyahu claims victory in Israeli election repeat Two weeks before his criminal trial for corruption, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed victory in Israel\u2019s third general election in less than 12 months. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party appears to have secured 36 seats, contributing to a total of 59 for the rightwing alliance headed by the country\u2019s longest-serving leader. That puts him two seats short of an overall parliamentary majority, so he will need to entice rival politicians to join a coalition in order to secure a historic fifth term. Blue and White. Partial results showed Likud\u2019s leading opponents, the Blue and White party led by Benny Gantz, with 32 seats, while the Joint List alliance representing Israel\u2019s Arab minority is now the third-largest party in the Knesset. Husband of LA\u2019s DA pulls gun on Black Lives Matter activists The husband of the Los Angeles district attorney pulled a gun on Black Lives Matter activists protesting outside his home early on Monday morning, warning \u201cI will shoot you\u201d, video footage from the incident shows. David Lacey, whose wife Jackie Lacey is the city\u2019s top prosecutor, told the demonstrators: \u201cGet off of my porch. I will shoot you \u2026 I don\u2019t care who you are \u2026 We\u2019re calling the police right now.\u201d Tough on crime. Jackie Lacey, who is in the midst of a re-election fight, has long faced criticism for failing to prosecute LA police officers who kill civilians, as well as her other tough-on-crime strategies. Cheat sheet Russia has been accused of committing war crimes by indiscriminately bombing civilian areas in Syria, as part of a UN investigation into atrocities perpetrated during the conflict. Chris Matthews, the veteran host of MSNBC\u2019s Hardball, has abruptly announced his retirement, apologising for his past inappropriate comments about women and saying \u201ca younger generation is ready to take the reins\u201d. Students at around a dozen US universities have taken part in protests against their schools\u2019 proposed use of facial recognition technology on campus. James Lipton, the actor and writer best known for hosting the long-running interview series Inside the Actors Studio, has died aged 93. Must-reads The rise and fall of Greece\u2019s neo-Nazis A decade ago, Greece\u2019s Golden Dawn \u2013 a group of violent, racist neo-Nazis \u2013 elbowed their way into the country\u2019s mainstream political scene by exploiting a national economic crisis. Now the party is crumbling under the weight of a sprawling criminal trial, but their success remains a warning for the rest of the world, writes Daniel Trilling. The leftwing Texan running to unseat John Cornyn AOC\u2019s recently formed political action committee Courage to Change is backing six progressive women of colour in congressional races across the US. A seventh, Cristina Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez, has her eyes on a bigger prize, she tells Erum Salam: a Texas senate seat. Joe Pera\u2019s brilliantly boring comedy His new series, Joe Pera Talks With You, showcases the small, beloved pleasures of a northern Michigan choir teacher. In a sea of toxic masculinity, says Laura Snapes, Pera cuts a benign figure \u2013 and his show is an antidote to the hysteria of modern life. Meet the Hollywood super-networkers working to beat Trump Hollywood is famously full of celebrity Democrats. But who are the behind-the-scenes networkers who can bring together Leonardo DiCaprio, Paris Hilton and executives from Snapchat to help raise millions in the fight to oust Trump in 2020? Peter Savodnik reports. Opinion From Russian bots claiming Covid-19 originated in a US lab, to US senators claiming it started as a Chinese bio-weapon, conspiracy theories about the disease are spreading faster than the coronavirus itself, says Scott Radnitz. As the coronavirus spreads to new countries, governments have resorted to conspiracy theories to distract from their own failures or to pre-empt criticism. Sport The NBA has issued a list of tips to players on how to avoid contracting the coronavirus, by avoiding high-fives with fans or taking any items to autograph, in a memo sent to teams on Sunday. Europe\u2019s 55 national football associations will meet on Tuesday for the annual Uefa congress. With talk of an expanded Club World Cup and even a breakaway superleague, David Conn asks what the future holds for the organisation\u2019s flagship competition, the Champions League.

Chloe has set her desk up like home, with an iPad, her own lamp, and an aromatherapy diffuser.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Across the world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/27/coronavirus-live-updates-china-wuhan-hubei-south-korea-japan-trumpcases-infections-death-toll-outbreak-italy-latest-news\">governments are ordering</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/uk-two-more-patients-in-england-test-positive-for-coronavirus\">contemplating school closures</a> in a bid to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/coronavirus-nsw-public-school-principals-told-to-cancel-or-delay-students-overseas-trips\">slow the spread of the virus</a>.

Some have taken holidays or sent the kids overseas to relatives.</p> \n<p>Most Hong Kong schoolchildren never returned to school following the lunar new year holidays after the government announced and then extended closures to 20 April.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the first few weeks it was a little bit troublesome, it messed up all our schedules \u2013 not only the kids but all of our daily routine and work schedules,\u201d Wong says.</p> \n<p>But the start of online classes brought back routine and relieved the girls\u2019 boredom, Wong says, and she\u2019s lucky to have an employer who lets her work flexibly.

She has company, but she sees the parents at home so she expects the parents to do something with her.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chau says he\u2019s lucky that he\u2019s permitted to work from home, as his wife is a teacher and is busy running online classes for her students.</p> \n<p>His advice to other parents facing the same situation is to take advantage of it. Hong Kong\u2019s schooling is notoriously demanding, but Chau is using the extra time to teach his kids more responsibility for their home and chores, and to do more exercise.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt the same time it\u2019s also a good opportunity for us to catch up with family relations,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have nowhere to go, even on the weekend. We do board games, and card games, that\u2019s something we can take this chance to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>In China, millions of students have been home from school since mid-February. Schools have been ordered to provide online lessons, and primary classes are reportedly <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/28/asia/remote-school-education-intl-hnk/index.html\">broadcast on public television</a>.</p> \n<p>Officials have advised, and in some cases ordered, families to stay inside, making the absence of school even harder for restless children stuck at home.

A notice in February from the Gulou district in Beijing advised parents to cherish the time: \u201cThe parent is the most important teacher in every child\u2019s life,\u201d it said.</p> \n<p>But discussion topics such as \u201cwhat kind of life have parents been pressured into\u201d and \u201cschool start date is postponed\u201d have more than 400m views and thousands of comments.</p> \n<p>\u201c I just want to know when kindergarten starts,\u201d one wrote.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe kids are so destructive and parents are going crazy. I hope the epidemic passes as soon as possible, so that these destructive little beasts can study.\u201d</p> \n<p>Others complained about the difficulty of supervising their kids\u2019 online classes and heavy workload.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long holiday,\u201d laughs Hong Kong insurance worker and mother, Sarah Wong. Wong and her two daughters, Chloe and Greeta, are at a co-working space in Jordan, Kowloon. Chloe has set her desk up like home, with an iPad, her own lamp, and an aromatherapy diffuser. The girls, aged 12 and eight, are listening to online lessons from their school which has been closed because of the coronavirus. Across the world, governments are ordering or contemplating school closures in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. French officials closed about 120 schools in areas that have reported the largest numbers of infections, its education minister said on Tuesday. In some countries parents have already had their children at home for more than a month. Some have taken holidays or sent the kids overseas to relatives. Most Hong Kong schoolchildren never returned to school following the lunar new year holidays after the government announced and then extended closures to 20 April. \u201cIn the first few weeks it was a little bit troublesome, it messed up all our schedules \u2013 not only the kids but all of our daily routine and work schedules,\u201d Wong says. But the start of online classes brought back routine and relieved the girls\u2019 boredom, Wong says, and she\u2019s lucky to have an employer who lets her work flexibly. Friends aren\u2019t so fortunate and she says they are \u201cpanicked\u201d. When the weather is nice, Wong takes the girls to the playground or the beach, but amid calls for people to practise social distancing, they\u2019re missing their friends. On Hong Kong Island the age gap between Eiffel Chau\u2019s children \u2013 kindergarten, grade one, and grade five \u2013 has made it difficult to manage all three. \u201cThe youngest one in kindergarten doesn\u2019t have any online class,\u201d Chau says. \u201cI just need to keep her busy so she won\u2019t disturb the other two kids. She has company, but she sees the parents at home so she expects the parents to do something with her.\u201d Chau says he\u2019s lucky that he\u2019s permitted to work from home, as his wife is a teacher and is busy running online classes for her students. His advice to other parents facing the same situation is to take advantage of it. Hong Kong\u2019s schooling is notoriously demanding, but Chau is using the extra time to teach his kids more responsibility for their home and chores, and to do more exercise. \u201cAt the same time it\u2019s also a good opportunity for us to catch up with family relations,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have nowhere to go, even on the weekend. We do board games, and card games, that\u2019s something we can take this chance to do.\u201d In China, millions of students have been home from school since mid-February. Schools have been ordered to provide online lessons, and primary classes are reportedly broadcast on public television. Officials have advised, and in some cases ordered, families to stay inside, making the absence of school even harder for restless children stuck at home. Online videos show families playing elaborate games. A flood of advice online ranges from creating strict daily schedules to follow, to videos with home science experiments and tips for activities. A notice in February from the Gulou district in Beijing advised parents to cherish the time: \u201cThe parent is the most important teacher in every child\u2019s life,\u201d it said. But discussion topics such as \u201cwhat kind of life have parents been pressured into\u201d and \u201cschool start date is postponed\u201d have more than 400m views and thousands of comments. \u201c I just want to know when kindergarten starts,\u201d one wrote. \u201cThe kids are so destructive and parents are going crazy. I hope the epidemic passes as soon as possible, so that these destructive little beasts can study.\u201d Others complained about the difficulty of supervising their kids\u2019 online classes and heavy workload. One said: \u201cI am being tortured to death by these online classes. When will this end?\u201d In Japan many working parents were horrified by the government\u2019s weekend announcement requesting every primary, middle and high school in the country to close until the start of the new academic year in mid-April. The unprecedented shutdown, affecting almost 13 million pupils, has forced companies to rethink their rigid work practices, to allow working from home or shortening business hours. Working mothers complained that the shutdown would force them to take time off, given the shortage of daycare facilities and the scarcity of nannies and babysitters. An online poll by Yahoo Japan found 49% of parents said they would leave their children home alone, 20% would take time off work and 14% would enlist the help of grandparents. In a few cases, parents have had no choice but to take their children to work. They include Keiko Kobayashi, a senior manager at a multinational staffing service in Tokyo. \u201cI was shocked by the news of the school closures, and thought, what should I do?\u201d Kobayashi told Associated Press. \u201cThere was no explanation of how this is going to work.\u201d Back in Kowloon, Wong looks at her girls studying at the table and smiles. \u201cI really hope they can go back to school soon,\u201d she says. \u201cThey keep saying \u2018I want to go to school\u2019, which is good because before they didn\u2019t want to go.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, have dominated the headlines. Yet the range of expectations and predictions of its impacts have been so wide as to make clear understanding almost impossible. This is perhaps inevitable when we grapple with a fast-moving and previously unknown illness. What is clear, is that as knowledge grows it has become evident that this has the potential to be one of the most fatal epidemics to have hit the world for a century, and it is rapidly increasing in prevalence in the UK.</p> \n<p>I work as a doctor in an intensive care unit (ICU). It is a speciality (like anaesthesia its parent speciality) which most of the public have little understanding of unless they have required our services. What is in no doubt is that ICU sits at the centre of all that is necessary for keeping alive what may be a very large number of patients who will develop severe Covid-19.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/02/coronavirus-all-the-days-developments-at-a-glance\">Coronavirus: today's developments at a glance</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>ICU treats patients whose lives are at risk or whose organs have failed. Severe Covid-19 leads mostly to lung failure but also causes kidney and cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) failure. All these are rapidly fatal without intense and prompt treatments only available in ICU. In simple terms, treatments include a ventilator taking over the patient\u2019s breathing while the patient is anaesthetised (placed in an induced coma), a dialysis machine cleaning the blood and drugs or machines supporting the heart and blood pressure. The reality of care is, of course, considerably more complex and highly intensive.</p> \n<p>So let\u2019s look at some statistics: it is likely that more than 30% of the whole UK population will get Covid-19 \u2013 it may be as high as 60% in some estimates.

The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>ICU is a precious and scarce resource in terms of beds, staff and equipment. This is especially so in the UK. In 2012 the UK had about 4,100 critical care beds including ICU beds and \u201chigh dependency\u201d beds which are a step down from full ICU care. Compared with other European countries the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-012-2627-8/figures/1\">UK ranked 24th</a> of 31 in terms of ICU beds per head of population and 29th of 31 for all hospital beds.

      "bodyText": "Coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, have dominated the headlines. Yet the range of expectations and predictions of its impacts have been so wide as to make clear understanding almost impossible. This is perhaps inevitable when we grapple with a fast-moving and previously unknown illness. What is clear, is that as knowledge grows it has become evident that this has the potential to be one of the most fatal epidemics to have hit the world for a century, and it is rapidly increasing in prevalence in the UK. I work as a doctor in an intensive care unit (ICU). It is a speciality (like anaesthesia its parent speciality) which most of the public have little understanding of unless they have required our services. What is in no doubt is that ICU sits at the centre of all that is necessary for keeping alive what may be a very large number of patients who will develop severe Covid-19. ICU treats patients whose lives are at risk or whose organs have failed. Severe Covid-19 leads mostly to lung failure but also causes kidney and cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) failure. All these are rapidly fatal without intense and prompt treatments only available in ICU. In simple terms, treatments include a ventilator taking over the patient\u2019s breathing while the patient is anaesthetised (placed in an induced coma), a dialysis machine cleaning the blood and drugs or machines supporting the heart and blood pressure. The reality of care is, of course, considerably more complex and highly intensive. So let\u2019s look at some statistics: it is likely that more than 30% of the whole UK population will get Covid-19 \u2013 it may be as high as 60% in some estimates. Most will have no or mild illness but maybe one in seven will need hospital admission. Of patients in hospital up to one in five may need ICU care \u2013 that would be an unprecedented number of people admitted to ICU. As many as one in 50 of patients known to have Covid-19 may die from it. ICU is a precious and scarce resource in terms of beds, staff and equipment. This is especially so in the UK. In 2012 the UK had about 4,100 critical care beds including ICU beds and \u201chigh dependency\u201d beds which are a step down from full ICU care.

Spain\u2019s Health Minister Salvador Illa recommended that sporting events in the country with a high expected attendance from zones designated as high-risk, such as northern Italy, should be held behind closed doors. That includes the return leg between Valencia and Italy\u2019s Atalanta and the Europa League match between Getafe and Internazionale on 19 March.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, said the mortality rate for the illness was 1%, based on information from China. However, it is higher in older people, particularly those aged over 80 and with pre-existing health conditions.</p> \n<p>A 1% rate could result in up to 600,000 deaths in the UK, though Whitty said that even among the highest-risk groups, the \u201cvast majority\u201d of people would survive. The mortality rate could also be lower than that because there was no way to tell how many people had the illness but no symptoms, Whitty said.</p> \n<p>The advice was released in the Coronavirus: Action Plan on Tuesday as the number of cases in the UK rose from 39 to 51.</p> \n<p>The document sets out plans for scenarios ranging from a mild pandemic to a \u201csevere prolonged pandemic as experienced in 1918\u201d, when the Spanish flu killed 50 million people worldwide.</p> \n<p>If the illness moves into the \u201cdelay\u201d and \u201cmitigate\u201d phases in the UK, retired NHS staff could be brought back to help care for patients, the document says.</p> \n<p>\u201cWith a significant loss of officers and staff, the police would concentrate on responding to serious crimes and maintaining public order,\u201d it adds.</p> \n<p>The 28-page plan also says:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>There could be an increase in number of deaths arising from the outbreak, particularly among vulnerable and elderly people.

Businesses facing short-term cashflow problems because of low demand from customers could ask HMRC how to avoid falling behind with tax. If NHS staff numbers are affected, some non-urgent care may be delayed and retired healthcare professionals brought back on duty. Anyone who shows symptoms should consider options ranging from avoiding contact outside work and school to \u201csocial distancing\u201d, household quarantine and working from home. Widespread exposure in the UK may be inevitable \u2013 but \u201cslowing it down would still nonetheless be beneficial\u201d, partly because GP surgeries and hospitals will be less busy in the summer months outside of peak flu season.

Whitty said the peak was likely to last for weeks, during which the government would postpone treatment for the least urgent conditions. He said it was important for older and vulnerable people to \u201cisolate from the virus but not from society\u201d. Whitty said the government was keen not to take stringent measures too early, such as banning visitors from care homes, as there would be a social cost when it was not yet necessary. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has spoken to social media companies about taking responsibility for websites spreading fake news and about conveying the right messages.

      "bodyText": "Publicity Publicity will be increased about the need for good hygiene measures (handwashing and \u201ccatch it, bin it, kill it\u201d) and for workers to stay at home for the full duration of their illness. Analysis: Simple measures have the ability to mitigate the risks of an individual contracting the virus. A public information campaign is key to reminding everyone of their responsibilities and the difference they can make. Population distancing strategies These include school closures, encouraging homeworking, and reducing the number of large-scale gatherings. It includes the caveat that the country should be able to continue \u201cas normally as possible\u201d. Analysis: These are strategies that have already been implemented in countries with a higher number of cases. In Italy, many football matches in the top tier have been postponed, while France has banned all indoor gatherings of more than 5,000 people. Numerous other sporting and arts events around the world have been cancelled, postponed or relocated. The government has expressed its desire to limit the social impact but that may not be possible if its efforts at containment fail. The question will then become what constitutes a mass/large-scale gathering. Reduced police capability There is acknowledgement that the capability of the emergency services to operate may be impeded by increased spread of the virus. The document refers to a potential significant loss of officers and staff, which could force police to concentrate on serious crimes and maintaining public order. Analysis: This raises the possibility of police forces in the UK being so overstretched that their capability is reduced to the extent that many crimes will not be investigated and officers will be reduced to making sure there is not a loss of confidence in forces\u2019 ability to maintain public order. This is a scenario that the government, which has made cracking down on crime a priority, will want to avoid at all costs. Medical detention of people with Covid-19 New powers introduced in England allow \u201cmedical professionals, public health professionals and the police to \u2026 detain and direct individuals in quarantined areas at risk or suspected of having the virus\u201d. Scotland already has such powers, while in Wales and Northern Ireland a justice of the peace can let officials \u201cisolate, detain or require individuals to undergo medical examination\u201d. Analysis: In China, whole populations have been put in quarantine, which medical experts say has slowed the spread of the virus. Italy has done the same on a smaller scale. It is unclear how the proposed draconian new power of detention would work in Britain if it was deemed necessary to use it. Questions arise over how people whose behaviour was causing concern would be identified, the availability of police officers to attend their detention and where they would be detained. Specialist care for the seriously ill Although \u201cinitial confirmed patients\u201d who have serious breathing problems due to Covid-19 will be cared for in critical care units in hospital; \u201cwhen necessary, the provision of care may move from specialist units into general facilities in hospitals\u201d, the plan says. It refers to \u201cwell-rehearsed plans \u2026 [for] the provision of excellent care for all patients affected by this new disease\u201d. Analysis: The prospect of large numbers of people becoming seriously unwell raises two problems for the NHS: a shortage of beds in intensive care and high dependency units and the well-known lack of general and acute beds. The UK has about 4,250 critical care beds \u2013 one of the lowest rates of such beds per 100,000 of population in international terms. The faculty of intensive care medicine is worried that while demand for such beds has risen at 4% a year since 2009, the number of beds available has not increased, leaving a worrying lack of capacity to manage such patients. Patients discharged early Under the plan, \u201chealth and social care services will work together to support early discharge from hospital, and to look after people in their own homes\u201d. Analysis: That would lead to hospital doctors identifying patients who were the least sick, whose beds would then be used by people left seriously ill with coronavirus. However, the widespread shortage of social care services \u2013 which already leaves patients stuck in hospital despite them being medically fit to leave \u2013 could limit the potential for inpatients to be sent home, or to do that safely. The social care workforce is already very stretched due to the ageing population, so may struggle to take on this extra responsibility. In addition, the number of district nurses \u2013 who care for people at home \u2013 has fallen sharply in recent years. Restricted hospital admissions If the virus leaves more people ill enough to require hospital care and also NHS staff too sick to work, \u201cclinicians may recommend a significantly different approach to admissions\u201d, including delays to some non-urgent care, the plan says. Analysis: This could see some or all non-urgent operations \u2013 for example hip and knee replacements, cataract removals and hernia repairs \u2013 postponed. That would increase the number of patients waiting for such care, which in England alone already stands at a record 4.5m. They could wait months until the virus has subsided and hospitals can get back to their usual way of prioritising patients. Deaths/mortuary space The action plan recognises that the coronavirus outbreak could lead to an increase in the number of deaths, particularly among vulnerable and elderly groups, and that dealing with these additional fatalities could put pressure on local authorities. Analysis: The Human Tissue Authority has been warning about problems with mortuary capacity since 2014-15. Last week, Nickie Aiken, the Conservative MP for Cities of London and Westminster, said there were contingency plans relating to Covid-19 for a morgue in Hyde Park. She later rowed back from the claim, perhaps wary that it jarred with the government\u2019s attempt to quell panic. However, she spoke to the truth, in that a large increase in deaths would stretch the ability of existing facilities to cope. Bringing retired doctors and nurses back to work The plan confirms that, if necessary, \u201cleavers and retirees\u201d may be called back to work to help relieve pressure on current NHS staff. No other details are provided but the General Medical Council has said it could grant doctors temporary registration for the duration of the emergency. Analysis: It is unclear how this plan is compatible with World Health Organization advice for those over 60 years old to avoid possible contact with people infected with the virus.

      "bodyText": "\u201cFor the runway show, no frame. I don\u2019t like framing,\u201d said Chanel\u2019s artistic director, Virginie Viard, before the brand\u2019s autumn/winter 2020 fashion show in Paris.. Its quite a statement of intent given the megabrand\u2019s decades-long ownership of the concept of fashion show as theatrical blockbuster. So on Tuesday, there was no rocket taking off in the middle of the catwalk (2017); no supermarket complete with boxes of Chanel-branded ketchup bottles (2014). Instead, models walked against a glossy white set, with layers of curvy seating trimmed with black, recalling a map\u2019s contour lines. Viard, Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s long-term right-hand woman, has taken a softer, subtler approach since taking over after the legendary designer\u2019s death just over a year ago. This collection continued in that vein, throwing the focus on to more than 70 mainly monochrome looks, with occasional hints of coral pink. Current trends were addressed; puffy sleeves, Wolf Hall necklines and thigh high splits in midi skirts were all present. Models came two or three abreast at times. Gigi Hadid walked, arm in arm, between two other models, a move which felt protective given her altercation last season with a catwalk gatecrasher. Trousers came with poppers at the side, fanning open to display footwear described, in press notes, as \u201cseven-league boots\u201d \u2013 which according to Charles Perrault\u2019s fairytales allow wearers to traverse seven leagues per step \u2013 inspired by a pair once worn by Lagerfeld. There was a New Romantic mood in those piratey, Adam Ant-ish boots and the many ruffle-fronted shirts; Madonna and Boy George were evoked in the liberal use of crucifixes. Two large crucifixes were knitted into jumpers, recalling the Lacroix crucifix jacket famously chosen by Anna Wintour \u2013 controversially, at the time, paired with jeans \u2013 for her first Vogue cover in 1988.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is to take paternity leave after the birth of his child with his partner, Carrie Symonds, in the summer. When asked about the new arrival during a press conference on coronavirus on Tuesday, the prime minister said he was likely to take his entitlement to two weeks off. Dominic Raab, the first secretary of state and foreign secretary, would be the next in line to be in charge during Johnson\u2019s absence. Johnson announced at the weekend that he was expecting a child with Symonds and that the couple were engaged. Their spokesperson said: \u201cThe prime minister and Miss Symonds are very pleased to announce their engagement and that they are expecting a baby in the early summer.\u201d Johnson, 55, will become the first prime minister in 250 years to get married in office. The last child born to an incumbent PM was Florence Rose Endellion, the daughter of David and Samantha Cameron, who was born in August 2010. Cameron and Tony Blair took paternity leave while they were in office. Johnson and Symonds have been living together in Downing Street since he became prime minister in July 2019. He is not yet divorced from his second wife, Marina Wheeler, but they came to a financial settlement last month. Johnson and Wheeler have four adult children together: Lara Lettice, Milo Arthur, Cassia Peaches and Theodore Apollo. The prime minister also has a younger daughter with Helen Macintyre, an art consultant, and has repeatedly refused to answer questions about whether he has any more children.",

The entertainment firm had planned a star-studded private event in west London on Thursday, with hundreds due to attend from across Europe to unveil the service before its consumer launch on 24 March. \u201cDue to a number of media attendee cancellations and increasing concerns at the prospect of travelling internationally at this time, we have decided to cancel our Disney+ launch events scheduled to take place on Thursday and Friday,\u201d the company said. On Tuesday, Disney announced a deal with Sky to make its new streaming service available to millions of UK households. Disney+ is to be integrated into the Sky Q box, to be followed by Sky\u2019s Now TV streaming service in the coming months. Disney+ will also be available as a standalone app.",

Canadian popster Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s catchy, saccharine-sweet <em>cri de coeur</em> Call Me Maybe was No 1 in the UK singles charts, Andy Carroll was fit enough to replace Jay Spearing on 55 minutes before scoring for Liverpool and Chelsea prevailed by the odd goal of three to get some trophy-hoisting practice in before their Big Cup final against Bayern Munich two weeks later. But most of that\u2019s by the by, because you can\u2019t get the sound of Carly Rae belting \u201cThis is crazy, but here\u2019s my number, so call me maybe!\u201d out of your head, can you?</p> \n<p>On Tuesday the sides meet in the competition again, with another Canadian \u2013 The Weeknd \u2013 bestriding the UK hit parade, Chelsea\u2019s players still shell-shocked from having their collective backside handed to them in Big Cup by Bayern last week and Spearing relaxing after his first day training under brand new Blackpool manager Neil Critchley. Yes, the same Neil Critchley who masterminded Liverpool U-23s\u2019 fourth-round replay win over Shrewsbury Town in the last round.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/02/jurgen-klopp-jumps-to-defence-of-dejan-lovren-after-watford-defeat\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp: 'I would be a real idiot to question my players' character'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Their season threatening to go off a cliff Wile E Coyote style, following two defeats in three games, Liverpool find themselves legs-spinning-in-mid-air over the abyss as they travel to Stamford Bridge to take on a team whose manager wants them to cement first-team ideals and go for victory. \u201cWe want to cement first-team ideals and go for victory,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/02/theve-become-human-for-one-game-lampard-expecting-liverpool-reaction\">roared Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea manager Frank Lampard</a>. \u201cIt is Liverpool, our fans are coming to the FA Cup to try to overturn the best team in the land. It doesn\u2019t mean I might not change a couple of people. There might be something for freshness of legs or a couple of different options, but I won\u2019t pick a team to casually give minutes to but treat it like I would any Premier League game.\u201d We\u2019re sure whatever he was trying to say made sense in his head.</p> \n<p>Having literally failed to turn up for their last FA Cup game and metaphorically excused themselves from the Premier League outing at Watford, Liverpool will be hoping to get back to winning ways. \u201cThis is an exceptional group of players,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/02/jurgen-klopp-jumps-to-defence-of-dejan-lovren-after-watford-defeat\">tooted J\u00fcrgen Klopp</a>. \u201cThey did outstanding stuff \u2013 but not that night. Should I think that just because we want to respond that we shoot Chelsea out of their own stadium?

      "bodyText": "I THREW A WISH IN THE WELL \u2026 The last time Chelsea and Liverpool met in the FA Cup was seven years, nine months and 29 days ago in the 2011-12 final at Wembley. Canadian popster Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s catchy, saccharine-sweet cri de coeur Call Me Maybe was No 1 in the UK singles charts, Andy Carroll was fit enough to replace Jay Spearing on 55 minutes before scoring for Liverpool and Chelsea prevailed by the odd goal of three to get some trophy-hoisting practice in before their Big Cup final against Bayern Munich two weeks later. But most of that\u2019s by the by, because you can\u2019t get the sound of Carly Rae belting \u201cThis is crazy, but here\u2019s my number, so call me maybe!\u201d out of your head, can you? On Tuesday the sides meet in the competition again, with another Canadian \u2013 The Weeknd \u2013 bestriding the UK hit parade, Chelsea\u2019s players still shell-shocked from having their collective backside handed to them in Big Cup by Bayern last week and Spearing relaxing after his first day training under brand new Blackpool manager Neil Critchley. Yes, the same Neil Critchley who masterminded Liverpool U-23s\u2019 fourth-round replay win over Shrewsbury Town in the last round. Their season threatening to go off a cliff Wile E Coyote style, following two defeats in three games, Liverpool find themselves legs-spinning-in-mid-air over the abyss as they travel to Stamford Bridge to take on a team whose manager wants them to cement first-team ideals and go for victory. \u201cWe want to cement first-team ideals and go for victory,\u201d roared Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea manager Frank Lampard. \u201cIt is Liverpool, our fans are coming to the FA Cup to try to overturn the best team in the land. It doesn\u2019t mean I might not change a couple of people. There might be something for freshness of legs or a couple of different options, but I won\u2019t pick a team to casually give minutes to but treat it like I would any Premier League game.\u201d We\u2019re sure whatever he was trying to say made sense in his head. Having literally failed to turn up for their last FA Cup game and metaphorically excused themselves from the Premier League outing at Watford, Liverpool will be hoping to get back to winning ways. \u201cThis is an exceptional group of players,\u201d tooted J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \u201cThey did outstanding stuff \u2013 but not that night. Should I think that just because we want to respond that we shoot Chelsea out of their own stadium? No. It will be a tough game.\u201d While visitors to Stamford Bridge are unlikely to see a shootout in the guns drawn, bullets screaming, High Noon interpretation of the phrase, they may be treated to one in the more traditional footballing sense. Due to the reluctance of top-flight professional clubs to play more matches than are strictly necessary, replays are no longer played from the fifth round on. In the event of a draw, extra-time will be played, followed by pistols at around 10.15pm (GMT) if required. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Barry Glendenning from 7.45pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea 1-2 Liverpool.

Johnson appeared alongside <strong>Prof Chris Whitty</strong>, the government\u2019s chief medical officer, and <strong>Sir Patrick Vallance</strong>, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. To a large extent the PM allowed the two officials to answer the more technical questions, and, perhaps not surprisingly, they appeared to have a better grasp of the detail.</p> <p>Here are the main points from the briefing.<br></p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson sought to reassure the public that the government is prepared for a widespread coronavirus outbreak that could have far-reaching consequences for Britain.</strong> He said the government was publishing its coronavirus action plan and that it had four strands:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The plan has four strands. Containing the virus, delaying its spread, researching its origins and cure, and finally mitigating the impact should the virus become more widespread. That is, contain, delay, research, mitigate.</p> </blockquote> <p>Johnson said it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that more people would contract the illness, and he stressed that the government was now preparing \u201cfor all eventualities\u201d. But he said little directly about what emergency measures might be introduced, and he avoiding discussing the possible fatality rate \u2013 even though his two advisers made it clear that potentially the number of people at risk was very high. Johnson said that most people would not be affected. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me be absolutely clear that for the overwhelming majority of people who contract the virus this will be a mild disease from which they will speedily and fully recover as we have already seen.</p> </blockquote> <p>He insisted that the country was going to get through the coronavirus, \u201cand get through it in good shape\u201d. And he stressed the importance of people washing their hands.<br></p> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty and Vallance said that under a \u201creasonable worst case scenario\u201d 1% of people getting coronavirus might die.</strong> Near the start of the press conference Whitty said that coronavirus had a 1% death rate based on the Chinese experience. And he said that there was a \u201csignificant ramp up\u201d in the death rate for those over 80. Whitty commended this graphic from<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-does-the-coronavirus-death-rate-compare-with-flu-and-how-long-will-the-outbreak-last-tlpnwxg89\"> today\u2019s Times (paywall) </a>showing coronavirus death rates.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a60acf67d94161df009ced28d9734cd441b7941\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a60acf67d94161df009ced28d9734cd441b7941/0_0_736_456/500.jpg\" alt=\"Coronavirus mortality rates.\" width=\"500\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coronavirus mortality rates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Times</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Whitty also said that the 1% Chinese mortality rate figure might be overstating the true rate because of the number of people getting the virus but not displaying symptoms. And he implied that the survival rate might be higher in the UK because of its health system being better than China\u2019s. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The exact percentages will depend on a lot of factors - including the healthcare system you have in place, so I would not expect ... the numbers we are seeing in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a> automatically to read over to the UK.</p> </blockquote> <p>The two advisers did not predict what proportion of the population might contract coronavirus on the event of containment failing.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said that, although the government was planning to legislate to give it powers in relation to schools, borders and quarantine, these powers would be \u201cexceptional and short-term\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty and Vallance said that, in the event of coronavirus spreading, ministers would be asked to choose from a series of far-reaching proposals that could be taken to limit the spread of the disease.</strong> They did not go into great detail about what measures might be included, although they conceded that some of them could be highly disruptive. They said modelling would be used to decide what was best. But they also said it would be a mistake to introduce these restrictions too soon, because they said that could lead to people ignoring the rules at the point where they were needed most.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Vallance said a decision to give up trying to contain the virus, and to move to the focus on mitigation, could be taken by a group of countries at the same time.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty and Vallance played down the prospect of widespread school closures being ordered</strong>. Whitty said that the evidence from China suggested children were less likely to be affected by coronavirus than adults. Vallance said there might be a case for closing schools to stop the disease spreading, and to \u201cpull down the peak\u201d. But he said closing schools would impact on the NHS, because staff with school-age children would have to stay at home.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty said the government was trying to delay infection reaching its peak until the late spring and the summer, when the NHS would be in a better position to cope. </strong>He said that, to achieve this, the government might need to do three things: 1) introduce \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures (he did not elaborate); 2) isolate older people; and 3) reconfigure public services.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty signalled that the UK could be affected by coronavirus for another six months.</strong> He said he expected it to take two to three months to reach its peak from its outbreak, and for the virus to then take another two to three months to decline.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty and Vallance played down the prospect of people having to cancel holidays.</strong> They said that, at the moment, they were not advising people to cancel their plans, other than in specific countries covered by health advice. And they said that, once the virus had spread widely, there would be no point in avoiding foreign countries anyway. But Whitty said people might want to consider the risk of travelling to countries with a weaker health service than the UK\u2019s with coronavirus at its peak.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty came close to ruling out any attempt being tried to isolate cities, following the Chinese model</strong>. He said this would only make sense in a situation where the virus was starting in one place, with a high transmission rate, and where it was not present elsewhere. (That is not the situation in the UK.) At the weekend Matt Hancock, the health secretary, refused to rule out cities being isolated to prevent the spread of the disease.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said the government was considering \u201call reasonable options\u201d that could help self-employed workers who need to give up work because they are self-isolating.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty said specific measures were likely to be proposed for care homes.</strong> He did not give details of what these might be.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said he thought the NHS was \u201cwell capable of handling the most tremendous pressures\u201d, such as the ones it was likely to face, although he refused to go into detail of extent to which normal health services might be disrupted</strong>. But he did say, if the virus spreads widely, people might have to be \u201cself-restraining\u201d and avoid services like the GP and 111 where possible.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said that, when deciding how to balance the need to protect the public against the need to reduce disruption, he would be guided by scientific advice.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson did not rule out the army being used to help out the police or other public services at the peak of the outbreak.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said he had not given up shaking people\u2019s hands.</strong> On a visit to a hospital last week where he thinks coronavirus patients were being treated, he shook hands with everybody, he said. \u201cOur judgment is washing your hands is the crucial thing,\u201d he said.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Vallance said that there was no need for people to panic buy. </strong>Asked if the government was worried about this, he said the government expected people to take logical decisions.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty said the crisis was likely to lead to \u201cextraordinary outbreaks of altruism\u201d rather than widespread outbreaks of antisocial behaviour.</strong></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd75780859586d069ccd9d3e98a86ffa764bccdc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd75780859586d069ccd9d3e98a86ffa764bccdc/0_327_6517_3910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Left to right: Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer;

He was even allowed to appear on the Today programme, with the No 10 ministerial ban temporary lifted due to the severity of the crisis. My colleague <strong>Ben Quinn</strong> was covering Hancock\u2019s comments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/03/coronavirus-live-updates-china-latest-news-us-australia-deaths-markets-italy-iran-update-cases-italy-south-korea-japan?page=with:block-5e5e062a8f0811db2fb028ef#liveblog-navigation\">on the coronavirus live blog</a>, but here is a quick summary of what he said.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Hancock said at this point the government was advising people to carry on with normal life.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Right now, that is what people should be doing and otherwise going about their normal daily life because we want to minimise the level of disruption, subject to doing the things we need to do to keep people safe.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that effective action to contain the spread of coronavirus was still possible.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>But he also said the government plan being published this morning would explain what might have to happen if the spread becomes a pandemic.</strong> He said: <br></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s quite unusual for a government to publish a plan with things in it we hope we won\u2019t have to do.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said at this point he could not say if events like the London Marathon would have to be cancelled. </strong>Asked about the marathon, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s far too early to be able to tell in that instance.</p> <p>What we can say for sure is that, right now, we do not recommend the cancelling of mass events, and schools as well should not be closing unless there is both a positive case and the school has had the advice to close from Public Health England.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said people who had to self-isolate would qualify for sick pay, even if they were healthy</strong>. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Self-isolating for medical reasons if you are healthy counts as being sick in the legislation.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He hinted that the government was considering what might be done to help self-employed people who have to give up work because they are self-isolating</strong>. Asked about people in this category, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s a system in place through DWP [the Department of Work and Pensions] to help people who are in difficult circumstances because of that, and we keep these things under review. I talked to the welfare secretary [Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey] yesterday about it. Of course we keep that under review.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He accepted that the government had to make a trade-off between protecting people and allowing economic life to continue.</strong> Asked if he accepted that there was a trade-off, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To a degree. The answer to the question, which obviously we\u2019ve been thinking very hard about, and the prime minister is leading the thinking on this, is that we will be guided by the science, and that we will minimise social and economic disruption, subject to keeping people safe.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the experts were not advising people to give up shaking hands, because the health impacts of hand shaking were \u201cnegligible\u201d.</strong> But it was important for people to wash their hands regularly, he said.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a796ae221f5eea56f3a896c2c42b2e03e48e26f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a796ae221f5eea56f3a896c2c42b2e03e48e26f8/0_56_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hancock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T11:12:10.253Z\">at 11.12am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5e15be8f08e1332474e2f2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T09:06:07.935Z\">9.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour facing one of worst local elections in recent history in 2020, leaked party report suggests</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labour\u2019s general election result was the worst for the party, in terms of seats won, since 1935, but there is more electoral misery to come in the local elections, according to an internal party report leaked to the BBC\u2019s <strong>Iain Watson</strong>. The document says the party is facing \u201cone of our worst local election performances in recent history\u201d in England and should brace itself for the loss of \u201chard working councillors\u201d across the country.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51709639\">his report </a>Watson goes on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The document examines three different scenarios, based on varying polling methods - and taking into account Labour\u2019s general election performance.</p> <p>These suggest the so-called red wall, breached so spectacularly by the Conservatives in December\u2019s general election, is continuing to crumble in some areas.</p> <p>In every scenario, Labour would lose control of Plymouth, Harlow in Essex, Amber Valley in Derbyshire and West Lancashire. In two scenarios Southampton would be lost and in the worst-case scenario, the bastion of Sheffield, held by Labour for most of the last 75 years, would also fall ...</p> <p>The document suggests that the situation could be even worse as the party\u2019s polling hasn\u2019t taken into account the recent Conservative poll \u201cbounce\u201d but it adds that it can not yet estimate the effect of a change of leadership on the election results.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, of course, by the time the local elections are held in May everything could change because the coronavirus outbreak is likely to have disrupted ordinary life to a remarkable degree - with political consequence that, at this point, are just unknowable. One consequence is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/local-elections-could-be-delayed-by-coronavirus-outbreak\">the local elections could even be delayed.</a></p> <p>The big event at Westminster today will be the publication of the government\u2019s coronavirus action plan.

In a press conference marking the publication of the plan Boris Johnson sought to reassure Britons, saying that the government was prepared for all eventualities, and that country would \u201cget through [this outbreak] in good shape\u201d and that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of people who caught coronavirus would only suffer a mild disease from which they would recover fully. At the event, where he was flanked by Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Johnson did not discuss how many people might die if, as expected, efforts to contain the virus fail, and he would not discuss in detail the emergency measures being considered to limit the impact of the disease. Whitty and Vallance were more forthcoming, and they confirmed that under a \u201creasonable worst case scenario\u201d 1% of those affected could end up dying. See 12.49pm. For more on coronvirus, do read our coronavirus live blog. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has told MPs that in the light of the coronavirus outbreak the government may review the rule saying workers need a sick note from a GP if they need to take sick leave for more than seven days. (See 1.33pm.) Boris Johnson is to take paternity leave after the birth of his child with his partner, Carrie Symonds, in the summer. The Labour party has called for the home secretary, Priti Patel, to stand down while a lawyer-led \u201cgenuinely independent\u201d inquiry is carried out into bullying allegations against her. The Conservative MP Bob Seely has asked BT to investigate whether using Huawei is compliant with its anti-slavery policy after an Australian thinktank alleged that some of the Chinese firm\u2019s subcontractors used forced labour from the country\u2019s Muslim minority. Labour is expecting to do badly in the local elections, according to a leaked party memo. (See 9.06am and 2.46pm.) That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. More than 40% of Conservative party members do not believe in man-made climate change, a survey for the ConservativeHome website has found. Some 49% of respondents said that global warming was happening and that human activity was driving it. But 10% said they did not think global warming was happening, and another 33% said that it was happening, but that human activity was not driving it. More than 1,000 Tory members participated in the survey for the website, which regularly posts the findings from its membership polls. Leadership election results suggest the findings are a good guide to the views of party members as a whole. In the past Boris Johnson himself has claimed that the main cause of global warming is solar activity, not man-made carbon emissions, although that is not a view that he expresses now. The survey findings illustrate the extent to which Conservative party mirrors Donald Trump\u2019s Republican party in the US, where climate science denial is also commonplace. Of course, the worldwide scientific consensus that human activity is responsible for global warming is overwhelming. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM), has said he thinks there is a \u201cgrowing possibility\u201d of a no-deal Brexit at the end of this year, the Irish Independent\u2019s Hugh O\u2019Connell reports. By no-deal Brexit, he means the UK and the EU failing to agree a trade deal, leading to the UK having to trade with the EU on WTO terms from January next year. The UK government refuses to describe this as \u201cno deal\u201d, and describes this outcome instead as having a trade arrangement akin to Australia\u2019s. The Sunday Times\u2019s Gabriel Pogrund has posted on Twitter a copy of the leaked internal Labour report saying the party is expecting to lose seats in this spring\u2019s local elections. It was covered by the BBC this morning. See 9.06am. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant make a point of order. He says many of the toilets on the parliamentary estate do not have soap. Will the authorities sort this out so the Commons can set an example. Dame Rosie Winterton, the deputy speaker, says the House of Commons commission will discuss this at its next meeting. Labour\u2019s Vicky Foxcroft asks what will the government do for people who do not get sick pay. Hancock says the government is keeping this issue under review. Hancock says the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, will provide a private briefing for MPs later this afternoon if they want more information about the coronavirus outbreak. Lynn Davidson, an MoD special adviser who confronted Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser Dominic Cummings over his \u201cunkindness\u201d two weeks ago, has been removed from her job, Alex Wickham reports in a BuzzFeed story. He says that No 10 tried to move her to another department, and that she is now leaving government. And here is some reaction from the Labour whips office. The Green MP Caroline Lucas asks about reports that coronavirus is leading to people becoming the victim of racist attacks. Does Hancock agree that terms like the Wuhan virus should be avoided? Hancock says he agrees. Labour\u2019s Lloyd Russell-Moyle says the government should ensure that people can wash their hands whenever they enter a public building. Hancock says he will look into this. He says what matters is being able to use existing sinks. Hancock says, while using hand sanitiser is a good thing, it is not nearly as good as washing your hands with soap for 20 seconds. Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper says many people care for elderly relatives. If they have to self-isolate, what will happen to them, and to the elderly people who rely on their help? Hancock says the government is very concerned about this issue. It will be issuing guidance to care providers soon, he says. He says the government wants to make it easier to \u201conboard\u201d volunteers. But volunteers are not the only solution to this problem, he says. The Conservative Craig Mackinlay asks Hancock if he will ensure that pharmacies maintain supplies of basic medicines. Hancock says the government will do this. He says the Brexit no-deal planning helped in this regard. Here is a gov.uk note about the current rules relating to sick leave. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, implied a moment ago (see 1.22pm) that the current rule saying that self-certification can only last for seven days, and that people need a sick note from a GP if they need to be off sick longer, could be revised in the light of coronavirus. The SNP\u2019s health spokesperson Philippa Whitford says self-certification for sickness only lasts for seven days. Yet self-isolation is supposed to last for 14 days. Hancock says this is one reason why this issue is being kept under review. Hancock is now responding to Ashworth. He says people who need to self-isolate to protect others count as being sick. They do not need to visit a doctor. He says other points about under review, and he says he \u201cbroadly agrees\u201d with the point Ashworth made about ensuring people do not lose out if they are ill. On the EU and its pandemic early warning system, Hancock says some of the newspaper reports on this have not been accurate. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, says the opposition backs the government\u2019s plan. But he asks how people will be able to get a sick note if they are supposed to be self-isolating, and not visiting the GP. And he asks for an assurance that all workers will be able to get the sick pay they need. The government should legislate for this, he says. He says Labour would help get the bill through. Ashworth says coronavirus will lead to greater demands on the NHS. Will the government provide an emergency funding increase for the NHS? Will the government consult with the opposition on the emergency powers it plans to take? And why is the government walking away from the EU\u2019s pandemic early warning system? Ashworth ends by saying the opposition will work constructively with the government on addressing this problem. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is making a Commons statement now on the coronavirus action plan. He says this disease is \u201cincreasingly serious\u201d. As of 9am this morning, there were 51 confirmed cases in the UK, he says. He says it is more likely that we will see widespread transmission in this country. At some point scientific advice may conclude it is impossible to contain the virus any further, he says. You can read the government\u2019s coronavirus action plan here (pdf). Here are the main points from the Boris Johnson press conference held this morning to announce the UK government\u2019s coronavirus action plan. Johnson appeared alongside Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. To a large extent the PM allowed the two officials to answer the more technical questions, and, perhaps not surprisingly, they appeared to have a better grasp of the detail. Here are the main points from the briefing. Johnson sought to reassure the public that the government is prepared for a widespread coronavirus outbreak that could have far-reaching consequences for Britain. He said the government was publishing its coronavirus action plan and that it had four strands: The plan has four strands. Containing the virus, delaying its spread, researching its origins and cure, and finally mitigating the impact should the virus become more widespread. That is, contain, delay, research, mitigate. Johnson said it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that more people would contract the illness, and he stressed that the government was now preparing \u201cfor all eventualities\u201d. But he said little directly about what emergency measures might be introduced, and he avoiding discussing the possible fatality rate \u2013 even though his two advisers made it clear that potentially the number of people at risk was very high. Johnson said that most people would not be affected. He said: Let me be absolutely clear that for the overwhelming majority of people who contract the virus this will be a mild disease from which they will speedily and fully recover as we have already seen. He insisted that the country was going to get through the coronavirus, \u201cand get through it in good shape\u201d. And he stressed the importance of people washing their hands. Whitty and Vallance said that under a \u201creasonable worst case scenario\u201d 1% of people getting coronavirus might die. Near the start of the press conference Whitty said that coronavirus had a 1% death rate based on the Chinese experience. And he said that there was a \u201csignificant ramp up\u201d in the death rate for those over 80. Whitty commended this graphic from today\u2019s Times (paywall) showing coronavirus death rates. But Whitty also said that the 1% Chinese mortality rate figure might be overstating the true rate because of the number of people getting the virus but not displaying symptoms. And he implied that the survival rate might be higher in the UK because of its health system being better than China\u2019s. He said: The exact percentages will depend on a lot of factors - including the healthcare system you have in place, so I would not expect ... the numbers we are seeing in China automatically to read over to the UK. The two advisers did not predict what proportion of the population might contract coronavirus on the event of containment failing. Johnson said that, although the government was planning to legislate to give it powers in relation to schools, borders and quarantine, these powers would be \u201cexceptional and short-term\u201d. Whitty and Vallance said that, in the event of coronavirus spreading, ministers would be asked to choose from a series of far-reaching proposals that could be taken to limit the spread of the disease. They did not go into great detail about what measures might be included, although they conceded that some of them could be highly disruptive. They said modelling would be used to decide what was best. But they also said it would be a mistake to introduce these restrictions too soon, because they said that could lead to people ignoring the rules at the point where they were needed most. Vallance said a decision to give up trying to contain the virus, and to move to the focus on mitigation, could be taken by a group of countries at the same time. Whitty and Vallance played down the prospect of widespread school closures being ordered. Whitty said that the evidence from China suggested children were less likely to be affected by coronavirus than adults. Vallance said there might be a case for closing schools to stop the disease spreading, and to \u201cpull down the peak\u201d. But he said closing schools would impact on the NHS, because staff with school-age children would have to stay at home. Whitty said the government was trying to delay infection reaching its peak until the late spring and the summer, when the NHS would be in a better position to cope. He said that, to achieve this, the government might need to do three things: 1) introduce \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures (he did not elaborate); 2) isolate older people; and 3) reconfigure public services. Whitty signalled that the UK could be affected by coronavirus for another six months. He said he expected it to take two to three months to reach its peak from its outbreak, and for the virus to then take another two to three months to decline. Whitty and Vallance played down the prospect of people having to cancel holidays. They said that, at the moment, they were not advising people to cancel their plans, other than in specific countries covered by health advice. And they said that, once the virus had spread widely, there would be no point in avoiding foreign countries anyway. But Whitty said people might want to consider the risk of travelling to countries with a weaker health service than the UK\u2019s with coronavirus at its peak. Whitty came close to ruling out any attempt being tried to isolate cities, following the Chinese model. He said this would only make sense in a situation where the virus was starting in one place, with a high transmission rate, and where it was not present elsewhere. (That is not the situation in the UK.) At the weekend Matt Hancock, the health secretary, refused to rule out cities being isolated to prevent the spread of the disease. Johnson said the government was considering \u201call reasonable options\u201d that could help self-employed workers who need to give up work because they are self-isolating. Whitty said specific measures were likely to be proposed for care homes. He did not give details of what these might be. Johnson said he thought the NHS was \u201cwell capable of handling the most tremendous pressures\u201d, such as the ones it was likely to face, although he refused to go into detail of extent to which normal health services might be disrupted. But he did say, if the virus spreads widely, people might have to be \u201cself-restraining\u201d and avoid services like the GP and 111 where possible. Johnson said that, when deciding how to balance the need to protect the public against the need to reduce disruption, he would be guided by scientific advice. Johnson did not rule out the army being used to help out the police or other public services at the peak of the outbreak. Johnson said he had not given up shaking people\u2019s hands. On a visit to a hospital last week where he thinks coronavirus patients were being treated, he shook hands with everybody, he said. \u201cOur judgment is washing your hands is the crucial thing,\u201d he said. Vallance said that there was no need for people to panic buy. Asked if the government was worried about this, he said the government expected people to take logical decisions. Whitty said the crisis was likely to lead to \u201cextraordinary outbreaks of altruism\u201d rather than widespread outbreaks of antisocial behaviour. Boris Johnson is about to start his press conference on the coronavirus action plan. We will be covering it here, on our coronavirus outbreak live blog. And here is ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen with another line from the coronavirus action plan. And here is a summary of the coronavirus action plan from the BBC\u2019s Chris Mason. Here is my colleague Kate Proctor\u2019s report on the government\u2019s coronavirus action plans. And this is how it starts. Police and fire services will only respond to the most serious call-outs if their staff fall ill through coronavirus, the government warned on Tuesday, in a key planning document setting out how ministers would deal with an escalating outbreak. The 28-page action plan envisages that up to a fifth of the national workforce could be absent from work, schools could close and elderly people would be advised not to attend social gatherings. The measures would only be rolled out if the virus moved beyond the currently designated \u201ccontain phase\u201d. The advice was released in the Coronavirus: Action Plan on Tuesday as the number of cases in the UK stood at 40. If the illness moves into the \u201cdelay\u201d and \u201cmitigate\u201d phases, retired NHS staff could be brought back to help care for patients, the document says. \u201cWith a significant loss of officers and staff, the police would concentrate on responding to serious crimes and maintaining public order,\u201d it said. It states there could be an increase in deaths arising from the outbreak, particularly among vulnerable and elderly groups, and that local authorities will need help to deal with that challenge, presumably in relation to morgue capacity. This is from the Labour group on the Local Government Association on the leaked Labour report saying the party is expected to do badly in this spring\u2019s local elections. (See 9.06am.) Q: Are you considering loans to banks or cuts to interest rates? And how will you know when you need to act? Carney says the bank is considering its options. And it is \u201csighted\u201d on what the chancellor is planning for his budget, he says. He says he expects the collective international response to be \u201cboth powerful and timely\u201d. At the Treasury committee, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, is taking questions about coronavirus. Labour\u2019s Liz Kendall is asking the questions. Q: Are you updating your forecasts in the light of coronavirus? Carney says the bank is in the process of doing that now. He says the impact of the virus is potentially large. It is reasonable to expect that the impact of coronavirus in the places where it has been spread will be felt for one quarter (ie, for three months), or potentially for two quarters. Carney says health is paramount; economic considerations should be secondary. He says the UK is one of the most open economies in the world. But there are differences from the financial crash of 2008, he says. He says banking is part of the solution, not part of the problem, this time. And he says household debt relative to income is lower than it was in 2008. He says the \u201cpolicy response\u201d should involve ensuring people do not have to draw on all their \u201cbuffers\u201d (ie, their savings). He says there will be disruption, but not destruction. The shock could be large. But the persistence of that impact can and should be different from 2008, he says. Carney says he does not expect coronavirus economic shock to be as bad as 2008. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has said Priti Patel should stand down as home secretary while she is subject to a Cabinet Office inquiry into allegations she bullied civil servants. Speaking on the Today programme this morning, Abbott said: You can\u2019t have a government that\u2019s at war with its civil servants. We want a genuinely independent inquiry \u2013 a lawyer-led inquiry and something that can be seen to be independent. I\u2019m afraid it would be better if she stepped down. We are calling on her to step down whilst the inquiry goes on. According to this Reuters report, in a speech to the World Trade Organization today Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, will say that the UK will \u201cmake the case to update the WTO rulebook to tackle underlying trade tensions, such as industrial subsidies\u201d. David Henig, who heads the UK Trade Policy Project, finds this hard to square with the UK\u2019s refusal to accept level playing field rules in the trade deal it is negotiating with the EU. Here is the full text of Mark Carney\u2019s opening statement to the committee about coronavirus. And here is an extract. The Bank of England\u2019s role is to help UK businesses and households manage through an economic shock that could prove large but will ultimately be temporary. The bank will take all necessary steps to support the UK economy and financial system, consistent with its statutory responsibilities. We are monitoring the situation closely across all our functions and ensuring all necessary contingency plans are in place. Carney told the Treasury committee that the Bank of England\u2019s role in the coronavirus outbreak was \u201cto help UK businesses and households manage through an economic shock that could prove large but will ultimately be temporary\u201d. He said the bank would \u201ctake all necessary steps to support the UK economy and financial system consistent with its statutory responsibilities\u201d. Mark Carney, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, has just started giving evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. He starts with a prepared statement about coronavirus. There is a live feed here. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, gave a round of interviews this morning about the government\u2019s coronavirus action plan. He was even allowed to appear on the Today programme, with the No 10 ministerial ban temporary lifted due to the severity of the crisis. My colleague Ben Quinn was covering Hancock\u2019s comments on the coronavirus live blog, but here is a quick summary of what he said. Hancock said at this point the government was advising people to carry on with normal life. He said: Right now, that is what people should be doing and otherwise going about their normal daily life because we want to minimise the level of disruption, subject to doing the things we need to do to keep people safe. He said that effective action to contain the spread of coronavirus was still possible. But he also said the government plan being published this morning would explain what might have to happen if the spread becomes a pandemic. He said: It\u2019s quite unusual for a government to publish a plan with things in it we hope we won\u2019t have to do. He said at this point he could not say if events like the London Marathon would have to be cancelled. Asked about the marathon, he said: It\u2019s far too early to be able to tell in that instance. What we can say for sure is that, right now, we do not recommend the cancelling of mass events, and schools as well should not be closing unless there is both a positive case and the school has had the advice to close from Public Health England. He said people who had to self-isolate would qualify for sick pay, even if they were healthy. He said: Self-isolating for medical reasons if you are healthy counts as being sick in the legislation. He hinted that the government was considering what might be done to help self-employed people who have to give up work because they are self-isolating. Asked about people in this category, he said: There\u2019s a system in place through DWP [the Department of Work and Pensions] to help people who are in difficult circumstances because of that, and we keep these things under review. I talked to the welfare secretary [Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey] yesterday about it. Of course we keep that under review. He accepted that the government had to make a trade-off between protecting people and allowing economic life to continue. Asked if he accepted that there was a trade-off, he replied: To a degree. The answer to the question, which obviously we\u2019ve been thinking very hard about, and the prime minister is leading the thinking on this, is that we will be guided by the science, and that we will minimise social and economic disruption, subject to keeping people safe. He said the experts were not advising people to give up shaking hands, because the health impacts of hand shaking were \u201cnegligible\u201d. But it was important for people to wash their hands regularly, he said. Labour\u2019s general election result was the worst for the party, in terms of seats won, since 1935, but there is more electoral misery to come in the local elections, according to an internal party report leaked to the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson. The document says the party is facing \u201cone of our worst local election performances in recent history\u201d in England and should brace itself for the loss of \u201chard working councillors\u201d across the country. In his report Watson goes on: The document examines three different scenarios, based on varying polling methods - and taking into account Labour\u2019s general election performance. These suggest the so-called red wall, breached so spectacularly by the Conservatives in December\u2019s general election, is continuing to crumble in some areas. In every scenario, Labour would lose control of Plymouth, Harlow in Essex, Amber Valley in Derbyshire and West Lancashire. In two scenarios Southampton would be lost and in the worst-case scenario, the bastion of Sheffield, held by Labour for most of the last 75 years, would also fall ... The document suggests that the situation could be even worse as the party\u2019s polling hasn\u2019t taken into account the recent Conservative poll \u201cbounce\u201d but it adds that it can not yet estimate the effect of a change of leadership on the election results. But, of course, by the time the local elections are held in May everything could change because the coronavirus outbreak is likely to have disrupted ordinary life to a remarkable degree - with political consequence that, at this point, are just unknowable. One consequence is that the local elections could even be delayed. The big event at Westminster today will be the publication of the government\u2019s coronavirus action plan. Boris Johnson is holding a press conference to announce it this morning, and then Matt Hancock, the health secretary, will be making a statement in the Commons. Mostly we will be covering these developments on our coronavirus outbreak live blog - my colleague Ben Quinn is writing it at the moment, but I will be contributing - but there will be some mention of developments here too. Here is Ben\u2019s blog. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 9.30am: Mark Carney, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. Around 10.30am: Johnson is due to hold a press conference as the government publishes its coronavirus action plan. After 12.30pm: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, gives a statement to MPs about the coronavirus action plan. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Conservatives and liberals in the eastern German state of Thuringia are preparing to abstain from or boycott the election for a new premier after the decision by a far-right populist party to put up its most controversial figurehead as a candidate. Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke announced his candidacy for Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) less than an hour before the closing deadline on Monday and will go head to head with Bodo Ramelow, of the far-left Die Linke, in the ballot on Wednesday night. Members of Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the pro-business Free Democratic party (FDP) have said they will abstain because they cannot vote for an extreme candidate on either the left or the right. Last month centre-right politicians in Thuringia used votes from the AfD to oust Ramelow as premier. That resulted in the resignation of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who was Merkel\u2019s successor as CDU general secretary. A suspected case of coronavirus could yet derail Wednesday\u2019s vote. A member of the CDU who sits in the Thuringia parliament is being tested for the virus. If his results come back positive, officials will have little choice but to postpone. \u201cIf the suspicions [of coronavirus] are confirmed, the vote for a new premier planned for this Wednesday will have to be postponed,\u201d said the parliamentary president, Birgit Keller.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The death toll, provided by officials on Tuesday night, marked an increase of 27 in 24 hours.

The number of people who have recovered from the illness has more than doubled to 160.</p> \n<p>Researchers at Sacco hospital last week isolated a strain of the virus from an Italian patient, which suggests Covid-19 may have circulated in northern Italy for weeks before it was detected.</p> \n<p>Galli said: \u201cIt has been claimed that the so-called Italian virus is very different from the Chinese one. These are simply rumours. We are currently mapping out the sequences and only afterwards can we know.</p> \n<p>\u201cObviously, since it is an RNA virus, it is expected to be at least a little different from the Chinese one. RNA viruses typically change: between each viral copy and its template there will be a few differences, like a single nucleic acid mutation. But only once we have the sequences can we begin to make comparisons.\u201d</p> \n<p>Italy had experienced the coronavirus outbreak despite being one of the first countries that not only closed contact with Wuhan but also all air contact with China, he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cSome countries have accused us of taking too drastic measures. Yet even taking drastic measures, proactively, does not seem to have been enough,\u201d Galli said. \u201cWhat is certain is that we had no way of predicting the outbreak in the so-called red zone or identifying it before sick people appeared.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many people could reach Italy from other countries that had not closed direct flights from China, Galli said, adding that \u201coutbreaks that will eventually appear elsewhere in Europe\u201d may not necessarily come from Italy.</p> \n<p>\u201cLet us remember the case of a person who had travelled from Singapore, of British nationality, who then went to visit friends in France and infected them,\u201d he said. \u201cIf such a thing happened in other parts of Europe, it means we might end up with other red zones.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>A doctor in Italy who is recovering from the virus at home told the Guardian she had only mild symptoms. She lives with her parents and brother, all of whom tested negative. She will be tested again on Friday, after two weeks in quarantine.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the majority of cases, people heal,\u201d said the doctor, who asked not to be named. \u201cThe problem is we don\u2019t have the mechanisms to protect those who are most vulnerable: the elderly or those with serious health problems. But we need to be objective \u2013 an increase in new cases doesn\u2019t mean an increase in serious cases.\u201d</p>",

Authorities say the majority of people who tested positive in other regions were travelling from Lombardy or had been in the north for a few weeks before the outbreak. Of those infected, 1034 are in hospital \u2013 229 in intensive care \u2013 and 1,229 are recovering at home. The number of people who have recovered from the illness has more than doubled to 160. Researchers at Sacco hospital last week isolated a strain of the virus from an Italian patient, which suggests Covid-19 may have circulated in northern Italy for weeks before it was detected. Galli said: \u201cIt has been claimed that the so-called Italian virus is very different from the Chinese one. These are simply rumours. We are currently mapping out the sequences and only afterwards can we know. \u201cObviously, since it is an RNA virus, it is expected to be at least a little different from the Chinese one. RNA viruses typically change: between each viral copy and its template there will be a few differences, like a single nucleic acid mutation. But only once we have the sequences can we begin to make comparisons.\u201d Italy had experienced the coronavirus outbreak despite being one of the first countries that not only closed contact with Wuhan but also all air contact with China, he said. \u201cSome countries have accused us of taking too drastic measures. Yet even taking drastic measures, proactively, does not seem to have been enough,\u201d Galli said. \u201cWhat is certain is that we had no way of predicting the outbreak in the so-called red zone or identifying it before sick people appeared.\u201d Many people could reach Italy from other countries that had not closed direct flights from China, Galli said, adding that \u201coutbreaks that will eventually appear elsewhere in Europe\u201d may not necessarily come from Italy. \u201cLet us remember the case of a person who had travelled from Singapore, of British nationality, who then went to visit friends in France and infected them,\u201d he said. \u201cIf such a thing happened in other parts of Europe, it means we might end up with other red zones.\u201d A doctor in Italy who is recovering from the virus at home told the Guardian she had only mild symptoms. She lives with her parents and brother, all of whom tested negative. She will be tested again on Friday, after two weeks in quarantine. \u201cIn the majority of cases, people heal,\u201d said the doctor, who asked not to be named. \u201cThe problem is we don\u2019t have the mechanisms to protect those who are most vulnerable: the elderly or those with serious health problems. But we need to be objective \u2013 an increase in new cases doesn\u2019t mean an increase in serious cases.\u201d",

While Italy has placed a number of towns in lockdown, most countries have stopped short of following China by imposing mass quarantines, instead it has discouraged large gatherings, delayed sporting events and banned arrivals from virus-hit nations.

      "body": "<p>In a brief but doomed attempt to dance around a looming deadline earlier this week I found myself playing an online game called Town of Idiots. The idea of the game itself is very neat \u2013 you and 16 other players have to all figure out which roles have been assigned to you before either the devil or the mafia murder you in the night, and some people are lying and some are not \u2013 but it is near instantly ruined because the only way you can communicate with other players is through a completely uncensored, unmoderated chat room, like the ones of the internet of yore, and that means what should be a wholesome whodunnit swiftly devolves into a load of 15-year-old American children competing with each other to see who can send the most shocking slurs. It reminded me of the first iteration of the internet \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/01/geocities-archive-netscape-browser-first-web-suburbs-aol/580285/\" title=\"\">Geocities</a> and <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/07/newgrounds-flash-animations-will-survive-flashs-death.html\" title=\"\">Newgrounds</a> and anonymity and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPPj6viIBmU\" title=\"\">Star Wars Kid</a> \u2013 and how truly bad it all was.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the two weeks since 'be kind' started being chanted like a mantra, it has quickly become a strangely weaponised thing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the turn of the century, to shock people online, you had to copy and paste an all-caps missive about hell into an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat\" title=\"\">Internet Relay Chat (IRC) chatroom</a> until you were banned by a sleepy moderator. With filters, it\u2019s harder to be obnoxious in the same way today, so the goalposts have shifted: now you simply go on Twitter and say \u201cI think we should let immigrants into the country\u201d with your real name, and people with poppies superimposed over their profile picture year-round tell you what an idiot you are, for weeks and weeks and weeks, and find your family on Facebook and tell them, for weeks and weeks and weeks, until you delete all traces of yourself from ever existing in the digital space and throw your phone into a body of water. It doesn\u2019t feel like progress, but it is.</p> <p>It\u2019s been an interesting week for The Internet, because it\u2019s been learning things that I learned when I was somewhere between four and five years old. So: this week, in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/explained-uk-coronavirus-action-plan\" title=\"\">the coronavirus epidemic</a>, The Internet has learned about washing your hands after going on the Tube or using the toilet; viral tweets in gentle, self-care tones have been going round reminding people to, you know, use soap and water to wash your hands every time you go to the bathroom. Who was not already doing this?

      "bodyText": "In a brief but doomed attempt to dance around a looming deadline earlier this week I found myself playing an online game called Town of Idiots. The idea of the game itself is very neat \u2013 you and 16 other players have to all figure out which roles have been assigned to you before either the devil or the mafia murder you in the night, and some people are lying and some are not \u2013 but it is near instantly ruined because the only way you can communicate with other players is through a completely uncensored, unmoderated chat room, like the ones of the internet of yore, and that means what should be a wholesome whodunnit swiftly devolves into a load of 15-year-old American children competing with each other to see who can send the most shocking slurs. It reminded me of the first iteration of the internet \u2013 Geocities and Newgrounds and anonymity and Star Wars Kid \u2013 and how truly bad it all was. At the turn of the century, to shock people online, you had to copy and paste an all-caps missive about hell into an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) chatroom until you were banned by a sleepy moderator. With filters, it\u2019s harder to be obnoxious in the same way today, so the goalposts have shifted: now you simply go on Twitter and say \u201cI think we should let immigrants into the country\u201d with your real name, and people with poppies superimposed over their profile picture year-round tell you what an idiot you are, for weeks and weeks and weeks, and find your family on Facebook and tell them, for weeks and weeks and weeks, until you delete all traces of yourself from ever existing in the digital space and throw your phone into a body of water. It doesn\u2019t feel like progress, but it is. It\u2019s been an interesting week for The Internet, because it\u2019s been learning things that I learned when I was somewhere between four and five years old. So: this week, in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic, The Internet has learned about washing your hands after going on the Tube or using the toilet; viral tweets in gentle, self-care tones have been going round reminding people to, you know, use soap and water to wash your hands every time you go to the bathroom. Who was not already doing this? How many of them have I shaken hands with in my lifetime? The second thing The Internet has learned about is the performative empathy movement \u201cbe kind\u201d, which in the two weeks since it started being chanted like a mantra has quickly become a strangely weaponised thing wielded by both the left (who traditionally lean kinder anyway, but now are making more of a concerted effort at kindness, because it means they can police other people for not being kind enough, a sort of kindness hall monitor kink that taps into a lot of the things the left enjoys \u2013 chiding, moral superiority, a feeling of authority without the actual power of it) and the right (who only invoke it when someone swears at them on the internet, at which point they say, \u201cWow! So much for kindness!\u201d). It\u2019s in this way that even typing the word \u201ckindness\u201d has become a sort of cheat code for trial-by-social-media, where disagreeable opinions that are couched in tones deemed either too kind or not kind enough are attacked for their kindness content and not for the actual opinion behind them.

      "bodyText": "Police are investigating an alleged race-hate attack on a Singaporean student in London by a group of people who are said to have shouted about the coronavirus before beating him up. Officers said they were looking into reports of an attack on Oxford Street at about 9.30pm last Monday, after Jonathan Mok shared pictures of his battered face and wrote about his ordeal in a Facebook post. Mok said one of the group tried to kick him in the head and told him: \u201cI don\u2019t want your coronavirus in my country.\u201d Scotland Yard said it had received a report that a 23-year-old man was punched and sustained facial injuries, and officers were looking at CCTV to try to identify suspects. Mok said several racist taunts had been directed at him in recent weeks, some involving references to the coronavirus. Writing about last Monday\u2019s incident, he said he was walking past a group of men when he heard one make a reference to the virus, and he stopped to look at them. \u201cAll of a sudden, the first punch was swung at my face and took me by surprise. When I was still shocked by the first hit, the guy delivered the second sucker punch. By then, a few passersby had stopped and one of them tried to reason with them that four on one was not fair. \u201cThe attacker\u2019s friend tried to swing a kick at me as I was explaining to the passerby that I hadn\u2019t done anything at all. I tried to react in self-defence but couldn\u2019t do anything substantial because I was still recovering from a broken finger in my master hand. \u201cThe guy who tried to kick me then said: \u2018I don\u2019t want your coronavirus in my country,\u2019 before swinging another sucker punch at me, which resulted in my face exploding with blood (from my nose), where the blood was splattered all across the pavement.\u201d Mok, who been studying in London for the past two years, said he hated being in the spotlight and did not like writing posts on Facebook or any social media platform but the incident highlighted an important issue that needed to be brought to wider attention. He said doctors had told him he had fractures to his face and may need to undergo reconstructive surgery. There have been a number of reports of racist incidents relating to the coronavirus outbreak in the UK, including verbal abuse, attacks with eggs and bullying at schools. On Tuesday, the University of Oxford vice-chancellor Louise Richardson sent an email to staff, warning: \u201cMany of our Chinese and other Asian students and staff have felt isolated or even suspect, especially when wearing face masks.

Two-thirds of its victims died in a three-month period and most were aged 18-49. So what lessons has the world\u2019s deadliest pandemic taught us?</p> \n<h2><strong>1) How not to name a pandemic</strong></h2> \n<p>In spring 1918, soldiers in Europe on both sides starting suffering from a new type of influenza. But if the illness seemed worse than seasonal flu, the squalid conditions of the trenches were blamed and, not wanting to admit any potential weakness, Britain, France and Germany kept the outbreak a secret.

There\u2019s a joke that when an epidemic is said to emerge first in a place, it almost certainly didn\u2019t. Except Wuhan might actually be right.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/02/corona-carousel\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>2) Tell the truth and warn the public</strong></h2> \n<p>The Spanish flu hit during the first world war, so authorities were unusually keen to avoid further social disruption or blows to national morale. Much of the pandemic was characterised by increasingly untenable reassurances that the Spanish flu was not something to be overly concerned about. In June 1918, just before the UK felt the full force of the outbreak, the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3867839/\">Daily Mail advised readers</a> that flu was no worse than a cold and that people should not have \u201cany great dread\u201d but \u201cmaintain a cheery outlook on life\u201d.

The way coronavirus is being played down by some leaders is concerning, he said, and even throwaway comments that appear to undermine the seriousness of the threat can set the tone for how people respond to advice.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou still have politicians like Boris Johnson saying <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-handshake/johnson-coronavirus-will-not-stop-me-shaking-hands-idUKKBN20Q1K2\">they\u2019re happy to shake hands</a>. Just stop shaking hands,\u201d said Honigsbaum. \u201cWe need to take this a little bit more seriously.

Instead of the sickest people staying put in bed, many were sent home from the frontline, which may have contributed to the rapid spread of the disease. And many countries struggled to balance national war interests with public health.</p> \n<p>In New Zealand, which was slow to clamp down on ships entering and leaving its ports, nearly 1% of the population died within two months in late 1918, triggering even worse outbreaks in Pacific territories such as Western Samoa, where 30% of men, 22% of women and 10% of children died.</p> \n<p>By contrast, the coronavirus outbreak has prompted draconian clampdowns on civil life. The World Health Organization has <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/china-s-aggressive-measures-have-slowed-coronavirus-they-may-not-work-other-countries\">credited the response in China</a>, where entire cities were placed in lockdown and schools and work suspended, with averting hundreds of thousands of cases of Covid-19.</p> \n<h2><strong>4) The potential for a second wave</strong></h2> \n<p>The first wave of Spanish flu in spring 1918 wasn\u2019t that bad. But by August, when a second wave spread from France across Europe, the US and much of the globe, the virus had mutated to a far deadlier form and appeared to hit hardest in regions that had not already been exposed, meaning people had lower immunity.</p> \n<p>Flu viruses are fundamentally different from coronaviruses in that they are constantly shuffling their genomes, which means they rapidly morph from one strain into another \u2013 that\u2019s why flu vaccines are needed annually. Coronaviruses tend to be genetically fairly stable and so scientists don\u2019t expect a sudden shift in the mortality rate of Covid-19. But the question of whether coronavirus will disappear, reappear in waves or simmer in the background as an endemic illness still remains to be answered.</p> \n<p>Viruses where transmission is strongly affected by temperature and humidity often come in waves and initially it was expected that Covid-19 might die down in the spring and possibly reappear next winter. But the geographic spread is already raising questions about this.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIran right now, Italy right now, they\u2019re all warmer than the UK, so the argument that we\u2019ll be safer as we move towards the summer doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d said Gog. \u201cHow transmission depends on temperature and humidity is unknown, but it\u2019s possible it may not be a two-wave thing, at least not due to climate.\u201d</p> \n<p>Whether we see a second wave will also depend on whether people who have been infected once have long-term immunity, which would suppress re-emergence in the community. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/japanese-woman-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-for-second-time\">Reports of a Japanese woman</a> getting the virus twice raised the prospect that immunity may wane in the weeks or months after recovery, which some think could make a second wave more likely.

Viruses where transmission is strongly affected by temperature and humidity often come in waves and initially it was expected that Covid-19 might die down in the spring and possibly reappear next winter. But the geographic spread is already raising questions about this. \u201cIran right now, Italy right now, they\u2019re all warmer than the UK, so the argument that we\u2019ll be safer as we move towards the summer doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d said Gog. \u201cHow transmission depends on temperature and humidity is unknown, but it\u2019s possible it may not be a two-wave thing, at least not due to climate.\u201d Whether we see a second wave will also depend on whether people who have been infected once have long-term immunity, which would suppress re-emergence in the community. Reports of a Japanese woman getting the virus twice raised the prospect that immunity may wane in the weeks or months after recovery, which some think could make a second wave more likely. This is something experts are tracking closely as case numbers continue to rise.",

      "bodyText": "The sister of North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, has condemned South Korea as a \u201cfrightened dog barking\u201d after Seoul protested against a live-fire military exercise by the North. Kim Yo-jong\u2019s comments \u2013 her first known official statement \u2013 came after Seoul\u2019s security ministers expressed \u201cstrong concern\u201d over Pyongyang\u2019s firing of two short-range ballistic missiles on Monday \u2013 its first weapons test for more than three months. In the statement published by state media on Tuesday, Kim Yo-jong said the North was entitled to carry out military drills and dismissed the South\u2019s condemnation as a \u201ctruly senseless act\u201d. \u201cSuch incoherent assertion and actions \u2026 only magnify our distrust, hatred and scorn for the South side as a whole,\u201d she added. Kim has long been one of her brother\u2019s closest advisers and has frequently been pictured alongside him. She acted as her brother\u2019s envoy to the South during the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in 2018, which ushered in a rapid diplomatic rapprochement on the divided peninsula. Kim did not mention South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in \u2013 whom she met several times \u2013 but described Seoul\u2019s presidential office, the Blue House, as \u201ca burnt child dreading fire\u201d. The publication of a political statement in her own name highlights her central role in the regime, analysts said. \u201cBy having someone like Kim Yo-jong \u2013 who has been a dovish figure towards the South and acting as a soft and friendly messenger \u2013 issue such a strong statement condemning the current government, the North is raising its pressure,\u201d said Go Myong-hyun, an analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies. Kim was named in January as a first vice-department director of the central committee of the ruling Workers\u2019 party, but the new statement signalled she may have moved further up the hierarchy, he added. Earlier on Tuesday, North Korean state media published pictures of Kim Jong-un supervising what it called a \u201clong-range artillery\u201d exercise. Monday\u2019s drills came days after the one-year anniversary of the failed Hanoi summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, and followed the expiry of an end-of-year deadline Pyongyang set Washington to offer it fresh concessions. The two countries are deadlocked over sanctions relief and what the North would be willing to give up in return, and there are no significant contacts between the North and South. Kim Jong-un has declared the North no longer considered itself bound by its moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, and threatened to demonstrate a \u201cnew strategic weapon\u201d soon. Seoul and Washington last week postponed forthcoming joint military exercises over the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 the South has more than 5,000 infections \u2013 and the South\u2019s president, Moon, offered to cooperate over the disease with the North, which has closed its borders to try to prevent a potentially devastating outbreak.\ufeff",

      "body": "<p>And\u2026 breathe. Though not too deeply. And certainly not all over anybody else. After more than six weeks of mooching around No 10 hoping the pangolins would deal with the coronavirus on their own, Boris Johnson finally broke off from his sabbatical to ease widespread concerns about a global pandemic with an emergency press conference. Don\u2019t panic! Don\u2019t panic!</p> <p>There were no face masks or breathing equipment stashed in the corner of the state room. Just hand sanitiser at the front door on the way in. This was Downing Street in full \u201cKeep calm and carry on\u201d mode. As Boris walked into the room, flanked by chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, his trademark smirk was replaced by the serious face. It wasn\u2019t altogether convincing \u2013 it never is \u2013 but it was the best he could do. When you\u2019re trying to find the right words to tell several hundred thousand people they might die, it\u2019s probably best not to look too chipper. Don\u2019t panic! Don\u2019t panic!</p> <p>Boris began by outlining the government\u2019s four-part strategy. Contain, delay, research and mitigate. He forgot to mention the fifth strand of \u201cdoing almost nothing\u201d, which had been the plan up until the previous weekend. Everything was probably going to be more or less OK for most people, he continued, though for some people it would undoubtedly not be. Which was just one of those things. But try not to worry as the NHS, which was already severely overstretched and underfunded, was uniquely placed to cope with an extra 2 million patients. Don\u2019t panic! Don\u2019t panic!</p> <p>\u201cThe best thing you can do,\u201d Boris said, \u201cis to wash your hands with soap and hot water while singing Happy Birthday twice.\u201d Mostly as an aspiration that you survive until your next one. Still, at least here he was on relatively strong ground. Because if there\u2019s one thing Boris knows something about it\u2019s washing his hands. Over the years he\u2019s washed his hands of almost everything: family, children, friends, colleagues, morals, scruples. Pontius Boris.</p> <p>Having listened in silence as the prime minister tried to minimise the situation, Whitty and Vallance were left to deliver a cold dose of reality. No one could say for certain just how bad things were going to get. But it would be at least another six months before we were out of the woods, and in a worst case scenario, 80% of the country could catch the virus with a mortality rate of about 1%. The young would probably be fine. The old, not so much. Bring out your dead! It would also be handy if the UK could work closely with neighbouring countries. If only there was a Union of European countries of which we could be a part...</p> <p>It rapidly became clear that the government\u2019s emergency plan was actually remarkably thin. Something that had been hastily cobbled together over a couple of days and didn\u2019t really stand up to close examination. There was nothing on what role the army might have to play, how health and social care workers could be protected, which hospital procedures would have to be delayed and what financial provision would be made for workers in the gig economy who weren\u2019t covered by employment law. It was all just a bit hit and hope. Don\u2019t panic! Don\u2019t panic!</p> <p>The longer the press conference went on, the more uncomfortable the prime minister looked. Boris is essentially a good time guy with a penchant for the glib one-liner. He hates being the bearer of bad news. He hates even more the idea that people might hold him responsible for the decisions that could cost lives. He just wants to keep things light and breezy. One of the things he had most liked about Brexit was that at least no one was that likely to die from it. Or not so anyone would notice. Now it was all getting just a bit too real.</p> <p>Boris tried to cheer people up a bit. The good news was that if the coronavirus really did get everywhere, there would be no need for isolation units or preventing overseas travel. Though it might be an idea to only visit those countries with better healthcare than on our own. There again, the shiny new blue passport did guarantee immunity from Covid-19 and all other foreign illnesses, so all was not entirely lost.</p> <p>\u201cWe should all basically just go about our normal daily lives,\u201d he said, hopefully. Before telling the entire nation he had spent the last few days shaking hands with as many people who had contracted the coronavirus as possible. Whitty and Vallance perked up. They had at last tracked down \u201cPatient Zero\u201d. The prime minister was the UK\u2019s own super-spreader. The man who had broken all the rules he was telling everyone else to observe.</p> <p>As the pair walked away from the podium, they quietly advised Boris that a spell of self-isolation might do him and the country no end of good. Besides, it wasn\u2019t as if anyone would know the difference. After all, he was the first person on record to have started his paternity leave four months before his child was born.</p> <p>An hour later, Matt Hancock, delivered much the same message in a statement to the Commons. Weirdly, though, he sounded rather more convincing in saying he didn\u2019t know what he was doing than the prime minister had. When a 12-year-old Tigger is the one with gravitas then it really is time to panic. Don\u2019t panic! Don\u2019t panic!</p>",

Don\u2019t panic! \u201cThe best thing you can do,\u201d Boris said, \u201cis to wash your hands with soap and hot water while singing Happy Birthday twice.\u201d Mostly as an aspiration that you survive until your next one. Still, at least here he was on relatively strong ground. Because if there\u2019s one thing Boris knows something about it\u2019s washing his hands. Over the years he\u2019s washed his hands of almost everything: family, children, friends, colleagues, morals, scruples. Pontius Boris. Having listened in silence as the prime minister tried to minimise the situation, Whitty and Vallance were left to deliver a cold dose of reality. No one could say for certain just how bad things were going to get. But it would be at least another six months before we were out of the woods, and in a worst case scenario, 80% of the country could catch the virus with a mortality rate of about 1%. The young would probably be fine. The old, not so much. Bring out your dead! It would also be handy if the UK could work closely with neighbouring countries. If only there was a Union of European countries of which we could be a part... It rapidly became clear that the government\u2019s emergency plan was actually remarkably thin. Something that had been hastily cobbled together over a couple of days and didn\u2019t really stand up to close examination. There was nothing on what role the army might have to play, how health and social care workers could be protected, which hospital procedures would have to be delayed and what financial provision would be made for workers in the gig economy who weren\u2019t covered by employment law. It was all just a bit hit and hope. Don\u2019t panic! Don\u2019t panic! The longer the press conference went on, the more uncomfortable the prime minister looked. Boris is essentially a good time guy with a penchant for the glib one-liner. He hates being the bearer of bad news. He hates even more the idea that people might hold him responsible for the decisions that could cost lives. He just wants to keep things light and breezy. One of the things he had most liked about Brexit was that at least no one was that likely to die from it. Or not so anyone would notice. Now it was all getting just a bit too real. Boris tried to cheer people up a bit. The good news was that if the coronavirus really did get everywhere, there would be no need for isolation units or preventing overseas travel. Though it might be an idea to only visit those countries with better healthcare than on our own. There again, the shiny new blue passport did guarantee immunity from Covid-19 and all other foreign illnesses, so all was not entirely lost. \u201cWe should all basically just go about our normal daily lives,\u201d he said, hopefully. Before telling the entire nation he had spent the last few days shaking hands with as many people who had contracted the coronavirus as possible. Whitty and Vallance perked up. They had at last tracked down \u201cPatient Zero\u201d. The prime minister was the UK\u2019s own super-spreader. The man who had broken all the rules he was telling everyone else to observe. As the pair walked away from the podium, they quietly advised Boris that a spell of self-isolation might do him and the country no end of good. Besides, it wasn\u2019t as if anyone would know the difference. After all, he was the first person on record to have started his paternity leave four months before his child was born. An hour later, Matt Hancock, delivered much the same message in a statement to the Commons. Weirdly, though, he sounded rather more convincing in saying he didn\u2019t know what he was doing than the prime minister had. When a 12-year-old Tigger is the one with gravitas then it really is time to panic. Don\u2019t panic! Don\u2019t panic!",

Six more people have tested positive to the coronavirus in NSW, bringing the total number of those infected in the state to 15 since the outbreak began. NSW Health is alerting passengers who were on five separate flights from Asia in the past week after two men in their 30s, a man in his 50s and two women in their 60s tested positive following their arrival in NSW. The men in their 30s travelled from Iran, the two women flew from Japan and South Korea respectively, and the man in his 50s was returning from Singapore. Meanwhile a woman in her 50s who hasn\u2019t been out of Australia recently has also tested positive to the coronavirus. And health authorities are advising passengers who sat near a coronavirus-infected woman on a Doha-to-Sydney flight to immediately isolate themselves at home. The woman in her 50s who flew into Australia from Iran on 23 February aboard Qatar Airways flight 908 from Doha was in seat 43H. Meanwhile, a 53-year-old male doctor is in a stable condition at Westmead hospital and \u201cgoing quite well\u201d, NSW health minister Brad Hazzard told the Nine Network on Tuesday. NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said the doctor had worked at Ryde hospital and had been in contact with a \u201cdiverse range of patients\u201d. Thirteen doctors, 23 nurses and four other health workers have been identified as close contacts of the doctor and are in home isolation. A further eight patients of the doctor are showing no symptoms, while 29 other patients identified as casual contacts are being chased up. \u201cWe are making sure we get in contact with them and make sure they don\u2019t have symptoms,\u201d Hazzard said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a worry.\u201d Another locally acquired case in Sydney is a 41-year-old sister of an infected man who recently returned from Iran where the virus is rampant. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has called for Australians to use \u201ccommon sense\u201d, with escalation of the virus around the world prompting panic buying. Consumers reported supermarket shelves stripped of items like paper towels and toilet paper, along with nonperishable food items. But health experts and Morrison said extensive stockpiling was not necessary. By Tuesday evening, #toiletpaper was trending on Twitter as Australians shared photos of empty shelves. Both Coles and Woolworths reassured customers that they had increased deliveries and expected to replenish stock. Toilet paper producer Kimberly-Clark said it had opened up its manufacturing line in South Australia to help replenish stock. \u201cThe commonsense response is to go about your business as normal.

That is why it is important to get information from the trusted official sources, rather than wildly speculative reports out there.\u201d He urged people to regularly visit the federal department of health website, to contact the coronavirus health information hotline, and to listen to the commonwealth chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy.

However, the attorney general, Christian Porter, said it was \u201cnot inconceivable\u201d that control orders might be used under the Biosecurity Act to detain people or force them into treatment to halt the virus spread. A \u201chuman biosecurity control order\u201d requires people to comply with certain orders including staying at home, handing over contact details and providing body samples for diagnosis. On Friday, health ministers will meet with aged care home providers to discuss advice and ensure the sector is prepared. Meanwhile, doctors will be briefed in coming days on how to respond to any sustained community transmission, including through establishing dedicated coronavirus clinics where patients could be triaged. The NSW chief medical officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said hospitals were planning to increase the number of beds and staff in intensive care units to accommodate severe cases. \u201cWe will increase ICU capacity and work is being undertaken with our districts to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can redeploy staff.

Public schools in NSW have been told to stop overseas excursions, while in Western Australia, education officials have told students to stay home if they have been in close contact with a confirmed case of coronavirus \u201cirrespective of whether they have developed symptoms\u201d. \u201cPrincipals are encouraged to consider the needs of students in self-imposed isolation,\u201d the WA directive states. \u201cThe health-related needs of these students is primary, however, it is important to also consider the social-emotional needs of such students. \u201cMaintaining contact with students via phone and/or the internet while they are in isolation will allow students to know the school cares about them and their well-being.\u201d Because of the risk to the economy from the virus, the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates to a record low of just 0.5%. The prime minister has called on the banks to pass on any rate cut in full.",

Top stories About 8% of the Iranian parliament\u2019s MPs have tested positive for the coronavirus, officials have said, as the country announced plans to mobilise 300,000 soldiers and volunteers against the deadliest outbreak of the epidemic outside China. In Australia, six more people were diagnosed with the virus in New South Wales after arriving on flights from Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Iran. Coronavirus is having a devastating effect on Australian tourism, with industry chiefs warning hotels \u201cface ruin\u201d if the outbreak continues to limit visitor numbers. The Reserve Bank cut interest rates on Monday, saying the disease was having a significant effect on the economy. Scott Morrison is now under pressure to release his stimulus package early to protect the businesses most impacted by the virus. Voting is under way in the US on Super Tuesday, the most important day in the Democratic presidential primary contest. Results from 14 states will clarify who out of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders leads the race to face Trump for the presidency. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders heads into the contest with a narrow lead in the delegate count, but Joe Biden is emboldened by endorsements from two of his former moderate rivals \u2013 Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg \u2013 who both dropped out of the race in recent days and voiced their support for the former vice president. This will be the first test for the billionaire former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who skipped the early voting states and poured millions of dollars into a campaign that has focused on Super Tuesday. The bushfires in NSW likely killed about 5,000 koalas, and conservation groups are calling for an emergency endangered species declaration. In the past 20 years, koala numbers are thought to have declined by two-thirds. \u201cIt\u2019s a spectacular loss in terms of conservation criteria and meets endangered listing almost immediately,\u201d said Dr Stephen Philips, principal research scientist and koala ecologist at the environmental consultancy Biolink.

The NDIS and government services minister filmed himself handing over the giant cheque to the Paradise Point bowls club in his electorate of Fadden in February and distributed the video on social media. Aboriginal people living on Northern Territory\u2019s Groote archipelago were left \u2018\u2018sick, angry, hungry and forgotten\u201d after a power outage that lasted for three days. The lack of power meant people had no access to food, fuel or phones, and they were given no support from emergency services. Services Australia has accidentally released the personal information of a disability support pensioner amid a growing number of privacy breaches with the agency. Services Australia\u2019s last annual report showed there was a 43% jump in substantiated privacy incidents. Scott Morrison has finally admitted he asked the Trump administration to invite the Hillsong pastor Brian Houston to a state dinner at the White House. The prime minister has refused for months to answer questions from journalists and Labor, describing the story as \u201cgossip\u201d. The world The US Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates in an emergency move to protect the world\u2019s largest economy from the coronavirus outbreak, ramping up the global response as the disease spreads. The EU has praised Greece for acting as a \u201cshield\u201d in deterring migrants, despite questions from the UN about breaches of international refugee law. The move comes after Turkey\u2019s foreign minister said \u2013 without providing evidence \u2013 that Greek soldiers killed three migrants attempting to enter the country. The world\u2019s biggest meat company, JBS, and its rival, Marfrig, have been linked to a brutal massacre in the Amazon. On 19 April 2017, nine men who were squatting on land considered valuable for resources were murdered in what became known as the \u201cColniza massacre\u201d. A New Zealand study has shown that the kea, the world\u2019s only alpine parrot, appear to use probabilities when making decisions. \u201cThe kea shows intelligence that is comparable to a human or chimpanzee,\u201d said research co-author Amalia Bastos.

      "body": "<p>Tensions over how to contain the fast-spreading coronavirus escalated Tuesday in the United States as the death toll climbed to nine and lawmakers expressed doubts about the government\u2019s ability to ramp up testing fast enough to deal with the crisis.</p> <p>All of the deaths have occurred in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/coronavirus-washington-state-deaths-testing\">Washington state</a>, and most were residents of a nursing home in suburban Seattle. The surge is raising concerns about the dangers of the coronavirus to the elderly and immunocompromised. The number of cases in the US overall climbed past 100 scattered across at least 14 states, with 27 in Washington.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in New York state, a second coronavirus case has been confirmed in a 50-year-old man with an underlying respiratory illness. He is hospitalized in serious condition.

      "bodyText": "Tensions over how to contain the fast-spreading coronavirus escalated Tuesday in the United States as the death toll climbed to nine and lawmakers expressed doubts about the government\u2019s ability to ramp up testing fast enough to deal with the crisis. All of the deaths have occurred in Washington state, and most were residents of a nursing home in suburban Seattle. The surge is raising concerns about the dangers of the coronavirus to the elderly and immunocompromised. The number of cases in the US overall climbed past 100 scattered across at least 14 states, with 27 in Washington. Meanwhile, in New York state, a second coronavirus case has been confirmed in a 50-year-old man with an underlying respiratory illness. He is hospitalized in serious condition. According to state health officials, the man is an attorney who lives in Westchester county north of New York City and works in Manhattan. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday that the patient had not traveled to countries considered the epicenter of the outbreak but had visited Miami recently. The confirmed diagnosis marks the first apparent community-spread case regionally. Because the patient is not believed to have come into contact with other infected people, health officials said it raises concerns that the pathogen is spreading locally. \u201cWith the results confirmed within a number of hours, we were immediately able to take next steps to stop the spread of this virus,\u201d said New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio. \u201cWe have said from the beginning that it is likely we will see more positive cases of the coronavirus.\u201d The patient had primarily been with his family in Westchester. Health officials are testing friends, relatives and anyone who may have come in contact with him for risk. News of the second case spread as an Orthodox Jewish school in New York City canceled classes on Tuesday to allow for precautionary measures after a suspected case of coronavirus turned up within its community. Health officials cautioned, however, that a second confirmed case should not be a cause for alarm, reiterating that they had expected that the disease would be found in multiple locations around the state and that it would be likely to spread. \u201cWe want New Yorkers to go about their everyday lives, use the subway, take the bus, etc,\u201d city health commissioner Dr Oxiris Barbot said, adding that the coronavirus \u201cis not an illness that can be easily spread through casual contact\u201d. Governor Cuomo disclosed the second case after the SAR Academy and high school, in the Riverdale section of the Bronx borough, said it was in touch with the city\u2019s department of health and following its guidelines. New York had previously reported one confirmed case, in Manhattan, on Sunday. The 39-year-old woman had recently returned from visiting Iran \u2013 one of the virus\u2019s global centers. Her husband is also undergoing tests and his results are expected to come back positive. The US surgeon general urged Americans to remain calm after about 100 coronavirus cases had been confirmed in 15 states, with New Hampshire and Georgia being the most recent. \u201cWe should be cautious and take appropriate measures to prepare and protect ourselves, but we should not be afraid,\u201d the surgeon general, Jerome Adams, said. In a phone conference on Tuesday, the CDC confirmed 60 positive or presumed-positive cases of the coronavirus nationwide and expressed growing concerns for vulnerable populations throughout the US. Research into cases worldwide indicated serious illness occurs in 16% of coronavirus cases, particularly in older people and those with underlying health conditions. \u201cWhat is happening now in the US may be the beginning of what is happening abroad,\u201d said Nancy Messonnier, director for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in an opening statement. The director faced tough questioning from reporters over criticism of the department\u2019s handling of the health crisis, including the initial limited availability of diagnostic test kits and strict qualifications for screening. Many critics say these measures may have contributed to the virus lying dormant in places like the Seattle suburbs for weeks. Reporters also pressed the director over the CDC\u2019s cooperation with state and local health officials to provide updated infection numbers. While Messonnier noted that the department \u201cof course will be aggregating data on a daily basis\u201d, she also acknowledged the CDC\u2019s numbers \u201cmay be a little delayed\u201d because of the volume of \u201ctesting kits going out\u201d. The CDC update came as the Wall Street Journal first reported that Trump administration officials are weighing using national disaster program dollars to fund hospital care for uninsured patients with the coronavirus. Under the National Disaster Medical System reimbursement program, the federal government reimburses hospitals and medical facilities by paying them higher rates than Medicare for treating at-risk patients. There are an estimated 27 million Americans without health coverage. Dr Robert Kadlec, the US health department\u2019s assistant secretary for preparedness and response, acknowledged discussion of the use of disaster funds in a hearing before the Senate committee on health, education, labor, and pensions on Tuesday. He added that, in a major pandemic, the US would need 3.5bn N95 respirator masks to fight the virus. \u201cWe have about 35 million,\u201d he said. The World Health Organization has confirmed nearly 90,000 cases, the vast majority in China, and more than 3,000 deaths. Coronavirus, or Covid-19, is a respiratory illness with symptoms similar to flu and is thought to spread mainly via respiratory droplets among \u201cclose contacts\u201d \u2013 such as coming directly into contact with the droplets or certain other bodily fluids. The virus can also be spread from being within about 6ft of a patient for a prolonged period, according to the CDC. It is characterized by fever and coughing and, in serious cases, shortness of breath or pneumonia.

NHS bosses have ramped up their efforts to detect the virus by ordering all 135 acute hospital trusts in England to routinely test anyone in intensive care units (ICUs) who has a breathing problem. They are worried that people who are already very sick in hospital with different illnesses could be infected with the virus by a fellow patient. The plan is a direct response to the detection of Covid-19 in patients in intensive care units in Europe whose illness cannot be traced to any of the areas where the virus is circulating, such as northern Italy. Staff working in these units have also contracted the virus. The move came to light in a letter sent to all NHS organisations on Tuesday by Prof Keith Willett, the senior doctor co-ordinating NHS England\u2019s efforts against the virus. In it he told trusts: \u201cIn recent days, new Covid-19 infections have been diagnosed in intensive care units in a number of European countries, without any epidemiologial links to high risk areas. \u201cNosocomial [hospital-acquired] transmission has occurred in these units affecting other patients and staff.

Willett\u2019s letter also reveals that NHS England has declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a level four incident, which is the the highest level of threat to the functioning of the health service.

      "bodyText": "Police investigations into some homicides would be halted and 999 response times extended under contingency plans to help forces cope with a severe coronavirus outbreak, the Guardian has learned. As the number of confirmed UK cases reached 51, the government warned that up to a fifth of the workforce could be off sick during the peak of a potential epidemic. A raft of measures would be introduced if the virus moved beyond the currently designated \u201ccontain phase,\u201d a 28-page action plan warned. On Tuesday evening, tests on thousands of patients in hospital intensive care units were ordered by NHS England amid concerns that the virus could be spreading undetected among people with respiratory problems. Twelve more people across England tested positive for coronavirus \u2013 the second highest single-day increase in cases to date \u2013 with all thought to have contracted it abroad. Eight had recently travelled from Italy, while the others came from Germany, Singapore, Japan and Iran. Health officials in the Canary Islands also reported the first case of a British national testing positive at a quarantined hotel in Tenerife. In other developments: A ninth person with coronavirus died in the Washington state, US, while the global death toll exceeded 3,100 with more than 90,000 people infected in 73 countries and territories. UK officials revealed plans for new legislation that could force children and teachers to transfer to alternative schools if their own is shut down. If NHS staff numbers are affected, some non-urgent care may be delayed and retired healthcare professionals brought back on duty, the government said. Unite, the union, warned that factories could shut down or cut working hours because of shortages of parts from China if the coronavirus crisis worsens. Johnson gave a rare Downing Street press conference to explain the government\u2019s \u201cbattle plan\u201d on Tuesday, including potential future advise to elderly people not to attend social gatherings. He was flanked by scientific experts, whom Downing Street\u2019s research has suggested are most trusted by the public to carry crucial health messages. Among plans drawn up to keep hospitals, schools and other public services running, the action plan warned: \u201cWith a significant loss of officers and staff, the police would concentrate on responding to serious crimes and maintaining public order.\u201d Meetings of senior police officers and government officials have been hammering out options to deal with severe disruption, including rationing services to respond only to serious 999 emergency calls only such as life threatening-crimes in action, domestic violence, sexual violence and homicides. One senior source said inquiries in non time-critical homicide investigations could be postponed as long as there was no increase in threat or risk. \u201cWe could stop homicide investigations, stop everything that is not time critical. Everything goes on the protection of life and property,\u201d they said. Other steps taken by police could include increasing response times to crimes such as burglaries, as there is no legally set time to attend; postponing some proactive work, such as against gangs and serious organised crime with those officers being diverted to frontline response; halting work on past crimes such as sexual abuse; and pulling officers out of neighbourhood policing \u2013 seen as vital to building trust and intelligence \u2013 so they are free to respond to serious 999 emergencies. Police chiefs could choose to suspend the 101 non-emergency police number to discourage the reporting of low-level crimes, though there would be concerns about an increase in 999 calls. The source added that forces are suffering from years of cuts and will face hard choices if the severest effects of coronavirus are realised: \u201cThe public can\u2019t expect as good a service in a worst-case scenario. They need to be reasonable about what a police force with 20% of staff missing because of illness, and still depleted from austerity, can do.\u201d The action plan said that the army is on standby to help. Soldiers with guns could guard parliament and Buckingham Palace, with armed police moved on to other duties, it is understood. In a sign of the scale of strain on Britain\u2019s fabric, police have been told by planners to limit demands on the army \u2013 because the military may be filling in for firefighters or even helping to bury the dead. Military help would come under plans originally devised for terrorist emergencies when the UK goes on to attack-imminent alerts, such as after the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing. The government is planning to pass legislation creating powers it can use if the outbreak becomes more serious and medical experts deem that \u201csocial distancing\u201d is necessary to control its spread. These are expected to include: the power to detain people at the border for the purposes of carrying out medical checks; allowing more extensive use of court hearings by video-link, as currently already happens in certain cases; and enabling the government to shut down large-scale public events \u2013 though the government believes many would be cancelled voluntarily. The prime minister played down the risks of widespread school shutdowns, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t think schools should be closing in principle. If possible they should stay open but school authorities should follow the advice of Public Health England.\u201d But the government wants to be prepared to tackle potential teacher shortages in individual schools or areas. Legislation is expected to permit the relaxing of constraints on class sizes and the sending of pupils and teachers to other schools if theirs are closed or demand is created by staff being off sick. Officials say new powers would not be used at this stage of the outbreak but could be triggered either if the World Health Organization declares that the risks have escalated or if a group of countries, including the UK, makes a coordinated decision that the virus has entered a new phase. The powers would be strictly temporary, either through the inclusion of a sunset clause or by allowing the legislation to lapse, once the chief medical officer and chief scientific officer declare that the disease is no longer an epidemic. Detailed plans the government put in place to prepare for a potential no-deal Brexit last year had helped departments to understand the risks of disruption, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman claimed. \u201cWe do have well developed plans in relation to supply chains.

      "bodyText": "Ouch! The New York stock market has ended the day with steep losses again, as the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency rate cut failed to reassure investors. Anxiety over a possible US downturn wiped out a hefty chunk of Monday\u2019s recovery, taking the main indices down 3%, back to their lows late last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 785 points to 25,917 - a day after its best points gain ever (1,297). The S&amp;P lost 86 points, clinging onto the 3,000-point level, while the tech-focused Nasdaq closed 268 points lower at 8,684. Traders appear increasingly anxious about the US economy -- is a recession looming? -- and concerned that monetary policy won\u2019t stop the crisis created by the coronavirus. Kyle Rodda of IG says it was another wild day in the markets: The Fed\u2019s 50-pointer initially supported market sentiment, as investors got a little giddy on the prospect of cheaper money. But the fundamental concerns about the coronavirus, and whether monetary policy would really stop a slow-down in the US and global economy, prevailed. The VIX spiked once again, to trade back around the 40 mark \u2013 a level entirely unconducive taking confident long positions in risk assets. Here\u2019s more reaction: Doubtless we\u2019ll see more drama tomorrow, so get some rest! Goodnight. GW We\u2019re into the last hour of trading in New York, and it\u2019s turning choppier. The Dow has recovered some ground, but is still deep in the red today - down 652 points or 2.4% at 26,050.68. Rate cut scepticism abounds, as Bloomberg points out: Does a 50 basis point cut change things? That\u2019s a tough one to answer,\u201d said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale. \u201cFed cuts tend to be less effective in situations like this when there is a supply and demand shock.\u201d Fears that the US economy is slowing are driving investors into the safety of government debt. With prices at new records, the yield on US 10-year Treasury bills has dropped below 1% for the first time. That signals pessimism about growth and inflation prospects. Allianz\u2019s top economist, Mohamed El-Erian, tweets that investors have lost enthusiasm for buying the dip, for fear of missing out of the next rally: Interest rate cuts usually boost shares, as looser monetary conditions should lift consumer spending and benefit company earnings. Not tonight, though... Here we go again.....the Dow\u2019s now down 910 points, or 3.4%, as the Fed rate cut fails to shore up confidence. It\u2019s shaping up to be another hefty selloff - pushing the index back towards last week\u2019s lows. The emergency cut to US interest rates has spooked Wall Street, says Reuters. Having initially craved lower borrowing costs, traders are now fretting about why the Fed acted today, rather than waiting two weeks for its next policy meeting. How bad is the US economy right now?..... As Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York, puts it: \u201cThe market reaction now is negative because the Fed sent the wrong message to the market. \u201cAll of a sudden the Fed is really worried about the economy and this is the reason why we are having this volatility.\u201d Back on Wall Street, stocks are moving deeper into the red - reversing last night\u2019s strong gains. The Dow is currently down 596 points, or 2.3%, at 26,106 points - wiping out some of Monday\u2019s 1,297-point rally. Capital Economics have also predicted the Bank of England will cut interest rates this month -- either at its scheduled meeting in three weeks, or in an Fed-style emergency move. In a note to clients, they say: We are not epidemiologists, but judging by the progression of the virus in other countries it seems sensible to assume that over the coming weeks the number of coronavirus cases in the UK will rise from 51 now to somewhere in the hundreds or thousands..... As such, we now expect the Bank to cut interest rates from 0.75% to 0.50% at its next meeting on 26th March, but it could easily follow the Fed\u2019s emergency 0.50% cut earlier today by taking action sooner. It may also provide extra support by encouraging banks to lend more freely by reducing the counter-cyclical capital buffer and/or by extending the Term Funding Scheme. Heads-up. Analysts at Nomura have predicted that the Bank of England will make an emergency cut to UK interest rate before the end of this week. In a note, just released, they say cutting rates from 0.75% to 0.5% would buy the Bank time to \u201ccollect its thoughts\u201d before its scheduled meeting later this month. At that point the Bank could then make a further decision to lower interest rates again if deemed necessary (another 25bp, or even 35bp if it wanted to take rates down to what we think would be the lowest the Bank would be willing \u2013 i.e. 0.10%) and at the same time deliver some sort of easing targeted to addressing issues raised by the virus. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank are planning to turn their Spring Meetings, due in April, into a \u2018virtual event\u2019. The Spring Meetings are a major event in the economic calendar, with thousands of delegates usually flying to downtown Washington DC from around the world. But not this year, it seems, given concerns over the coronavirus. Time for a quick recap America\u2019s central bank has made its first emergency cut to interest rates since the 2008 financial crisis. The Federal Reserve slashed borrowing costs by 50 basis points, to a 1%-1.25% range. Fed chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was responding to the risks created by Covid-19. Although US economic fundamentals were strong, the virus is undermining confidence, hurting some sectors and disrupting supply chains. Powell predicted that other nations will take their own actions, and denied that he had bowed to political pressure; which promptly intensified again today, as president Trump urged further rate cuts. Stocks initially rallied after the Fed\u2019s move, but then reversed their gains as economists questions whether a rate cut would provide enough support. Yesterday Wall Street posted its biggest gains since 2009. Shares are currently down on Wall Street, while European markets have closed 1% higher. The Fed move came three hours after G7 finance ministers and central bankers held a conference call to discuss the virus threat. They said they \u201cstand ready to cooperate further on timely and effective measures\u201d, but didn\u2019t announce any coordinated action today. Bank of England governor Mark Carney told MPs that preparations are underway to protect the UK economy from the coronavirus too. France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, is pushing hard for a coordinated response that could include increased government spending. Here\u2019s our main Coronavirus liveblog: European stock market have ended the day with gains, but have fallen back from their highs earlier in the day. The emergency US interest rate cut boosted equities initially, but that quickly unravelled as investors questioned how much good it would do. Here are the closing prices: FTSE 100: up 63 points or 1% at 6,718 German DAX: up 127 points or 1% at 11,985 French CAC: up 59 points or 1.1% at 5,393 Italian FTSE MIB: up 93 points or 0.4% at 21,748 The broader picture is that European stocks are still massively down on last week. Wall Street is also in the red, in another volatile trading session. Melissa Davies, economist at City fund managers Redburn, argues that a rate cut is the wrong answer to the coronavirus crisis. Focused help for companies, and sick pay for US workers who need time off, would be better: \u201cFor a start, rate cuts reduce bank income, at a time banks need to be supporting the economy through a potential cash flow squeeze. Rate cuts also help little if consumers stay at home in large numbers. \u201cWhat is needed is targeted central bank help for the corporate sector \u2013 loans and bond purchases \u2013 and targeted government help for workers \u2013 tax holidays and sick pay.\u201d Marc Ostwald, chief economist at ADM Investor Services, argues that the Fed\u2019s rate cut is a mistake. He argues that the coronavirus is fundamentally a supply shock (undermining company supply chains), so lower rates will simply drive asset prices higher. It could provide support for riskier corporate debt with low credit ratings -- but that itself creates risks down the line. Remember that observation about extended periods of economic growth \u2018not dying of old age\u2019, but all too frequently of policy mistakes - sort this into that category. This is a supply side shock, it will along with the array of trade tensions sharpen the minds of the corporate world in terms of their supply chains and \u2018just in time\u2019 processes, but there is a structural shift, interest rates and monetary can do little to change that. Indeed following decade in which central bank has fuelled chronic asset price inflation, and sanctioned a shockingly high level of financial engineering, this may in the long run be judged by historians to be a \u2018straw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u2019 type of error. It\u2019s been a choppy day in the markets.... ...and a wild couple of weeks! Wall Street is now sliding deeper into the red, as investors digest today\u2019s rate cut. The Dow Jones industrial average has now slumped by 546 points, or 2%, back to 26,157. That takes a hefty chunk out of yesterday\u2019s strong rally, in which the Fed surged by a record-breaking 1,300 points on hopes of central bank action. Ironically, now the Fed has acted, stocks are falling again. Banks such as JP Morgan (-3%) and Goldman Sachs (-1.5%) are among the fallers, as a rate cut will eat into their profitability. Shares in housebuilders are rallying, though, as lower borrowing costs should mean increase demand for property Here are the key points from Jerome Powell\u2019s short press conference to explain today\u2019s emergency rate cut: The coronavirus is hurting the US economy, so the Federal Reserve acted swiftly by lowering interest rates US economic fundamentals are strong, but some sectors are suffering from the new risks created by the virus outbreak A rate cut will help the economy, by preventing financial conditions tightening and lifting confidence Expect to see other measures from G7 countries, following today\u2019s conference call Powell insists he\u2019s not bowed to pressure from Donald Trump (despite the president repeatedly demanding rate cuts). Q: What damage is the coronavirus causing to the US economy? Jerome Powell says the effects are still at an early stage, but the Fed is hearing concerns from industries such as travel. Those effects aren\u2019t visible in the data yet. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Q: How will a rate cut protect America from a coronavirus outbreak? Powell argues that lower borrowing costs will provide economic support, by avoiding a tightening of financial conditions. But he agrees that it won\u2019t fix broken supply chains or lower the rate of infection. Q: Did you feel any political pressure to make this rate cut? Powell insists that he did not. We will not let political considerations affect our thinking, ad it\u2019s very important the public know that, he says firmly. Q: Could you cut interest rates again at your scheduled meeting later this month? Powell says the Fed is happy with the current level of interest rates, but it will consider all the facts when it meets in a fortnight. Q: Should we expect other central banks to follow suit? Jerome Powell says the Fed is in \u201cactive discussions\u201d with its counterparts in other countries -- including today\u2019s teleconference with other G7 policymakers. Other G7 countries could also take measures, he suggests. Q: What changed over the last week, and how quickly with the US economy recover? Jerome Powell replies that the coronavirus has spread further in recent days, with more cases in the US, meaning the Fed now saw risks to the economy. It\u2019s unclear how long the outbreak will last, he adds, but he expects America to return to \u201csolid growth\u201d once it is resolved. Over in Washington, Jerome Powell has arrived for a press conference to explain today\u2019s emergency rate cut. The Federal Reserve chair confirms that the Fed has cut borrowing costs by 50 basis points today, to help keep the US economy \u201cstrong\u201d in the face of the risk posed by the coronavirus. Powell says the fundamentals of the US economy remain strong, with the jobless rate at its lowest in 50 years, and wages rising. Growth prospects remain favourable. But since the Fed\u2019s last meeting, the coronavirus has emerged, meaning the risks to the economic outlook have \u201cchanged materially\u2019. Powell says the Fed\u2019s \u201cthoughts and prayers go to those harmed\u201d by the virus. There are signs that that the spread of the coronavirus is hurting the US domestic economy, he says, citing the travel industry. The situation is \u201cstill fluid\u201d, he adds, and ultimately other parties such as health professionals will play the major role in fighting coronavirus. Emergency Fed rate cuts really are unusual. They only happen in times of economic distress, financial peril, or terrorism attacks, as this tweet shows: Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, agrees that monetary policy can\u2019t protect the US economy on its own. The surprise cut will deliver a confidence boost and should lead to an easing of financial conditions that had tightened sharply in recent weeks. But, beyond that, questions still remain about how policy rate cuts can help the economy if quarantines and travel barriers are introduced. Certainly, rate cuts will not help re-stock emptying grocery shelves. Monetary policy is hopeless when supply simply cannot feed demand. Some traders suspect the Federal Reserve could announce another rate cut at its scheduled meeting in mid-March. Newsflash: Donald Trump is demanding deeper cuts to US interest rates. That early bounce on Wall Street is fizzling out..... The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow are only slightly positive now -- a small reaction to such a dramatic move from the Fed. Traders may be concluding that a rate cut will only have limited impact -- it certainly won\u2019t cure Covid-19! And it might not stimulate demand, if nervous citizens simply refuse to get on a plane or head to the cinema for fear of infection. Edward Park of asset managers Brooks Macdonald says the Fed is trying to create a feeling of \u201cshock and awe\u201d stimulus, to reassure markets about Covid-19. Today\u2019s emergency rate cut is designed to signal a \u201cstrong intent\u201d to protect the US economy, Park adds. The US joins a rolling wave of stimulus from across the globe which has previously been focused within economies strongly impacted by the outbreak. Markets are trying to weigh up the unknown risk of the virus with the known stimulus efforts by governments and central banks, the decisive cut by the Federal Reserve provides an additional reason for investors to consider buying the dip. Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton, predicts that more central banks will follow the Fed\u2019s lead: The move by the Fed comes as a big surprise but will be welcomed by markets. Cuts were already discounted, but not so much so soon. It\u2019s likely that other central banks will follow. It won\u2019t have much immediate impact on the economy but investors will be encouraged by the positive action. This feels like a victory for Donald Trump. The president has been a persistent, and vocal, critic of the Federal Reserve for not cutting interest rates faster. Just eight hours ago he tweeted that the Fed had \u201ccalled it wrong from day one\u201d and should \u201ccut rate big\u201d. But even at 1%-1.25%, US interest rate are higher than in the eurozone (0%) or UK (0.75%), so Trump might want to see more cuts. The dollar is weakening following the Fed\u2019s rate cut, down around 0.5%. This has pushed the pound up to $1.282, with the euro rising to $1.119. This is the first emergency cut in US interest rates since 2008, when the global economy was reeling from the financial crisis. It means the Fed has now cut rates four times since last July as this tweet shows: Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 11am EST (4pm UK time) to discuss today\u2019s shock rate cut. This emergency cut in US interest rates has sent shares rallying. The S&amp;P 500 index has shaken off its earlier losses, and is now up nearly 1%. Stocks are pushing higher in Europe too -- with Britain\u2019s FTSE 1000 index now up 2% today. NEWSFLASH: The US Federal Reserve has slashed US interest rates in an emergency measure to protect America\u2019s economy from the economic impact of the coronavirus. In an unscheduled move, the Fed is cutting its benchmark rate to between 1% and 1.25%. That\u2019s down from 1.5% to 1.75%. The move comes two weeks before its next official meeting, but just three hours after that joint conference call with G7 finance ministers and central bankers. The Fed says: The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity. In light of these risks and in support of achieving its maximum employment and price stability goals, the Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point, to 1 to 1-1/4 percent. The Committee is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. More to follow! The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 327 points, or over 1%, at 26,375 as stocks are continuing to dip in New York. Ding ding! Stocks in Wall Street have dipped in early trading -- quite a contrast with Monday\u2019s 5% surge. The main indices are in the red, as New York shows its disappointment with the G7 statement on the coronavirus. The Dow has shed 212 points to 26,490 -- having leaped by almost 1,300 points yesterday in its biggest points gain ever.. The S&amp;P 500 index has also dipped by 0.75%, losing 22 points to 3,067 points. Wall Street had been hoping for coordinated action from global policymakers today. So simply hearing that finance ministers and central bankers are \u201cclosely monitoring the spread of the coronavirus disease\u201d and \u201cstand ready to cooperate further\u201d isn\u2019t cheering investors. It\u2019s worth noting that the US Federal Reserve\u2019s overnight liquidity scheme has just proved very popular. This scheme makes $100bn of cash available to banks for overnight purposes, as long as they provide US treasury bills and mortgage-backed securities as collateral. It\u2019s meant to keep the plumbing of the financial system running smoothly. It\u2019s not been oversubscribed since October -- until today, when the Fed received bids worth $108bn. That suggests that market participants are somewhat anxious, and keen to avoid a scramble for short-term funds. Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics says today\u2019s G7 statement \u201cfalls short of hopes of a coordinated policy response.\u201d It raises the risk that central banks will disappoint markets\u2019 expectations in the months ahead, she cautions, telling clients: This is a disappointment compared to previous hopes of an immediate and coordinated fiscal package and interest rate cuts, although such hopes had already been dampened by information leaked from \u201cG7 officials\u201d early this morning. The G7 appears to have disappointed the markets. Wall Street is currently expected to open lower, after posting its strongest jump in five years on Monday. CNN says: S&amp;P 500 futures turned negative and Dow futures lost 390 points following the statement.And there are limits to what central banks can do in the current environment. Their policy arsenal is already depleted after years of low interest rates and bond-buying programs. European markets are also dipping off their highs, with the FTSE 100 now up 120 points or 1.8%. The Stoxx 600 is up 2%. Jens Nordvig, analyst at Exante Data has put his finger on the G7\u2019s problem - not enough ammo: Although, they arguably don\u2019t know what to do either.... (and how much can they do?) Snap reaction: The G7 statement is a disappointment, to anyone who was hoping for dramatic action from the world\u2019s top policymakers today. Andreas Steno Larsen of Nordea Markets says ministers and bankers are operating in the dark, so they can\u2019t agree action yet. The G7 have failed provide \u201cshock and awe\u201d to reassure the markets, points out Kathy Jones of stock brokers Charles Schwab: Joumanna Bercetche of CNBC agrees that interest rate cuts may have to wait... NEWSFLASH: The world\u2019s top finance ministers and central bankers have just pledged to do what they can to protect the global economy from the coronavirus. That could include extra government spending, they say, or changes to monetary policy (such as interest rate cuts or more asset purchase programmes). They also applauded the IMF and the World Bank for promising to help countries who encounter financial problems because of Covid-19. But they\u2019ve not yet agreed any co-ordinated action, following their teleconference meeting which has just ended. US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who led the call with fellow G7 finance ministers and central bankers, have just issued this joint statement: \u201cWe, G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, are closely monitoring the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its impact on markets and economic conditions. Given the potential impacts of COVID-19 on global growth, we reaffirm our commitment to use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks. Alongside strengthening efforts to expand health services, G7 finance ministers are ready to take actions, including fiscal measures where appropriate, to aid in the response to the virus and support the economy during this phase. G7 central banks will continue to fulfill their mandates, thus supporting price stability and economic growth while maintaining the resilience of the financial system. We welcome that the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and other international financial institutions stand ready to help member countries address the human tragedy and economic challenge posed by COVID-19 through the use of their available instruments to the fullest extent possible. G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors stand ready to cooperate further on timely and effective measures.\u201d Vietnam is planning to launch a 27 trillion dong (\u00a3900m) stimulus package to help businesses cope with the coronavirus epidemic, according to state media. The plan could also help Vietnam stick to its 6.8% growth target this year, despite the supply chain disruption caused by the coronavirus. Vietnam reported earlier this week that its 16 Covid-19 cases have all been cured. However, its factories are still struggling, due to problems securing raw materials from neighbouring China. Media entertainment group Disney has been forced to cancel a major media launch of its new Disney Plus streaming service in London, due to the coronavirus. Journalists from across Europe were due to travel to the UK for the event on Thursday. But as my colleague Mark Sweney explains, the press launch is now canned. Disney Plus itself, which includes content from Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar and National Geographic, should still launch later this month (giving anyone quarantined at home something new to watch....) French finance minister Bruno Le Maire is really banging the drum for a powerful economic response to the coronavirus. He\u2019s just told a press conference in Paris that European authorities must show flexibility and solidarity. Reuters has more details: Le Maire also told a press conference it was important to consider all options including budgetary measures to deal with the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cIf there is a time we need to be flexible, it is when we are facing a crisis as important as the one we are facing today\u201d, Le Maire said. And now for a public service announcement from the UK\u2019s new Chancellor of the Exchequer: Rishi Sunak will be joining the G7 finance minister\u2019s teleconference call in around 20 minutes, which might move policymakers towards stimulus measures to protect their economies (but no promises....). Hopefully he\u2019ll still have time to work on his budget - due a week tomorrow. Elsewhere in London, a crucial meeting to decide the future of Yorkshire fertiliser miner Sirius Minerals is getting underway. Sirius wants shareholders to approve a rescue deal from Anglo American which values the firm at \u00a3405m, or just 5.5p per share. Sirius had hoped to dig the UK\u2019s first deep mine in 40 years under the North York Moors. But it was plunged into financial troubles last autumn when it was forced to cancel a \u00a3400m bond sales, blaming a lack of government support and Brexit uncertainty. If the deal is rejected, then Sirius could collapse into administration. But many of the company\u2019s army of small investors, based in North Yorkshire, vote the deal down - unhappy that Anglo is trying to take the business on the cheap. My colleague Rob Davies is there, and reports: Back in parliament, Labour MP Alison McGovern asks Mark Carney whether the Bank actually has enough firepower to fight a coronavirus downturn. With interest rates at just 0.75%, and \u00a3475bn of quantitative easing already conducted - there\u2019s not much left, is there? \u201cWe have effectively 200 to 250 basis points of space\u201d, governor Carney shoots back. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d, he asks, like a Western gunslinger twirling his six-shooter. That\u2019s 75 basis points of conventional action (ie, interest rate could fall to 0%), plus fresh unconventional moves such as QE. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden adds that you get \u2018more bang for your buck\u2019 if such stimulus comes as part of a package, and is coordinated internationally. Shares are pushing higher in London, as the markets recover some of last week\u2019s heavy losses. Traders are welcoming the Bank of England\u2019s pledge to take \u201call necessary steps\u201d to protect Britain from the economic shock of coronavirus. Shares in medium-sized UK firms are leading the way, with the FTSE 250 index up over 3%. The larger FTSE 100 index (which contains more multinationals) is up 2.2% or 147 points at 6802. Consumer-focused firms are up 3%, followed by miners (+2.9%), energy companies (2.8%) and tech firms (+2.6%). Conservative MP Felicity Buchan asks Mark Carney if the Bank of England could cut interest rates before its next scheduled meeting (on Thursday 26 March). Carney takes a couple of moments to gather his thoughts, before making two points: The MPC has \u201calways acted in a timely way\u201d, once it has gathered the necessary information and conducted its analysis. The transition to a new governor on March 16 will have no impact on the conduct of Bank\u2019s operations as Carney is in regular contact with Andrew Bailey. He adds: The committee would make a decision at the appropriate time and not before. Angela Eagle MP asks Mark Carney about the impact of coronavirus on the labour market -- including gig economy staff who only get paid if they work. Carney replies this is indeed an issue - but one where fiscal tools (government spending) work better than monetary ones. Sensing he is drifting beyond his remit, Carney adds smartly: I don\u2019t want to lead the government, but these are considerations we all need to take into account. Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden, weighs in too - saying the Bank is now reassessing its January economic forecasts (which predicted a rise in global growth). Ramsden adds that the Bank could launch \u201cadditional liquidity measures\u201d to help the economy ride out the temporary shock of the coronavirus. The Treasury Committee are also probing Mark Carney over the recent revelations that some traders gained early, unauthorised access to the audio feed from its press conferences. Carney says that it is a \u201cwholly unacceptable situation\u201d that anyone should have used the Bank\u2019s backup audio feed in this way (as was revealed in December). He explains that that Bank disabled the feed once this issue came to light, and have terminated the 3rd party supplier involved. Both this supplier, and the traders who received this information, have been referred to the FCA who are now investigating. Carney adds that the Bank is conducting an internal review into what went wrong - a report is expected by April. On Sunday, my colleague Jasper Jolly revealed that the Bank had carried out due diligence three times on technology supplier Encoded Media, but only revoked its access in December. Under questioning from MPs, Mark Carney adds that he expects a \u201cpowerful and timely\u201d global economic response to the coronavirus. He say the Bank doesn\u2019t want \u201cviable businesses\u201d to collapse because of the impact of Covid-19. So there are \u201cthings we can do\u201d to help commercial banks to use their balance sheets to support customers, he explains. That could provide vital working capital to help bosses manage their way through \u201ca difficult but ultimately temporary\u201d situation, the governor explains. Mark Carney then outlines to MPs how the Bank\u2019s various committees are taking action to protect the UK from the coronavirus. The Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates, is looking at the impact which supply disruptions will have on economic demand. That includes issues like \u201ccash flow, the cost and availability of finance as well as confidence effects\u201d. The Financial Policy Committee, which manages financial risks, is looking at whether there could be \u201cspillover effects\u201d, including whether UK households and banks could struggle to get financing. The Prudential Regulation Committee, which oversees the City, is examining the contingency plans of banks and insurers to see if they are ready for disruption, and can serve customers through split teams and remote working if needed. The Bank\u2019s own management is reviewing its own operations, to ensure that Britain\u2019s payment systems and money market remain operational. These three committees met yesterday to discuss the situation, and will keep meeting for as long as appropriate, Carney says - adding that he\u2019s in regular contact with international peers, the Treasury, and his successor Andrew Bailey. Newsflash: Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned MPs that the coronavirus could be a \u201clarge\u201d but \u201ctemporary\u201d economic shock. Appealing at the Treasury committee at parliament, Carney insist that the BoE is taking action to protect the economy too. He tells MPs that the front line of combating Covid-19 are the \u201cextraordinary efforts\u201d of the NHS staff, public health officials, carers and volunteers across the UK. He also cites the \u201cexceptional support\u201d provided by the Foreign and Commonwealth office to UK citizens abroad, explaining: The Bank of England\u2019s role is to help UK businesses and households manage through an economic shock which could prove large, but which will ultimately be temporary. The Bank will take \u201call necessary steps to support the UK economy and financial system, consistent with its statutory responsibilities\u201d, Carney pledges, adding: We\u2019re monitoring the situation closely across all our functions and ensuring all necessary contingency plans are in place. More to follow..... In an encouraging sign, Britain\u2019s construction sector has returned to growth for the first time in nearly a year. Output jumped in February, at its fastest rate since December 2018, according to data firm Markit. It says: UK construction companies signalled a return to business activity growth during February, following a nine-month period of declining workloads. The latest survey also pointed to the sharpest rise in new orders since December 2015. Anecdotal evidence mainly linked the recovery to a post- election improvement in business confidence and pent-up demand for new projects. This has lifted Markit\u2019s construction PMI, which tracks activity in the sector, up to 52.6 in February, up from 48.4 in January. That\u2019s the first reading over 50 (which shows growth) since April last year. France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has tweeted that he held a \u201cvery positive\u201d phone call with ECB chief Christine Lagarde today. Le Maire adds: \u201cWe want a strong and coordinated answer at euro zone and G7.\u201d Analyst John Kemp has spotted that investor are expecting sharp cuts in US interest rates over the next two months - which would please Donald Trump. Policymakers might be relieved to see shares going up again today, as it suggests last week\u2019s coronavirus panic is easing. But there are more important things in life than the stock market -- the G7 should be more focused on protecting the wider economy. Vitor Const\u00e2ncio, former Vice President of the European Central Bank, has tweeted about this -- pointing out that just one in three market corrections led to a recession. Sales of hand sanitiser surged in the UK last month, as worried consumers tried to protect themselves from Covid-19. Sales of hand sanitiser rose by 255% in February, data company Kantar reported. Liquid soap sales jumped by 7%, while demand for household cleaners rose 10%. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: \u201cGiven the media focus around the outbreak of COVID-19 in February, it\u2019s unsurprising to see shoppers prudently protecting themselves from illness.\u201d Some stores have run out of hand sanitisers as the first coronavirus cases were reported in the UK - suggesting that sales could have been even higher had shops been able to meet demand. As we reported yesterday, supermarkets are preparing to cope with any surge in stock-piling or panic buying from the coronavirus, having drawn up \u2018feed the nation\u2019 strategies. Sales at bakery chain Greggs have been hit by the series of blustery storms that hit Britain last month.....and the coronavirus could hurt the business too. Greggs told shareholders this morning that: \u201cWe made a very strong start to 2020 in January, but in February saw a significant slowdown in sales growth as a result of the storms that have affected the UK. There is some uncertainty in the outlook, particularly given the potential impact of Coronavirus. 2019 had been a good year for Greggs. Pretax profits jumped to \u00a3108.3m, from \u00a382.6m, partly due to its new vegan range. But if customers start shunning the high street, it will suffer. European markets are a sea of green, as optimism following Wall Street\u2019s huge rally ripples across the Atlantic. As you can see, every index is up over 1% - with strong gains in London (+2%), Germany (+1.7%) and France (+1.7%). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx comments: There are rallies, and there are rallies \u2013 and boy did the Dow Jones RALLY on Monday night, posting its greatest ever points gain on the hopes that the world\u2019s central banks can muster a co-ordinated response to the coronavirus this Tuesday. It is a sign of just how bad the final week of February was that the Dow\u2019s 1,297 point \u2013 or 5.1% \u2013 increase still leaves it almost 3,000 points off of where it was on Valentine\u2019s Day. Nevertheless, after a weekend full of stimulus-suggesting statements, news that the central bank chiefs and finance ministers of the G7 would be having a conference call to discuss an action plan \u2013 like a fiscal version of the Avengers \u2013 designed to combat the coronavirus crisis was enough to point the markets in the right direction. The stock market rally is gathering pace in London, driving shares higher. The FTSE 100 is now 136 points up this morning, or 2%. But as you can see, that only recovers a small slice of last week\u2019s rout. The Footsie is still down 10% this year. Shares in holidaymaker TUI jumped by 4% at the start of trading in London. Last night, TUI announced it would cut spending and implement a hiring freeze, after suffering weaker bookings since the coronavirus outbreak began. It added: \u201cAt this point in time, we only see a marginal effect on our operations,\u201d TUI\u2019s shares had slumped by 30% last week, during the market rout. UK product testing firm Intertek were the only FTSE 100 stock falling in early trading, after warning shareholders that the factory shutdowns in China are hurting. Intertek is not immune to the impact of the Novel Coronavirus and our 2020 performance will be affected by the temporary disruption to the supply chains of our clients in China and any impact it might have on global trade activities. It is too early to quantify the impact of the Novel Coronavirus. Boom! European stock markets have jumped at the start of trading, on hope of central bank intervention. The FTSE 100 has gained 97 points, or 1.5%, taking the blue-chip index back to 6745 points. Nearly every stock is rallying. That\u2019s a solid rise, but it still leaves the Footsie 9% lower than in mid-February. Germany\u2019s DAX has jumped by 1.3%, while France\u2019s CAC and Spain\u2019s IBEX have both gained 1.5%. By calling on the Federal Reserve to \u201ccut rate big\u201d, Donald Trump is demanding significant easing of US monetary policy. The Fed funds rate is currently 1.50\u20131.75% -- compared to just 0.75% in the UK, and zero in the eurozone. So there is potential for chunky cuts, with the markets already pricing in three cuts this year. Australia\u2019s central bank has already taken action to ward off a coronavirus recession, by slashing borrowing costs to a record low. The Reserve Bank of Australia voted to lower its benchmark interest rate to just 0.5% today, from 0.75%, blaming the impact of the virus outbreak. That could set the tone for today\u2019s coronavirus conference call. My colleague Ben Butler reports: The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut official interest rates to a new record low of 0.5% due to the \u201csignificant effect\u201d of the coronavirus outbreak on the Australian economy and has signalled it is prepared to cut further if needed. \u201cThe global outbreak of the coronavirus is expected to delay progress in Australia towards full employment and the inflation target,\u201d the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, said. He said that at a meeting on Tuesday the bank\u2019s board \u201ctherefore judged that it was appropriate to ease monetary policy further to provide additional support to employment and economic activity\u201d. The RBA\u2019s move could be the first of a series of interest rate cuts in the weeks ahead, if central banks decide they need to act. President Donald Trump has seized on the RBA\u2019s move as a stick to beat America\u2019s Federal Reserve --- claiming, for the nth time, that Fed chief Jerome Powell is blundering. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Can policymakers save the world economy from being dragged into a recession by a coronavirus epidemic? Markets are looking for action when top central bankers and G7 finance ministers hold a teleconference call today. Led by US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, it will discuss the \u201cwidening coronavirus outbreak and its economic impact. Obviously these Lords of Finance can\u2019t come up with a vaccine to tame Covid-19. But if they can deliver easier monetary policy and growth-friendly spending plans, they could protect businesses from the economic shock of the coronavirus. Hopes of a breakthrough today triggered a monster rally on Wall Street last night. The Dow posted its biggest points gain ever (1,297) as it surged by 5.1% - its best day since March 2009. European markets are expected to open higher today, with the EU-wide Stoxx 600 called up around 0.6%. But will policymakers deliver? Reuters is reporting that a draft statement is already being prepared, which doesn\u2019t yet call for fresh fiscal spending or coordinated interest rate cuts by central banks. So that optimism could yet falter, if yesterday\u2019s rally proves to be a classic \u2018dead cat bounce\u2019. Also coming up today Outgoing Bank of England governor Mark Carney is appearing before the UK parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee today. He leaves the BoE on the 15th March, so can speak pretty freely about monetary policy, the state of the economy, and the Bank itself. We also get a health check on UK construction this morning. It may show that the sector contracted slightly again last month. The agenda 9.30am GMT: Bank of England governorMark Carney appears before Treasury committee 9.30am GMT: UK construction PMI - expected to rise to 49.0 from 48.4 Noon GMT: G7 finance ministers and central bankers hold coronavirus teleconference",

The city\u2019s assemblywoman picked Elizabeth Warren. What do the voters have to say? </strong>The Guardian\u2019s West Coast reporter Mario Koran brings us this dispatch: </p> \n  <p>On paper, this should be Bernie Sanders country. Sanders, the clear front runner, boasts 42% of the state\u2019s Latino vote. Chula Vista, just a 10-minute trolley ride away from the US-Mexico border, is about 61% Latino; nearly half the city speaks Spanish. <br></p> \n  <p>But Warren has made significant inroads here, grabbing the endorsement of Lorena Gonzalez, the high-powered, Latina assemblywoman who represents this district. Last month <a href=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/story/2020-02-22/former-obama-official-rallies-barrio-logan-crowd-for-warren\">Gonzalez joined Julian Castro</a> as they stumped for Warren at a brewery not far from Chula Vista. <br></p> \n  <p>Chula Vista\u2019s mayor, Mary Salas, appeared to be swayed by neither: Her endorsement went to Mike Bloomberg, adding to a growing list of major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/24/california-mayors-endorse-mike-bloomberg-us-election-2020-london-breed\">US cities whose leaders</a> have embraced the former NYC mayor. <br></p> \n  <p>Some of the cities whose mayors have endorsed Bloomberg are also the beneficiaries of <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/equity/2020/02/2020-presidential-election-candidates-mayor-endorsements/605797/\">hundreds of millions</a> in grant money from Bloomberg Philanthropies \u2014 though Bloomberg\u2019s campaign has scoffed at the suggestion that his support is purchased.<br></p> \n  <p>A visit to the polls proved that the political view in Chula Vista defies a simple narrative.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cMike proved he can run a city. Realistically, he can take on Trump,\u201d said 19-year-old Rosalinda Gomez said outside of her Chula Vista polling place. <br></p> \n  <p>But her friend, Dafne Ariza, believes Sanders is the better candidate to address the issues that matter most to her. </p> \n  <p>\u201cSanders is for everything I care about - immigration reform, LGBTQ rights,\u201d Dafne says.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MarioKoran/status/1234914106513117184\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here in Chula Vista, Dafne and Rosalinda, both 19, split for Bloomberg and Sanders.<br><br>\"Mike proved he can run a city.

The state\u2019s voter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SChang_MH/status/1234872716563550208\">lookup tool briefly crashed</a> Tuesday morning because of heavy online traffic. It was later back up and running.</li> \n   <li>There were glitches with printers in Bexar county, long lines in <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Dallas</strong>, and a shortage of poll workers in Travis county after many poll workers didn\u2019t show up. The Travis county clerk <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.kut.org/post/travis-county-poll-workers-coronavirus-fears-prompt-rocky-start-election-day\">said</a> one of the reasons people didn\u2019t come to work was out of coronavirus concerns. </li> \n   <li>There were also issues with printers in two <strong>North Carolina</strong> counties that were quickly fixed, the Raleigh News and Observer <a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article240831926.html\">reported</a>. Democracy NC, a civic group helping to monitor voting in the state, said there were also issues with curbside voting access for people with disabilities. </li> \n   <li>In <strong>California</strong>, 15 counties had issues connecting to the statewide voter database, making it difficult to update voter information once people cast their ballots, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-03/california-primary-election-los-angeles-county-voting-issues-experiences\">according to the Los Angeles Times</a>. In Los Angeles counties, there were also some long lines as voters cast their ballots using a new election system for the first time.</li> \n   <li><strong>Tennessee</strong> voters also faced additional hurdles after tornadoes ripped through the state and killed at least 22 people Tuesday. In Nashville, several polling locations were closed because of the disaster. Civil rights groups<a href=\"https://www.lawyerscommittee.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Letter-March-3-Primaries-Concerning-Tornadoes-in-Tennssee.2020.03.03..pdf\"> asked state election officials</a> to extend voting for several days to accommodate people affected by the disaster.</li> \n   <li>In <strong>Minnesota</strong>, the secretary of state<a href=\"https://www.sos.state.mn.us/about-the-office/news-room/sec-simon-statement-on-pollfinder-issues/\"> apologized</a> after a staffer redirected voters using the state\u2019s voter lookup tool to a progressive website.

In November, for the first time in the organization\u2019s history, every item the group endorsed won. <br></p> \n  <p>But Tuesday\u2019s voter guide had one very prominent item with no position: that of president. <br></p> \n  <p>Cynthia Crews-Pollock, who is on the steering committee of the League of Pissed Off Voters, explained that at the endorsement meeting in December, the group was of three separate camps: \u201cOne camp of the league said we should sole endorse Bernie,\u201d she said. \u201cOne camp said we should endorse Bernie and Warren for progressive unity. Another camp said no, we should not make an endorsement - we should focus on local politics only.\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>Since no camp got a majority, the league took the position of no position - which is different than no endorsement. \u201cI think it\u2019s good because progressive voters are not monolithic,\u201d Crews-Pollock said. \u201cEverybody has a different strategy of how to get a progressive candidate in office.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>The position of no position gets tougher, however, with Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar mobilizing their moderate voters behind Joe Biden. But Crews-Pollock is not discouraged. \u201cForty-six states haven\u2019t voted yet, and the way that Biden wants to spring ahead against Bernie is to have his competition drop out,\u201d she said. \u201cThat says that our primary system is broken. So in the primaries, you should vote with your heart.\u201d <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T22:30:16.687Z\">at 10.30pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e5ed5c68f08e1332474eb4e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/vivian-ho\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T22:13:45.693Z\">10.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c779bd1e054372b6191683d4eae35ca17ccf7421\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c779bd1e054372b6191683d4eae35ca17ccf7421/195_116_3305_1984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Voters fill out their ballots for the presidential primary election at a polling station inside Hua-Zang Si buddhist temple in San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Voters fill out their ballots for the presidential primary election at a polling station inside Hua-Zang Si buddhist temple in San Francisco.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Lam/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p><strong>The Guardian\u2019s West Coast reporter Vivian Ho brings us this dispatch from San Francisco: </strong></p> \n  <p>San Francisco is electric on election days.

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a></strong>, 77, and until Sunday his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-buttigieg\">Pete Buttigieg</a></strong>, 38, appeared together before a tiny crowd in the <strong>Chicken Scratch restaurant in Dallas</strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas\">Texas</a></strong>, where Buttigieg endorsed the former vice president, Reuters writes.</p> \n  <p>Fighting back tears, Biden compared the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, to his late son Beau, saying it was the highest compliment he could offer any person.</p> \n  <p>Having ditched his own bid for the nomination, Buttigieg, who had spent months calling for generational change, said Biden would \u201cbring back dignity to the White House.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Buttigieg\u2019s endorsement was the most eye-catching among over 100 that flooded in for Biden from mostly moderate Democrats after his dominant South Carolina win on Saturday, narrowly preceded by Amy Klobuchar\u2019s endorsement and followed by former candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s last night.</p> \n  <p>Biden\u2019s comeback in South Carolina, after poor showings in other early voting states, was exactly the kind of a victory that Democratic Party officials, alarmed that front-runner Bernie Sanders is far too liberal to beat Trump, had been craving, according to more than two dozen people who either gave their endorsements or were involved behind the scenes.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t planned on endorsing anybody, but then I started getting worried that Bernie Sanders would become the nominee,\u201d said former Senator Barbara Boxer of California, a longtime Senate colleague of both Biden and Sanders.</p> \n  <p>On the eve of the South Carolina primary, she called longtime Biden aide Steve Ricchetti, telling him she would endorse Biden if he won the race.</p> \n  <p>People both inside and outside the Biden campaign said that while the effort to garner endorsements involved calls from Biden aides asking for help, most decided on their own.</p> \n  <p>\u201cPeople woke up and got a sense of urgency,\u201d said one person close to Biden.</p> \n  <p>Buttigieg\u2019s endorsement, in particular, surprised Biden.</p> \n  <p>Biden did not ask Buttigieg for his endorsement nor did the former mayor say he was going to announce support, Biden said at the Texas chicken restaurant event.</p> \n  <p>The event, which lasted only a few minutes and involved a small crowd of press, campaign supporters and people who just happened to be at the restaurant, was hastily arranged to accommodate a quick, last-minute announcement, said one person familiar with the matter.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ca18df21b5d918a5db52a1c6ba9415dff0bbbec\"> \n   <img

Associated Press have been looking at some of the measures in place in the first big test of the system since the 2018 midterms. And there\u2019s a new factor at play - coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>In 2016, the Russians weaponized social media to sow discord among Americans, scanned state and local election systems for cyber vulnerabilities and deployed the targeted release of stolen campaign emails and documents. US intelligence chiefs have warned that foreign interference remains a threat. And the recent outbreak of a new virus could present a bad actor with an opening to spread false information to keep voters away from the polls. We\u2019ve already seen misinformation about the virus on social media go, well, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/battling-coronavirus-misinformation-in-the-age-of-social-media\">viral</a>.</p> \n  <p>One California county has sought to address concerns over the coronavirus by sending bottles of hand sanitizer to polling places and asking poll workers to post fliers from the public health department on how to avoid spreading the virus.</p> \n  <p>Jesse Salinas, the chief elections official in Yolo County, California, told Associated Press that a few poll workers have backed out over concerns but most understand the threat is relatively low. The county had no reported cases as of Monday morning.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are hoping people remain calm and still participate in the election process,\u201d Salinas said.</p> \n  <p>Unlike the fiasco of the Democrat counting at the Iowa caucuses, it will be state and local election officials will be administering Tuesday\u2019s elections. </p> \n  <p>\u201cTexas voters can rest assured ... that our office and those of local and county elections officials are committed to working hand in hand to ensure smooth elections as well as the integrity of our electoral process,\u201d said Stephen Chang, spokesman for the Texas Secretary of State\u2019s Office.</p> \n  <p>States vary considerably in their use of technology to run elections. Some utilize computerized voter lists known as electronic pollbooks to check in voters, while others rely on paper. Voters in a few places will be using new electronic voting machines that produce a paper record of voter selections while some voters in Texas, Tennessee and Oklahoma will be using older ones considered vulnerable by election security experts.<br></p> \n  <p>In California - widely seen as the most crucial Democrat primary to win - a new publicly owned computerized voting system the first of its kind in the nation will face a crucial test in Los Angeles County, the nation\u2019s largest elections jurisdiction with 5.4 million registered voters.<br></p> \n  <p>The new system won conditional state approval despite serious security and technical issues, with the county ordered to offer all voters the option of using hand-marked paper ballots. </p> \n  <p>An estimated 63 percent of voters were already expected to vote by mail using hand-marked paper ballots. Such ballots are considered the most reliable by election security experts because paper can\u2019t be hacked or altered by programming errors.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T11:17:58.354Z\">at 11.17am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e5e372d8f08e1332474e446\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T10:59:04.282Z\">10.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>If you\u2019d like an indication of where votes <em>might</em> go across the states voting today, then NBC News have got <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/super-tuesday-polls-state-state-look-who-s-leading-n1147246?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_np\">a state-by-state look at who\u2019s leading in the polls</a>.</p> \n  <p>They give Sanders a clear lead in California, the state where most delegates are up for grabs.

      "bodyText": "Voters in 14 states are casting their ballots today. The Guardian\u2019s reporters are covering Super Tuesday from across the nation. Bernie Sanders holds the delegate lead, but Joe Biden is emboldened by endorsements from two candidates who dropped out in recent days. In California, Biden stopped by Oakland before heading to Los Angeles. Mike Bloomberg, who is banking on a Super Tuesday victory after skipping the early primaries, was in Florida ... which doesn\u2019t vote today. A smattering of voting issues popped up in Texas, California, Tennesee and Minnesota. As voters took to the polls, lawmakers on Capitol Hill fretted about coronavirus. Donald Trump attended a roundtable with the National Institutes of Health to address the outbreak, and the Fed lowered interest rates as a protective measure. We\u2019re closing this blog, and I\u2019m passing the baton to my colleague Joan E Greve, who will report the results and more. Follow her here: Chula Vista, California\u2019s mayor endorsed Mike Bloomberg. The city\u2019s assemblywoman picked Elizabeth Warren. What do the voters have to say? The Guardian\u2019s West Coast reporter Mario Koran brings us this dispatch: On paper, this should be Bernie Sanders country. Sanders, the clear front runner, boasts 42% of the state\u2019s Latino vote. Chula Vista, just a 10-minute trolley ride away from the US-Mexico border, is about 61% Latino; nearly half the city speaks Spanish. But Warren has made significant inroads here, grabbing the endorsement of Lorena Gonzalez, the high-powered, Latina assemblywoman who represents this district. Last month Gonzalez joined Julian Castro as they stumped for Warren at a brewery not far from Chula Vista. Chula Vista\u2019s mayor, Mary Salas, appeared to be swayed by neither: Her endorsement went to Mike Bloomberg, adding to a growing list of major US cities whose leaders have embraced the former NYC mayor. Some of the cities whose mayors have endorsed Bloomberg are also the beneficiaries of hundreds of millions in grant money from Bloomberg Philanthropies \u2014 though Bloomberg\u2019s campaign has scoffed at the suggestion that his support is purchased. A visit to the polls proved that the political view in Chula Vista defies a simple narrative. \u201cMike proved he can run a city. Realistically, he can take on Trump,\u201d said 19-year-old Rosalinda Gomez said outside of her Chula Vista polling place. But her friend, Dafne Ariza, believes Sanders is the better candidate to address the issues that matter most to her. \u201cSanders is for everything I care about - immigration reform, LGBTQ rights,\u201d Dafne says. Meanwhile, Xochitl, 76, said she wants to see better health care and higher wages \u2014 a response that tracks with polling that shows Latino voters prioritize health care and wages even ahead of immigration. As for how Xochitl voted today, \u201ces un secreto\u201d, she said. The issues come as there is heightened scrutiny on the reliability and security of election machines in America. There is no evidence any of the malfunctions or other issues were caused by hackers or bad actors, reports the Guardian\u2019s voting rights correspondent Sam Levine. Texas, a closely-watched state, had several technical glitches. The state\u2019s voter lookup tool briefly crashed Tuesday morning because of heavy online traffic. It was later back up and running. There were glitches with printers in Bexar county, long lines in Dallas, and a shortage of poll workers in Travis county after many poll workers didn\u2019t show up. The Travis county clerk said one of the reasons people didn\u2019t come to work was out of coronavirus concerns. There were also issues with printers in two North Carolina counties that were quickly fixed, the Raleigh News and Observer reported. Democracy NC, a civic group helping to monitor voting in the state, said there were also issues with curbside voting access for people with disabilities. In California, 15 counties had issues connecting to the statewide voter database, making it difficult to update voter information once people cast their ballots, according to the Los Angeles Times. In Los Angeles counties, there were also some long lines as voters cast their ballots using a new election system for the first time. Tennessee voters also faced additional hurdles after tornadoes ripped through the state and killed at least 22 people Tuesday. In Nashville, several polling locations were closed because of the disaster. Civil rights groups asked state election officials to extend voting for several days to accommodate people affected by the disaster. In Minnesota, the secretary of state apologized after a staffer redirected voters using the state\u2019s voter lookup tool to a progressive website. The staffer had a \u201cserious lapse of judgment,\u201d Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon said. You can\u2019t walk by a busy intersection on election day in San Francisco without someone trying to hand you a voter guide from the San Francisco League of Pissed Off Voters, writes The Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho: The progressive group that describes itself as \u201cpolitical geeks in a torrid love affair with San Francisco\u201d has been issuing voter guides since 2004 for local, state and national politics. In November, for the first time in the organization\u2019s history, every item the group endorsed won. But Tuesday\u2019s voter guide had one very prominent item with no position: that of president. Cynthia Crews-Pollock, who is on the steering committee of the League of Pissed Off Voters, explained that at the endorsement meeting in December, the group was of three separate camps: \u201cOne camp of the league said we should sole endorse Bernie,\u201d she said. \u201cOne camp said we should endorse Bernie and Warren for progressive unity. Another camp said no, we should not make an endorsement - we should focus on local politics only.\u201d Since no camp got a majority, the league took the position of no position - which is different than no endorsement. \u201cI think it\u2019s good because progressive voters are not monolithic,\u201d Crews-Pollock said. \u201cEverybody has a different strategy of how to get a progressive candidate in office.\u201d The position of no position gets tougher, however, with Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar mobilizing their moderate voters behind Joe Biden. But Crews-Pollock is not discouraged. \u201cForty-six states haven\u2019t voted yet, and the way that Biden wants to spring ahead against Bernie is to have his competition drop out,\u201d she said. \u201cThat says that our primary system is broken. So in the primaries, you should vote with your heart.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s West Coast reporter Vivian Ho brings us this dispatch from San Francisco: San Francisco is electric on election days. Volunteers are out before the sun rises, waving signs supporting their candidates and passing out voter guides. Voters walk out of polling stations, proudly wearing their red \u201cI voted!\u201d stickers like badges of honor. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get too overly optimistic because I\u2019ve been a progressive my whole life, but this is the first time that any candidate I\u2019ve voted for has ever had this good of a chance,\u201d said Mokai DePolo, 65, as he balanced two large Bernie Sanders signs against his shoulder. A few weeks ago, Stacey DePolo, 45, registered the website, berniewon.me \u2013 it leads back to this New York Times opinion piece. \u201cBecause he already won by shifting the possibility of debate, with the movement he\u2019s created, with our revolution,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we have all the candidates fighting over who\u2019s more progressive, whose Green Deal is better than whose Green Deal. Bernie already won, no matter what happens.\u201d Healthcare has been a major \u2013 or even the main \u2013 issue for voters in the primaries so far and is sure to factor into many Super Tuesday voters\u2019 decisions today. Amid the coronavirus outbreak, even Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill are advocating for the sort of public healthcare that all the Democratic presidential candidates are proposing (in varying forms). Representative Ted Yoho, a Republican of Florida who has opposed the Affordable Care Act, nevertheless advocated for free coronavirus testing and treatment for uninsured Americans, according to HuffPost\u2019s Matt Fuller. \u201cYou can look at it as socialized medicine, but in the face of an outbreak, a pandemic, what\u2019s your options?\u201d Yoho said. Lawmakers \u2013 who skew older, tend to travel a lot \u2013 seem to be especially wary of contracting the disease. BuzzFeed News\u2019 Paul McLeod reports that Bill Cassidy, a Republican senator from Louisiana, was generous with his hand sanitizer. The mayor of Richmond, Virginia, said Joe Biden\u2019s South Carolina victory was an \u201cearthquake\u201d in the Democratic primary. The Guardian\u2019s senior political reporter Daniel Strauss reports: \u201cI think in South Carolina there was an earthquake that shook up this race,\u201d said Richmond mayor Levar Stoney. \u201cAnd it showed that the bedrock of the Democratic, that being African American voters, had a clear choice for the nomination. And his name is Joseph R Biden.\u201d Stoney\u2019s comments come just days after the South Carolina Democratic primary which Biden won by double digits. Since then Biden has enjoyed a wave of endorsements, including from two moderate rivals in the primary, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar and former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, who dropped out and backed him. The victory and endorsements have acted as a jolt of optimism for Biden\u2019s supporters. Asked if Stoney thought former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, one of the remaining other more moderate candidates left in the primary, should drop out, the Richmond mayor said it was up to the mayor. But he said supporters curious about Bloomberg would come to Biden now. \u201cI\u2019m never going to tell anyone to get out of the race,\u201d Stoney said. \u201cThat\u2019s for the mayor to choose. But what I recognize that some folks have flirted, dated, dabbled a little with Mike Bloomberg over the last couple months and they\u2019re coming home. They\u2019re coming home to Joe. That is comforting over the last three days, since the Saturday victory in South Carolina. It\u2019s time to stop the flirtation and get serious.\u201d Bloomberg, pressed on his expectations for Super Tuesday voting, claimed that: \u201cIf there\u2019s only three candidates, you can\u2019t do worse than that. But, of course, he can, Richard Luscombe reports from West Palm Beach: After a reporter politely reminded him that Elizabeth Warren remained alongside himself, Sanders and Joe Biden, Bloomberg appeared confused. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize she\u2019s still in, is she?\u201d he wondered. He was also prickly when asked if he\u2019d considered withdrawing from the race after two poor debate performances and tepid polling numbers. \u201cHave you asked Joe if he is going to drop out?\u201d Bloomberg responded. \u201cWhen you ask him, then you can call me.\u201d Next up: Orlando and a rally-the-troops visit to one of 20 field offices statewide that his free-spending Bloomberg campaign hopes to have operational before the primary. Then it was on to the Palm Beach county convention center four miles from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort for the evening rally-cum-watch party. The former New York mayor is picking up the tab for supporters\u2019 parking and refreshments tonight, dipping further into the $500m war chest he has invested into his campaign from his estimated personal fortune of $55bn. Richard Luscombe reports from West Palm Beach: Bloomberg spent Super Tuesday hopping around Florida, a state that does not vote until 17 March, before heading to an evening rally in West Palm Beach \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s back yard \u2013 to await his fate. The former New York mayor has already spent about $35m on TV ads in the Sunshine State two weeks before primary day, and his furious criss-crossing today, while his opponents are elsewhere, highlights the importance to his campaign of Florida\u2019s 219 delegates. First up was the politicians\u2019 traditional photo-op stopover in Miami\u2019s Little Havana neighborhood, slurping on coffee-flavored ice cream from a Cuban-owned parlor on Calle Ocho. Mindful of his surroundings, he slammed Bernie Sanders\u2019 questionable recent comments praising post-revolution literacy programs on the communist Caribbean island. \u201cWe will not win Florida with a candidate who sings the praises of Fidel Castro and downplays the atrocities he has committed in Cuba,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cSome of those comments are hurtful and offensive to [those] who have come here to start a new life.\u201d Minnesota\u2019s top election official apologized Tuesday after a staffer redirected voters to a progressive group\u2019s website when they tried to look up their polling locations Steve Simon, Minnesota\u2019s secretary of state, said the staffer had a \u201cserious lapse of judgment\u201d. The staffer linked to the website after the secretary of state\u2019s pollfinder website went down on Tuesday. The office planned to go to a non-partisan backup, but the staffer diverted from that plan and linked to a poll location finder on boldprogressives.org. The website belongs to the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which backs Senator Elizabeth Warren. The link was up for 17 minutes, Simon said in a statement. \u201cThe moment this error was discovered, we corrected the link,\u201d Simon, a Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cAnyone who knows me knows that I place the highest possible value on the nonpartisanship of this office, and I deeply regret this error.\u201d While Biden was inside meeting with supporters, dozens of Bernie Sanders supporters rallied and chanted outside Buttercup Diner \u201cBernie has historically been the candidate to fight for the folks that we fight for on a daily basis, sitting across from us in our offices, sitting across from us as we\u2019re doing radical sidewalk therapy,\u201d said Danielle Herrera, an associate therapist at the Harm Reduction Therapy Center. \u201cHe\u2019s been working for them since the beginning of his political campaign and we support that.\u201d Herrera and her two coworkers work near Buttercup Diner, and came out when they heard Biden was going to stop by. They joined the Bernie supporters when they saw them rallying, waving \u201cNot Me, Us\u201d signs in support. Leticia Brown, another therapist with the Harm Reduction Therapy Center, said as a Bernie supporter, she has some concern about the recent momentum behind Biden with the Buttigieg and Klobuchar endorsements. \u201cBut I\u2019m not worried in the sense that we\u2019ve had folks that we thought were longshots before,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe had Barack Obama in the presidency and I remember when he announced that he was going to run, I thought, this is too soon. This is too early. Bernie, the numbers, the math is behind him. Things are being pulled in ways when it\u2019s not just a fringe movement. People are impacted by all the things that he talks about. For us, if we fall into fear and worry, then we are just going to keep doing the same thing with the same results. Just having hope and believing this can happen needs to be a driving force for people going to the ballots today.\u201d Dozens of Biden supporters squeezed in with members of the press at Buttercup Diner in Oakland, California, for Joe Biden to make his first of two appearances in California today. Capt \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger, the pilot who emergency-landed a plane on the Hudson river, and Oakland mayor Libby Schaaf were among the local big names to welcome Biden to Oakland. After ordering a slice of coconut cream pie, Biden shook hands and took selfies with supporters at the diner. \u201cThe mayor was like, \u2018This is one of our brightest stars, a small-business owner,\u2019 and he was like, \u2018What do you sell,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I sell sex toys,\u2019 and he was like, \u2018I got to come by!\u2019\u201d said Nenner Joiner, owner of Feelmore, the first black-owned sex shop in Oakland. Joiner voted for Biden because \u201cwe\u2019re going to make sure that the next candidate that gets in there is actually going to win.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just the next person to win \u2013 I like his morals, I like his values, I like his judgments,\u201d Joiner said. \u201cLet\u2019s just hope that he also has the relationships to build a better future for us.\u201d In Texas, there were long waits and a few glitches, the Guardian\u2019s voting rights reporter Sam Levine writes: In Dallas, one voter told WFAA he waited for two hours at the Fretz Park branch library. Another voter told the station he was leaving without casting a ballot after waiting an hour in line. In Travis county, home of Austin, the county clerk said voting had gotten off to a \u201crocky start\u201d because pollworkers hadn\u2019t shown up for work. One of the reasons they weren\u2019t showing up, the clerk said, was out of concerns over the coronavirus. In Bexar county, home of San Antonio, there were issues when voting first started because of difficulties connecting to printers at the precinct, said Jacque Callanen, the county election administrator. One polling location had no power, leaving the machines operating on batteries, KTSA reported. The Guardian\u2019s Los Angeles correspondent Sam Levin has been chatting with voters in Koreatown, where there\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and also some fear about Joe Biden\u2019s recent rise: \u201cI\u2019ve never felt like I trusted a political candidate before,\u201d said Nat Tereshchenko, a 23 year old who works for a union and voted for Sanders. \u201cOur system just doesn\u2019t care about working-class people. To see the way he\u2019s mobilized people who haven\u2019t voted before means so much ... What he is proposing is not all that radical. I want to push his ideas even further.\u201d Tereshchenko said they were worried about Biden and frustrated Warren was still in the race: \u201cIt makes me scared. If Biden secures the nomination, we will definitely have Trump.\u201d Nelson Cole, 26, who works for a literary manager and also voted for Sanders, said he was hopeful that Sanders or Warren would win: \u201cSeeing the panic about Bernie shows just how much excitement there is for this new direction. If it\u2019s Bernie or Warren, I think we\u2019ll hear them talk more about the issues and less about the distractions.\u201d He said he was encouraged by the turnout in the voter center: \u201cI\u2019m seeing a lot of young people out here, so I\u2019m hoping for the best.\u201d Pooja Nair, a 32-year-old lawyer, voted for Warren and was once in her class when the senator was a professor: \u201cShe has a path forward. I think it\u2019s narrow, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question. The field just narrowed. I believe in the primary, you vote for the candidate you believe in.\u201d She said most of her friends were choosing between Biden and Sanders: \u201cAny Democrat will have a much more pro-science attitude. That\u2019s what we need during a global health crisis.\u201d In Oxford, England, Bernie Sanders\u2019 brother Larry has cast his absentee ballot ... the Guardian US chief reporter Ed Pilkington writes: Larry Sanders, a Green Party spokesperson in the UK, has been feeling \u201cthe Bernard\u201d today. The Brooklyn-born politician, 84, who has lived in the UK since the late 1960s, has just participated in the Democrats Abroad primary. He voted in Oxford for his younger brother who he calls Bernard, or Bernie to you and me. \u201cBernard\u2019s policies are very mainstream,\u201d he told the Oxford Mail outside the polling station. Asked whether he\u2019d be tempted to move back to the US were his brother to win in November, he replied: \u201cI\u2019d be tempted to visit a lot\u201d. Though the Sanders brothers have been separated by the Atlantic for more than 50 years, they have a special bond. At the Democratic National Convention in 2016, Larry cast the delegates vote of Democrats Abroad for his brother, giving a tearful speech about how proud their parents would have been of Bernie\u2019s achievements. Joe Biden is hoping his success in South Carolina can spill over into North Carolina, the Guardian\u2019s David Smith reports from Charlotte. But the former vice-president is facing a stiff challenge from Bernie Sanders: David and Lisa Ruch voted for Sanders at a polling place at the Wells Fargo Sense Science Garden in rainy Charlotte on Tuesday. \u201cI just feel we\u2019re in a place where we need a lot of change,\u201d said Lisa, 59, a real estate agent. \u201cWe need someone for the people, not a self-promoting president any more. We need change in health care and Bernie can get it done.\u201d Lisa had considered Biden but admitted: \u201cI\u2019m not sure about his capability in the long term. There\u2019s something a little off.\u201d Mike Bloomberg had several signs outside the voting place but Lisa was unimpressed: \u201cI feel like he\u2019s a Republican trying to be a Democrat to win an election. He\u2019s just another Donald Trump buying his way in.\u201d Her husband David, 66, a therapist and life coach, agreed: \u201cI don\u2019t like him. He is certainly a poster child for money in politics.\u201d David explained his vote for Sanders: \u201cI\u2019m charged by his connection with the people and how he\u2019s trying to build a people\u2019s movement rather than a corporate agenda. He\u2019s been in government a long time fighting for the little guy.\u201d The president is attending a briefing and roundtable at the National Institutes of Health vaccine research center. His administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak has come under sharp criticism, as health experts warn that hospitals were ill-prepared to handle the influx of cases. Under pressure from Trump, the US Federal Reserve slashed interest rates in an emergency move to protect the economy. Follow the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of coronavirus and its impact around the world: In Tennessee, the recent tornadoes have disrupted voting... the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: A civil rights group called on officials to extend primary voting after tornadoes significantly damaged the state Tuesday, killing at least 22 people. The letter from the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law came after 21 election sites were closed because of the tornado, according to the Tennessean. The outlet reported voters were being redirected to other locations to cast their ballots. Some polling sites opened an hour later than scheduled. \u201cGiven the devastation and loss of life, we urge you to immediately extend voting in the primaries through at least the end of the week to provide voters a fair opportunity to access the polls,\u201d Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee, wrote in a letter to Governor Bill Lee, Secretary of State Tre Harnett and Mark Goins, the state coordinator of elections. On a call with reporters Tuesday, Clarke said the group was considering additional action, including a lawsuit if the officials did not extend voting. What about Biden and Bloomberg? Biden\u2019s plan calls for $20bn for the National Housing Trust Fund, and Mike Bloomberg\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t specify an amount. All the candidates have pushed for measures to fight housing discrimination. Diane Yentel, president of the NLIHC, said the plans were all significant: \u201cThe federal government has for decades turned its back on the funding investments needed to keep the lowest-income people affordably housed. We\u2019ve never had a moment like this where we\u2019ve had housing policy and the discussion of the crisis and the solutions as a major part of the presidential campaigns before.\u201d You can read NLHIC breakdowns of the plans for Biden, Bloomberg, Sanders and Warren. Elizabeth Warren: $500bn toward affordable housing Warren\u2019s plan calls for investing $500bn over the next ten years to build, preserve and rehab units that will be affordable to lower-income families. The senator is focused on the supply of housing and recognizes that if \u201cwe solve affordability at the middle-income level, it doesn\u2019t trickle down\u201d, said Noelle Porter, director of government affairs at the National Housing Law Project, who reviewed the candidates\u2019 plans. \u201cShe\u2019s talking about extremely low-income renters \u2026 If we solve deep affordability, it trickles back up.\u201d The Democrats have all proposed investments in the National Housing Trust Fund, which states currently use to build and rehabilitate affordable housing. Currently, there is roughly $260m available in the fund per year, but the nonpartisan National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) recommends that it is expanded to at least $40bn a year. As senator, Warren pushed legislation that would increase the amount to $45bn. The Sanders campaign\u2019s housing proposal calls for $148bn. Bernie Sanders: A $2.5tn \u201chousing for all\u201d plan Sanders\u2019 plan is in some ways the most radical in terms of the scope of proposed funding and the kinds of regulations he is targeting, according to some tenants\u2019 rights activists and supporters of the Vermont senator. Most significantly, he is the only candidate to propose a national rent control standard, meaning an annual cap on rent increases, and is pushing a policy that would prevent landlords from evicting tenants for arbitrary or retaliatory reasons. It\u2019s a policy that tenant organizers have long pursued at the local level, but has never been pursued by a frontrunner presidential candidate at the federal scale. \u201cIt\u2019s what tenants need now to just have the most basic levels of protection,\u201d said Lacei Amodei, an advocate with the Eviction Defense Collaborative in Hayward, California, who endorsed Sanders. \u201cWith soaring rents and so many people being evicted \u2026 it is one of the most urgent issues.\u201d Tracy Jeanne Rosenthal, a Sanders supporter and co-founder of the LA Tenants Union (a group that has not endorsed a candidate), said it was remarkable to have a candidate acknowledge that the profit motives that drive the housing market are not good for the public. National rent control, she said, could mean \u201cincredible relief for tenants \u2026 and more stable communities\u201d. Voters across California say that the most important issue to them is the state\u2019s severe housing and homelessness crisis, and the Democratic presidential candidates appear to be responding. And across the country, there is a shortfall of roughly 7m homes that are affordable and available to the lowest-income people. The 2020 campaigns have all released detailed housing policy plans. Here\u2019s what you need to know about them. In Oakland, California, Joe Biden was joined by mayor Libby Schaaf and hero pilot Sully Sullenberger at Buttercup Diner. The former vice president ordered a coconut cream pie, per the Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho. Biden, riding high off a wave of endorsements from his former 2020 rivals and Democratic politicians across the country, said he\u2019s \u201cfeeling really good today\u201d. The moderate Democrat is divisive in Oakland. As Sanders supporters rallied outside the diner, Biden met with supporters inside. Mario also spoke to several Bernie Sanders supporters: Zaira Martinez, a 24 year-old-student and mental health worker, said the issue she cares most about is healthcare \u2013 an answer that tracks with polling which shows health care, not immigrant rights, as the number one priority for Latino voters. \u201cI really appreciate consistency, and Sanders\u2019 record goes back so many years. He doesn\u2019t bend,\u201d said Martinez. And it may be the voice of Latinas, not Latinos, that register a bigger impact. Research shows that Latinas consistently vote at higher rates than men. The Sanders campaign has invested a lot of time and resources to reach Latino voters in this state. Hello! Maanvi Singh, here taking over from the west coast. Our reporters are all over California, covering the elections in the most populous US state. In San Diego, near the US-Mexico border, the Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran brings us a first dispatch: There\u2019s steady foot traffic into the polling place in San Diego\u2019s Barrio Logan neighborhood, a historically Latino neighborhood where murals tell the story of a hard-fought Chicano movement. As Bernie Sanders is slated to run away with California\u2019s delegates, he\u2019ll look to predominantly Latino communities, where polling shows him as the candidate of choice. But even in historically brown neighborhoods, a quick visit to the polls shows no votes can be taken for granted. Augustin, 49, a Barrio Logan resident who preferred not to give his last name, said the last four years that Donald Trump has made him a believer. \u201cI didn\u2019t vote for him in 2016, but he\u2019s done a good job. Against all odds, he\u2019s gotten things done. He\u2019s not always nice, but he says what he believes,\u201d said Augustin, who identifies as Latino. My colleague on the west coast, Maanvi Singh, will take on the blog now as Super Tuesday voting - and related drama - continues. Later, Joan Greve in Washington, DC, will helm the blog as the polls begin to close and the results trickle in tonight. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far today: Former FBI director James Comey just endorsed Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination. Kamala Harris: will she or won\u2019t she? Endorse Biden and, if so, when? Rumors and reports abound. On the second most important voting day of the 2020 election (after election day itself in November), it\u2019s a fierce battle between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, with major efforts at disruption of what could become a two-horse race by Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates in a rare emergency move, to try to mitigate the economic effects of coronavirus. But it wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy Donald Trump. The Trump administration is considering using a national disaster program to pay hospitals and doctors for their care of uninsured people infected with the coronavirus. As concerns rise over costs of treating some of the 27 million Americans without health coverage, the government is looking for news ways to step in, a person familiar with the conversations told the Wall Street Journal. This would certainly be unexpected. The WSJ reports that: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has been in discussions about using that program to pay providers who treat uninsured patients with coronavirus, the person said. Dr. Robert Kadlec, who is the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, also said Tuesday at a congressional hearing that discussions are being held about using the National Disaster Medical System reimbursement program. About 2% of people infected with coronavirus have died and about 5% have developed serious infections that may require oxygen therapy or ventilators, based on research on cases in China. In the U.S., there are more than 100 coronavirus cases, Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at the congressional hearing Tuesday that \u201cwe are seeing community transmission in a few places.\u201d The administration is focusing on the costs of caring for uninsured people because individuals otherwise would have coverage through Medicaid, employers, or through private insurance purchased on the individual market, according to the person familiar with the conversations. No final decision has been made. Meanwhile, the Guardian reports on the unpreparedness of the US health system. Just what Joe was looking for, obviously. Kamala? No Comey, James Comey. The former FBI director just endorsed Joe Biden. Comey was fired by Trump in 2017 when, effectively, the FBI director refused to pledge loyalty to the president and extricate him from the Trump-Russia investigation that Comey was in charge of. The move triggered the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to take over the inquiry. Comey has been very outspoken against Trump ever since, but has flaws of his own, having misjudged in the later stages of the 2016 election the situation where the FBI kept secret the fact that they were investigating Trump in what was undoubtedly a huge international scandal - while disclosing a last-minute probe into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails on Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer (the disgraced ex-congressman then married to Hillary Clinton\u2019s right-hand aide Huma Abedin). The emails turned out to be harmless, in the sense of whether they were a threat to national security, but the very disclosure of the probe at that sensitive time was a serious blow to Clinton. Comey also admitted in December \u201creal sloppiness\u201d over the handling of surveillance of a Trump campaign adviser. California governor votes on Super Tuesday Gavin Newsom\u2019s a fan of Kamala Harris and since the California senator dropped out of the presidential race in early December, it\u2019s been and remains unclear who the governor is backing for the Democratic nomination. Apparently we\u2019ll have to wait a little longer to find out. Regardless of what the next few hours bring in the \u201cwill she, won\u2019t she\u201d endorse Biden cliffhanger, surely no-one will think of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris today without their minds flicking immediately back to that pivotal moment in the second Democratic debate last June, in Miami, when Harris scored a bullseye against Biden and her campaign took off like a rocket (until she fell to Earth in December). My politics colleague Lauren Gambino wrote at the time: It was the most dramatic moment of the evening and came in response to a question about race and policing, when Harris interjected, saying that she had a right to respond as the only black candidate on stage. The California senator and former prosecutor then directed her comments to Biden, denouncing his record on race. \u201cI do not believe you are a racist,\u201d Harris said, looking directly at the former vice-president. \u201cBut,\u201d she continued, \u201cit is personal. And it was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.\u201d She accused Biden of supporting policies that would have prevented young minority students like herself from attending school in majority-white districts. She said when he opposed bussing, there was a little black girl in Oakland, California, who was being bussed to a better school. \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that little girl was me.\u201d Growing visibly upset, Biden looked away. \u201cThat is a mischaracterization of my position across the board. I did not praise racists. That is not true,\u201d he said. California Senator Kamala Harris, who dropped out of the presidential race in early December, may be ready to endorse Joe Biden.... That would be a huge fillip for Biden, not least in California, where he is extremely keen to spoil a Sanders primary landslide. But it will be a big bonus nationwide as Super Tuesday voters stream to the polls, a terrific last-minute boost for the former VP in his dramatic comeback. NBC\u2019s Bay Area anchor Raj Mathai has just posted a crucial update on his previous news, however. Watch this space. All of the Democrats running for president have pitched substantial climate plans - responding to voters\u2019 increasing concerns about rising temperatures and their widespread effects. Two in three registered voters (66%) are worried about global warming, according to Yale\u2019s climate change communication program. That includes 84% of liberal Democrats, 72% of moderate/conservative Democrats, and about half of liberal/moderate Republicans, but only a quarter of conservative Republicans. In one Super Tuesday state, Texas, two-thirds of voters want to develop more renewable energy. But presidential contenders, particularly the more moderate ones, are cautiously navigating climate politics. Both Joe Biden and Mike Bloomberg have refused to commit to banning fracking, which will likely give them an edge in oil and gas states. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren would ban the method of extracting oil and gas, which would drastically reduce drilling in the US. Banning fracking, however, would require action from Congress, which seems politically untenable. Supporters of Biden and Bloomberg say they are focused on the actions they can achieve with executive authority. The candidates also split over nuclear power - which provides more than half of zero-carbon electricity in the US. Many experts argue that climate plans that don\u2019t include nuclear aren\u2019t serious. Sanders would prohibit the construction of new nuclear plants and stop renewing licenses for existing ones. Warren said she opposed new nuclear plants and would phase out existing ones, but she has since backtracked. California has already shut down its nuclear plants. It was a scene that was hard to imagine just one week ago. Joe Biden, 77, and until Sunday his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination Pete Buttigieg, 38, appeared together before a tiny crowd in the Chicken Scratch restaurant in Dallas, Texas, where Buttigieg endorsed the former vice president, Reuters writes. Fighting back tears, Biden compared the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, to his late son Beau, saying it was the highest compliment he could offer any person. Having ditched his own bid for the nomination, Buttigieg, who had spent months calling for generational change, said Biden would \u201cbring back dignity to the White House.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s endorsement was the most eye-catching among over 100 that flooded in for Biden from mostly moderate Democrats after his dominant South Carolina win on Saturday, narrowly preceded by Amy Klobuchar\u2019s endorsement and followed by former candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s last night. Biden\u2019s comeback in South Carolina, after poor showings in other early voting states, was exactly the kind of a victory that Democratic Party officials, alarmed that front-runner Bernie Sanders is far too liberal to beat Trump, had been craving, according to more than two dozen people who either gave their endorsements or were involved behind the scenes. \u201cI hadn\u2019t planned on endorsing anybody, but then I started getting worried that Bernie Sanders would become the nominee,\u201d said former Senator Barbara Boxer of California, a longtime Senate colleague of both Biden and Sanders. On the eve of the South Carolina primary, she called longtime Biden aide Steve Ricchetti, telling him she would endorse Biden if he won the race. People both inside and outside the Biden campaign said that while the effort to garner endorsements involved calls from Biden aides asking for help, most decided on their own. \u201cPeople woke up and got a sense of urgency,\u201d said one person close to Biden. Buttigieg\u2019s endorsement, in particular, surprised Biden. Biden did not ask Buttigieg for his endorsement nor did the former mayor say he was going to announce support, Biden said at the Texas chicken restaurant event. The event, which lasted only a few minutes and involved a small crowd of press, campaign supporters and people who just happened to be at the restaurant, was hastily arranged to accommodate a quick, last-minute announcement, said one person familiar with the matter. Virginia is the fourth-largest prize on Super Tuesday, awarding 99 pledged delegates, ranking behind California (415), Texas (228) and North Carolina (110), the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. It\u2019s a huge day in this increasingly-blue swing state and will be a useful early indicator of how things are going for the leading candidates Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren when polls close at 7pm ET. Meanwhile, WDBJ7, the CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Roanoke, Va, reports: Virginia Tech Professor and WDBJ7 Political Analyst, Bob Denton, said Virginia\u2019s primary will likely come down to a three-way race among Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg. Elizabeth Warren remains in the race, but in the last 48 hours, Tom Steyer, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar have ended their campaigns. Biden, Denton said, has picked up momentum following a decisive win in South Carolina. \u201cIn a matter of one month he\u2019s gone from a distant third to first in the most recent poll, by three or four points,\u201d Denton said, \u201cso it makes him extremely viable.\u201d Denton said Sanders has an opportunity to make a statement. \u201cAnd if he has a very strong night,\u201d Denton said, \u201cthat will certainly send an interesting message indeed for the Democrats.\u201d And Bloomberg must prove himself in Virginia, after focusing his attention and millions in campaign spending on Super Tuesday, WDBJ7 reports from Blacksburg, Va, the home of Virginia Tech university. Virginia congresswoman and moderate Democrat Abigail Spanberger, part of the Blue Wave in the 2018 midterms, who flipped her red district in her first ever run for office, mourns the departure of Klobuchar and urges her fellow Virginians to get out and vote in this key primary today. Abby to Amy: Rocky in the Rockies? Will Joe Biden pull back from way behind in Colorado primary voting today and, if making significant progress, how many delegates will he pull in? Two Colorado polls last week gave Sanders leads of 12 and 14 percentage points over the rest of the field in the purple state, the Denver Post reports. Those were pre-Biden South Carolina primary landslide, obviously, but the indications had been that Elizabeth Warren could come in second behind Sanders. So will the Biden phoenix-like rise of late make a difference tonight? State watchers expect a strong voter turn-out in Colorado today and a lot of undecided voters making late decisions - perhaps wise in light of the developments of the last 48 hours. It\u2019s definitely Bernie\u2019s to lose. Bernie just voted He\u2019s in his home state of Vermont today and will be there tonight as the results come rolling in. It could be a long night, especially waiting for a result in California, where the polls don\u2019t close until 8pm local time. Will Bernie Sanders follow his strong performances in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada voting with a good show east and west? Will it be enough to hold off Joe Biden? If he beats Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts tonight it could be a harbinger for where Warren\u2019s campaign is going to end up. But will it mean the start of a sweep for Sanders, or will Biden capitalize strongly on his South Carolina win - leaving California as a late-night cliffhanger? The Boston Globe has a handy \u201ceverything you need to know on Super Tuesday in Massachusetts\u201d piece, here. The Globe has endorsed Warren for the Democratic nomination. And my senior politics reporter colleague Lauren Gambino will be on the spot when Joe Biden rounds off a hectic day of campaigning in some key Super Tuesday states, with an event in Los Angeles. Here she shares her thoughts on what to expect from Super Tuesday with the Guardian\u2019s award-winning news podcast Today in Focus. At 29 minutes long it\u2019s the perfect commuter-listen. Ah, so the president perhaps thinks the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency rate cut over coronavirus concerns is kinda cute, but Not Enough for Potus\u2019s liking. Follow all the business details on our dedicated live blog out of London. Today is the biggest voting event of 2020 before actual election day in November. With California bringing its primary voting forward to join Super Tuesday and the warring moderate wing of the Democratic party suddenly coalescing around Joe Biden, it\u2019s going to be an exhilarating/nail-biting night. They say everything is big in Texas and the biggest thing going on there today is Joe Biden\u2019s hope - because if he loses Tex and California to Bernie it could be very grim for his prospects. After a rambunctious rally in Dallas last night, after a string of key endorsements, the Biden campaign is reportedly feeling very confident. \u201cI expect to win Texas,\u201d Cristobal Alex, a senior adviser to Biden and native of El Paso, told Politico. The Lone Star state will award 261 pledged delegates at today\u2019s primary. If Texas is really in play for the Democrats this November, today is a good day to start. Down ticket, new names are emerging in the effort to push Texas to the blue end of purple and try to flip the state. Barbra: \u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this\u201d We HAVE to pivot now. To Barbra Streisand. One of Hollywood\u2019s most loyal Democratic donors over the years, the 77-year-old\u2019s written a searing op-ed for Variety, so stop what you\u2019re doing and check this out before you hit the polling station, if you\u2019re in a Super Tuesday voting state. She says she fears the country \u201ccould be extinguished\u201d if Donald Trump wins reelection in November. \u201cEvery morning I wake up, holding my breath while I turn on my phone to see the latest news. I think to myself, \u2018It can\u2019t be worse than yesterday.\u2019 But when the news loads, I think, \u2018Ohhhhh, yes, it is worse. Since 2016, we\u2019ve been dragged down into the mud of Trump\u2019s swamp. We can\u2019t go on like this. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d \u201cEvery day, he takes another swipe at the pillars of our democracy, but we cannot allow him to irrevocably change this country,\u201d Streisand writes. \u201cThe \u2018beacon of hope\u2019 that is America could be extinguished if he\u2019s given another four years.\u201d The US Federal Reserve has slashed US interest rates in an emergency measure to protect America\u2019s economy from the coronavirus. Follow our business live blog for all the developments, here. In an unscheduled move, the Fed is cutting its benchmark rate to between 1% and 1.25%. That\u2019s down from 1.5% to 1.75%. The move comes two weeks before its next official meeting, but just three hours after that joint conference call with G7 finance ministers and central bankers. The Fed says: The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity. In light of these risks and in support of achieving its maximum employment and price stability goals, the Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point, to 1 to 1-1/4 percent. The Committee is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. Michael Ellis, a White House lawyer and former counsel to the House intelligence committee under Republican Devin Nunes is the new senior director for intelligence on the National Security Council. It\u2019s the latest instance of Donald Trump elevating a trusted loyalist to control the intelligence community, according to a Politico report this morning. Ellis, a deputy to White House lawyer John Eisenberg, started in the role on Monday, according to a senior administration official and a former national security official. Ellis left the counsel\u2019s office so won\u2019t be dual-hatted with his new job. The office of the director for intelligence serves as the day to day connective tissue between the intelligence community and the White House. Sensitive information coming in from the intelligence agencies will go to that office, especially if it is in hard copy form. The office also coordinates covert action activities between the White House and the intelligence community, and it\u2019s where the NSC server is housed that stores the most sensitive classified information. Ellis featured in the Ukraine impeachment scandal, according to testimony heard by the House Intelligence Committee during the impeachment investigation. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a decorated Army officer who served as the National Security Council\u2019s director for Ukraine, told lawmakers in October that Ellis and Eisenberg were the ones who decided to move the record of Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky into the NSC\u2019s top-secret codeword system\u2014a server normally used to store highly classified material that only a small group of officials can access. Warren still on the hunt Elizabeth Warren will be deep in a rabbit hole tonight if she doesn\u2019t make a surprisingly good showing in Super Tuesday voting. She badly needs to win, at the very least, her home state of Massachusetts, which she represents in the Senate - but there\u2019s a danger of Bernie Sanders winning there tonight. If she doesn\u2019t win Mass or Oklahoma, where she grew up, the landscape will be bleak, with a path to the nomination (contested party convention...?) very had to see. She gives fantastic performances on the trail and the enthusiasm mask has never slipped, but this has been a devastating few months for Warren\u2019s campaign - especially as she is arguably the most qualified of anyone for the White House (including the incumbent). Warren\u2019s busy on a Twitter fundraising streak this morning, as if oblivious to the fact that Buttigieg and Klobuchar have abruptly dropped out and moved quickly to heal division in the Democratic ranks, despite beating her in the early contests. And progressive rival Bernie Sanders has mountains more support at this point, based on most recent polls, in states from New England to California via Texas. Does the candidate with \u201ca plan for that\u201d have a plan for tomorrow morning if she tanks tonight? US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has said the Group of Seven leading industrial countries agreed this morning to do \u201ceverything possible\u201d to limit harm from the coronavirus outbreak to the world\u2019s economies. There was an international special conference call on this earlier this morning, led by Mnuchin and US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, with finance and economics ministers from around the globe. You can follow all the developments live on our dedicated coronavirus blog, here. And all the business news on our live blog, here. Just hours after endorsing former Joe Biden for president, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar joined NBC News\u2019 Today program this morning - and firmly rejected the notion that she and other Democrats are trying to crush progressive champ Bernie Sanders in the 2020 race. \u201cYou want a candidate that not just builds a coalition of fired-up Democrats, which we\u2019ve got, but also brings in independents, moderate Republicans. That\u2019s how we won back the House of Representatives [in the 2018 midterm elections], and that\u2019s what Joe Biden can do,\u201d Klobuchar told program host Savannah Guthrie. She added, \u201cI don\u2019t look at the Mayor [Pete Buttigieg, who dropped out on Sunday], Beto O\u2019Rourke [who\u2019s been MIA since he dropped out of the presidential race late last year] and myself as \u2018establishment\u2019.\u201d And she continued: \u201cI look at us as new leaders for the party, fresh faces for the party and we\u2019re basically saying we\u2019ve got to win here and that\u2019s why we\u2019re supporting Joe Biden...None of us had talked to each other. We came to our own decisions...We made the decision, instead of a personal victory for ourselves or a personal quest that this was about our country.\u201d On leaving the Democratic primary race, Klobuchar said: \u201cThere literally was no push from anyone. It was a decision I made...The hardest part was actually telling our staff...but I think everyone knew this was the right thing to do.\u201d And on if she discussed with Biden serving in his administration, should he win the White House in November, Klobuchar said, \u201cNo actually not one bit,\u201d and when asked about the possibility of being Biden\u2019s running mate she responded, \u201cI\u2019m just doing my work right now, I\u2019m one day out of having left my own campaign.\u201d The eventual party nominee chooses his or her own candidate for vice-president, some time after the party convention in the summer. Hello all, Joanna Walters here: I\u2019m taking over the blog in New York now, from my esteemed colleague in London, Martin Belam, and will be you walking with you through this Super Tuesday morning before passing the baton on to others for an exciting afternoon and then a dramatic night of results. Stay tuned here for all the action. Bloomberg\u2019s D-Day Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg appears on primary voting ballots for the first time today and it\u2019s make or break for him. After Biden\u2019s overnight surge of support from his South Carolina result, Bloomberg\u2019s billions could end up counting for very little in his personal race. He\u2019s spent a record-breaking $566 million of his own money so far on his gamble of launching a campaign but not actually competing in a primary or caucus until today. And of that, a whopping $215 million has been spent in the 14 Super Tuesday states where primary voters go to the polls today to pick their Democratic party nominee to face Donald Trump in November. Oddly, Bloomberg\u2019s spending the day in Florida, which doesn\u2019t vote until March 17, at events in Orlando and Miami before watching the results at an event in West Palm Beach, coincidentally the location of Trump\u2019s private resort club Mar-a-Lago and a billionaire snowbird playground. And here\u2019s Trump\u2019s generous take on his rival. Donald Trump is inevitably having his say on the Democrat\u2019s Super Tuesday primaries from the comfort of his phone. He\u2019s just been tweeting that voters in Texas and Oklahoma should shun Mike Bloomberg, as he will have a negative impact on their fossil fuel-based energy industries. Trump has gone on to describe Bloomberg as a \u201cchocker\u201d, which is rapidly becoming the covfefe of election season. Talking of Mike Bloomberg and Texas, a few hours ago Time published this in-depth look at his campaign from Molly Ball in Houston. On 3 March, Bloomberg\u2019s big bet will be called. His name will be on the primary ballot for the first time. Sanders holds a delegate lead over a surging Joe Biden, and Bloomberg\u2019s debate flops have some Democrats accusing him of being an obstacle rather than savior, contributing to the clog of moderate contenders that\u2019s preventing Democrats from consolidating around a non-Sanders candidate. Unlike when he was mayor, Bloomberg can\u2019t order those in the path of his blitz to evacuate\u2014not that he hasn\u2019t tried. Read it here - Time: Mike Bloomberg wants to fix America. But can he fix the Democrats? The AP are reporting that a super PAC is sending out robocalls today in five Super Tuesday states that feature positive words about Joe Biden from former president Barack Obama. Amanda Loveday of Unite the Country PAC says the call is running through Tuesday in Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia. The call features audio from a speech in which Obama calls Biden \u201ca statesman, leader who sees clearly the challenges facing America in a changing world.\u201d Loveday said the call also ran in South Carolina before its primary last Saturday and could be used in other states that vote in the future. She says the group did not need permission to use the audio, nor did it seek permission. Obama has so far gone out of his way not to specifically endorse Biden - or any other candidate - in person. Sources close to the former president have suggested that he feels his voice may be best saved until later in the year, to bring unity to the Democrat campaign against Trump once a nominee is chosen. Last week the former president threatened legal action against a Republican super PAC that was running an anti-Biden campaign which, he said, used Obama\u2019s words out of context to paint his vice president in a negative light. Amy Klobuchar was live on NBC News this morning in her first TV spot since dropping out. She said she made the decision to quit the race herself. She said that she stepped back while she was attending the commemoration service in Selma at the weekend, and thought to herself \u201cWhat is better here? What is better for the country?\u201d She said that announcing her support for Joe Biden last night was an \u201cincredible joyous moment\u201d. Asked if Super Tuesday was \u201cdo or die time\u201d in terms of stopping Bernie Sanders, Klobuchar said: \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal tonight. You have Sen. Sanders who has been ahead in a number of the states, but part of that was because there were so many other people. I think you will see some victories of Joe Biden in a number of the states.\u201d Explaining her preference against Sanders, she says the Democrats want to \u201cwin big\u201d and that means nominating a candidate that \u201cbrings in independents, moderate Republicans\u201d. On Biden she said \u201cHe has this decency, exactly what we need right now\u201d You can watch the full segment here: Amy Klobuchar rejects idea that moderate Dems are trying to crush Sanders Here\u2019s a few things worth a read over your coffee this morning: Jim Newell in Slate suggesting that this Super Tuesday, anything could happen, and all he is willing to predict is that: Sanders will win a whole bunch of delegates, Biden will win a whole bunch of delegates, and Michael Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren will win some number of delegates. Dead candidates, like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, might also win some delegates based on either early voting tallies or people who don\u2019t watch the news. Tulsi Gabbard, who is still in the race, will probably not win any delegates. The rest, though, is all unknown. Read it here - Slate: After Mayhem Monday, it\u2019s Super Tuesday! Over at The Hill, Niall Stanage has a breakdown of what he says each candidate needs to do. Key takeaways - it is vital for Biden to do better than Bloomberg, Warren must win her home state of Massachusetts, and he didn\u2019t bother working out what Tulsi Gabbard needed. And Sanders? One key question for Sanders is how he does in Southern states. Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina and Tennessee all vote on Tuesday. Black voters will be crucial to the outcome in those states, and Sanders underperformed with African Americans in South Carolina. His skeptics will be scrutinizing the Super Tuesday results for signs of further weakness in that regard. Read it here - The Hill: What each candidate needs to do Away from the results of the election and more about the mechanics of elections temselves, Kim Zetter at Politico has been looking at the business of states investing in their own election tech. Los Angeles County spent nine years working on a government-designed and owned voting system with the goal of setting a new standard for security, reliability and transparency. Instead, millions of county voters on Super Tuesday will cast ballots on a system in which numerous security flaws were found. Read it here - Politico: Los Angeles County\u2019s risky voting experiment At least 7 people were killed earlier today as two tornadoes touched down in central Tennessee, shredding about 40 buildings across the Nashville area. The state is due to vote today as part of Super Tuesday. Metro Nashville Public Schools said its schools would be closed Tuesday because of the tornado damage. Wilson County, just east of metro Nashville will close schools for the rest of the week. Election polling sites at schools were expected to remain open, as well as district offices, according to tweets from its official account. Jeff Roberts of the Elections Commission said in a statement early Tuesday that information about damage to polling stations is being collected as polls open. Any voter in Davidson County whose assigned precinct has been impacted may vote at the Election Commission Offices, the statement said. Polls open in the state at various times, starting at 7 am CST, depending on the county. Polls will be opening at 8am in Nashville It\u2019s not just in the 14 Super Tuesday states that Democrats are casting their votes today. 3 March also marks the opening of the Democrats Abroad primary. There are thirteen pledged delegates at stake. The primary runs until 10 March. To vote, you have to be a US citizen residing abroad, be 18 as of 3 November 2020 and be a member of Democrats Abroad. One of the earliest voting stations to open was in Bangkok, Thailand, where the primary is taking place amid the coronavirus outbreak. There have been 43 cases and one death in the country. Some voters have been casting their ballots wearing face masks. Polls are opening across the US as 14 states vote in the biggest day of the 2020 election campaign so far. Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Mike Bloomberg and Tulsi Gabbard all still vying to win the Democrats nomination to fight Donald Trump for the White House in November. The primaries in Texas and California are key battle ground, both sending swathes of delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Sanders and Warren are both facing votes in their home states. Biden has been boosted in the last two days bu the endorsements of former candidates Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O\u2019Rourke. Here\u2019s Lauren Gambino in Los Angeles with our scene-setter for the day. 130 million people live in the states that votes today. That is more than 10 times as many people who live in the four states that have had their say so far. It is also one of the most diverse electorates of the primary season. 25% of the population in these 14 states are Hispanic, with an 11% black population and the 7% Asian population. Altogether the white vote makes up 53%. Here are the 14 states voting today, when their polls close (in Eastern Time), and how many delegates they have on offer. Closing at 7pm ET Vermont (16 delegates) Virginia (99) Closing at 7:30pm North Carolina (110) Closing at 8pm Alabama (52) Maine (24) Massachusetts (91) Oklahoma (37) Tennessee (64) Texas (228) - El Paso closes at 9pm Closing at 8:30pm Arkansas (31) Closing at 9pm Colorado (67) Minnesota (75) Closing at 10pm Utah (29) Closing at 11pm California (415) You can\u2019t expect full results on the dot though. In some primaries, for example California, postal ballots still have a couple of days to arrive and be counted after the polls close. They are still valid as long as the post-mark is before 3 March. Another key question - given the late drop-outs of Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer and Pete Buttigieg, what happens to the votes of people who opted for them in early voting? Here\u2019s Maanvi Singh with a quick guide to \u2018zombie votes\u2019 Also overnight on the coronavirus outbreak, Donald Trump was flexing his muscles again over interest rates at Federal Reserve - a long-term concern of his. Responding to news that Australia\u2019s central bank has cut interest rates to a record low due to the \u201csignificant effect\u201d of the coronavirus outbreak on the Australian economy, Trump blasted the Fed and Jerome Powell again for their interest rate position. There\u2019s been some domestic controversy over the coronavirus outbreak brewing overnight. Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan has picked up on news that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have changed the way it reports the number of cases in the US - removing public information about how many people have been tested. Pocan tweeted last night to say that he has written to CDC director Robert Redfield demanding to know why this information is no longer available. In the letter, Pocan says: Americans are dying. We deserve to know how many Americans have perished from Covid-19, and we deserve to know how many people have been tested for it. Knowing that CDC testing is keeping pace with the likely number of cases is imperative to maintaining public trust. He goes on to ask when the CDC will resume publishing the information. Here\u2019s the latest on the coronavirus situation in the US from Hallie Golden in Seattle. One story that will not go away during the whole of the 2020 election cycle is that of vote security. Associated Press have been looking at some of the measures in place in the first big test of the system since the 2018 midterms. And there\u2019s a new factor at play - coronavirus. In 2016, the Russians weaponized social media to sow discord among Americans, scanned state and local election systems for cyber vulnerabilities and deployed the targeted release of stolen campaign emails and documents. US intelligence chiefs have warned that foreign interference remains a threat. And the recent outbreak of a new virus could present a bad actor with an opening to spread false information to keep voters away from the polls. We\u2019ve already seen misinformation about the virus on social media go, well, viral. One California county has sought to address concerns over the coronavirus by sending bottles of hand sanitizer to polling places and asking poll workers to post fliers from the public health department on how to avoid spreading the virus. Jesse Salinas, the chief elections official in Yolo County, California, told Associated Press that a few poll workers have backed out over concerns but most understand the threat is relatively low. The county had no reported cases as of Monday morning. \u201cWe are hoping people remain calm and still participate in the election process,\u201d Salinas said. Unlike the fiasco of the Democrat counting at the Iowa caucuses, it will be state and local election officials will be administering Tuesday\u2019s elections. \u201cTexas voters can rest assured ... that our office and those of local and county elections officials are committed to working hand in hand to ensure smooth elections as well as the integrity of our electoral process,\u201d said Stephen Chang, spokesman for the Texas Secretary of State\u2019s Office. States vary considerably in their use of technology to run elections. Some utilize computerized voter lists known as electronic pollbooks to check in voters, while others rely on paper. Voters in a few places will be using new electronic voting machines that produce a paper record of voter selections while some voters in Texas, Tennessee and Oklahoma will be using older ones considered vulnerable by election security experts. In California - widely seen as the most crucial Democrat primary to win - a new publicly owned computerized voting system the first of its kind in the nation will face a crucial test in Los Angeles County, the nation\u2019s largest elections jurisdiction with 5.4 million registered voters. The new system won conditional state approval despite serious security and technical issues, with the county ordered to offer all voters the option of using hand-marked paper ballots. An estimated 63 percent of voters were already expected to vote by mail using hand-marked paper ballots. Such ballots are considered the most reliable by election security experts because paper can\u2019t be hacked or altered by programming errors. If you\u2019d like an indication of where votes might go across the states voting today, then NBC News have got a state-by-state look at who\u2019s leading in the polls. They give Sanders a clear lead in California, the state where most delegates are up for grabs. Sanders has a tighter six point lead over Biden in Texas, which has 228 pledged delegates on offer. A word of caution though. Some polling has been done in some states after Biden\u2019s South Carolina victory, but a lot of these figures are going to be a bit stale, as they don\u2019t reflect that Biden win, or that Klobuchar and Buttigieg have dropped. The final destination of the votes from their supporters is going to be one of the things that makes today so intriguing. Read it here - NBC News: Super Tuesday polls state-by-state look at who\u2019s leading Good morning. And then there were four. Well, four plus Tulsi Gabbard. Super Tuesday always looked like being the day that the Democratic nomination field narrowed - but we expected it to be after the results, not in the two days beforehand. The withdrawal of first Pete Buttigieg and then Amy Klobuchar from the race leaves today\u2019s election tantalisingly poised. For Bernie Sanders, it is about showing that he can keep on picking up those pledged delegates and keep his nose ahead in the race. For Joe Biden, with key moderates now out of the running and backing him, it is a huge opportunity to make himself the clear single leading opponent to Sanders. Elizabeth Warren needs to do well enough that it seems worthwhile her continuing, although her strategy appears to be just hanging on all the way to the convention, and see what shakes out there. And Mike Bloomberg needs to see if he can turn his massive ad spend into votes. It is the first time he has been on the ballot paper. 14 states across the country \u2013 Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia \u2013 as well as one US territory (American Samoa) and Democrats abroad will cast their votes, allocating around a third of the delegates candidates need to get the nod to run against Trump. Here\u2019s our guide to the night: Away from the Democratic race, it will be another important day for the Trump administration in its attempts to cope with the coronavirus outbreak, which has now claimed six lives in Washington state. Donald Trump is visiting a viral pathogenesis laboratory at the National Institutes of Health Vaccine Research Center in Bethesda, Maryland. He will be taking part in a roundtable briefing. There is also expected to be a press briefing by members of the Coronavirus Task Force later this afternoon.",
