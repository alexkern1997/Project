      "bodyText": "Shares in Australian companies closely linked to the Chinese economy tumbled on Tuesday morning amid fears the deadly coronavirus outbreak could smash a tourism sector already reeling from the summer\u2019s unprecedented bushfires. The benchmark ASX200 index fell 1.6% in morning trade, following the lead set overnight by US markets, with tourism, consumer and mining stocks leading the charge downwards. Australia\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on China, which as the country\u2019s biggest trade partner makes up 26% of its trade with the world. China is Australia\u2019s biggest export market, particularly in tourism, with 1.5m Chinese tourists arriving every year, and education. While some reports estimate the damage to the Australian economy could be as much as $2.3bn, experts told Guardian Australia it was too early to be sure. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got enough information,\u201d the economist and former Reserve Bank board member Warwick McKibbin said. McKibbin has previously estimated that a \u201cmild\u201d pandemic in Asia, such as the 1968 Hong Kong flu outbreak which killed about 1m people, would carve 0.8% from Australia\u2019s gross domestic product, with most of the damage felt in the services sector. And in a 2004 paper co-authored with the World Health Organisation, he estimated the 2003 Sars outbreak, which killed about 800 people, cut Australian GDP by 0.07%. Coronavirus is so far known to have killed 106 people since the outbreak of a new strain in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last month. McKibbin said the hit to the economy would largely depend on how governments responded to the crisis. \u201cThe virus itself has a pretty small impact in itself, but the way people respond has a larger impact,\u201d he said. He said the damage would initially be felt in China-dependent industries such as tourism and mining. \u201cYou turn off the flow of Chinese tourists for six months and that\u2019s a big economic shock. \u201cAustralia I think has responded very well so far. They\u2019ve been transparent and they\u2019ve been responsible, so that\u2019s diminishing the impact domestically.\u201d Investors sold down China-exposed stocks on Tuesday morning. Airline flight sales website Webjet tumbled 11%, flag carrier Qantas was down more than 5% and Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest\u2019s iron ore miner, Fortescue Metals Group, tumbled almost 8%. Australia\u2019s two listed casino groups, which are heavily dependent on high rollers from China, also fell, with James Packer\u2019s embattled Crown Resorts dropping 4.4% and Star Entertainment Group, which runs Sydney\u2019s casino, falling 5.6%. Treasury Wine Estates, which sells wine including the top-end Penfolds Grange into the Chinese market, plunged 6.2%. Australian airports are also likely to be hit by falling passenger numbers, ratings agency Moody\u2019s said. \u201cThe Australian airports\u2019 exposure to travellers from China is significantly higher now than it was during the Sars outbreak, accounting for over 15% of total short-term inbound travellers in 2019 compared to 4% in 2003,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in a report issued on Thursday. \u201cAny decline in passenger volumes would add to the challenging operating conditions facing Australian airports, including moderating passenger volumes due to lower arrivals from China, tepid consumer confidence and the impact of the bushfires on the peak holiday season.\u201d The Australian Tourism Industry Council executive director, Simon Westaway, said the virus was \u201ca genuine concern\u201d to the sector. He said that of about $50bn spent by tourists each year, Chinese visitors made up $12bn. About a quarter of these arrive as part of tour groups, which Chinese authorities have banned for at least two months. \u201cWe\u2019re receiving about 1.5m short-term arrivals a year out of China, so it\u2019s our largest inbound market,\u201d he said. \u201cSo therefore there are clear challenges ahead on the basis of the sheer numbers alone, and the fact that we\u2019ve built a strong relationship between our countries.\u201d He said it was too early to quantify the damage. \u201cThe concern is obviously we\u2019re going to see a reduction in terms of the number of visitors because the groups are going to fall away for the next two months. \u201cIt will be interesting to see how it\u2019s going to recover.\u201d He said the relationship between the coronavirus outbreak and the hit the tourism industry has already taken from the summer\u2019s deadly bushfires was \u201cnot as significant as many people may believe\u201d. \u201cThey don\u2019t spread tourists down through to places like Mallacoota. \u201cThere inevitably will be a level of crossover effect but we are really talking about a fairly separate market.\u201d Ratings agency Moody\u2019s said tourism industries across the Asia-Pacific, including Australia, were likely to feel the most impact in the short term. In a report issued on Friday, Moody\u2019s said it was too early to tell if the outbreak would cut China\u2019s growth, but warned it could hurt domestic travel and the country\u2019s car industry, which is heavily reliant on Wuhan. \u201cWuhan hosts production facilities for seven major domestic and foreign manufacturers, and for hundreds of auto parts suppliers,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. \u201cComplicated supply chains and just-in-time production could mean that production outages in Wuhan factories have broader spillover effects.\u201d It said the effect on consumers could be magnified because the outbreak is occurring during lunar new year, \u201ca period when households tend to spend more on travel, entertainment, and gifts\u201d. \u201cEven if the virus is contained fairly quickly, the initial stages of high uncertainty are likely to affect spending,\u201d the agency said. \u2022 This story was corrected on 29 January 2020 to attribute comments to Moody\u2019s that had been attributed to S&amp;P in an earlier version.",

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus outbreak will have a \u201csignificant\u201d impact on Chinese growth, economists have warned, with the \u201cwildcard\u201d of still unknown infections posing potentially serious risks for the global economy. Shares in Asia Pacific continued to fall on Tuesday in the wake of heavy losses at the start of the week which has seen the death toll from the outbreak in China almost double in two days to 105. The number of infections has risen to 4,500, \u2013 that\u2019s up 45% from Monday, with China\u2019s authorities confirming the virus can be transmitted by \u201crespiratory droplet transmission\u201d or by touch. Markets in mainland China are closed until 3 February at the earliest, providing a bulwark to losses, but the financial contagion has spread across Asia and the rest of the world. South Korea, where a fourth case was confirmed on Tuesday, saw its Kospi index fall more than 3% and Australia\u2019s ASX200 was off 1.35%. Shares in Europe and the US suffered similar heavy losses on Monday. The yuan, China\u2019s currency, dropped to its lowest level for a month. Economists agreed that the outbreak will have a negative impact in China but the lack of understanding about how the virus spreads and how bad it might be was adding to uncertainty to the mix and compounding investor concerns. Citigroup said on Tuesday: \u201cThe wildcard is not the fatality rate, but how infectious the Wuhan virus is. The economic impact will depend on how successfully this outbreak is contained.\u201d The consultancy Capital Economics said the impact could be similar to the Sars outbreak in 2003 which knocked three percentage points off growth \u201cThe outbreak is developing too rapidly to predict with any confidence the final extent of the economic damage,\u201d said Capital\u2019s chief Asia economist Mark Williams. \u201cBut it is now certain that the outbreak will have a significant impact on China\u2019s GDP this quarter.\u201d And although China recovered quickly from Sars, Williams said the local economy was much stronger back in 2003 and was not facing the cyclical and structural headwinds posed by slowing population growth and industrialisation. Gerard Burg, senior international economist at the Australian bank NAB, agreed that it was hard to predict the impact of the outbreak because there was so little information or data coming out of China. But he said there would be a \u201cbig flow-on effect outside China, especially in south-east Asia because of the growing importance of Chinese tourism\u201d. He said countries such as Thailand, which depends on China for around one quarter of its 10 million annual tourists, \u201creally jumps out\u201d because Thailand may be hesitant about people travelling there from China and the Chinese, with many cities in lockdown, would not be able to travel. \u201cSouth-east Asia already felt the big brunt of the US trade war so there is potential for a negative impact,\u201d he said. Chinese authorities stepped up their attempts to control the spread on Tuesday as the capital Beijing recorded its first fatality from the outbreak and the country\u2019s second city, Shanghai, said it now has 13 confirmed cases. Another large industrial city, the steel-making centre of Tangshan, said that it was suspending public transport, adding to dozens of similar moves across the country where millions of people are in lockdown. Viet Nguyen, a senior research fellow in macroeconomics at the University of Melbourne, said that the restrictions already placed on many areas would mean Chinese consumers were spending less and making fewer journeys which would harm the economy. It was difficult to say what the final impact would be, he said, noting that Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak, was not a major industrial area. But he added: \u201cIt depends how well China can contain the outbreak. If it spreads from Hubei into the manufacturing hubs on the east coast and south-east coast then there may be more of a problem.\u201d",

The head of the national oil corporation has said countries meddling in the conflict are putting Libya on the road to \u201ca disaster and a nightmare\u201d. * * * Reputation punctured \u2013 The 2020 edition of the Michelin guide, the \u201cgastronomy bible\u201d, has been launched amid controversy over a leak that revealed it downgraded Auberge du Pont de Collonges, the oldest three-star restaurant in the world. The new guide contains 3,439 restaurant listings in France and Monaco, 628 of them starred. Fresh three-star ratings went to Christopher Coutanceau\u2019s seafood restaurant in La Rochelle, Japanese-born Kei Kobayashi\u2019s Kei restaurant in Paris, and L\u2019Oustau de Baumani\u00e8re, a family restaurant at Les-baux-de-Provence that had lost its third star in 1954. Today in Focus podcast: Iannucci on politics and satire The creator of The Thick of It and Veep discusses why modern politics has moved beyond satire. And: Bryan Graham on Kobe Bryant. Lunchtime read: Quiz me on anything! Samanth Subramanian has taken part in quizzes all his life: in schools, in pubs and on TV shows. The biggest secret, he argues, is that curiosity, not knowledge, is the key to success. Sport America remains in shock over the death of Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna in a helicopter crash on Sunday as investigators worked to determine the cause of the incident, which also killed seven others. Despite a late surge from Bournemouth, first-half goals from Bukayo Saka and Eddie Nketiah were enough to take Arsenal to a 2-1 home win in the FA Cup fourth round. Gary Lineker, the BBC presenter and former striker, has told the Guardian in an interview how VAR must change and why the licence fee should be voluntary. Faf du Plessis has said there was no malicious intent when he shoulder-barged England\u2019s Jos Buttler during an incident on the fourth and final day of the fourth Test that looks likely to land the South Africa captain with a disciplinary charge. A youthful French side have been warned to brace themselves for a crash course in Test-match reality on Sunday when England head to Paris for the opening round of the 2020 Six Nations Championship. World No 1 Ashleigh Barty withstood a fierce challenge from Petra Kvitov\u00e1 to become the first local woman to reach the Australian Open semi-finals in 36 years. And a US college has suspended one of its American football coaches after he named Adolf Hitler as a dream dinner guest. Business Economists have warned that the coronavirus outbreak poses a \u201csignificant\u201d threat to Chinese growth as infections continue to spread. Investors translated those concerns into heavy losses on Asian markets overnight with South Korea, where a fourth case was confirmed, leading the way with a fall of 3%. The FTSE100 is expected to stabilise at the opening after losing more than 2% on Monday. The pound is buying $1.306 and \u20ac1.184. The papers The Duke of York receives a pasting across the front pages: \u201cPrince Andrew accused of zero cooperation in Epstein inquiry\u201d reports the Guardian. The Sun renders Andrew cuttingly as a missing-person poster that asks: \u201cHave you seen this prince?\u201d \u201cAndrew snubs FBI over Epstein sex quiz\u201d \u2013 slightly odd language from the Mirror. \u201cZero help from duke\u201d says the Metro while the Mail asks on behalf of the FBI: \u201cWhy won\u2019t Andrew speak to us?\u201d. And on it goes in the i \u2013 \u201cFBI: Prince Andrew is ignoring us\u201d. The splash in the Times is \u201cEU demands its judges keep control after Brexit\u201d \u2013 Brussels wants the European court of justice to be able to enforce the terms of any trade, farming and fisheries deal. In a similar vein the FT says Britain and the EU may be headed into a \u201cfish for financial services\u201d deal and says \u201cUK and EU face post-Brexit clash\u201d over the City and the seas. The Express has as its hook \u201cBoris: I won\u2019t give up fishing rights\u201d. Sign up The Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

      "bodyText": "Chinese companies are working overtime to produce protective face masks amid soaring demand caused by the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. Five of the 12 main mask-producing companies based in Guangdong province have resumed production after pausing for the lunar new year holiday, the business publication First Financial reported on Tuesday. Guangdong has implemented a province-wide order for everyone to wear masks in public places or face unspecified fines. Videos have circulated of unmasked metro riders being ejected forcibly by security staff. Search stats on Baidu, China\u2019s main search engine, revealed there had been 2m queries for the term \u201cnot wearing masks can get you fined\u201d as of Tuesday morning. On Monday, footage emerged showing a scramble for masks at the gate of a factory in Jiujiang in Jiangxi province. Of more concern is the ability to get masks and other medical supplies to hospitals and medical staff in quarantined areas of Hubei, the province where the outbreak began. A report from People\u2019s Daily on Monday indicated that masks were in short supply at Wuhan\u2019s No 7 hospital. Patrick Brogan, a Briton who has been in Wuhan since 10 January and is now stuck, said there were shortages of masks there but that his girlfriend\u2019s father was able to pick up a box before supplies dwindled. \u201cWe are using scuba goggles if and when we have to go out again, it\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d the 30-year-old from Reading said. Meimei, from Shenzhen, who did not want her full name used, said she had been trying to order masks from the US through online shops such as Amazon to distribute to people across China, but supplies are running short there too. \u201cIt is difficult because California is having a very severe flu season,\u201d she said. \u201cI heard that many others are asking friends abroad to buy masks but it is very difficult.\u201d Meimei said she had heard supplies to Wuhan were improving but that other areas of Hubei were short. Shenzhen Airlines dispatched a flight to Wuhan with about 100 medical personnel and 10 tons of medical gear on Tuesday, according to Meimei, who is friends with one of the cabin crew on the flight.

Everyday use of surgical masks, once mainly confined to Japan and parts of China affected by major dust storms or smog, has expanded in recent years, mainly because of worsening air pollution. In the Philippines, which has reported no cases of the virus, the recent eruptions of the Taal volcano have prompted many to wear masks to protect against ash. The Australian government has told doctors and staff at GP surgeries to wear face masks when seeing patients who may be carrying the virus, and said it was prepared to use a national stockpile to make sure there are enough to go around.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Key Republicans signal openness to Bolton testimony Unless the Democrats\u2019 efforts to call witnesses in Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial succeed, it could all be over by Friday. That seemed to be the plan for the president\u2019s legal team, whose arguments on Monday ignored the damaging new revelations from John Bolton\u2019s forthcoming book. The former national security adviser reportedly claims Trump told him he was withholding aid to Ukraine until Kyiv announced an investigation into the Bidens \u2013 corroborating the central charge against the president. GOP Senators. Mitt Romney, Susan Collins and even Lindsey Graham have signalled their willingness to vote for witnesses, including Bolton, to testify. But Graham said Joe and Hunter Biden should also be called to appear. Ken Starr. The lawyer who led the impeachment charge against Bill Clinton is now defending Trump, declaring \u2013 apparently without irony \u2013 that \u201cpresidential impeachment is hell\u201d. White House to unveil Kushner\u2019s Middle East peace plan Trump will on Tuesday unveil his administration\u2019s new Middle East peace plan, crafted by his son-in-law Jared Kushner, which the president has described as the \u201cdeal of the century\u201d. But leaked details of the proposals, engineered with almost no input from the Palestinians, suggest they will generate widespread controversy over their weighting in favour of Israel. Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, himself facing an imminent election and corruption charges, is in Washington DC for the launch of the plan. Yemen violence. The surge in violence in Yemen could scupper efforts to secure a peace settlement in the country\u2019s lengthy civil war, the UN special envoy has said, blaming fresh regional instability on the recent US killing of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. US plans Wuhan airlift as coronavirus death toll tops 100 At least 106 people have now died from the coronavirus, Chinese officials have confirmed, including the first death from the disease in the country\u2019s capital, Beijing. Several countries have strongly advised against travel to China, while the US and Japan are both organising airlifts to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan, the quarantined city at the centre of the outbreak. Economists have warned that the crisis will have a \u201csignificant\u201d impact on Chinese growth. Whether to worry. It remains unclear just how dangerous the coronavirus is, but its spread outside China is not unexpected. The CDC has said there is nevertheless very little immediate risk to the American public. Quarantine life. Michael Standaert reports on how the people of Wuhan have been keeping themselves occupied under quarantine, from indoor fishing to outdoor exercise classes. America mourns Kobe as investigators investigate crash cause Investigators are working to determine the cause of the helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven others on Sunday, as America remains in shock over the death of the 41-year-old NBA legend. While the aircraft\u2019s maintenance records and its pilot Ara Zobayan were both being looked into, attention has so far focused on weather at the time of the accident, which was sufficiently foggy that the LAPD had grounded its own chopper fleet. Other victims. The other victims are believed to include a well-known college baseball coach, John Altobelli, and his wife and daughter; Gianna\u2019s basketball teammate Peyton Chester and her mother; and the girls\u2019 coach, Christina Mauser. Assault case. The Washington Post has been criticised for suspending a reporter who tweeted a link to an article about a rape allegation made against Bryant in 2003. Joan Niesen argues it is important to mourn the man in full. Cheat sheet At least eight people were killed after a huge fire broke out at a marina in Jackson County, Alabama on Monday, destroying dozens of boats. Fire officials warned the death toll could rise. Miriam Haley, a former production assistant at the Weinstein Company, has recounted her alleged 2006 rape by Harvey Weinstein at his trial in New York. Haley was the second of six women set to testify against the disgraced film producer. A British man has died in US immigration custody in Florida. According to Buzzfeed, Ben James Owen, 39, was arrested on suspicion of stalking, false imprisonment and domestic assault, and is thought to have died by asphyxiation due to hanging. The US lawyer Lisa Bloom has urged Prince Andrew to \u201cstop playing games\u201d after prosecutors said on Monday that the Duke of York had so far provided \u201czero\u201d cooperation with the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In Wuhan, some UK citizens complained of what they described as a lack of clarity on the part of the British government, but there was also confusion about what Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union would mean in terms of any partnerships with other EU states.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople want to know if there is permission from the Chinese government for the flights to leave,\u201d Kathleen Bell told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>She had yet to contact a Foreign Office helpline number but added that Britons on social medial had been gathering lists of names themselves in recent days.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne of the deciding factors for a lot of people though is whether they will be allowed to bring their Chinese spouses or children with them.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Twitter account of Britain\u2019s embassy in Beijing, UK in China, has been posting the numbers for a 24-hour helpline that British citizens in Hubei can call.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n     <li>Advice about face masks varies.

On Tuesday evening the Foreign Office updated its advice to warn against all but essential travel to mainland China following the coronavirus outbreak.

      "body": "<p>Hong Kong has announced major cuts to its transport links with mainland China, as several countries scrambled to fly their citizens out of the city at the centre of a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 100 people.</p> \n<p>Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, said high-speed trains and ferries that cross the border would be suspended from Thursday. The number of flights to mainland China would also be halved, she said, and personal travel permits for mainland Chinese to the city suspended.</p> \n<p>Several countries \u2013 including Japan, the US and France \u2013 have announced they will evacuate their citizens from Wuhan, where the outbreak began in December and has since killed 106 people. Almost all transport to the city has been blocked and its hospitals completely overwhelmed.</p> \n<p>The World Health Organization\u2019s director general has criticised the evacuation plans, according to China\u2019s foreign ministry. \u201cTedros [Adhanom] said the WHO does not advocate for countries to evacuate their citizens from China, adding there was no need to overreact,\u201d the foreign ministry said in a statement. \u201cHe said the WHO is confident in China\u2019s ability to prevent and control the epidemic.\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile German officials said a German man who tested positive for the virus was infected by a work colleague, in what is believed to be the first human transmission in Europe.</p> \n<p> On Monday, the British government, which has been accused of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/27/coronavirus-outbreak-britons-trapped-in-wuhan-decry-pathetic-government-advice\">slow response to the crisis</a>, asked its citizens to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china\">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> so it could determine how many British people were in Wuhan. Matt Hancock, the UK health secretary, said citizens would be offered repatriation.

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong has announced major cuts to its transport links with mainland China, as several countries scrambled to fly their citizens out of the city at the centre of a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 100 people. Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, said high-speed trains and ferries that cross the border would be suspended from Thursday. The number of flights to mainland China would also be halved, she said, and personal travel permits for mainland Chinese to the city suspended. Several countries \u2013 including Japan, the US and France \u2013 have announced they will evacuate their citizens from Wuhan, where the outbreak began in December and has since killed 106 people. Almost all transport to the city has been blocked and its hospitals completely overwhelmed. The World Health Organization\u2019s director general has criticised the evacuation plans, according to China\u2019s foreign ministry. \u201cTedros [Adhanom] said the WHO does not advocate for countries to evacuate their citizens from China, adding there was no need to overreact,\u201d the foreign ministry said in a statement. \u201cHe said the WHO is confident in China\u2019s ability to prevent and control the epidemic.\u201d Meanwhile German officials said a German man who tested positive for the virus was infected by a work colleague, in what is believed to be the first human transmission in Europe. On Monday, the British government, which has been accused of a slow response to the crisis, asked its citizens to contact the Foreign and Commonwealth Office so it could determine how many British people were in Wuhan. Matt Hancock, the UK health secretary, said citizens would be offered repatriation. It is thought that up to 300 UK nationals are in the wider Hubei province, where most deaths have occurred. Several countries have also stepped up their warnings over travel to China, including the US, which is advising citizens to avoid non-essential visits to any part of the country. Previously it had warned only about non-essential travel to Wuhan or other parts of Hubei province, where most deaths have occurred. Germany and Turkey have released similar statements asking citizens to reconsider all travel.

The cuts to travel links with the mainland follows calls by a union of hospital workers for the border to be closed. Hong Kong has recorded eight cases of coronavirus, and health workers had threatened to strike over the territory\u2019s response to the outbreak. Chinese companies are working overtime to produce masks, with five of the 12 main mask-producing companies based in Guangdong province resuming production after pausing for the lunar new year holiday, the business publication First Financial reported on Tuesday. About 4,515 cases of the illness have been recorded across the country, including almost 1,000 people in critical condition, according to state media. Though the number of cases appears to have risen quickly, from 2,887 on Monday, this was likely to be due to better reporting, and the numbers remain small compared with the population. On Tuesday, Beijing confirmed the city\u2019s first death from the virus. An American citizen working in Wuhan, who asked not to be named, said she had secured a seat on a US flight, and expected to be quarantined afterwards for up to 14 days. \u201cIt could either be in a hospital or a hotel,\u201d she said while travelling to the airport. \u201cI plan to visit relatives back in the states, but they live across the country in Missouri and Alabama so it will be even more traveling.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s nearly time for the first US interest rate decision of 2020 - but don\u2019t expect many fireworks. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep its benchmark Fed Funds rate unchanged, at 1.5% to 1.75%. Following three cuts in the second half of 2019, the Fed is effectively on hold - waiting to see how the economic data plays out. Although trade tensions have eased, the coronavirus crisis is a new threat to global growth - so central bankers will remain cautious. Finally, the FTSE 100 index has closed 68 points higher at 7480, up almost 1% today. That still means it has lost 100 points over the last two sessions, amid coronavirus worries. David Madden of CMC Markets says traders have been snapping up potential bargains after Monday\u2019s rout, and hoping Beijing gets a grip on the crisis: Stock markets in Europe have pulled back some of the ground that was lost yesterday. In relation to the coronavirus, the situation has deteriorated in the past 24 hours as the number of confirmed infections has risen, and so has the number of fatalities. The positive move in equities is probably down to short covering plus bargain hunting as the health crisis has deepened. The longer the news story hangs around, traders might build up a tolerance to it. The Chinese central bank has made it clear it is willing to use monetary tools in a bid to lift economic sentiment, should they feel it is required. The message from Beijing reassured traders somewhat, but the acid test will be whether the rebound lasts or not. Here\u2019s an interesting thread on the implications of the coronavirus, from Canada\u2019s Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD). Stock markets are now moving higher, lifted by hopes that the coronavirus outbreak could be controlled following Zhong Nanshan\u2019s optimistic comments today. The pick-up in American consumer confidence is also lifting equities, as it bodes well for US economic growth this year. But... the main indices have still only recovered a third of Monday\u2019s losses. FTSE 100: up 61 points or 0.9% at 7,475 German DAX: up 87 points or 0.66% at 13,292 French CAC: up 48 points or 0.8% at 5,911 Wall Street has also opened higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 129 points or 0.45% (it lost 450 points on Monday). Chris Towner, Director at risk advisor JCRA, says investors are trying to get to grips with the Wuhan virus. \u201cWith the death toll rising above 100, financial markets are still trying to gauge the potential reach of this deadly virus. By comparison, the SARS virus impacted 8098 people with 774 fatalities. The question now is how quickly can this virus be contained and, in the meantime, how many countries and economies will be impacted? In times of risk aversion money normally floods into the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. Due to the proximity of Japan to China the risk of the virus penetrating Japan is high, with one confirmed case so far. Therefore, the Swiss franc is currently seen as the ultimate safe haven and has strengthened by over 3% against the Euro from its pre-Christmas level of 1.10 CHF to the Euro in the 1.06\u2019s, the strongest level since April 2017. Markets will now be focusing on the pace of the spread of the virus and whether there are signs of acceleration or deceleration.\u201d Just in: US consumer confidence has rallied this month, by more than expected. The Confidence Board\u2019s survey of consumer morale has spiked to 131.6, up from 128.2 last month. Americans interviewed for the survey said their current financial situation had improved, adding that they were more optimistic about their future prospects. A top Chinese respiratory scientist has predicted that the Wuhan coronavirus has predicted that the outbreak could peak in one week or around 10 days. Zhong Nanshan made the comments in an interview with Xinhua, the state news media site. They say: \u201cIt is very difficult to definitely estimate when the outbreak reaches its peak. But I think in one week or about 10 days, it will reach the climax and then there will be no large-scale increases,\u201d Zhong said. Zhong is the head of a national team of experts set up for the control and prevention of the novel coronavirus-caused pneumonia and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Zhong really knows his stuff -- he was deeply involved in fighting the SARS outbreak back in 2003 (telling reporters that the situation wasn\u2019t under control). So this could be an encouraging signal, if Zhong is right.... But with more cases detected in Thailand today, and a second patient in Germany, the situation is still moving fast. Despite the slump in demand for aircraft, overall US durable goods rose by 2.4% in December. But if you strip out defence kit, demand was slightly lower. That\u2019s a disappointing sign, says Chad Moutray, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers: Ouch. We have fresh evidence today that Boeing\u2019s 737 Max crisis is causing economic harm. First up, US aircraft orders plunged by almost 75% in December, according to the latest durable goods orders report just released. That\u2019s the biggest slump in non-defence aircraft orders since 2009, as airline hold off buying 7373 Max jets until the problems that caused two fatal crashes are fixed. This delay is hurting Boeing (which sacked its CEO last month), and also harming its customers. It currently hopes to get the plane flying by this July. Ryanair has warned pilots that it could be forced to close some bases, resulting in job cuts, because of the persistent delays. In a memo, the budget airline told staff it won\u2019t receive its first 737 Max jets until September or October at the earliest, as Ryanair does not take deliveries during its peak summer months of June, July and August. It had originally hoped to take delivery last April, boosting capacity on its routes. Back in the UK, some of the investors caught up in Neil Woodford savings scandal have learned how much of their money has been lost. And, as feared, it\u2019s a very heavy blow. Link Fund Solutions, which has been winding up the Equity Income fund, says investors will receive an initial payment of 46.3p and 58.9p for each share they owned in the fund, compared to 100p when it was launched. They should receive a second payment, once the less-liquid assets held by the fund are sold off (although that will be a trickier task). More here: Several companies have instructed some staff not to come into the office Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs has told staff who have visited mainland China to work from home for the next fortnight, Reuters reports. Chinese video games giant Tencent and online retail giant Alibaba are also trying to keep staff out of the office, CNBC flags up: The oil price would probably be even lower, but for ongoing supply disruption in Libya. Libya\u2019s crude output has tumbled in recent days, as the Libyan National Army (based in Benghazi) have blockaded ports as part of their campaign against the Libya\u2019s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord. This has pulled Libya\u2019s oil production down from 1.2m barrels a day to 260,000 barrels and it could soon all-but run out. Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, predicts that Opec (the oil cartel) could soon step in and cut supplies, to prop prices up. \u201cThe University of Hong Kong estimates that at least 25,630 people in Wuhan have symptoms of the virus with 44,000 infected with no symptoms yet. This should imply that the sell-off in Brent crude is still not yet over, as the crisis is still intensifying.... On the supply side however, we see that Libya\u2019s oil production will likely be down to zero (from 1.1 m bl/day) within days. OPEC is also following the coronavirus situation closely. It will most likely step in and reduce supply for a month or two in order to prevent an inventory build-up which the market would have to struggle with for an extended period. The oil price is also suffering today, with Brent crude down 1% at $58.88 per barrel. At one stage it touched $58.88, the joint-lowest since October. Analysts at SP Angel Oil and Gas blame the \u2018panic\u2019 around the escalating coronavirus, telling clients: The number of casualties in China continues to climb, as do cases of the virus elsewhere in the world The Chinese government has tried to quarantine Wuhan and other cities, affecting tens of millions of people. Multinational businesses in China are also implementing lockdown procedures. Oil demand growth is the biggest factor weighing on prices, China\u2019s oil demand has been growing at an annual rate of 5.5%, while comparatively, US oil demand has been growing by 0.5% Most of the demand loss will come from jet fuel as the risk of disease discourages travellers Back in the UK, retail sales remain flat this month despite the so-called Boris Bounce. Retailers are evenly split between those enjoying stronger sales this month, and those suffering weaker demand. That\u2019s according to the CBI\u2019s monthly \u2018distributive trades\u2019 survey, which has come in at zero for January, the same as December. That\u2019s better than November\u2019s -3, and a sharp improvement on the -49 suffered last August (when most shops reported declining volumes). Retailers also reported that sales were poor for the time of year, undermining the theory that December\u2019s general election has brought much cheer. Anna Leach, CBI Deputy Chief Economist, says: \u201cBoth official data and business surveys are painting a picture of subdued activity for retailers. A challenging Christmas has extended into the New Year, with little expectation of any improvement soon. \u201c2020 looks set to be another tough year for the sector as growth in households\u2019 disposable income is set to remain modest and retailers continue to battle longer-term issues such as digital disruption and the cumulative burden of policy costs. The upcoming Budget provides an opportunity for the Chancellor to support retailers, primarily by fixing the broken business rates system.\u201d Copper prices are also being hurt by the prospect of China\u2019s economy slowing as its government grapples with the coronavirus shutdown. The futures price of Copper is down 0.5% today, and is on track for its 10th daily fall in a row. Copper is seen as a bellweather of the health of the global economy (known as \u2018Doctor Copper\u2019 in the City). Fashion chain Burberry is suffering badly from the virus crisis. It\u2019s the biggest faller on the Footsie this morning, down 3.5% at \u00a319.30. Burberry\u2019s shares have now lost 17% of their value since 17th January, just before experts warned that the virus could be much more serious than first thought. Asia is a massively important market for Burberry. Last week, it reported that sales in mainland China had grown by \u201cmid-teen\u201d levels. It has been hoping for a bumper Lunar New Year -- creating a \u201cRatberry\u201d campaign to piggy-back off the Year Of The Rat. It also planned to take its Autumn/Winter 2020 runway show to Shanghai in April and open our first social retail store in Shenzhen, in partnership with Tencent. Those plans could all be hurt by the Wuhan coronavirus. Neil Mackinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital, has also been looking at previous viruses such as SARS, for indications of how the Wuhan coronavirus may play out. The lesson, he says, is that markets may tumble in the face of an epidemic-- but they then typically bounce back. \u201cOf course, making any accurate quantitative estimate of what the coronavirus means for global and Chinese GDP growth estimates or what it might mean for financial markets is fraught with difficulties. However, that is the nature of the beast. Equity markets seem to want to believe \u201cgood news\u201d. In other words, investors, in the absence of anything else to work on, refer to previous viruses, such as SARS in 2003 or MERS in 2012, as a template for price action in the markets or in terms of economic developments. The investment message from those episodes is that equity markets can drop 10% or so over a 1-3 month period before strongly bouncing back. Negative effects on economic growth are equally short-lived. For example, developing Asia recovered at an 11% pace after the summer of 2003.\u201d The Coronavirus crisis could drive China\u2019s economy into reverse, fears Freya Beamish. chief Asia Economist at Pantheon Economics. In a new research note, Beamish predicts that China\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d real GDP could be flat, or even fall in January-March, due to the efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, factory shutdowns, and fearful consumers. She points out that the SARS virus caused a serious slowdown back in 2003, damaging service sector activity and manufacturing output. We reckon the brunt of the damage was done in Q2 2003, when real GDP growth dropped to 1.8% quarter-on-quarter, from an average of 2.8% in the previous three quarters. Growth then rebounded sharply in Q3, to 3.4%, coming off the favourable base of Q2, but again was weak in Q3. Although coronavirus appears to be less deadly than SARS, it may be more contagious -- and Beijing may impose more stringent measures to tackle the virus. Beamish predicts: The bottom line here is that China could even see a contraction in quarterly real GDP growth in Q1, in reality, depending on the timing of factory closures and how long it takes to contain the virus. We are assuming that missed spending will be recouped in Q2, leading to a bumper quarter, though it\u2019s very possible that some of the expenditure on services around the holiday simply will be lost. This means the overall economy may not bounce back in the same way as in 2003. In short, you can make up for factory shutdowns by increasing overtime, but making up spending for a lost holiday is more complicated. And the containment measures could go on for longer than in our baseline assumption. A person in Japan who has not visited Wuhan has contracted the coronavirus, local media are reporting. Reuters explains: Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said a person in Japan who had not visited Wuhan has contracted the new coronavirus, Japanese media reported on Tuesday. The infected person is a tour bus driver in his 60s in the city of Nara, Kyodo said. Health Ministry officials were not immediately available for comment. The European market rally is now fading, as Hong Kong\u2019s leader Carrie Lam outlines new measures to curb transport between her city and mainland China. Hong Kong is suspending its high-speed rail link with China, and also cutting the number of flights in an attempt to limit the spread of coronavirus. Sensible measures, but they also highlight how the epidemic will hurt economic activity in the region. After their worst day in four months yesterday, European stock markets have opened higher this morning. But it\u2019s only a small recovery, given they lost over 2% on Monday. FTSE 100: up 27 points or 0.38% at 7439 German DAX: up 38 points or 0.3% at 13,239 French CAC: up 27 points or 0.5% at 5,891 Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says traders should await coronavirus developments.... It makes sense to compare and draw some inference between now and the performance of markets during SARS. European equities saw a 20-25% drawdown during SARS. The FTSE 100 is down just under 4% from its recent peak and the DAX has lost under 2.5% so there is plenty of downside risk. Is that size correction likely? The lower mortality rate of the Wuhan virus is a reason for optimism it won\u2019t. But extra caution is needed because China is now much more important to the global economy than it was in 2003. We think it is better to wait for the rise in the number of cases to slow before getting positive about the markets again. We know there is an incubation period of 14 days and the virus can be passed on when the subject is not showing symptoms. Putting that together, we could be on the cusp of a plateau or a massive escalation in the number of cases. MSCI\u2019s index of emerging markets shares has dropped by 0.5% today, amid worries that the coronavirus will hurt global growth. John Velis of BNY Mellon Markets says: With Chinese authorities working hard to contain the spread of the virus, and firms and provinces extending the week-long lunar new year to prevent massive travel volumes at the height of an epidemic, we\u2019re seeing anecdotal evidence of large factories going idle until well after the new year, and foreign companies evacuating non-Chinese citizens. Japan\u2019s stock market has fallen to a three-week low today. The Nikkei shed 0.55%, hurt by coronavirus worries and a rally in the yen (as investors race for save havens). Companies exposed to the Chinese economy did badly, but shares in pharmaceuticals firms jumped. Reuters has the details: Shares of South Korean mask producer Monalisa surged 29%, while South Korean pharmaceuticals Kukje Pharma and Woojung Bio added 29% and 21% respectively on Tuesday. Japan\u2019s Kawamoto Corp, which supplies medical products including masks, saw its share prices tripled, while Japanese protective clothing maker Azearth rose 53% in the past week. Malaysia\u2019s Top Glove Corp has seen its shares surge by a quarter in a week. Several economists fear that the coronavirus will hurt China\u2019s economy -- although there\u2019s uncertainty over quite how bad it will be. My colleague Martin Farrer explains: Economists agreed that the outbreak will have a negative impact in China but the lack of understanding about how the virus spreads and how bad it might be was adding to uncertainty to the mix and compounding investor concerns. Citigroup said on Tuesday: \u201cThe wildcard is not the fatality rate, but how infectious the Wuhan virus is. The economic impact will depend on how successfully this outbreak is contained.\u201d The consultancy Capital Economics said the impact could be similar to the Sars outbreak in 2003 which knocked three percentage points off growth \u201cThe outbreak is developing too rapidly to predict with any confidence the final extent of the economic damage,\u201d said Capital\u2019s chief Asia economist Mark Williams. \u201cBut it is now certain that the outbreak will have a significant impact on China\u2019s GDP this quarter.\u201d And although China recovered quickly from Sars, Williams said the local economy was much stronger back in 2003 and was not facing the cyclical and structural headwinds posed by slowing population growth and industrialisation. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors around the globe are focused on one question today -- how serious is the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, and what impact will it have on the global economy? Global equities suffered sharp losses on Monday, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 plunged over 2% - its worst day since October. Wall Street followed, losing 1.5% as traders fretted that the virus could become a SARS-like epidemic proportions. Overnight, the death toll from the virus hit 106, with more than 4,515 cases of the illness now been recorded across China. The first death has been reported in Beijing, highlighting how the virus has spread beyond the city of Wuhan. This has prompted losses in some Asia-Pacific market today, particularly in markets which were closed on Monday. South Korea\u2019s KOSPI 200 index has been badly buffeted, losing 3% during Tuesday\u2019s session, while Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 shed 1.35% , with tourism, consumer and mining stocks leading the charge downwards. Australia\u2019s economy is tightly linked to China, providing the coal and iron ore needed to sustain the Chinese economy. But it\u2019s hard to assess quite how much economic damage coronavirus could cause. My colleague Ben Butler reports: \u201cWe haven\u2019t got enough information,\u201d the economist and former Reserve Bank board member Warwick McKibbin said. McKibbin has previously estimated that a \u201cmild\u201d pandemic in Asia, such as the 1968 Hong Kong flu outbreak which killed about 1m people, would carve 0.8% from Australia\u2019s gross domestic product, with most of the damage felt in the services sector. And in a 2004 paper co-authored with the World Health Organisation, he estimated the 2003 Sars outbreak, which killed about 800 people, cut Australian GDP by 0.07%. China\u2019s stock markets remain closed for the Lunar New Year - preventing traders in Shanghai, Shenzhen or Beijing from selling stocks. Europe\u2019s stock markets may recover today - the FTSE 100 just opened 38 points higher (having lost 173 on Monday). But any signs that the virus is spreading faster or claiming more lives could send stocks down again. Part of the problem, bluntly, is that pneumonia pandemics aren\u2019t well understood in the City. Investors have been swotting up fast about incubation times, mortality rates and infectious control -- but it\u2019s still hard to plug this public health crisis into a classic trading mode. As Neil Wilson of Markets.com puts it: The problem is investors have very limited visibility of the current situation in China, have virtually zero knowledge of epidemiology and virology, and have no clue how bad it will get or lasting the impact will be. Risk models are not geared for this situation. Here\u2019s a pithier take: Also coming up today A new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s retail sector is expected to show a pick-up in spending this month, as confidence rises following December\u2019s general election. New economic surveys from the US could show a rise in durable goods orders, and consumer confidence. However, such data could soon be overtaken by concerns over the coronavirus. The agenda 11am GMT: CBI index of UK retail sales for January. Forecast to rise to +4. from 0 1.30pm GMT: US durable goods orders for December. Forecast to rise by 0.9%, from -2.1% 3pm GMT: US consumer confidence index for January. Forecast to rise to 128.0, from 126.5",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The country saw a similar wave of xenophobia during 2003 Sars outbreak, which also started in China.</p> \n<p>During that panic, many Chinese-run businesses in Canada took steep losses as fear overrode public health advice: Toronto lost an estimated C$1bn as residents and tourists avoided the city, especially areas with a high concentration of Chinese businesses.</p> \n<p>The irrational public worry that paralyzed much of the city seems to be returning, said Amy Go, the interim president of the Chinese Canadian National Council for Social Justice.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was hopeful it wasn\u2019t going to be like 2003.

Recommended reads A lovable moustachioed thug in a dress brought colour to Australia. Andrew Mercado writes: \u201cIn 1965, American primetime TV went all colour; the UK did the same in 1969. But Australia couldn\u2019t afford a war in Vietnam and new technology at the same time, so despite leading the world in TV firsts like nudity and sexual taboos, none of it happened in colour until the mid-1970s. When colour came to Australian TVs, it came in a uniquely Australian way: ushered in by an outrageous comedy legend named Aunty Jack, whose catchphrase to \u2018little kiddies\u2019 everywhere was: \u2018If you don\u2019t behave, I\u2019ll jump through your set and rip yer bloody arms off!\u2019\u201d To address climate change, we must stop dividing people along the faultlines of class and culture, writes Emma Dawson: \u201cThe shocking levels of smoke haze blanketing Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne have meant that city-dwellers cannot avert their gaze from the impact of these massive fire fronts, so devastatingly charged by the impact of climate change on our arid land mass. So is it too much to hope that when the fires are, at least temporarily, quelled and the smoke subsides, this sense of national unity might extend beyond the immediate crisis?\u201d Listen On today\u2019s Full Story: the problem with Silicon Valley lifestyle hacks. These days Silicon Valley entrepreneurs don\u2019t just make apps \u2013 they also spruik diets, expensive health treatments and other \u201cbio-hacks\u201d such as dopamine fasting and cryotherapy. Columnist Brigid Delaney considers how much stock we should put in their advice. Cook These spicy mussels can be one of those dishes that ranges from being a simple weekday compromise to a more refined dinner, writes Jackie Middleton. Sport Roger Federer saved seven match points en route to a semifinal with Novak Djokovic. Federer beat Tennys Sandgren 6-3, 2-6, 2-6, 7-6 (10-8), 6-3. \u201cRoger Federer has had many improbable victories in his career, and a smattering of unusual defeats, but his passage into the semi-finals of the 2020 Australian Open after three-and-half hours of undiluted drama against Tennys Sandgren was in another dimension,\u201d writes Kevin Mitchell. LeBron James has made his first public comments since the death of Kobe Bryant, his fellow Los Angeles Laker. In an Instagram post, James said he was crying as he wrote a tribute to Bryant. Media roundup The Australian leads with Scott Morrison\u2019s speech to the National Press Club today, in which he will outline \u201cstrengthening the constitutional and legal powers of the commonwealth to allow prime ministers to declare national disasters and call in the Defence Force\u201d and \u201cshift the Coalition\u2019s posture on climate change.\u201d The Australian Financial Review reports that \u201cDeloitte failed to flag problems in the financial statements of three of the eight collapsed listed companies it audited over the last decade.\u201d On the ABC: a $1m reward is being offered for information about the 1995 murder of Hasan Dastan, a Blacktown business owner.

We will continue to see further similar cases outside of China, but the indications are at this stage that onwards transmission will be limited, so there will likely not be too many cases for example across Europe, and on a much lesser scale than we are seeing in China.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p> <strong>Prof Paul Hunter, professor in medicine, the Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, said:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> The recent reports would now bring to a total of three confirmed cases \u2013 in Vietnam, Japan and Germany \u2013 who have not visited China but only been in contact with cases from China. The fact that person to person transmission is occurring outside of China is not too surprising. The Vietnamese case was reported by WHO and he was in contact with his sick father who had returned from China. The Japanese case was a tour bus driver who had driven around two groups of Chinese tourists and the German cases had attended a work-based training event also attended by a woman who only became ill two days later during her return to China two days later. The German case is most worrying because if the Chinese woman was indeed asymptomatic at the time of the training session it would confirm reports of spread before symptoms develop making standard control strategies less effective.</p> \n   <p>This new information reinforces the importance of Public Health England\u2019s current advice that if anyone has returned from Wuhan in the last 14 days they should \u201d<em tabindex=\"-1\">stay indoors and avoid contact with other people as you would with other flu viruses</em>\u201d and \u201d<em tabindex=\"-1\">contact NHS 111 to inform them of your recent travel to the city</em>\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A German man who tested positive for the strain of coronavirus sweeping across China was infected by a work colleague, officials said on Tuesday, in what is believed to be the first human transmission in Europe. The Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, said on Tuesday the high-speed rail service between the city and mainland China would be suspended from Thursday, and all cross-border ferry services would also be suspended in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has said the government is working on plans to repatriate UK nationals in Wuhan, the Chinese region at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. He called on Britons in the region to contact the British consulate. The head of the World Health Organization has said he is confident in China\u2019s ability to contain a new coronavirus that has killed 106 people and he called for calm, Chinese media reported. Footage has emerged appearing to show a man being forcibly removed from the Guangzhou metro by security staff for not wearing a face mask, after the South China province implemented a mandatory order to wear them because of the coronavirus crisis. Chinese companies are working overtime to produce masks amid soaring demand caused by the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday China was sure of defeating the \u201cdevil\u201d coronavirus, in comments carried by Chinese state television. Xi spoke after he met the World Health Organization (WHO) chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in Beijing to discuss how to protect Chinese and foreigners in areas affected by the virus and \u201cpossible\u201d evacuation alternatives, a WHO spokesman said. State television quoted Xi as saying: The virus is a devil and we cannot let the devil hide. China will strengthen international cooperation and welcomes the WHO participation in virus prevention \u2026 China is confident of winning the battle against the virus. A WHO panel of 16 independent experts twice last week declined to declare an international emergency. Traditionally, the WHO is reluctant to antagonise or ostracise countries dealing with epidemics for fear of undermining future willingness to report cases of infectious disease outbreaks. There have been 97 cases of suspected coronavirus tested in the UK, but so far no positive diagnoses. Taiwan has reported its first case of domestic transmission of the new coronavirus. Taiwan\u2019s central epidemic command centre said the latest patient, the eighth, was the first case of transmission on the island as in all the previous cases the people had been infected first in China. The new patient, a man in his 50s from central Taiwan, was infected by his wife after she returned from working in China and before she was subsequently diagnosed, the command centre said. The man is in a stable condition, it said. The academic pubilsher Wiley has compiled 54 research articles relating to the coronavirus, listed them on a single page, and has made them free to read for the next few months, as the world battles to contain the outbreak. Here is Wiley\u2019s announcement: Wiley has identified 54 articles related to the coronavirus and is providing free access to this research to support outbreak relief efforts in China and other countries. These important pieces of literature will remain free until April 2020, with the window of time extended as needed. Newly published articles related to coronavirus will immediately be free to access during this time period, and will be posted to the coronavirus research page. Access to 54 medical and scientific articles includes research from the Journal of Medical Virology, Transboundary and Emerging Diseases, Zoonoses and Public Health and many more. The coronavirus outbreak could last several months and its course is unpredictable, with many thousands more people likely to have been affected than official figures suggest, according to Dr Jennifer Rohn, a specialist in cell biology at University College London. In an interview with the PA Media news agency, Rohn said it was possible the UK already has cases of coronavirus that have not been detected. \u201cIt is possible that somebody has slipped through the net,\u201d she said. \u201cThe symptoms are incredibly common to lots of other things that aren\u2019t harmful at all.\u201d But she added: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we got a couple of cases soon.\u201d According to Rohn, the virus was spreading more quickly than Sars but was less deadly. She said it was difficult to know how long the outbreak would last, adding: \u201cIt is hard to predict but, certainly, the cat is out of the bag. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the full picture \u2013 they are running very short on diagnostic kits in China \u2013 and the truth is we don\u2019t know where all the people are who are infected.\u201d It was likely far more thousands of people are infected than the cases confirmed in China, she said. Dr Rohn said it was possible the virus could last several months but it could also end as the seasons change. \u201cSome of these respiratory viruses are seasonal \u2013 there could be a peak and then there\u2019s a lull,\u201d she said. \u201cWe may have some breathing space but to be honest we don\u2019t know yet.\u201d Health experts say they are unsurprised by the human to human transmissions of coronavirus in Japan, Vietnam and Germany. Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: The reported human to human transmission in Germany and Japan is unsurprising to see. We will continue to see further similar cases outside of China, but the indications are at this stage that onwards transmission will be limited, so there will likely not be too many cases for example across Europe, and on a much lesser scale than we are seeing in China. Prof Paul Hunter, professor in medicine, the Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, said: The recent reports would now bring to a total of three confirmed cases \u2013 in Vietnam, Japan and Germany \u2013 who have not visited China but only been in contact with cases from China. The fact that person to person transmission is occurring outside of China is not too surprising. The Vietnamese case was reported by WHO and he was in contact with his sick father who had returned from China. The Japanese case was a tour bus driver who had driven around two groups of Chinese tourists and the German cases had attended a work-based training event also attended by a woman who only became ill two days later during her return to China two days later. The German case is most worrying because if the Chinese woman was indeed asymptomatic at the time of the training session it would confirm reports of spread before symptoms develop making standard control strategies less effective. This new information reinforces the importance of Public Health England\u2019s current advice that if anyone has returned from Wuhan in the last 14 days they should \u201dstay indoors and avoid contact with other people as you would with other flu viruses\u201d and \u201dcontact NHS 111 to inform them of your recent travel to the city\u201d. I would add that this advice should also be followed by anyone who has been to any other area in China where the infection is known to be common or if they know they have been in contact with a presumed case. There have now been 45 confirmed cases in 13 countries outside of China, with no deaths so far, the WHO\u2019s spokesman, Christian Lindmeier, told a briefing in Geneva on Tuesday. Reuters reports: The WHO said a case in Vietnam involved human-to-human transmission outside China and a Japanese official has said there was a suspected case of human-to-human transmission there, too. Andreas Zapf, the president of Bavaria\u2019s office for health and food safety, said on Tuesday the person infected was 33 years old and had come into contact with a Chinese woman on 21 January. Zapf said the woman was from Shanghai but her parents, who are from the Wuhan region, had visited her a few days earlier. He added that she had arrived in Germany on 19 January, appearing not to have any symptoms, but began to feel ill on her flight home on 23 January. She sought medical treatment after landing and tested positive for coronavirus. When that information was relayed back to the German company, a male employee said he felt like he had flu over the weekend and was on Monday advised to get medical treatment. The head doctor at the clinic where the man is being treated told a news conference the patient was awake and responsive and he did not think the man\u2019s life was at risk. Bavaria\u2019s health ministry said people who had been in contact with the man had been informed of possible symptoms, hygiene measures and transmission channels. Good afternoon, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin taking over the blog while Damien has lunch. According to a recent update from Public Health England, of the 73 UK tests that have been carried out, 73 were confirmed negative and none positive. The health body notes: The risk to the UK population has been assessed as low. This has been raised from very low due to current evidence on the ability for the virus to spread between people. Taiwan has raised its travel warning for China, saying people should avoid going unless absolutely necessary amid an outbreak of the new coronavirus there, Reuters reports. The island has reported seven confirmed cases of the virus so far. Taiwan\u2019s central epidemic command centre said it had raised its previous advice and would extend to the rest of China an existing warning not to go to Hubei province unless totally necessary, though Hong Kong and Macau are excluded. Taiwan also has rolled out strict curbs on Chinese visitors, restricting a vast majority of them. Last week, Taiwan\u2019s government announced a one-month ban on the export of specialist masks designed to be used for medical personnel, saying it had to look after the needs of its own people first. Some pharmacies in Taiwan have reported shortages of face masks since the island reported its first case a week ago, and the government says it is working to ensure supplies. In a separate notice on Tuesday, the government said it would release more stock of masks, but limit each person to buying a maximum of three. However, it also issued a reminder that most healthy people do not need to wear masks all the time. The Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, visiting people on Tuesday to extend lunar new year wishes, said the government was fully prepared to deal with the virus and people should not panic. \u201cOur anti-epidemic work does not take holidays, and is taking place 24 hours a day,\u201d the presidential office quoted her as saying. A German man who tested positive for the strain of coronavirus sweeping across China was infected by a work colleague, officials said on Tuesday, in what is believed to be the first human transmission in Europe, AFP reports. The man had not visited China but a Chinese work colleague who was in Germany last week had started to feel sick on the flight home on 23 January, said Andreas Zapf, the head of the Bavarian state office for health and food safety. He had attended a training session given by his Chinese colleague on 21 January at the office of a car parts supplier Webasto in Stockdorf in Bavaria and tested positive for the virus on Monday evening. Unlike the other patients, the 33-year-old had not recently travelled to China. He remains in hospital in an isolation ward, but Zapf said he \u201cwas doing well\u201d. The Chinese woman immediately sought medical attention on her return to China and was confirmed to have caught the virus, which has spread rapidly in recent weeks after first emerging in the city of Wuhan. The woman had recently returned from visiting her parents in the Wuhan region, Zapf said. In a statement, the Webasto company said it had halted all business travel to and from China \u201cfor at least the next two weeks\u201d. Health officials are checking 40 people that the two infected workers have been in contact with recently, including colleagues and family members. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) and China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, have discussed ways to protect Chinese and foreigners in areas affected by the coronavirus and \u201cpossible alternatives\u201d to evacuations, Reuters reports. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who arrived in Beijing on Monday, will return to Geneva on Wednesday, WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told a Geneva briefing. The WHO emergency committee is being \u201ckept in the loop\u201d on the evolution of the outbreak, which has spread to 13 other countries, he said. The WHO has not seen onward human-to-human spread of the virus by travellers returning from China apart from a second family member infected by a returning relative in Vietnam, which is \u201cgood news but of course this could change\u201d, Lindmeier said. This startling footage shows football teams playing in China\u2019s domestic league arriving in facemasks, then playing their match in an empty stadium in Shanghai. The Chinese embassy in Copenhagen is demanding that one of Denmark\u2019s biggest newspapers apologise for a cartoon on the outbreak of a deadly virus, which it considers an insult to China, the Associated Press reports. The chief editor at Jyllands-Posten, Jacob Nybroe, said the cartoon, which shows the Chinese flag with what resembles viruses instead of stars, did not intend to mock or ridicule China. \u201cWe can\u2019t apologise for something we don\u2019t think is wrong,\u201d Nybroe said on the newspaper\u2019s website. \u201cAs far as I can see, there are two different types of cultural understanding here.\u201d The embassy expressed its strong indignation and said the cartoon, which was printed on Monday, was an insult to China and crossed the bottom line of civilised society and the ethical boundary of free speech and offended human conscience. Jyllands-Posten was embroiled in a previous cartoon-related controversy in 2005 when it published 12 editorial cartoons depicting the Muslim prophet Muhammad, leading to protests around the world, including violent demonstrations and riots in some Muslim countries. The Japanese health minister, Katsunobu Kato, said a person in Japan who had not visited Wuhan has contracted the new coronavirus, Reuters cited the Jiji news agency as reporting on Tuesday. Japanese media reported that the patient was a tour bus driver in his 60s from Nara Prefecture who drove tourists from Wuhan twice a month. He was diagnosed with pneumonia on 25 January, Fukui Shimbun reported. If confirmed, it is the first case of human to human transmission of the new coronavirus in Japan. The Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, said on Tuesday the high-speed rail service between the city and mainland China would be suspended from Thursday, and all cross-border ferry services would also be suspended in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus, Reuters reports. Wearing a green face mask, Lam told a press briefing the number of flights to mainland China would also be halved and personal travel permits for mainland Chinese to the city would be suspended. It comes as Hong Kong health workers threatened to strike from tomorrow over the territory\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak. One of their demands is to close the border with the mainland. Two more confirmed cases of coronavirus have been diagnosed in Singapore, bringing the total number of infected patients in the city state to seven, the Straits Times reports, citing the Singaporean heath ministry. The country is imposing new entry restrictions on travellers with passports issued in Hubei, the Chinese province where the outbreak began, or those who have recently travelled there. Quarantine orders are to be imposed on the most high risk among 2,000 recent travellers to the area already in Singapore. All seven coronavirus patients diagnosed in Singapore so far have been from Wuhan. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has said the government is working on plans to repatriate UK nationals in Wuhan, the Chinese region at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. He called on Britons in the region to contact the British consulate. His call comes as the UK appeared to be lagging behind other countries in efforts to get their nationals out of the region. Speaking on BBC Breakfast this morning, Shapps said: We are working on it. For anybody who is there, one of the issues we have, working with our partners internationally on this, is actually identifying how many British citizens there are in Wuhan. One of the things we\u2019re asking people to do is to contact the consulate there to make them aware. People have started to do that. We are working on arrangements as well. So making contact would be very helpful indeed ... If they actually contact the consulate where they are then that consulate is in fact gathering together all the information of the people who are there in order to help repatriate where that\u2019s appropriate. That is very much what\u2019s required at this stage. More than half a million South Koreans have signed a petition calling for a ban on people from China entering the country, Reuters reports. A petition filed with the presidential Blue House on Thursday had gathered more than 530,000 signatures by Tuesday, highlighting a growing fear in South Korea that the coronavirus could spread widely. The first confirmed case detected in South Korea was a Chinese national, but the other three so far are South Koreans who travelled from Wuhan, where the outbreak appears to have started. That has not stopped the calls for Chinese visitors to be banned. \u201cCoronavirus is spreading from China. Even North Korea is banning Chinese people from entering the country,\u201d wrote the anonymous author of the petition, adding that even a temporary ban would help stop the virus from spreading too widely. The Blue House has not directly responded to the petition. When asked about other countries\u2019 bans on Chinese entries, its spokesman on Tuesday said only that the issue should be handled in close consultation with the World Health Organisation. The head of the World Health Organization has said he is confident in China\u2019s ability to contain a new coronavirus that has killed 106 people and he called for calm, Chinese media reported. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a meeting with State Councilor Wang Yi in Beijing, said he approved of the government\u2019s measures to curb the outbreak, the Xinhua state news agency said. He said he did not think foreigners should be evacuated. Ghebreyesus was not available for comment but his agency said his aim was to strengthen the partnership with China, in particular on the response. A WHO panel of 16 independent experts twice last week declined to declare an international emergency over the outbreak. While more cases have been emerging outside China in people who have travelled from there recently, the WHO said only one of the overseas cases involved human-to-human transmission. \u201cThat\u2019s still one case too many. But we\u2019re encouraged that so far we have not seen more human-to-human transmission outside China,\u201d the WHO said on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019re monitoring the outbreak constantly.\u201d Countries around the world are planning to evacuate diplomatic staff and private citizens from Chinese areas hit by the new coronavirus, Reuters reports. The news agency has compiled some countries\u2019 evacuation plans, and how they are planning to manage the health risk from those who are returning. France\u2019s first plane to repatriate nationals from Wuhan will leave Paris on Wednesday and return the next day. The flight will carry people with no symptoms, junior transport minister Jean-Baptiste Djebarri told television channel CNews. \u201cThese people will be put under quarantine. And then there will be a second flight, at a yet undefined date, with people showing symptoms ... who will be cared for in Paris,\u201d he said. South Korea plans to send charter flights this week to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said on Tuesday. The planes will arrive in the city as early as Thursday, he told a ministerial meeting aimed at discussing efforts to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. Japan will send a charter flight to Wuhan on Tuesday night. Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said the flight can carry around 200 passengers, but added about 650 citizens hope to return to Japan. Motegi said Tokyo is making arrangements for extra flights to Wuhan as early as Wednesday. Those with symptoms such as fever will be sent to hospital on landing at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport, while those with no signs of virus can go home and then to work or school, but will be advised to avoid crowds and take their temperatures twice a day. Kazakhstan has asked Beijing to allow 98 Kazakh students to leave the city of Wuhan, deputy foreign minister Shukhrat Nuryshev said. Germany will evacuate 90 citizens living in China\u2019s Wuhan region. Morocco will evacuate 100 citizens, mostly students, from the Wuhan area. Spain\u2019s government is working with China and the European Union to repatriate Spanish nationals from the Wuhan area, Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said. The U.S. State Department said it will evacuate personnel from its Wuhan consulate to the United States and offer a limited number of seats to private U.S. citizens on a flight. Some private citizens will be able to board the \u201csingle flight\u201d leaving Wuhan on Jan. 28 for San Francisco, it said. Canada has about 167 nationals in the Wuhan area, Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said on Monday, and eight people have sought consular assistance, which is being provided. While the minister did not rule out possible evacuations, he did not indicate there were any planned at the moment, adding that each consular request would be evaluated on a \u201ccase by case basis\u201d. Russia has been in talks with China about evacuating its nationals from Wuhan and Hubei province, Russia\u2019s embassy in China said. The Dutch government is assessing ways to evacuate 20 Dutch citizens from Wuhan, press agency ANP reported. Authorities in Myanmar said they had cancelled a planned evacuation of 60 students from Mandalay who were studying in Wuhan. Kyaw Yin Myint, a spokesman for the Mandalay municipal government, told Reuters that a \u201cfinal decision\u201d had been made to send them back after 14 days, once the virus\u2019 incubation period had passed. Britain is talking to international partners to find solutions to help British and other foreign nationals leave Wuhan, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. Doctors and nurses in Hong Kong are planning to strike tomorrow out of anger at the way authorities have dealt with the coronavirus crisis, sources within the territory\u2019s protest movement have confirmed to the Guardian. People in Hong Kong are furious that the border with the mainland has remained open, that authorities have failed to hand out enough face masks to prevent the spread of infection, and that they are allowing people from the mainland to come over for free medical checks. DW News\u2019s east Asia correspondent, William Yang, has tweeted a translation of the latest advice from China\u2019s national health commission, which says that patients with less severe cases of coronavirus are still contagious - but perhaps less so. Hello, this is Damien Gayle, in London, taking over the reins of the live blog this morning. If you have any updates or comments on the coronavirus outbreak and you want to get in touch then you can email me at damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via my Twitter profile @damiengayle. Here\u2019s a summary of what we now about the coronavirus outbreak so far on Tuesday: 106 people have died from coronavirus in China China has more than 4,500 confirmed cases, with nearly 1,000 in a critical condition China\u2019s Health Commission says that the main transmission is through \u201crespiratory droplets\u201d (coughing) and then touch. Incubation is generally 3-7 days, maximum 14 days, the commission says The US has updated its travel advice to the highest level which means avoid all non-essential travel to China Asian markets have fallen on concerns about the virus spreading Germany has recorded its first case of the virus as has Sri Lanka Australian state of NSW advises school children returning from summer break not to go back if they have been in China in past two weeks Several countries are sending charter flights to evacuate their citizens Thailand on Tuesday confirmed six more cases of coronavirus among visitors from China, bringing the country\u2019s total to 14 cases, a health official said. Five of the new cases, aged 6 to 70 years, came from Hubei province and are part of the same family, the deputy director-general of the Department of Disease Control, Tanarak Plipat, told reporters. The other patient came from Chongqing, For foreign citizens trapped in Wuhan, attention will turn in the next few days to airlifts. Japan said it would send a chartered flight to Wuhan on Tuesday night to evacuate its citizens, while the US government is also preparing an airlift. France and South Korea are also preparing an evacuation but there\u2019s been criticism of the slow response by the British authorities. You can read our full story below. South Korea plans to send charter flights this week to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan, the epicentre of a virus outbreak in China, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said on Tuesday, according to the Reuters news agency. The planes will arrive in the city as early as Thursday, he told a ministerial meeting aimed at discussing efforts to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency says six people are being tested for coronavirus. There are four confirmed cases. The Global Times is reporting that the Chinese city of Tianjin, in northern China, is to launch a \u201cwartime mechanism\u201d, putting one of its general hospitals and 500 medical teams in the city under military management. It\u2019s the first Chinese city to take the step, according to the Global Times. Tianjin is about 120km south-east of Beijing. Its population is around 15 million people. There are a few interesting sites tracking the increase in coronavirus cases. This one from John\u2019s Hopkins university in the US is one of the best. It clearly shows the steep rise in confirmed infections each day in the past week, from around 280 on 20 January, to over 4,500 today. One of the curious thing to come out of the Australian news conference about school advice with regards to coronavirus, is that speakers reiterated that there hasn\u2019t been person-to-person transmission of the virus in Australia. \u201cThere is no evidence,\u201d said the NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant. Yesterday the federal health minister also said there was no human-to-human transmission in Australia. It does seem difficult to see why the virus would behave differently in Australia, given the Chinese health authorities have said that transmission is through \u201crespiratory droplets\u201d (coughing) and touch. I\u2019m assuming the ministers mean there has been no evidence so far of human-to-human transmission in Australia. The NSW education minister Sarah Mitchell was also at the press conference regarding change of advice for children returning after the long summer break. She said it is the right decision: \u201cWe know that many in the community have been wanting to see this. I think it is important we are taking this precautionary measure in line with community sentiment but also knowing we are doing everything we can even though the risk is low, to ensure the safety in that school environment,\u201d she said. Whether to allow children to return to school has been the subject of considerable controversy in Australia over the past few days. On Monday, a number of Sydney private schools issued much stricter restrictions on children who had been in China returning to school. As of yesterday afternoon, one asked that any children who had travelled to China in the holidays remain at home for 14 days after they returned, and do not return to school without a medical certificate. The decision is particularly controversial in Australia as only this morning the federal education minister, Dan Tehan, chastising schools for telling students to stay away. The exclusion period announced in Australia for school children is for 14 days since returning to the country. So if NSW school students arrived back in Australia in mid-January, they would be able to start school this week if the 14-day period had passed. At the new conference, Hazzard was asked if it was compulsory for children who had travelled in China to keep their children home from school until the 14-day incubation period had passed, and essentially the answer was that it is a request and they hope people will comply. In Australia the New South Wales government has announced that it is changing its advice with regards to parents sending their children back to school after the long summer break. Children who have returned from China in the past two weeks have been asked to stay home from school. \u201cThis is one of the most difficult decisions I have made,\u201d said the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard. \u201cWe have decided that New South Wales is the epicentre of what\u2019s occurring,\u201d he said. \u201cWe apologise to parents who may find themselves in this situation.\u201d The decision will apply to teachers and students in the NSW health system as well. Japan\u2019s government will send a chartered flight to Wuhan on Tuesday night to evacuate its nationals wishing to return home, according to the Reuters news agency. The country\u2019s foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, told reporters the flight could carry around 200 passengers, but added about 650 Japanese citizens are hoping to come back to Japan. Motegi said the government is making arrangements for additional flights that will leave for Wuhan as early as Wednesday. We reported earlier that the National Health Commission had issued new figures for deaths and infections, including 4,515 confirmed cases of the virus. State media is reporting that 976 - or just over 20% of cases \u2013 are patients in a critical condition. It also says there are 6,973 suspected cases in China. China Global TV Network published a map of infections in China (in which it includes Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan). The streets of Wuhan are still largely empty says the New York Times\u2019 reporter Chris Buckley. With millions largely confined to their homes because of the coronavirus in China, social media is awash with novel ways to stave off boredom \u2013 from indoor fishing to singing challenges, as our correspondent Michael Standaert reports. The Philippines has suspended its usual practice of issuing visas upon arrival (VUA) to Chinese visitors in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. The bureau of immigration commissioner Jaime Morente said in a statement: \u201cThe Civil Aeronautics Board has already suspended direct flights from Wuhan province,\u201d said Morente. \u201cWe are now temporarily suspending the issuance of VUA for Chinese nationals to slow down the influx of group tours,\u201d he added. The VUA facility is often used by groups of Chinese tourists but Morente emphasised that Chinese visitors were not barred from the Philippines, but would be subject to checks for the virus. China accounts for around 20% of tourist visits to the Philippines. \u201cWe have not received any directive imposing policy changes on Chinese nationals,\u201d said Morente. \u201cBut we are taking this proactive measure to slow down travel, and possibly help prevent the entry of the 2019-nCov,\u201d he stated. Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister, has just been been speaking about the virus and its impact on Australian in China and at home, where there have been five confirmed cases. He said the cabinet\u2019s national security committee met yesterday to discuss the threat posed by the virus and would continue to meet every few days. Australia is working with the Chinese government to deploy consular officials into Hubei province and into Wuhan. \u201cThis is essential to assist us as we then consider the further options of support that we can provide to Australian citizens who are in Wuhan and in Hubei Province more broadly,\u201d he said amid growing calls for Australia to follow the example of the US and Japan and evacuate its citizens from the virus epicentre. The virus sent Australia\u2019s stock market tumbling today. Read all about it, and the potentially negative impact on tourism, with this report from our business writer Ben Butler: Sri Lanka has confirmed its first case of the coronavirus, according to the Chinese state news service CGTN. It said the victim was a Chinese tourist who arrived in the south Asian country on 19 Janaury but became ill on 25 January. A report on the website of the Hindu newspaper said the victim was a woman in her 40s and was from the locked down Chinese province of Hubei. With regards to the number of infections, it seems the figure issued just over an hour ago of 4,193 cases in China has been updated to 4,515, according to the state-run Global Times. According to CGTN, this includes 8 in Hong Kong, 7 in Macao and 5 in Taiwan. The death toll remains 106. China\u2019s National Health Commission issued guidance on treating the coronavirus last night (27 January). It says \u201crespiratory droplet transmission is the main route of transmission\u201d, but it can also be transmitted through contact. It says \u201cbased on current epidemiological investigations, the incubation period is generally 3-7 days, with the longest no more than 14 days\u201d. As I mentioned earlier, the US consulate in Wuhan is preparing to fly its diplomats and some other Americans out of the country. Many other countries are also considering this, such as Japan, Mongolia, and France. Australia has identified about 400 citizens how have registered for help to get out of Hubei, but it does not have an embassy in Wuhan, which is likely making the situation more complicated. Indian diplomatic officials are also apparently in talks about how to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan. In Australia, there\u2019s been conflicting advice between public and private schools about when to send children back for the start of the school year after the long summer break. Australia\u2019s federal education minister, Dan Tehan, weighed into the debate today, chastising schools for forcing healthy students returning from China to stay away. Some private schools are telling children to stay away from school for 14 days if they have recently travelled to any part of China. Publicly funded state schools say only students who have been in contact with known cases of coronavirus should be excluded until medically cleared. \u201cIndividual schools make their own decisions but the advice from the Australian government is to follow our medical advice,\u201d Tehan told ABC radio. \u201cI would say to all schools that they should be following the advice of the health department, that is the clear position of the Australian government. \u201cObviously in the end they will have to answer to their parents, but also they will have to answer to state and territory governments, who have responsibility for schools.\u201d We have reported quite a bit about the new hospital Chinese authorities are building in a very short time to cope withe rising number of infections. Below is a time-lapse video of the 1,000-bed facility that is expected to open in the next few days. Just to put those figures into context ... yesterday the toll was 82, so today\u2019s figures of 106 is an increase of 29%. Infections are up from 2,887 to 4,193, an increase of 45%. But it\u2019s worth remembering these are still relatively small numbers of people affected relative to the population size. Wuhan \u2013 where most deaths have occurred \u2013 has a population of 11 million people Chinese state media is reporting the new figures for deaths and those infected by the coronavirus. The People\u2019s Daily says: 106 deaths 4,193 cases confirmed in China We are starting to get some revised figures on infections in China from coronavirus. The official broadcaster CGTN has just tweeted that there are now 100 deaths confirmed in Hubei province, where the city of Wuhan is the epicentre. It says there are 2,714 confirmed cases in the province, which has a population of just under 60 million people. The Global Times has also reported that Beijing has suspended 28 bus routes to neighbouring cities in an attempt to control the spread of the virus. China\u2019s official Global Times is reporting 13 new cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Shanghai on Monday, taking the total in the city to 66. I\u2019ll bring you an update on overall figures as soon as I can confirm it. As I mentioned earlier, the US has upgraded its travel advice to China to level 3 \u2013 its highest level _ which advises Americans to avoid all non-essential travel to China. Meanwhile the Associated Press is reporting that US State Department has ordered it employees in Wuhan to leave the city and is offering seats on a charter flight to US citizens who also want to leave. Here\u2019s the AP report: State department officials said on Monday in a statement that the the flight to Ontario, California, is expected to leave Wuhan on Wednesday morning local time. Priority will be given to citizens who are most at risk of contracting the virus. Alaska health officials say the flight is expected to make a refuelling stop in Anchorage and that about 240 Americans are expected to be aboard. The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services says the passengers will be screened for coronavirus before they leave Wuhan by US and Chinese health officials and that anyone with symptoms will not be allowed to board the aircraft. The department in a statement says they would be screened again at Anchorage. China\u2019s largest steelmaking city of Tangshan \u2013 about 200km east of Beijing \u2013 has announced it is suspending all public transit in an effort to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The city has a population of around 7.5 million people. The statement was posted on the city government\u2019s official Weibo account, the Reuters news agency reported. In New Zealand there are as yet no reported cases of coronavirus, but experts say it is only a matter of time before the illness breaches the country\u2019s borders. Health experts are currently meeting passengers off flights arriving from China in Auckland and Christchurch. Some schools in Auckland are taking precautions by asking pupils who have spent their summer holidays in or near Wuhan to stay at home for a week to make sure they are not carrying the virus. On Tuesday a hotel in Queenstown became the site of panic after rumours spread that it was in lockdown due to a suspected case of the illness, but the ministry of health said it was not investigating any cases in the region. The hotel at the centre of the speculation said the episode caused \u201cunnecessary distress\u201d. Hundreds of Chinese tourists have also cancelled their planned holidays to New Zealand, tourism operators say, while others have extended their stay to avoid the risk of catching the illness back home. The ministry of health said authorities are taking the outbreak \u201cextremely seriously\u201d with the ministry\u2019s director general of Health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, saying health departments are well-prepared, but the risk of a sustained outbreak in New Zealand remains low. A spokesperson for the Bavarian health ministry has confirmed that a man from Starnberg, near Munich. He is in a \u201cclinically good condition\u201d and is being monitored in isolation. Still in Australia, where the country\u2019s schools are returning this week after the long summer break, health authorities in the state of New South Wales have confirmed there are four confirmed cases of the virus and 8 other cases are under investigation. Chris Weston, head of research at the online trading company Pepperstone in Melbourne, Australia, said there was \u201cno doubt\u201d the virus was going to have an impact on the world\u2019s second biggest economy. \u201cThe question is how dramatic the impact will be and what will be the ramifications on the global economy and demand in general,\u201d he said a short time ago. \u201cWhat we are trying to understand is the economic impact shutting transport links and imposing strict travel controls in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as effectively quarantining 14 cities and millions of people will have. The situation was complicated by the lack of understanding about how the virus is spreading, making it \u201cvery hard to comprehend just how bad it is, or how much worse it can get\u201d. The economic and financial impacts of the virus are beginning to bite. After heavy losses on Asian, European and US losses on Monday, the Australian stock market \u2013 closed on Monday for the Australia day holiday \u2013 has suffered a 1.7% fall this morning. The Australian economy is heavily exposed to any economic disruption in China so the ASX200 index is a decent proxy to watch for how investors are reading the outbreak. The Aussie dollar is also used as a proxy for China and it has duly dipped to its lowest for nearly two months at US67.6c. We are waiting for the latest daily figures on infections of the coronavirus, but at the moment the number of deaths has been confirmed as 82, with at least 2,887 confirmed cases globally, out of which 2,827 are in mainland China. Canada has also upgraded its travel advice for China, asking its citizens to avoid all travel to Hubei province, where the virus outbreak began. It says its citizens should \u201cexercise a high degree of caution\u201d in China due to \u201cthe risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws\u201d. However, it says the \u201cdecision to travel is your choice and you are responsible for your personal safety abroad\u201d. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has upgraded its warning for novel coronavirus to Level 3, which is to avoid all non-essential travel to all of China. This means the outbreak is of \u201chigh risk to travellers and no precautions are available to protect against the identified increased risk\u201d. It warns of person-to-person transmission and that \u201colder adults and people with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk for severe disease\u201d. The advice also notes that there is \u201climited access to adequate medical care in affected areas\u201d in China. Level 3 is the US\u2019s highest warning level. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, with me, Alison Rourke. I hope to be bringing you an update on infection figures shortly \u2013 they are usually announced at around this time. In the mean time, here\u2019s a short summary of the top news on this story at the moment. Beijing has recorded its first death from the virus More cities, including in Hubei province where the outbreak started, have introduced travel bans Wuhan\u2019s mayor has admitted authorities were too slow in releasing information about the virus The US recommends that travellers avoid all nonessential travel to China Canada advises against all travel to Hubei province You can see our latest story on the mayor of Wuhan below And our two explainers are here \u2013 on how worried we should be about the virus and our quick guide on how to protect yourself from infection.",
