      "bodyText": "During the coronavirus crisis, according to the latest, precise Chinese count, Xi Jinping has spoken with the leaders of 29 countries and international organisations and sent messages of sympathy to about a dozen more. The Australian prime minister Scott Morrison has been busy too, talking in the last week with the leaders of the United States, France and Germany and others, chasing support for Australia\u2019s initiative for an outside inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 virus in Wuhan. Notably, the two leaders have not bothered to call each other, something which captures in a nutshell the continuing deterioration in Sino-Australian relations. Put another way, Australia and China and their governments may no longer talk with each other, but they talk a lot about each other, usually in the most undiplomatic way. Australia\u2019s push for an inquiry, along with comments from Peter Dutton, the home affairs minister, is a case in point. It drew furious criticism from Beijing, which portrayed Canberra as lackeys of the US, and ignorant and bigoted for good measures. At the moment, Beijing is like someone who lends you a book and urges you to skip the horrifying opening chapters and flip straight to the end, where the hero \u2013 in this case, the party-state \u2013 prevails, shining a path for the rest of the world to follow. In other words, Beijing wants to talk about how China beat the virus, not how Covid-19 escaped Wuhan in January and spread around the world. The freeze in Sino-Australian relations which set in in late 2016 has thawed slightly here and there, with Morrison and Xi enjoying a brief chat on the sidelines of last year\u2019s G20 meeting in Osaka. Retired politicians, scholars and business leaders from both countries, led on the Australian side by John Howard and Stephen Smith, the former Coalition prime minister and Labor foreign affairs minister respectively, have gathered twice in the last 18 months for frank, private exchanges. But any efforts to quietly mend fences has invariably been overwhelmed by the multiple issues that divide the two countries: allegations of Chinese interference in domestic politics, the South China Sea, hacking, Xinjiang, the Pacific, Hong Kong, jailed writer Yang Hengjun, and on and on. The acrimony even spills into sport, notably swimmer Mack Horton\u2019s labelling of his rival, Sun Yang, as a \u201cdrug cheat\u201d, which made the Australian the target of a vituperative campaign on Chinese social media. At the centre of the rupture is geopolitics, with Australia drawing closer to Washington as China uses its growing muscle to squeeze America out of a region it has dominated for more than 70 years. It is little wonder, then, that Australia and China fall back on megaphone diplomacy, because at the moment, it\u2019s about the only way they have to communicate. Covid-19, which originated, as far as we can tell, from the wildlife markets in Wuhan, has added another thick layer of acrimony to the relationship. Morrison has been noticeably disciplined in how he speaks about China since becoming prime minister, conscious there was no need to make a bad relationship worse by taking gratuitous pot shots. The Chinese embassy in Canberra, although criticising the China travel ban imposed by Australia in January the early days of Covid-19, has also been, by its standards, relatively restrained recently. When a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman aired conspiracy theories about how the US military may have been responsible for bringing the virus to Wuhan, the embassy conspicuously avoided repeating them. But the restraint on both sides has now dropped. Australia might console itself on one point. Beijing is battling with many countries in the wake of the damage wrought to the global economy by the Covid-19. In turn, widespread anger at China ought to have translated into broad support for Australia\u2019s initiative for an inquiry. But that hasn\u2019t happened yet. France and Germany, key swing states in the west, have so far demurred. Australia\u2019s demand for China to be more transparent is unimpeachable. Likewise, it is no surprise that Beijing doesn\u2019t want to talk about what happened in early January, when officials initially delayed alerting the public that a potentially lethal new virus was spreading. Nonetheless, it seems strange that Marise Payne, the Australian foreign affairs minister, went public with Canberra\u2019s idea for an inquiry before she had built support behind the scenes for the idea. Instead, rather than moving in lockstep with numerous like-minded countries, Australia has managed to round up only a few supporters. Still, Australia\u2019s diplomatic shortfalls aren\u2019t a patch on Beijing\u2019s which is alienating country after country with its aggressive rebuke of anyone who dares to question its narrative. The Chinese call it \u201cwolf diplomacy\u201d, an aggressive new posture which is in sync both with their country\u2019s rising power and their resolution to no longer be pushed around by the west. As to Australia, Beijing views Canberra with a mixture of simmering hostility and indifference. If Canberra is in lockstep with Washington, they say, what is the point of putting in any diplomatic effort with the country? Government ministers have long worried that Beijing, which takes more than a third of our exports, would punish Australia with trade sanctions to pressure Canberra to change its political positioning.

So my food budget means I have to ration myself to eating every second day. Sometimes I\u2019ll go as long as four or five days without eating. I\u2019m very, very much looking forward to the supplement because it means for the first time in a long time I\u2019ll be able to buy fresh vegies, fresh fruit.</p> <p>It also means so much more. I haven\u2019t bought my daughter a birthday present since 2012. She\u2019ll be 33 in June. I\u2019ll be 59. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll buy her some art supplies \u2013 she\u2019s very artistic. She only uses the cheap stuff to experiment, but when she makes something she wants to sell, she uses the expensive stuff. As for me, there are all sorts of things I used to do that I\u2019ve forgotten because I can\u2019t afford to do them. I used to knit and crochet, but wool is expensive if you want to make anything like a jumper. I even used to dragon boat race. It\u2019s the only sport I\u2019ve loved and used to train three times a week when I had a job. I even competed nationally. Got medals and everything. But the membership costs money I didn\u2019t have, so I stopped.</p> <h2><strong>Avery Howard, 18, Sydney</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve been on the full independent youth allowance payment since I was 16 and became homeless. At the moment, the payment is $100 less than jobseeker, which is based on a highly outdated notion that young people are supported by their family.</p> <p>When the initial $750 stimulus pay came through, I used it to pay off some bills and buy some groceries. It was hard to find some things because of all the panic buying, but I was able to buy fresh food like mince and put that in the freezer, which I haven\u2019t been able to do until recently. Beforehand, skipping meals was definitely something I had to do. I still do it, but it\u2019s less of a necessity. I\u2019ve just gotten used to not eating as much.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fa08dbeae36d3ccf9fd7188e00f6a987afe74ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fa08dbeae36d3ccf9fd7188e00f6a987afe74ab/0_41_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Avery, 18, Sydney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avery, 18, Sydney: \u2018It means I can breathe easier.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The $550 fortnightly supplement basically means I can breathe easier. It means I won\u2019t be so stressed about managing every cent like I\u2019m used to. I can use it to pay off an Afterpay bill from when I replaced my jeans and shirts that had been worn past repair. Longer term, I\u2019d like to save for a better computer as my current laptop was given to me by my school years ago, and has been put through the wringer. In the very long term, I\u2019d like to save some money to visit my partner who lives in the US. That\u2019s quite expensive, so I\u2019ll hope to squirrel away some money to get me there someday.</p> <h2><strong>Jessica Harrison, 65, Wonthaggi</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve worked part time and lived on what used to be called Newstart for around ten years. I live in a small town where there\u2019s limited chance for any kind of full-time occupation, any type of full-time paid work and because I\u2019m 65 it\u2019s hard to find a job at that age. I\u2019m lucky though, Wonthaggi is a beautiful place and I have lots of friends who help take care of each other. It\u2019s still tough at times. You get that sort of knot in the stomach when you think you\u2019ve spent too much on food that week. I suppose that big change with that temporary increase is what will lessen that feeling.</p> <p>The moment I heard about the supplement payment, I immediately started to mentally budget on what I could spend it on. It was instant. The first thing I am going to buy is some cream cheese, some crusty bread and one of those packets of smoked salmon. That\u2019s the luxury food that you don\u2019t buy at all when you\u2019re on that tiny amount. After that are the big things like house repairs and saving for dental work. The stuff on the house you just put off for a long time. There is a leak at the back of my toilet which I\u2019m going to be getting fixed. And my chimney is pretty rusted. Get my car serviced. These are things you put off as a long as you can because no matter what you calculate one repair will lead to another. Same with teeth, really.</p> <h2><strong>Cameron Ezzy, 25, Townsville</strong></h2> <p>Right now I\u2019m working at Dominos to support myself while I do a social work degree. I usually get $300 to $400 a week from Dominos, with Centrelink topping up my wage. Before the $750 stimulus, I was overcharging my bank account by $50. Usually we were just getting by, month-to-month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"11b48dce225af8aa8cd90ed593bd73feef75c220\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11b48dce225af8aa8cd90ed593bd73feef75c220/250_0_489_546/448.jpg\" alt=\"Cameron, 25, Townsville\" width=\"448\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cameron, 25, Townsville.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve got $300 in savings \u2013 not much for an emergency. It was tough even getting basics like veggies and fuel. I help my partner out as well. She struggles with her mental health and studies. I work so she can take care of herself.</p> <p>The payment was announced pretty much on my birthday, so it was happy birthday from the Australian government. The money\u2019ll basically mean we\u2019re buying time. One day me and my partner would like to get married, have kids. We\u2019re thinking about moving to Melbourne one day, but we have to sort out work first, finish the degrees. Right now though we\u2019re just trying to survive, so the money means we\u2019ll be able to do that. I\u2019ll be able to cover car registration. I\u2019ll be stocking up on food a little bit \u2013 we go to the Asian grocer because no one tends to buy from there because they\u2019re worried about getting the coronavirus from Asian people. Which is stupid. Migraine medication is not on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme so that\u2019s $50 every time, which will be easier to get now. What it means is time to study. Less time to work. Time to prepare to make a big change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/26/i-havent-left-my-building-life-gets-harder-for-vulnerable-australians-during-coronavirus-crisis\">'I haven't left my building': life gets harder for vulnerable Australians during coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Julie Wilson*, 54, Shoalhaven</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve variously been on what was called Newstart and the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme for nearly two years \u2013 I run an Airbnb, which gives me opportunities others don\u2019t have, though with the recent fires and now the pandemic, we\u2019re not getting any visitors.</p> <p>When I heard they were giving additional money, I was cynical. I was under the impression this money was only going to people who were laid off because of the virus. Change might be happening, but it\u2019s government isn\u2019t it? I did not trust that there would not be some loophole. I\u2019m still not sure if I qualify. I haven\u2019t heard from anyone directly, though I\u2019m not thinking about it. I\u2019m in survival mode.</p> <p>It would be great if it happens. It means I can pay my friend back the thousand dollars I borrowed when I needed it. Then there\u2019s the house \u2013 there\u2019s always something that needs repairing. I can plan and organise for my small business food van to get up and running again. It\u2019ll mean I can buy bulk ingredients and because of the pandemic and social distancing rules I will need to rethink how to operate. I plan to take orders and deliver orders directly to homes.</p> <p>My life could change, but realistically, I won\u2019t believe it until I see it. I try not to get my hopes up, because I can\u2019t risk feeling hopelessness.</p> <h2><strong>Imogen Bunting, 47, Brisbane</strong></h2> <p>I walked to work at my part-time job this morning. A middle-aged man on a bike yelled at me because I didn\u2019t have cigarettes for him. The cops were surprised when I told them I\u2019m homeless too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e1ca51534fdddd44eee77b11b7b5188448b2bce3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1ca51534fdddd44eee77b11b7b5188448b2bce3/0_0_960_1280/750.jpg\" alt=\"Imogen, 47, Brisbane, with her cat\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Imogen, 47, Brisbane, with her cat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m so close to living in my car again. I\u2019ve got a bed this week in a $50 apartment. It\u2019s just a bed and bath with no other facilities \u2013 not even garbage collection. No cooking or laundry. At least I can lock my door and not worry about creeps staring in my car window.</p> <p>The extra $550 a fortnight is a great relief, but it was luck the government decided to do this. I\u2019ve been kicked off the public housing list so maybe I\u2019ll use that money to get a pair of glasses so I can see and write my re-application and housing appeal? It\u2019s not enough to pay my car rego. Definitely a good pair of shoes ... some new clothes. A bit of dignity. Is that a luxury? I\u2019ll eat a little better, if I can have a fridge to store food in. My overall health will improve with the certainty of a good night\u2019s sleep. Without a home I can\u2019t get my cat back.</p> <p>When Covid-19 clears up, I\u2019ll get back to studying my law and criminology degree. Maybe the money will help. Though it\u2019s terrifying there is an end date \u2013 afterwards people are going to be shunted back to abject poverty. Me? Next week, it looks like I\u2019ll be couch surfing in Brisbane again, where my tribe is.</p> <h2><strong>Mandy Weber, 48, Bacchus Marsh</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019m a single mum with two kids and usually a full-time chef. The transition from the parenting payment to Newstart, back when my eldest was eight, was rough. We spent three months living in a car. Now I use it to top up my income, but I lost my job in the pandemic. I don\u2019t think that pub will open again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3963d232fe0e039dc8d0891024780419157cc4b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3963d232fe0e039dc8d0891024780419157cc4b9/0_0_3017_1810/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mandy, 48, from Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, with her two daughters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mandy, 48, from Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, with her two daughters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until they announced they were going to do the coronavirus supplement, I was honestly terrified. I didn\u2019t know what we were going to do for money. I was selling things to keep us going. Until it comes I\u2019ve only got $48 to survive on, and that\u2019s to feed my two girls. I did my grocery shopping this week on $19. Right now my bank balance is 42 cents. When the money does come through, I\u2019ll be replacing some of the stuff I sold.</p> <p>The main thing is to keep paying for my girls\u2019 education. I want them to have a better life than I had so I want to buy them a future. VET courses are $900 a year, combined. Then there\u2019s school books. E-books. Pens and pencils. School bags for when they go back. Uniforms. Their laptops were $1,000 each. Then there\u2019s the internet, which I have to have now at $90 a month. A printer.</p> <p>That supplement is going to make a huge difference to my household, being able to pay the rent, buy food. It\u2019s hope, but then there\u2019ll also be despair at the end. A bit of grief and loss. Because all of a sudden, in October, we\u2019ll go back to nothing again.</p> <p><em>As told to Royce Kurmelovs. The interviews have been edited for length and clarity</em></p> <p><em>*Name has been changed</em><br></p>",

The fortnightly $550 coronavirus supplement will throw a lifeline to many, boosting existing payments such as jobseeker to roughly $1,100 a fortnight, at least until October when it is set to expire. For those who were already reliant on social security payments such as the jobseeker payment, youth allowance, sickness allowance, Austudy, ABSTUDY and the parenting payment, this money represents the single largest lift to their living standards in more than two decades. Guardian Australia spoke to seven people to ask what the additional money will mean for them. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Wendy Morgan, 59, Adelaide On my current budget, because obviously we get paid fortnightly, there\u2019s only about $20 left for food after everything comes out. So my food budget means I have to ration myself to eating every second day. Sometimes I\u2019ll go as long as four or five days without eating. I\u2019m very, very much looking forward to the supplement because it means for the first time in a long time I\u2019ll be able to buy fresh vegies, fresh fruit. It also means so much more. I haven\u2019t bought my daughter a birthday present since 2012. She\u2019ll be 33 in June. I\u2019ll be 59. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll buy her some art supplies \u2013 she\u2019s very artistic. She only uses the cheap stuff to experiment, but when she makes something she wants to sell, she uses the expensive stuff. As for me, there are all sorts of things I used to do that I\u2019ve forgotten because I can\u2019t afford to do them. I used to knit and crochet, but wool is expensive if you want to make anything like a jumper. I even used to dragon boat race. It\u2019s the only sport I\u2019ve loved and used to train three times a week when I had a job. I even competed nationally. Got medals and everything. But the membership costs money I didn\u2019t have, so I stopped. Avery Howard, 18, Sydney I\u2019ve been on the full independent youth allowance payment since I was 16 and became homeless. At the moment, the payment is $100 less than jobseeker, which is based on a highly outdated notion that young people are supported by their family. When the initial $750 stimulus pay came through, I used it to pay off some bills and buy some groceries. It was hard to find some things because of all the panic buying, but I was able to buy fresh food like mince and put that in the freezer, which I haven\u2019t been able to do until recently. Beforehand, skipping meals was definitely something I had to do. I still do it, but it\u2019s less of a necessity. I\u2019ve just gotten used to not eating as much. The $550 fortnightly supplement basically means I can breathe easier. It means I won\u2019t be so stressed about managing every cent like I\u2019m used to. I can use it to pay off an Afterpay bill from when I replaced my jeans and shirts that had been worn past repair. Longer term, I\u2019d like to save for a better computer as my current laptop was given to me by my school years ago, and has been put through the wringer. In the very long term, I\u2019d like to save some money to visit my partner who lives in the US. That\u2019s quite expensive, so I\u2019ll hope to squirrel away some money to get me there someday. Jessica Harrison, 65, Wonthaggi I\u2019ve worked part time and lived on what used to be called Newstart for around ten years. I live in a small town where there\u2019s limited chance for any kind of full-time occupation, any type of full-time paid work and because I\u2019m 65 it\u2019s hard to find a job at that age. I\u2019m lucky though, Wonthaggi is a beautiful place and I have lots of friends who help take care of each other. It\u2019s still tough at times. You get that sort of knot in the stomach when you think you\u2019ve spent too much on food that week. I suppose that big change with that temporary increase is what will lessen that feeling. The moment I heard about the supplement payment, I immediately started to mentally budget on what I could spend it on. It was instant. The first thing I am going to buy is some cream cheese, some crusty bread and one of those packets of smoked salmon. That\u2019s the luxury food that you don\u2019t buy at all when you\u2019re on that tiny amount. After that are the big things like house repairs and saving for dental work. The stuff on the house you just put off for a long time. There is a leak at the back of my toilet which I\u2019m going to be getting fixed. And my chimney is pretty rusted. Get my car serviced. These are things you put off as a long as you can because no matter what you calculate one repair will lead to another. Same with teeth, really. Cameron Ezzy, 25, Townsville Right now I\u2019m working at Dominos to support myself while I do a social work degree. I usually get $300 to $400 a week from Dominos, with Centrelink topping up my wage. Before the $750 stimulus, I was overcharging my bank account by $50. Usually we were just getting by, month-to-month. I\u2019ve got $300 in savings \u2013 not much for an emergency. It was tough even getting basics like veggies and fuel. I help my partner out as well. She struggles with her mental health and studies. I work so she can take care of herself. The payment was announced pretty much on my birthday, so it was happy birthday from the Australian government. The money\u2019ll basically mean we\u2019re buying time. One day me and my partner would like to get married, have kids. We\u2019re thinking about moving to Melbourne one day, but we have to sort out work first, finish the degrees. Right now though we\u2019re just trying to survive, so the money means we\u2019ll be able to do that. I\u2019ll be able to cover car registration. I\u2019ll be stocking up on food a little bit \u2013 we go to the Asian grocer because no one tends to buy from there because they\u2019re worried about getting the coronavirus from Asian people. Which is stupid. Migraine medication is not on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme so that\u2019s $50 every time, which will be easier to get now. What it means is time to study. Less time to work. Time to prepare to make a big change. Julie Wilson*, 54, Shoalhaven I\u2019ve variously been on what was called Newstart and the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme for nearly two years \u2013 I run an Airbnb, which gives me opportunities others don\u2019t have, though with the recent fires and now the pandemic, we\u2019re not getting any visitors. When I heard they were giving additional money, I was cynical. I was under the impression this money was only going to people who were laid off because of the virus. Change might be happening, but it\u2019s government isn\u2019t it? I did not trust that there would not be some loophole. I\u2019m still not sure if I qualify. I haven\u2019t heard from anyone directly, though I\u2019m not thinking about it. I\u2019m in survival mode. It would be great if it happens. It means I can pay my friend back the thousand dollars I borrowed when I needed it. Then there\u2019s the house \u2013 there\u2019s always something that needs repairing. I can plan and organise for my small business food van to get up and running again. It\u2019ll mean I can buy bulk ingredients and because of the pandemic and social distancing rules I will need to rethink how to operate. I plan to take orders and deliver orders directly to homes. My life could change, but realistically, I won\u2019t believe it until I see it. I try not to get my hopes up, because I can\u2019t risk feeling hopelessness. Imogen Bunting, 47, Brisbane I walked to work at my part-time job this morning. A middle-aged man on a bike yelled at me because I didn\u2019t have cigarettes for him. The cops were surprised when I told them I\u2019m homeless too. I\u2019m so close to living in my car again. I\u2019ve got a bed this week in a $50 apartment. It\u2019s just a bed and bath with no other facilities \u2013 not even garbage collection. No cooking or laundry. At least I can lock my door and not worry about creeps staring in my car window. The extra $550 a fortnight is a great relief, but it was luck the government decided to do this. I\u2019ve been kicked off the public housing list so maybe I\u2019ll use that money to get a pair of glasses so I can see and write my re-application and housing appeal? It\u2019s not enough to pay my car rego. Definitely a good pair of shoes ... some new clothes. A bit of dignity. Is that a luxury? I\u2019ll eat a little better, if I can have a fridge to store food in. My overall health will improve with the certainty of a good night\u2019s sleep. Without a home I can\u2019t get my cat back. When Covid-19 clears up, I\u2019ll get back to studying my law and criminology degree. Maybe the money will help. Though it\u2019s terrifying there is an end date \u2013 afterwards people are going to be shunted back to abject poverty. Me? Next week, it looks like I\u2019ll be couch surfing in Brisbane again, where my tribe is. Mandy Weber, 48, Bacchus Marsh I\u2019m a single mum with two kids and usually a full-time chef. The transition from the parenting payment to Newstart, back when my eldest was eight, was rough. We spent three months living in a car. Now I use it to top up my income, but I lost my job in the pandemic. I don\u2019t think that pub will open again. Until they announced they were going to do the coronavirus supplement, I was honestly terrified. I didn\u2019t know what we were going to do for money. I was selling things to keep us going. Until it comes I\u2019ve only got $48 to survive on, and that\u2019s to feed my two girls. I did my grocery shopping this week on $19. Right now my bank balance is 42 cents. When the money does come through, I\u2019ll be replacing some of the stuff I sold. The main thing is to keep paying for my girls\u2019 education. I want them to have a better life than I had so I want to buy them a future. VET courses are $900 a year, combined. Then there\u2019s school books. E-books. Pens and pencils. School bags for when they go back. Uniforms. Their laptops were $1,000 each. Then there\u2019s the internet, which I have to have now at $90 a month. A printer. That supplement is going to make a huge difference to my household, being able to pay the rent, buy food. It\u2019s hope, but then there\u2019ll also be despair at the end. A bit of grief and loss. Because all of a sudden, in October, we\u2019ll go back to nothing again. As told to Royce Kurmelovs. The interviews have been edited for length and clarity *Name has been changed",

As human time and geological time collapse into one another, the deep past is erupting into the present all around us with terrifying and uncanny consequences. What was fixed is now in flux, what was settled is being swept away faster than we can save it. Nor is it just the past that has become unstable. The climate emergency is unsettling our future as well, erasing what we thought was certain, what we thought we knew.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At what point does hope become just another form of denial? How are we to live in such a world?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For many people this process became suddenly tangible last summer when fires devastated south-eastern Australia. Over weeks and months we watched helplessly as the conflagration consumed lives, livelihoods, even entire ecosystems, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/11/terror-hope-anger-kindness-the-complexity-of-life-as-we-face-the-new-normal\">images that seemed wrenched from a dystopian future flickered across our screens</a>. In the months since, those images have been superseded by the spreading catastrophe of coronavirus, a moment of discontinuity that has only reinforced the vulnerability of our society, the speed with which natural forces can overwhelm the structures that sustain and shape our world.</p> <p>Part of the job of any art is what the cultural theorist Donna Haraway calls staying with the trouble. Art exists to record how it feels to be alive here, now, to capture the confusing, conflicting, sometimes terrifying, sometimes joyous messiness of the moment. It exists to bear witness. But art also needs to do more than just capture the here and now. We need it to help us see beyond the immediate, to understand how our stories connect to those of other people, in other times, to help us recognise we are part of a larger story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e28ed1b8027eef572344d0109b6c09880c5a74f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e28ed1b8027eef572344d0109b6c09880c5a74f/0_0_3000_1925/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An old chair sticks out of the mud on the shore line of Lake Eucumbene at Old Adaminaby, a town that was flooded as part of the Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric scheme in 1956.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An old chair sticks out of the mud on the shore line of Lake Eucumbene at Old Adaminaby in 2007, a town that was flooded as part of the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric scheme in 1956.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Nolan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A desire to give shape to some of these connections drove my 2015 novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/14/clade-by-james-bradley-review\">Clade</a>, which traced the experiences of three generations of a family as their world was transformed by climate catastrophe. When I was writing Clade it still seemed possible we might avoid the worst effects of global heating. But in the years since finishing it that hope has become harder and harder to sustain. Every day brings new stories of loss and extinction, every day our world seems to grow more violent, more deranged. Every day the spectre of collapse seems closer at hand.</p> <p>Faced with this reality I began to ask a series of slightly different questions, questions about inevitability and the new reality we inhabit. At what point, I wondered, does what we are losing become unbearable? At what point does hope become just another form of denial? How are we to live in such a world?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Environmental crisis and climate catastrophe collapse distance and time, bringing the deep past rushing into the present</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My new novel, Ghost Species, seeks to explore these questions by asking what it would mean if the deep past were to come to life in a literal sense, through a scheme to recreate a Neanderthal child from remnant DNA. Although this idea might seem pure science fiction, it isn\u2019t, or isn\u2019t quite. Many scientists believe cloning may offer a way to de-extinct species wiped out by human activity. Here in Australia researchers have already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/11/thylacine-dna-reveals-weakness-kangaroo-tasmanian-tiger-genome\">laid many of the building blocks to resurrect the thylacine</a>, while in Russia scientists in Siberia are working on a scheme to hold back the collapse of the permafrost by<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/pleistocene-park/517779/\"> recreating the ecology that existed in the region 12,000 years ago</a>, complete with woolly mammoths.</p> <p>It seemed to me this technology and its possibilities offered a way of thinking through not just the idea that the world might have become unhinged, that time might be out of joint, but also the processes of grief and mourning so many of us are grappling with. What is it we are losing when a species or an ecosystem vanishes from the world? What it is we think we are bringing back if we recreate them? What would it be like to <em>be</em> such a being?</p> <p>As the story and characters took shape, I found myself asking other questions. Questions about the super-rich and their planning for the end of the world. Questions about love and loss and the bond between the child and her adoptive mother. Questions about the boundary between human and the non-human.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/26/job-losses-cancelled-tours-delayed-releases-the-australian-books-industry-grapples-with-huge-shock\">Job losses, cancelled tours, delayed releases: the Australian books industry grapples with 'huge shock'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Along the way I began to write differently as well. Environmental crisis and climate catastrophe collapse distance and time, bringing the deep past rushing into the present and the distant to our doorstep. Approaching them in fiction brought the boundary between fiction and real life crashing down as well, until finally it seemed I was processing my own fears and feelings directly into fiction, resulting in a book that was often frighteningly personal.</p> <p>Yet most of all, I found myself having to confront a series of questions about the fragility of the structures that shape our world, the onrushing cost of climate catastrophe, and how we are to live in a world in which our most basic assumptions are collapsing.</p> <p>I began writing Ghost Species just after <a href=\"https://sydneyreviewofbooks.com/essay/an-ocean-and-an-instant/\">my father\u2019s death</a>. It will be published a few weeks after <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/australia-says-farewell-he-policy-powerhouse\">my mother\u2019s</a>. It was edited while bushfires raged up and down Australia\u2019s east coast, in a city thick with smoke and grief, and will be published in a world paralysed by a pandemic. Perhaps unsurprisingly therefore, it is a book that is, in many ways, defined and suffused by the sense of loss so many of us feel at the moment. But it is also a book that seeks to remind us that even out of the most seismic loss and grief, new configurations are always possible.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.penguin.com.au/books/ghost-species-9781926428666\">Ghost Species by James Bradley is out on 28 April 2020 through Hamish Hamilton</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "In 2015, flooding exposed the frozen bodies of two cave lion cubs in the Yakutia region of Russia. Members of a species that vanished at the end of the last Ice Age, the pair were buried approximately 12,000 years ago when the roof of their den collapsed and trapped them in the frozen ground. In photos, their faces are so well-preserved one might almost believe they are only sleeping. Yet despite their unusually perfect condition, the cubs are not the only such relics to have appeared in recent years. Throughout the Arctic and subarctic, animals and artefacts buried for thousands of years are reappearing, liberated from their frozen graves by the rapid warming in the region. In the Alps and elsewhere, bodies of people lost for decades in the mountains are emerging from the ice as glaciers melt. In Australia, towns submerged for generations are resurfacing as dam levels fall due to drought and heat. As British author Robert Macfarlane has observed, these uncanny emergences or \u201cAnthropocene unburials\u201d are part of a larger process of unsettlement and unhinging. As human time and geological time collapse into one another, the deep past is erupting into the present all around us with terrifying and uncanny consequences. What was fixed is now in flux, what was settled is being swept away faster than we can save it. Nor is it just the past that has become unstable. The climate emergency is unsettling our future as well, erasing what we thought was certain, what we thought we knew. For many people this process became suddenly tangible last summer when fires devastated south-eastern Australia. Over weeks and months we watched helplessly as the conflagration consumed lives, livelihoods, even entire ecosystems, while images that seemed wrenched from a dystopian future flickered across our screens. In the months since, those images have been superseded by the spreading catastrophe of coronavirus, a moment of discontinuity that has only reinforced the vulnerability of our society, the speed with which natural forces can overwhelm the structures that sustain and shape our world. Part of the job of any art is what the cultural theorist Donna Haraway calls staying with the trouble. Art exists to record how it feels to be alive here, now, to capture the confusing, conflicting, sometimes terrifying, sometimes joyous messiness of the moment. It exists to bear witness. But art also needs to do more than just capture the here and now. We need it to help us see beyond the immediate, to understand how our stories connect to those of other people, in other times, to help us recognise we are part of a larger story. A desire to give shape to some of these connections drove my 2015 novel, Clade, which traced the experiences of three generations of a family as their world was transformed by climate catastrophe. When I was writing Clade it still seemed possible we might avoid the worst effects of global heating. But in the years since finishing it that hope has become harder and harder to sustain. Every day brings new stories of loss and extinction, every day our world seems to grow more violent, more deranged. Every day the spectre of collapse seems closer at hand. Faced with this reality I began to ask a series of slightly different questions, questions about inevitability and the new reality we inhabit. At what point, I wondered, does what we are losing become unbearable? At what point does hope become just another form of denial? How are we to live in such a world? My new novel, Ghost Species, seeks to explore these questions by asking what it would mean if the deep past were to come to life in a literal sense, through a scheme to recreate a Neanderthal child from remnant DNA. Although this idea might seem pure science fiction, it isn\u2019t, or isn\u2019t quite. Many scientists believe cloning may offer a way to de-extinct species wiped out by human activity. Here in Australia researchers have already laid many of the building blocks to resurrect the thylacine, while in Russia scientists in Siberia are working on a scheme to hold back the collapse of the permafrost by recreating the ecology that existed in the region 12,000 years ago, complete with woolly mammoths. It seemed to me this technology and its possibilities offered a way of thinking through not just the idea that the world might have become unhinged, that time might be out of joint, but also the processes of grief and mourning so many of us are grappling with. What is it we are losing when a species or an ecosystem vanishes from the world? What it is we think we are bringing back if we recreate them? What would it be like to be such a being? As the story and characters took shape, I found myself asking other questions. Questions about the super-rich and their planning for the end of the world. Questions about love and loss and the bond between the child and her adoptive mother. Questions about the boundary between human and the non-human. Along the way I began to write differently as well. Environmental crisis and climate catastrophe collapse distance and time, bringing the deep past rushing into the present and the distant to our doorstep. Approaching them in fiction brought the boundary between fiction and real life crashing down as well, until finally it seemed I was processing my own fears and feelings directly into fiction, resulting in a book that was often frighteningly personal. Yet most of all, I found myself having to confront a series of questions about the fragility of the structures that shape our world, the onrushing cost of climate catastrophe, and how we are to live in a world in which our most basic assumptions are collapsing. I began writing Ghost Species just after my father\u2019s death. It will be published a few weeks after my mother\u2019s. It was edited while bushfires raged up and down Australia\u2019s east coast, in a city thick with smoke and grief, and will be published in a world paralysed by a pandemic. Perhaps unsurprisingly therefore, it is a book that is, in many ways, defined and suffused by the sense of loss so many of us feel at the moment. But it is also a book that seeks to remind us that even out of the most seismic loss and grief, new configurations are always possible. \u2022 Ghost Species by James Bradley is out on 28 April 2020 through Hamish Hamilton",

      "bodyText": "Health authorities have launched an investigation into an Australian company\u2019s attempts to sell large quantities of unsanctioned coronavirus test kits, after it falsely claimed its tests had been approved by medical regulators. Promedical Equipment Pty Ltd, a company that sells cryogenic treatment and erectile dysfunction machines, made headlines last month when it announced it had \u201cobtained TGA go-ahead\u201d to supply 5m rapid Covid-19 antibody test kits to Australian hospitals and labs every week. Its chief executive Neran de Silva \u2013 a convicted rapist and former business associate of the government services minister, Stuart Robert \u2013 was quoted in the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail, and his representatives appeared on the Today Show and Paul Murray Live, where the development was described as an \u201camazing piece of news\u201d. \u201cThe rapid test kit provides immediate peace of mind for health and medical staff who are exposed to Covid-19 daily,\u201d De Silva said. \u201cThey can be tested and back at work within 15 minutes, freeing up valuable treatment time.\u201d But Guardian Australia can reveal Promedical is now the subject of an investigation by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and has been disowned by the Chinese manufacturer of a TGA-approved test. It has also been enveloped in a separate US securities scandal after a Nasdaq-listed supply chain business was placed in a trading halt related to announcements it had struck a $805m deal to onsell 46m of the tests. The Wondfo deal Promedical\u2019s bold claims of bringing 5m tests to Australia per week were, initially at least, based on a distribution agreement with a relatively well-known Chinese manufacturer, Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech. On 20 March, the TGA gave Promedical an approval that allowed it to supply Wondfo-manufactured tests in Australia, but no others. Promedical, though, told Guardian Australia it \u201cdidn\u2019t proceed\u201d with its agreement with Wondfo. It did confirm, however, that it ordered a batch of unapproved tests, from an unknown supplier, which was delivered to its Brisbane warehouse on 22 March. Promedical has repeatedly refused to say who manufactured the tests it is now marketing. Guardian Australia understands that soon after becoming aware Promedical was promoting a different test, Wondfo rescinded its relationship with the Australian company. It released a statement saying: \u201cWe hereby clarify that now Promedical Equipment Pty Ltd is NOT an authorised representative nor distributor of [Wondfo] in Australia, America, and any other countries/districts,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe recommend purchasing products only from authorised distributors or dealers, which will increase the likelihood that you will receive authentic products. [Wondfo] is not responsible for any product complaints arising from products purchased from Promedical Equipment Pty Ltd.\u201d In early April, the TGA revoked Promedical\u2019s approval to supply Covid-19 test kits, at the company\u2019s own request. The US Food and Drug Administration also removed Promedical\u2019s name from its list of test providers. Despite no longer having TGA approval to supply test kits in Australia, Promedical has since continued to market test kits in Australia and overseas, including publishing claims it has \u201cAustralia\u2019s first approved and certified rapid test kit\u201d. After being approached by Guardian Australia last week, some references to having Australian and US approval were removed from its websites. But, at the time of publication, the Promedical website was still claiming the company had TGA approval for its test. \u201cPromedical\u2019s Covid-19 Rapid Test Kit is an Australia-first professional medical testing kit that can detect the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies in human blood,\u201d the website said. \u201cThe Covid-19 Rapid Test Kit is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), which means the clinical kit is safe for use by the Australian public.\u201d Promedical also issued a press release on 1 April claiming it had TGA approval, which included images of a test kit. It also supplied media outlets with the images. At that stage, it had TGA approval to supply the Wondfo product only. But the company confirmed it never proceeded with the Wondfo deal, and the pictured test kit looks similar to the non-Wondfo product delivered to its Brisbane warehouse on 22 March, according to video obtained by Guardian Australia. Trading halt on US shares On 10 April the Nasdaq-listed US supply chain and logistics company SCWorx filed documents with the US Securities and Exchange Commission claiming it had entered into a \u201csupply agreement\u201d with Promedical for the purchase of 52m of its test kits. On 13 April, SCWorx\u2019s share price increased more than 500%. A Promedical spokesperson said: \u201c[The company] had initial discussions with SCWorx in the US, and supplied an invoice, but an order was never placed, nor was payment ever made\u201d. \u201cSCWorx has not been approved to use the Promedical brand, or promote the Promedical branded [test] via their website.\u201d On 15 April, the chief executive and chairman of SCWorx, Marc Schessel, told investors on a conference call he had chosen the supplier because the product was not manufactured in China or South Korea and that the manufacturer \u201chad the proper FDA authorisations\u201d. Two days later Schessel released a statement confirming the deal would involve the supply of 2m test kits per week for 23 weeks, which would be onsold to another company, Rethink My Healthcare, for $35m per week. The statement contained links to Promedical\u2019s website. Last week the SEC placed a trading halt on SCWorx citing \u201cconcerns regarding the adequacy and accuracy\u201d of statements regarding the deal. Two law firms have announced investigations into SCWorx on behalf of shareholders following a report by Hindenburg Research, which first detailed the events. De Silva in the public eye It\u2019s not the first time De Silva has come to public attention. In 2018, he was convicted of rape for sexually assaulting an adult dancer who had been sleeping on the couch of a mutual friend\u2019s house in the Brisbane suburb of Fortitude Valley in 2016. Two months after his conviction, then-backbencher Stuart Robert joined De Silva\u2019s cryogenic treatment company, Cryo Australia, as a director. Robert said De Silva had said nothing of the criminal case. In the subsequent liquidation of Cryo Australia, Robert and his business partner stood to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars from their ill-fated investment. De Silva appealed his conviction all the way to the high court, but lost. Promedical\u2019s corporate head office is listed at the same address as Cryo Australia\u2019s former Brisbane headquarters. Its two shares were purchased for $2 by De Silva\u2019s partner, Cassandra Auty. Guardian Australia visited the office on Thursday and found it under renovation, with construction workers gutting the interior. A \u201cCryo Australia\u201d sign was still on display outside. Promedical\u2019s response Responding to questions, Promedical released a statement that said it had \u201cpartnered with another Australian company to manufacture the [test kits] under the Promedical brand name\u201d. It confirmed it received a \u201csmall batch delivery\u201d from the supplier on 22 March. When asked to identify who was making the kits, Promedical said it \u201cdid not wish to disclose the name of the new supplier\u201d until TGA approval had been obtained. \u201cPromedical\u2019s \u2026 rapid test kit is the same initial response test that has been successfully and effectively used by medical teams throughout Asian countries hard-hit by the Covid-19 virus since the beginning of 2020,\u201d the company said. \u201cA new TGA application is currently awaiting upload to the TGA system. This is the same case with the FDA in the US. \u201cPromedical is not aware of any investigations relating to the company, involving the TGA.\u201d A TGA spokesman said it could not comment on applications that might have been lodged, but confirmed an investigation was under way into Promedical. \u201cThe investigation into Promedical Equipment Pty Ltd relates to Covid-19 rapid test kits. Promedical Equipment Pty Ltd is not currently approved by the TGA to supply Covid-19 test kits in Australia.\u201d In response to suggestions it wrongly claimed to have approvals, and that its marketing materials clearly linked the initial Wondfo approval to its new product, the company said: \u201cPromedical is not claiming that its current Covid-19 [test], from its new supplier, is TGA or FDA approved. All references to TGA approvals related to its past agreement with Wondfo, which has since ended along with all marketing of the product.\u201d \u201cPromedical have not, and do not, advertise they have FDA approval.\u201d At the time Promedical made the above comment it was still advertising its tests as \u201cFDA approved\u201d on an official export site. The company has pointed out it holds a valid TGA permit to export the tests. After being contacted by Guardian Australia, Promedical has removed claims that it had various approvals from its websites. Peter Collignon, an infection diseases expert with the Australian National University, said that while accurate rapid antibody tests were crucial in the fight against the pandemic, allowing unknown or inaccurate testing on to the market was extremely dangerous. Australian regulators needed to do more to place suppliers of testing kits under intense scrutiny, he said. \u201cThe trouble is that this is an emergency \u2026 we can\u2019t do things on the normal slow bureaucratic process, I fully accept that,\u201d Collignon said. \u201cBut equally we have to have a set of minimum of standards that they accept for both drugs and antibody tests. The post-marketing surveillance has to be more intense than normal because we need to rapidly remove these tests if they\u2019re not up to scratch.\u201d",

The app is designed to help medical workers and state governments trace close contacts of Covid-19 patients. Australia has been one of the most successful countries in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, recording just 83 deaths and 6,700 cases, due to border closures, movement restrictions and a stay-at-home policy.

Both are key elements of the full PPE NHS staff are advised to wear when participating in an AGP, such as a patient being intubated before being ventilated.</p> \n<p>A survey undertaken by the college, to which 2,129 hospital doctors responded last week, found medics are finding it harder generally access to any sort of PPE. Just over a quarter (27%) said they could not get the kit they needed to keep them safe while treating people with Covid-19, up from 22% who said the same when the RCP conducted the same survey at the start of April.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"134c6037-2f86-41ab-a672-1986189fb60e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/closed-borders-and-black-weddings-what-the-1918-flu-teaches-us-about-coronavirus\">1918 influenza pandemic</a>&nbsp;that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/singapore-coronavirus-increase-revives-fears-of-post-lockdown-surge\">resurgence in infections</a>&nbsp;despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.</p>\n    <p>Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">cramped dormitory accommodation</a>&nbsp;used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.</p>\n    <p>Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are experts worried about?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted.

The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re living through the darkest times the NHS has ever faced and this survey shows the reality of the situation facing hospital doctors at the moment\u201d, said Prof Andrew Goddard, the college\u2019s president.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe lack of PPE remains their biggest concern and it is truly terrible that supply has worsened over the past three weeks rather than improved.\u201d</p> \n<p>In remarks that lay bare leading doctors\u2019 frustration with ministers\u2019 repeated emphasis on the hugely increased amounts of PPE that have reached the frontline in recent weeks, Goddard added: \u201cHealthcare workers couldn\u2019t care less how many billion pieces of PPE have been ordered or supplied.

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people.

      "bodyText": "Doctors working in the riskiest areas of the UK\u2019s hospitals with Covid-19 patients are finding it harder to get protective kit, despite ministerial pledges to solve the problem, research reveals. The Royal College of Physicians has condemned the apparently worsening availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) as \u201ctruly terrible\u201d and warned that frontline staff\u2019s lives are at risk as a result. Among doctors performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGP), in which patients with the disease release droplets from their mouth, 37% cannot always access a visor to wear while 31% have not been able to obtain a full-length surgical gown. Both are key elements of the full PPE NHS staff are advised to wear when participating in an AGP, such as a patient being intubated before being ventilated. A survey undertaken by the college, to which 2,129 hospital doctors responded last week, found medics are finding it harder generally access to any sort of PPE. Just over a quarter (27%) said they could not get the kit they needed to keep them safe while treating people with Covid-19, up from 22% who said the same when the RCP conducted the same survey at the start of April. \u201cWe\u2019re living through the darkest times the NHS has ever faced and this survey shows the reality of the situation facing hospital doctors at the moment\u201d, said Prof Andrew Goddard, the college\u2019s president. \u201cThe lack of PPE remains their biggest concern and it is truly terrible that supply has worsened over the past three weeks rather than improved.\u201d In remarks that lay bare leading doctors\u2019 frustration with ministers\u2019 repeated emphasis on the hugely increased amounts of PPE that have reached the frontline in recent weeks, Goddard added: \u201cHealthcare workers couldn\u2019t care less how many billion pieces of PPE have been ordered or supplied. If it isn\u2019t there when they need it, they are in harm\u2019s way.\u201d Dr Matthew Roycroft, the joint chair of the RCP\u2019s trainees committee, hinted that some doctors may decide to withhold treatment amid the PPE shortage. \u201cWithout the right PPE my colleagues and I may find ourselves with the most awful of conundrums on our hands \u2013 having to choose between protecting our own lives or protecting those of the patients we treat.\u201d Hospital bosses said the college\u2019s findings underlined the need for any future inquiry into the UK\u2019s handling of the pandemic to include the action taken on PPE. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health service trusts in England, said: \u201cTrust leaders have told us that, in general, after a difficult start, with the exception of visors and gowns, they now have the PPE they need. \u201cIt will be important \u2013 when the time comes for a public inquiry \u2013 to examine why the pandemic stockpile was not configured for an epidemic like the one we face today and didn\u2019t have enough gowns and visors.\u201d Niall Dickson, his counterpart at the NHS Confederation, said that while the self-selecting nature of the survey meant its findings should be treated with caution, shortages were continuing in some areas, though overall the picture is improving. Priority should now be given to getting PPE to GP surgeries, care homes and community-based health services, Dickson added. Meanwhile, 61% of family doctors are no longer seeing a patient unless they have adequate PPE, according to a separate survey, of 675 self-selecting Gps by the medical website Pulse, while 74% said they fear for their health and their life, it emerged. Although many GP appointments are now being conducted by telephone or video link, some patients are still coming into surgeries for a face-to-face consultation. Many GPs have trouble getting hold of face masks, visors or goggles and gowns. Only a third said they had enough masks, for example. Pulse also found that among GPs who responded: 52% feel unsafe because of PPE shortages. 26% have seen Covid-positive patients without proper PPE. One in five GPs have had Covid-19 or assume they have. The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cWe are working night and day to ensure our frontline health and social care staff have the equipment they need to tackle this virus, and have delivered over a billion items of PPE since the outbreak began. \u201cLord [Paul] Deighton is leading the national effort to increase domestic production scaling up existing manufacturing whilst tapping into new resources. In addition, there is a significant international strategy to ensure that we have the PPE we need.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Lucy Jameson is facing a conundrum as she advises cautious customers of her advertising agency: when are companies allowed to make jokes about the pandemic-induced lockdown?</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty soon,\u201d said Jameson, a co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.uncommon.london/\">Uncommon</a>, reflecting on how advertisers are having to juggle the severity of the situation with the emotions of an audience who face being stuck at home for months. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do it cleverly. There are still lots of people dying, but people are desperate for a bit of light relief. It\u2019s about striking the balance right.\u201d</p> <p>Advertisers are struggling to work out how to promote their products during an age of physical distancing, walking the tightrope between continuing to sell goods where possible, building their brands, and trying not to look insensitive.</p> <p>Already there are a few basic rules of thumb that are changing how advertising looks. Footage of people socialising outside the home is out, as it may look jarring to audiences in lockdown; adverts that resemble Zoom calls are in, but may already be a cliche; and everyone\u2019s trying to work out how to create new promotions without being allowed outside.</p> <p>\u201cThe number one thing advertisers are worried about is getting the right tone,\u201d said Kelly Williams, ITV\u2019s commercial boss. \u201cPeople will remember how you behave during the crisis. We\u2019re finding advertisers who can\u2019t trade still looking to spend some money to keep their voice.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/17/how-covid-19-turned-the-uk-news-and-entertainment-industry-upside-down\">advertising market has collapsed</a>, in step with much of the rest of the economy, threatening the funding for vast swathes of the media. Many major advertisers such as high-street retailers and holiday companies have cancelled their campaigns altogether as they have nothing to sell. This means that even though TV audiences have soared, revenue for commercial broadcasters has collapsed by up to 50%, and some other forms of advertising are performing even worse.</p> <p>\u201cTelevision advertising over the next couple of months will be as cheap as it ever has been,\u201d said Williams, who said he had seen signs that some companies were starting to spend again. Until then, he said, audiences should to expect to see the same adverts more often, especially promotions for telecoms, charities, groceries and online shopping.</p> <p>Necessity has forced innovation, with ITV producing more material in-house and companies turning promotions on their heads. \u201cSome advertisers are having to edit what they\u2019ve got. McCain have got this lovely family campaign narrated by Ricky Tomlinson. They kept the same ad but got Ricky Tomlinson to change the voiceover.\u201d</p> <p>The Co-op cancelled its Easter TV advertising campaign, which was originally promoting chocolate eggs, and donated millions of pounds of airtime to run an advert featuring supermarket staff urging people to support the food charity FareShare.</p> <p>Cathedral City <a href=\"https://www.lbbonline.com/news/theres-nothing-like-being-at-home-with-cheese-in-cathedral-citys-latest-ad\">created a</a><a href=\"https://www.lbbonline.com/news/theres-nothing-like-being-at-home-with-cheese-in-cathedral-citys-latest-ad\">n advert</a> about the joys of sitting at home with a cheese toastie by splicing together footage from old adverts and putting a new soundtrack over the top. Tesco promoted its Easter food sales by showing a <a href=\"https://www.marketingweek.com/tesco-food-love-stories-coronavirus/\">video of a family holding a video conference</a> to discuss how best to cook lamb.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3zI7T54L8k\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h3zI7T54L8k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Jameson said many big-budget campaigns had been scrapped and her team were desperately trying to think of formats that could be produced in lockdown, with drone footage of empty streets suddenly popular. She predicted that television screens and online video services would soon be filled with adverts produced using animation, which can be produced remotely.</p> <p>\u201cAdvertisers who just running pre-corona stuff looks really weird,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see ads for beer, which of course people are still going to want to drink, but somehow it just feels odd to see people in a pub at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Many companies have taken it upon themselves to promote stay-at-home messages, although there is a risk that people are baffled when companies that normally sell them beer or clothes start telling them how to stay safe in a pandemic.</p> <p>With ad spending collapsing, the government has stepped into the void with its big-budget national public health campaign, which has become ubiquitous \u2013 especially on news websites.</p> <p>\u201cYou need a short, informative message to get the public\u2019s attention, certainly to resonate with younger audiences today,\u201d said Jeremy Hine, the chief executive of MullenLowe Group UK, which has created the campaign. \u201c\u2018Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives\u2019 is like a wartime version.\u201d</p> <p>Following the prime minister\u2019s calls to evoke a blitz spirit, the campaign has been designed to evoke the spirit of the second world war, when the public were told that \u201ccoughs and sneezes cause diseases\u201d and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/20/how-we-made-keep-calm-and-carry-on-poster\">never released</a> \u201cKeep calm and carry on\u201d poster was created.</p> <p>However, Hine said brands should leave the evocation of war to the government and instead focus on reassuring the public with their advertising messages.</p> <p>\u201cBeing Churchillian is fine for politicians \u2013 a rallying cry to lead and set policy, it makes for a powerful, engaging ad campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that approach is less meaningful for a brand. Advertisers that are doing it well out there are those like McCain\u2019s \u2018staying at home\u2019 work, or PG Tips with the idea of sharing a cup of tea over Skype. They are putting an arm around you.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Lucy Jameson is facing a conundrum as she advises cautious customers of her advertising agency: when are companies allowed to make jokes about the pandemic-induced lockdown? \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty soon,\u201d said Jameson, a co-founder of Uncommon, reflecting on how advertisers are having to juggle the severity of the situation with the emotions of an audience who face being stuck at home for months. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do it cleverly. There are still lots of people dying, but people are desperate for a bit of light relief. It\u2019s about striking the balance right.\u201d Advertisers are struggling to work out how to promote their products during an age of physical distancing, walking the tightrope between continuing to sell goods where possible, building their brands, and trying not to look insensitive. Already there are a few basic rules of thumb that are changing how advertising looks. Footage of people socialising outside the home is out, as it may look jarring to audiences in lockdown; adverts that resemble Zoom calls are in, but may already be a cliche; and everyone\u2019s trying to work out how to create new promotions without being allowed outside. \u201cThe number one thing advertisers are worried about is getting the right tone,\u201d said Kelly Williams, ITV\u2019s commercial boss. \u201cPeople will remember how you behave during the crisis. We\u2019re finding advertisers who can\u2019t trade still looking to spend some money to keep their voice.\u201d The advertising market has collapsed, in step with much of the rest of the economy, threatening the funding for vast swathes of the media. Many major advertisers such as high-street retailers and holiday companies have cancelled their campaigns altogether as they have nothing to sell. This means that even though TV audiences have soared, revenue for commercial broadcasters has collapsed by up to 50%, and some other forms of advertising are performing even worse. \u201cTelevision advertising over the next couple of months will be as cheap as it ever has been,\u201d said Williams, who said he had seen signs that some companies were starting to spend again. Until then, he said, audiences should to expect to see the same adverts more often, especially promotions for telecoms, charities, groceries and online shopping. Necessity has forced innovation, with ITV producing more material in-house and companies turning promotions on their heads. \u201cSome advertisers are having to edit what they\u2019ve got. McCain have got this lovely family campaign narrated by Ricky Tomlinson. They kept the same ad but got Ricky Tomlinson to change the voiceover.\u201d The Co-op cancelled its Easter TV advertising campaign, which was originally promoting chocolate eggs, and donated millions of pounds of airtime to run an advert featuring supermarket staff urging people to support the food charity FareShare. Cathedral City created an advert about the joys of sitting at home with a cheese toastie by splicing together footage from old adverts and putting a new soundtrack over the top. Tesco promoted its Easter food sales by showing a video of a family holding a video conference to discuss how best to cook lamb. Jameson said many big-budget campaigns had been scrapped and her team were desperately trying to think of formats that could be produced in lockdown, with drone footage of empty streets suddenly popular. She predicted that television screens and online video services would soon be filled with adverts produced using animation, which can be produced remotely. \u201cAdvertisers who just running pre-corona stuff looks really weird,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see ads for beer, which of course people are still going to want to drink, but somehow it just feels odd to see people in a pub at the moment.\u201d Many companies have taken it upon themselves to promote stay-at-home messages, although there is a risk that people are baffled when companies that normally sell them beer or clothes start telling them how to stay safe in a pandemic. With ad spending collapsing, the government has stepped into the void with its big-budget national public health campaign, which has become ubiquitous \u2013 especially on news websites. \u201cYou need a short, informative message to get the public\u2019s attention, certainly to resonate with younger audiences today,\u201d said Jeremy Hine, the chief executive of MullenLowe Group UK, which has created the campaign. \u201c\u2018Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives\u2019 is like a wartime version.\u201d Following the prime minister\u2019s calls to evoke a blitz spirit, the campaign has been designed to evoke the spirit of the second world war, when the public were told that \u201ccoughs and sneezes cause diseases\u201d and the never released \u201cKeep calm and carry on\u201d poster was created. However, Hine said brands should leave the evocation of war to the government and instead focus on reassuring the public with their advertising messages. \u201cBeing Churchillian is fine for politicians \u2013 a rallying cry to lead and set policy, it makes for a powerful, engaging ad campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that approach is less meaningful for a brand. Advertisers that are doing it well out there are those like McCain\u2019s \u2018staying at home\u2019 work, or PG Tips with the idea of sharing a cup of tea over Skype. They are putting an arm around you.\u201d",

The bank, one of the big four, revealed its first half, after-tax profit was down 51% to $1.31bn compared with the same six months in 2019. NAB operates on a different financial year from most banks and these results are for the six months to 31 March 2020, which includes the first few weeks of the strict shutdown rules. NAB has the largest exposure to small and medium-sized businesses of the big four banks and so will be more affected by the closures of restaurants, cafes, hotels and small retailers. But the results revealed by NAB demonstrate how the economic impact of the coronavirus is quickly rippling through other parts of the economy, including the financial sector. The federal government has urged the banks to show forbearance to mortgage holders and business lenders during the crisis. It has announced a 50% loan guarantee scheme for small and medium-sized businesses with turnover up to $50m in a bid to keep those businesses afloat. In recent weeks the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has also urged the banks to set up hotlines and provide bridging loans to small businesses waiting for jobkeeper payments to start flowing in May. But the crisis, inevitably, is affecting the banks\u2019 bottom line as well. NAB announced it would raise $3bn from institutional investors and a further $500m through a retail placement with its shareholders to bolster its balance sheet. CEO Ross McEwan said NAB had entered the downturn in \u201ca robust position\u201d but had decided to raise capital to deal with the impact of impaired loans and a requirement to mark-to-market its loan portfolio. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He said the bank was provisioning for $2.135bn of \u201cforward looking adjustments for anticipated stress\u201d. Moody\u2019s investor services said the capital raising would \u201csignificantly strengthen NAB\u2019s capital base and boost its buffers against potential credit losses and rising capital requirements amid the broad economic downturn\u201d. The bank\u2019s decision to increase its collective provisions to $4.4bn underlines its balance sheet strength to combat the uncertainty ahead, Moody\u2019s vice-president, Frank Mirenzi, said. McEwan said the bank had consulted with its economists on the likely impact of the pandemic and the baseline scenario used by the bank assumed an 8.4% drop in GDP and unemployment rising to 11%. But he said he did not know whether to expect a V-shaped recovery, where the economy bounced back as fast as it slumped, or whether the recession would be a more prolonged U-shaped one. He said the bank had modelled for both but \u201cat this stage we don\u2019t know and would be very surprised if anyone did.\u201d The financial hit to the banks will now flow through to shareholders, including self-funded retirees and superannuation funds. Against the advice of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, NAB has decided to continue to pay a dividend of 30 cents a share, but cut it by 64%. McEwan said the bank needed to balance returning capital to shareholders with having a strong balance sheet. The bank\u2019s senior management will also feel the pain. The NAB chairman and directors will forego 20% of their base fees for the second half of 2020.

Boris Johnson will resume control of Britain\u2019s faltering response to the coronavirus crisis today as pressure mounts on his government to spell out how it will begin to ease the lockdown and reopen schools and businesses. The prime minister last night returned to Downing Street where the question of how to lift restrictions is the most pressing matter in an overflowing in-tray, which also includes fixing the government\u2019s decision-making structure and dealing with the Brexit talks impasse. How to reach the target of 100,000 tests per day is also a key issue and ministers are considering ordering millions of antibody testing kits in the hope of establishing immunity levels across the country. As countries across Europe plan to ease some lockdown restrictions this week, pressure on Johnson to do the same is especially strong from business leaders who have appealed for more clarity about Britain\u2019s exit strategy. The tourism sector faces the worst of the job losses, a new report says today, with areas such as the Yorkshire Dales, Cornwall and Wales worst hit. The latest EY Item Club forecast says the economy could take three years to recover from the impact of Covid-19. But businesses themselves could face scrutiny thanks to a thinktank report that says FTSE100 companies using the taxpayer-funded furlough scheme paid their bosses an average of \u00a33.6m last year. Hospital coronavirus deaths in Britain were 413 yesterday, taking the total to 20,732 out of 154,037 cases. There are almost three million cases around the world and more than 200,000 deaths, although Wuhan now officially has no coronavirus cases. You can catch up on all the key developments overnight at a glance and read more details on our live blog. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Back to Brexit \u2013 Part of Boris Johnson\u2019s busy week will be focused on persuading European leaders to break off from tackling coronavirus to help untangle the Brexit imbroglio. The prime minister\u2019s advisers have warned him that the negotiations that started last week are on track to fail. Europe\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has accused the UK of not engaging with key issues such as fishing rights, and the so-called level playing field conditions to ensure neither side can undercut environmental, labour and social standards. * * * Kim \u2018is alive\u2019 \u2013 Kim Jong-un is alive and well despite widespread rumours that he was seriously ill with heart trouble, according to a security adviser to the South Korean president. Moon Chung-in said overnight: \u201cOur government position is firm. Kim Jong-un is alive and well\u201d, adding that the North Korean leader had been staying in Wonsan \u2013 a resort town on the country\u2019s east coast \u2013 since 13 April. * * * Children stabbed \u2013 A one-year-old girl and a three-year-old boy have been stabbed to death at a home in Ilford in east London.

Coronavirus Extra New Zealand claims it has eliminated the virus after recording only one confirmed case in the past 24 hours and will now ease its lockdown restrictions. One million Australians have downloaded an app to help health officials with contact tracing as some state governments start to ease the lockdown. Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus coronavirus response coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, has warned that Americans should expect social distancing measures to remain in place throughout the summer. The US needed better testing before it could reopen more fully, she said, as the president failed to deliver a media briefing for the second day running. For light relief, read our review of Saturday Night Live, in which Brad Pitt appears as another of Trump\u2019s advisers, Dr Anthony Fauci, to explain the president\u2019s claims about treating the virus. The scientist leading Germany\u2019s much-praised response has given us a fascinating question and answer session in which he thinks Britain was too late to start testing and suspects China\u2019s raccoon dog-breeding industry could be linked to the outbreak.

France\u2019s prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe is to present an exit strategy to parliament on Tuesday. In the US, several states including Colorado, Montana, Minnesota, Mississippi and Tennessee will start lifting restrictions. Other coronavirus developments include: In the UK, the prime minister Boris Johnson will return to work on Monday after recovering from coronavirus and will be under pressure over his government\u2019s handling of the crisis. The New Zealand prime minister has said that the country had \u201cwon the battle\u201d against widespread transmission of coronavirus as the nation prepares to ease lockdown measures. One million people have downloaded a new app in Australia designed to help medical workers and state governments trace close contacts of Covid-19 patients.

We were in the process of moving home to be nearer family who currently live about four hours\u2019 drive away.</p> <p>Initially, we wanted to rent and signed up for a tenancy in the middle of March. We had a buyer for our house, and had booked a removals firm for early April, knowing that the sale would not be completed until a month or so after we had moved to the rented property.</p> <p>Our removals company closed down once lockdown was announced, and has refunded our money. We have had to put the sale on hold, as we had not exchanged contracts, but we know the buyers still want to buy our house.</p> <p>We are now a bit stuck. We are living in the house we still own but still paying rent on the other property, although the landlords have reduced what we have to pay. The first time we visited the rental property we took a few things with us and those are still there. </p> <p>We are not sure whether our move would be considered essential, and who decides whether it is? The main thing stopping us actually moving is finding removers. The British Association of Removers has advised companies to close down. At our age we cannot hire a van and do it ourselves.</p> <p>Until social distancing is relaxed we cannot see how removers are going to be able to work, as moving wardrobes, chests of drawers and so on is always going to take two people. We cannot see how we can move in the foreseeable future, but are stuck paying rent for a property we cannot live in.<br><strong>AR</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> The main thing stopping you moving is that the government has said that \u201chomebuyers and renters should, where possible, delay moving to a new house while measures are in place to fight coronavirus\u201d.</p> <p>To be permitted to move \u2013 and so not be subject to the new emergency enforcement powers given to the police \u2013 the move would have to be unavoidable because you have not been able to agree a new date for moving. So even if you could find a removal firm willing to help, you shouldn\u2019t go ahead with it because it is not unavoidable.</p> <p>In addition, the government has said that people who have two or more homes \u201cmust remain in their primary residence\u201d which, in your case, is the home you own. The government has also made it clear that \u201cessential travel does not include visits to second homes, camp sites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays\u201d.</p> <p>So it looks like you will not be able to move until the lockdown ends. In the meantime, you should keep in touch with your landlord. It sounds as though they are behaving reasonably, but if they do try to charge full rent before you are allowed to move in it may be worth pointing out that there is no wear and tear while you are not living there.</p>",

The main thing stopping us actually moving is finding removers. The British Association of Removers has advised companies to close down. At our age we cannot hire a van and do it ourselves. Until social distancing is relaxed we cannot see how removers are going to be able to work, as moving wardrobes, chests of drawers and so on is always going to take two people. We cannot see how we can move in the foreseeable future, but are stuck paying rent for a property we cannot live in. AR A The main thing stopping you moving is that the government has said that \u201chomebuyers and renters should, where possible, delay moving to a new house while measures are in place to fight coronavirus\u201d. To be permitted to move \u2013 and so not be subject to the new emergency enforcement powers given to the police \u2013 the move would have to be unavoidable because you have not been able to agree a new date for moving. So even if you could find a removal firm willing to help, you shouldn\u2019t go ahead with it because it is not unavoidable. In addition, the government has said that people who have two or more homes \u201cmust remain in their primary residence\u201d which, in your case, is the home you own. The government has also made it clear that \u201cessential travel does not include visits to second homes, camp sites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays\u201d. So it looks like you will not be able to move until the lockdown ends. In the meantime, you should keep in touch with your landlord. It sounds as though they are behaving reasonably, but if they do try to charge full rent before you are allowed to move in it may be worth pointing out that there is no wear and tear while you are not living there.",

Ahead of a meeting with providers on Friday, the government suggested it was prepared to force homes to allow each resident two visitors a day, in line with official health guidelines, if operators did not ease their own rules. On Monday, a coalition of 1,000 aged care homes and their representatives roundly rejected the government\u2019s request and disputed claims elevated by the prime minister that some homes were simply locking residents in their rooms. \u201cAged care providers have made extremely difficult decisions for enhanced resident protections on visitation in order to reduce the number of potential exposures to the vulnerable people in our care,\u201d they said in the statement. The impasse leaves families and residents at times abiding by vastly different rules at different homes, regardless of whether there have been confirmed cases within a facility. In March, the government launched new guidelines that stated aged care homes could allow residents to have two visitors per day. But the Guardian reported that many of country\u2019s largest operators had gone beyond that, banning visits in what some providers described as \u201cvoluntary lockdown\u201d, prompting concerns from advocates of a knee-jerk reaction. The Council on the Ageing chief executive, Ian Yates, told Guardian Australia on Monday he remained concerned about the level of visitor restrictions imposed by some providers. \u201cI\u2019m listening to some saying their members are very flexible, for example about people who are dying or residents who have severe dementia, but we have too many cases where that is not happening,\u201d he said. Yates acknowledged there were \u201ctwo sides\u201d to the debate and proposed a code of conduct to providers as a middle ground. \u201cBut so far we haven\u2019t had that reciprocated,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the provider feels the need to be stronger than the national guidelines, there [should be] certain guarantees. In that case then everybody would know what is happening. \u201cAt the moment it\u2019s quite arbitrary. Two providers in the same suburb will be doing something different.\u201d Globally, aged care facilities have been ravaged by Covid-19, with the WHO reporting that up to half of all deaths in Europe were in nursing homes. In New South Wales, authorities are dealing with a cluster at Newmarch House, run by non-profit Anglicare, which was sparked when a staff member tested positive, and has killed six residents and seen more than 50 residents and staff contract the virus. Patricia Sparrow, chief executive of non-profit peak body Aged and Community Services Australia, told the Guardian on Monday providers needed the right to impose restrictions beyond the AHPPC guidance. She acknowledged that providers had instituted extra visitor restrictions in an \u201cnumber of instances\u201d but said the peak body did not have data stating how many of its members had gone beyond the government guidelines. Although the outbreak at Newmarch had been sparked by a staff member, Sparrow said it highlighted why aged care homes were so insistent that they be able to further limit visits. The decision of providers to dig in sets up a showdown with the government after Morrison took a hard line on Friday, saying the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee\u2019s \u201cvery clear medical advice\u201d was that visits were safe. He said unless providers voluntarily loosened restrictions, he would force them to apply for an exemption to impose rules that were tougher than the health guidelines. \u201cThere are quite valid reasons why you would have exemptions, particularly as we\u2019ve seen in north-west Tasmania at the moment, or what we\u2019ve seen in western Sydney or in other places,\u201d he said. \u201cBut more broadly, having people stuck in their rooms, not being able to be visited by their loved ones and carers and other support people, that\u2019s not OK.\u201d Sparrow outright rejected claims that residents were locked in their rooms in facilities where visitors had been banned. Some providers have adopted the use of iPads and other digital tools to allow residents to communicate with loved ones, while others have established other novel methods such as \u201cwindow visits\u201d. While he pointed to these positive examples, Yates said there was also a need for provider peak bodies to pull their \u201crecalcitrant members into line\u201d. He cited cases such as an operator threatening to call the police on a family attempting to communicate with a loved one from afar. \u201cThey were just trying to communicate through a window,\u201d he said. Yates added that only \u201ca minority of people in residential care\u201d had family coming to visiting them. \u201cThe idea that there will be a flood of people coming in is a bit carried away,\u201d he said. The Guardian contacted the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, for comment.",

Coronavirus-induced lockdown is changing the daily rhythm of urban life, shining a light on emboldened animals that usually prefer to remain hidden.</p> \n<p> Biologists and ecologists normally feel more at home studying remote jungles or inaccessible mountain tops, where \u201creal\u201d nature is. But as our planet gets covered with cities, more and more environments are being run by humans, who have become a super keystone species.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"51ff943f-e72a-405b-8587-54ef351d6bc2\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This week, the Guardian's Age of Extinction site is looking at biodiversity in cities and urban areas around the world, shining a spotlight on the under-appreciated world of nature hidden among the highrises and busy roads.</p>\n    <p>Around 55% of the world\u2019s population live in urban areas and that number is projected to rise to&nbsp;68% by 2050. Nature\u2019s role in the wellbeing and happiness of billions of people will be more important than ever. While urbanisation is a major driver of biodiversity loss,&nbsp;many conservationists and town planners are trying to make built-up areas more nature-friendly. The role of green spaces in urban areas has even been formalised in a draft UN agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, often referred to as the Paris agreement for nature.<br></p>\n    <p>The Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way.<br></p>\n    <p>In this special series of reports we'll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Cities are not mausoleums for nature but modern-day versions of the Galapagos archipelago, according to Menno Schilthuizen, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jul/23/darwin-comes-to-town-how-cities-are-creating-new-species\">author of Darwin Comes to Town</a>, a book about contemporary evolution in cities where rapid changes can be observed within a human lifetime.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"067e9e986984e0a4de04e77d1b21e1aba6847518\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/067e9e986984e0a4de04e77d1b21e1aba6847518/0_0_5593_3729/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mother and two wild boar piglets roam at a street of the Carmel neighbourhood in Haifa, Israel, 11 April 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mother and two wild boar piglets cross a street in the Carmel neighbourhood of Haifa, Israel, on 11 April.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cOnly in our flights of fancy can we still keep nature divorced from the human environment. Out in the real world, our tentacles entwine nature\u2019s fabric,\u201d Schilthuizen writes. \u201cWhile we have been trying to save the world\u2019s crumbling pre-urban ecosystems, we have been ignoring the fact that nature has already been putting up the scaffolds to build novel, urban ecosystems for the future.\u201d</p> \n<p>Haunting images of wolves, bison and bears living in deserted towns following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster indicate what happens when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/may/28/chernobyl-wildlife-haven-tour-belarus-created-nuclear-disaster-zone\">humans leave a place for good</a>. The coronavirus lockdown shows how quickly wildlife closes in. \u201cIt is interesting to consider how fragile our urban environment is. If we\u2019re not constantly present, it\u2019s being taken over by nature very quickly,\u201d says Schilthuizen, who is professor of evolutionary biology at Leiden University in the Netherlands.</p> \n<p>The unique thing about coronavirus is that it is causing multiple cities across the globe to simultaneously go into hibernation. This gives ecologists an insight into how humans change urban biodiversity in multiple locations. \u201cAnimals are nearby, constantly watching us from the outskirts and the forests, and as soon as our presence seems to be abating they start exploring where new terrain could be won \u2026 It makes you aware of how we\u2019re constantly competing with many species,\u201d says Schilthuizen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2b96c8d02517de2e87a29e86329d469e04963180\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b96c8d02517de2e87a29e86329d469e04963180/0_0_3113_2075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two silvery-brown Tamarin or Grey Titi monkeys (saguinus leucopus) in Medellin, Colombia, 16 April 2020.

In the past few decades this has started to change but we still know little about the urban wildlife we live alongside, says Rana El-Sabaawi, associate professor of biology at Canada\u2019s University of Victoria.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you look in the literature, the field of urban ecology doesn\u2019t really come into its own until the last decade or two. Before that there were a smattering of papers and reports, mostly descriptions of biodiversity trends in and around specific cities. In recent years there has been a growing appreciation of the ecological mechanisms that explain biodiversity in the city,\u201d she says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f0af93063473d6b1f55a45621add1885f89b4de5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0af93063473d6b1f55a45621add1885f89b4de5/0_0_2050_1366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A puma in the streets of Santiago, 24 March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A puma in the streets of Santiago, 24 March 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andres Pina/ATON CHILE/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Urban environments are messy places (full of lights, pollution and people pursuing their own interests), which makes studying them difficult.

      "bodyText": "Peregrine falcons have swapped sea cliffs for the UK parliament and red-crowned parrots have left tropical forests in Mexico for the leafy neighbourhoods of Pasadena. Cities all over the world have their own unique ecological concoctions created by mixing human settlements with wildlife. Coronavirus-induced lockdown is changing the daily rhythm of urban life, shining a light on emboldened animals that usually prefer to remain hidden. Biologists and ecologists normally feel more at home studying remote jungles or inaccessible mountain tops, where \u201creal\u201d nature is. But as our planet gets covered with cities, more and more environments are being run by humans, who have become a super keystone species. Cities are not mausoleums for nature but modern-day versions of the Galapagos archipelago, according to Menno Schilthuizen, author of Darwin Comes to Town, a book about contemporary evolution in cities where rapid changes can be observed within a human lifetime. \u201cOnly in our flights of fancy can we still keep nature divorced from the human environment. Out in the real world, our tentacles entwine nature\u2019s fabric,\u201d Schilthuizen writes. \u201cWhile we have been trying to save the world\u2019s crumbling pre-urban ecosystems, we have been ignoring the fact that nature has already been putting up the scaffolds to build novel, urban ecosystems for the future.\u201d Haunting images of wolves, bison and bears living in deserted towns following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster indicate what happens when humans leave a place for good. The coronavirus lockdown shows how quickly wildlife closes in. \u201cIt is interesting to consider how fragile our urban environment is. If we\u2019re not constantly present, it\u2019s being taken over by nature very quickly,\u201d says Schilthuizen, who is professor of evolutionary biology at Leiden University in the Netherlands. The unique thing about coronavirus is that it is causing multiple cities across the globe to simultaneously go into hibernation. This gives ecologists an insight into how humans change urban biodiversity in multiple locations. \u201cAnimals are nearby, constantly watching us from the outskirts and the forests, and as soon as our presence seems to be abating they start exploring where new terrain could be won \u2026 It makes you aware of how we\u2019re constantly competing with many species,\u201d says Schilthuizen. A messy business Historically, urban environments have been seen as too contaminated by humans to teach us anything important about biodiversity. In the past few decades this has started to change but we still know little about the urban wildlife we live alongside, says Rana El-Sabaawi, associate professor of biology at Canada\u2019s University of Victoria. \u201cIf you look in the literature, the field of urban ecology doesn\u2019t really come into its own until the last decade or two. Before that there were a smattering of papers and reports, mostly descriptions of biodiversity trends in and around specific cities. In recent years there has been a growing appreciation of the ecological mechanisms that explain biodiversity in the city,\u201d she says. Urban environments are messy places (full of lights, pollution and people pursuing their own interests), which makes studying them difficult. It\u2019s all very well to observe animals and plants in urban places, but understanding how these different processes fit together is more problematic. At the same time, there is increasing recognition that few places on Earth are free from human influence \u2013 there is a plastic bag at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, and Antarctica\u2019s remote glaciers are flecked with microplastics. Understanding places where humans interact with nature most should help planners and developers create cities that hold as much wildlife as possible. Opportunists do well in cities Broadly speaking, \u201csensitive\u201d species, whose habitat is destroyed by urban developments, are unlikely to venture into urban areas. \u201cOpportunists\u201d, which have a much broader diet and high tolerance for noise and pollution, are more at home.

In her defence, Murray argued that the tweet was not defamatory and was a statement of her opinion.\u2019 I\u2019m finally watching Game of Thrones and it\u2019s made me a total pearl-clutcher \u2018The problem with watching a show so late is that you can\u2019t discuss it with other people. I\u2019m not going to phone my friends and say, \u201cDo you remember in Game Of Thrones about seven years ago when they had that Red Wedding? That was mad, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u2019 Saturday The bittersweet story of Marina Abramovi\u0107\u2019s epic walk on the Great Wall of China \u2018After slipping on rocks as slippery as polished ice, Abramovi\u0107 and her guide found themselves hanging over an abyss. She found homes and stables built into the winding wall, and other parts that had been dismantled by locals who, under Mao\u2019s encouragement to \u201ckill the dragon\u201d, had removed the clay and stones to build with. Once, Abramovi\u0107 claimed to have walked through a kilometre of human bones.\u2019 How we stay together: \u2018Looking after each other, everything else would fall into place\u2019 \u2018He says he just knew: \u201cIt just felt so comfortable that I knew this would be the person I\u2019d spend the rest of my life with. Margaret agrees: \u201c[It was like] putting the key in the lock and it fits and you turn the key and your life was on the other side of the door.\u201d\u2019 Blind date: \u2018I put on perfume for a video call\u2019 \u2018What did you talk about? Cricket, bad chat-up lines, the fact that my friend encouraged me to do this because I\u2019m apparently single and desperate, the accents we do when we get drunk and lie about our identities (me: scouse, him: South African). Everything but coronavirus.\u2019 Will justice finally be done for Emmett Till? Family hope a 65-year wait may soon be over \u2018In August, it will be 65 years since the battered and bloated body of the 14-year-old Till was fished from the muddy waters of the Tallahatchie River in Mississippi. His kidnapping, torture and murder on 28 August 1955 for having whistled at a white woman was a defining moment of postwar American history, sparking the civil rights movement.\u2019 Love and obsession: how one of the finest UK ceramics collections ended up in a London council flat \u2018Until recently, one of the best British postwar ceramics collections was to be found on a council estate in east London. \u201cIt was a bit like walking into a reliquary,\u201d says the ceramicist Annie Turner. \u201cYou\u2019d go into a pretty brutal-looking 1970s building and up a dull concrete stairwell and think, \u2018Am I in the right place?\u2019. Then you opened this door, and it was like entering another world.\u201d\u2019 Sunday World Cup questions: Were England robbed by Argentina at Mexico 86? \u2018Only Peter Reid is really running around. He dispossesses Maradona, loses his boot and keeps on running. For 15 minutes he\u2019s the best player on the pitch. His opposite number is Sergio Batista, who despite being only 23 has perfected the classic bearded serial killer midfielder look. The crowd noise is an ambient hum through this, with sudden vague hisses of excitement.\u2019 Chain reaction: the ups and downs of Britain\u2019s high street stalwarts \u2018Behold the British restaurant chain. Now that we all speak fluent independent bistro, taqueria and live fire grill, we are, of course, meant to look disdainfully upon them and all their works. Which, in true Carrie Bradshaw style, raises the simplest of questions: are the chains a valuable part of the British restaurant landscape?\u2019 Biden searches for his own \u2018Biden\u2019 \u2013 a running mate with chemistry \u2018Though Biden has been coy about his preferences, he has been consistent in his requirement that his running mate be someone he \u201ccompletely trusts\u201d to carry out his agenda yet is unafraid to challenge him on major decisions. Biden told a Pittsburgh radio station that he would select Michelle Obama as his running mate \u201cin a heartbeat\u201d but suspected that she has no \u201cdesire to live near the White House again\u201d.\u2019 \u2018They were literally about to turn me off and on again\u2019: Robert Webb on his brush with mortality \u2018My mood during the weeks before the operation was the kind of hysterical calm you\u2019d expect from someone who\u2019s just made an appointment to get hit by a lorry. I wandered quietly around the house downloading audiobooks and trying not to have a heart attack.\u2019 Scrum time for Beaumont and Pichot: the dinosaur v the dynamo \u2018Beaumont has had a trying couple of weeks, what with his campaign being backed by a convicted killer who has been condemned by Amnesty International. The Fiji rugby union chairman has been denied a visa for the US but astonishingly he emerged as a key supporter of Beaumont\u2019s bid. It is just one of this campaign\u2019s great ironies that a key part of Sir Bill\u2019s manifesto is a fit and proper persons test for elected officials.\u2019",

In contrast to influenza, data from both virus and antibody testing to date suggest that children are not the primary drivers of Covid-19 spread in schools or in the community.\u201d</p> <p>Epidemiologist Dr Kathryn Snow, from the University of Melbourne\u2019s Centre for International Child Health, said it was important to emphasise there is a difference between a child\u2019s likelihood of catching the virus themselves and their likelihood of passing the virus on to others. Evidence showed children were less likely to pass it on than adults but that did not mean scientists were saying children could not become infected.</p> <p>\u201cMany parents and teachers are finding the debate about schools confusing and stressful,\u201d Snow said. \u201cThe evidence shows that although primary school aged children can catch Covid-19, they usually only experience a mild illness. Interestingly, although primary school aged children can definitely catch it, it seems that they almost never pass the virus on to anybody else.</p> <p>\u201cThis will be counter-intuitive to a lot of parents, who know that children often bring home other germs from school. However, we see this same phenomenon with other diseases as well, for example with tuberculosis.\u201d</p> <p>She added that transmission from children is only one piece of the puzzle in terms of whether schools should be open.</p> <p>\u201cThere is also a risk of transmission between teachers and parents, and from teachers to students. Some teachers are in their 60s and could be at risk of a serious illness if they were to catch Covid at work. Globally, there have been some outbreaks among parents, teachers, and students linked to schools and school functions.\u201d</p> <h2>Support for the disadvantaged</h2> <p>But schools being closed will have a disproportionate impact on some students, especially students with learning difficulties or those with limited IT resources at home, she said. \u201cAs a health equity researcher, I\u2019m personally quite concerned about the impact on some students from disadvantaged backgrounds.\u201d</p> <p>Students returned to schools in South Australia on Monday, but parents who chose to keep their children at home reported widespread issues with the online learning system called LearnLink. The Australian Capital Territory and Victoria will deliver their curriculum via online and remote learning for term 2, while students face a staggered return in NSW from Wednesday.

Samal was inspired to create the series when the Guardian invited her to contribute an idea to an article proposing an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/20/an-action-plan-for-theatre-during-covid-19\">action plan for theatre</a>\u201d after venues were closed by coronavirus. \u201cThat was the first time I thought practically about how to stay creative and connected in isolation,\u201d said Samal. \u201cOnce I\u2019d written it down, I had to see if it worked.\u201d</p> <p>In the article, and on social media, Samal invited creatives to get in touch if they were interested in collaborating. She then devised a questionnaire for them to complete and, based on their answers, matched up trios of actors, writers and directors. \u201cIt was quite confusing and involved a very complicated spreadsheet. The idea was to introduce people to each other digitally, and have a mix of experience levels, disciplines and styles. Some people set up their own partnerships as well. It was all fairly fluid.

In the film, Esther Uwejeyah plays a team leader whose fuzzy jargon fails to unite her employees. It\u2019s an initially comic piece that gradually emphasises how remote working has left many frayed, frustrated and unsure of their rights.

Similarly, there have been problems with women\u2019s matches staged on the same day as the men\u2019s - often in different cities \u2013 ensuring supporters are not able to attend both.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/25/premiership-rugby-union-clubs-in-danger-funding-shortfall-from-paused-season\">Premiership rugby clubs in danger due to funding shortfall from paused season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was also considerable disbelief at the decision to stage France v England \u2013 effectively the title decider \u2013 on the opening weekend of the 2020 tournament. That match, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/02/six-nations-champions-england-beat-france\">won 19-13 by England</a>, attracted a bumper crowd of 14,000 while 11,000 saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/07/england-wales-womens-six-nations-match-report\">the</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/07/england-wales-womens-six-nations-match-report\">m thrash Wales</a> on 7 March at the Stoop.</p> <p>This year was the second in a row organisers failed to attract a title sponsor for the women\u2019s championship. There is no prize money either while \u00a316m is available in the men\u2019s tournament, and there is a growing sense that a new window would help resolve that. The most recent World Cup, in August 2017, gives an idea of the audiences available to a standalone women\u2019s competition. The final attracted a peak audience of 2.6m on ITV.</p> <p>\u201cWe are studying a possible specific window different to the men\u2019s as part of an update to the global calendar for the women\u2019s international game,\u201d said a Six Nations spokesperson. \u201cThis is a working option right now, no decision is made yet.\u201d</p> <p>It is understood the proposal was being considered before the coronavirus pandemic but the disruption could accelerate the move when rugby returns. The women\u2019s calendar has already been disrupted by the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics to 2021. There are just six weeks between the end of the Games and the start of the World Cup in New Zealand and far more women move between sevens and XVs than in the men\u2019s game.</p> <p>Firstly, however, the 2020 Six Nations needs to be completed. England, with four wins from four, are the champions elect with Italy left to play, but six matches need to be rescheduled owing to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Six Nations schedule is set for a radical overhaul, with organisers considering creating a new window for the women\u2019s competition to avoid clashing with the men\u2019s tournament, moving it away from the traditional February-March slot in an effort to increase exposure. There was widespread criticism of the schedule for this year\u2019s tournament from, among others, the England fly-half Katy Daley-Mclean, with a number of the matches shoehorned into lunchtime kick-offs, often overlapping each other. Similarly, there have been problems with women\u2019s matches staged on the same day as the men\u2019s - often in different cities \u2013 ensuring supporters are not able to attend both. There was also considerable disbelief at the decision to stage France v England \u2013 effectively the title decider \u2013 on the opening weekend of the 2020 tournament. That match, won 19-13 by England, attracted a bumper crowd of 14,000 while 11,000 saw them thrash Wales on 7 March at the Stoop. This year was the second in a row organisers failed to attract a title sponsor for the women\u2019s championship. There is no prize money either while \u00a316m is available in the men\u2019s tournament, and there is a growing sense that a new window would help resolve that. The most recent World Cup, in August 2017, gives an idea of the audiences available to a standalone women\u2019s competition. The final attracted a peak audience of 2.6m on ITV. \u201cWe are studying a possible specific window different to the men\u2019s as part of an update to the global calendar for the women\u2019s international game,\u201d said a Six Nations spokesperson. \u201cThis is a working option right now, no decision is made yet.\u201d It is understood the proposal was being considered before the coronavirus pandemic but the disruption could accelerate the move when rugby returns. The women\u2019s calendar has already been disrupted by the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics to 2021. There are just six weeks between the end of the Games and the start of the World Cup in New Zealand and far more women move between sevens and XVs than in the men\u2019s game. Firstly, however, the 2020 Six Nations needs to be completed. England, with four wins from four, are the champions elect with Italy left to play, but six matches need to be rescheduled owing to the coronavirus outbreak.",

This painting demonstrates his technical mastery of Rembrandt\u2019s early style. Image: Portrait of an Unknown Woman\u2019, c1644, Ferdinand Bol (1616-80), Historic England Archive, 2:A - The practice of painting inanimate objects can be traced back to ancient Greco-Roman art. However, the emergence of still life as a distinct genre occurred in the Netherlands during the early 16th century; it was then widely referred to as \"stilstaende dingen\", which translates as \"still-standing things\". It was only from 1650 that the modern Dutch term \"stilleven\" was introduced, from which the English still life derives. Image: Breakfast Piece, c1640, Pieter Claesz (1597/1598-1660), Historic England Archive, 3:C - The Bolsover Caesars go back to Titian\u2019s famous but lost series of 11 paintings created in 1536-40 for Federico II, Duke of Mantua, and were based on the engravings by Aegidius Sadeler from the 1590s. Something of Nero\u2019s reputed tyranny and extravagance is suggested by his downturned mouth, jutting chin and sinister expression. Image: Nero Claudius (AD37-AD68AD), fifth Roman Emperor (AD54-AD68), 1625-50, after Titian (c1488-1576), Historic England Archive, 4:C - John Singer Sargent was one of the last great exponents of the grand manner style of portraiture. The grand manner was an idealised style, drawing on classical and high Renaissance art. It was promoted in the 18th century by Sir Joshua Reynolds, who advocated the pursuit of perfect form over slavishly copying nature in order to elevate portraiture to the level of history painting. Image: Daisy Leiter, Later Margaret Hyde, 19th Countess of Suffolk, 1898, John Singer Sargent (1856-1925), Historic England Archive, 5:C - Prince Albert had Eos from a six-month-old puppy and they were inseparable. After Eos died, in 1844, she was buried in the grounds of Windsor Castle. John Francis produced a life-size bronze sculpture of Eos, a version of which can be seen on the garden terrace at Osborne. In Greek mythology, Eos is the goddess of the dawn. Image: Prince Albert (1819-61), Princess Royal and Eos, 1843, John Lucas (1807-74), Historic England Archive, 6:B - Lambert\u2019s view of Chiswick shows a key moment and place in the history of English landscape gardening, showing the results of Lord Burlington and William Kent\u2019s naturalistic designs. Lambert\u2019s skill in depicting landscape was not matched by his figure painting, so he turned to his friend Hogarth to supply the animated couple surveying the serpentine river, and the relaxed young man reclining in the foreground. Image: Chiswick House, Middlesex, c1742, William Hogarth (1697-1764) and George Lambert (c1700-65), Historic England Archive, 7:C - Thellusson (1737-97) left his substantial fortune to the survivor of any children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren living at the time of his death. The potential scale of any such accrued sum led to the Accumulations Act 1800 (known also as the Thellusson Act) which prevented such long term settlements. Image: Mrs Charles Thellusson, nee Sabine Robarts (1775-1814), and Her Son, Charles Thellusson (1797-1856), c1804, Thomas Lawrence (1769-1830), Historic England Archive, 8:C - Holbein\u2019s patrons outside royal circles included nearly a quarter of the peerage and many of the most important political figures of the day. In this portrait, the unknown sitter holds his gloves, a trope Holbein used in a number of aristocratic male portraits.

The Belgian government outlined a plan to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown last week, but with holidays abroad likely to remain impossible, the burgemeester Bart Tommelein has received tentative backing from the government\u2019s top virologist for his plan of a system of passes to keep people on beaches safe this summer. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an ants\u2019 nest here,\u201d Tommelein said when he proposed the beach passes plan, or strandpas in the local Flemish dialect used in the north of Belgium. The mayor\u2019s sliding scale of priority, with tax-paying locals, second home owners and hotel guests given preference, has provoked criticism among the other nine coastal municipalities, and sparked a discussion about the right of all Belgians to access the country\u2019s sandy beaches. \u201cAre we going to have to put gates at the entrance to the beaches?\u201d asked Daphn\u00e9 Dumery, the mayor of Blankenberge, 12 miles (19km) north of Ostend. \u201cIf a train full of vacationers arrives, will I have to send them home? Do I need to hire new police to deal with this?\u201d L\u00e9opold Lippens, the mayor of Knokke-Heist, a resort 30 miles (48km) north of Ostend, said: \u201cEither the beaches are open or they are closed.

Beaches are for everyone.\u201d Belgium\u2019s coastline is heavily built-up with what is commonly described as an Atlantic wall of apartment blocks, built in the 1950s and 1960s when the philosophy was that all Belgians should be able to find comfortable and affordable accommodation by the sea. \u201cThe idea was that everyone can come to the coast and can find a proper apartment or go camping, rich and poor,\u201d said Dedecker. \u201cThat was the politics of 50s and 60s. Then you have an ugly coast but everyone can go.\u201d Dedecker said he believed distancing between beachgoers could easily be organised on Belgium\u2019s broad sandy beaches. He said: \u201cI am expecting a lot of people this summer. People will not travel to Spain, Turkey or Italy. \u201cWe have a huge beach in Middelkerke. We have 12 swimming zones and we have made a calculation that we can put 65,000 people sitting in the sun and they all have a space of 36 sq metres. We have very fresh air. And everybody is already doing social distancing so they will do that on the beaches.\u201d The Belgian prime minister, Sophie Wilm\u00e8s, announced plans on Friday to lift restrictions over the next two months, with restaurants reopening and, potentially, permits for day trips being introduced in time for the summer. \u201cPeople have to come because our economy is falling down,\u201d said Dedecker. \u201cIf we start choosing who can come we will die. We have had an \u2018English\u2019 winter \u2013 a lot of rain. Stormy weather. We need a beautiful summer.\u201d",

But it can\u2019t go on much longer.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing about $300 of business a day, where we were doing 17 or 1800 before,\u201d said Floyd. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work to pay my workers when you don\u2019t have the income.\u201d</p> <p>So far Floyd has kept on her eight employees, although she\u2019s losing money and has almost no income for herself. She is clinging on, in the hope that Missouri\u2019s governor, Mike Parson, will make good on his promise to let restaurants and other businesses open back up when the state\u2019s stay-at-home order expires on 3 May \u2013 a shutdown she had doubts about in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how it\u2019s any different from the flu. Closing down was too far. People are losing their jobs. And the dollar stores, they\u2019re all open. How do we know it\u2019s not spreading in there? If they were going to shut down, they should have closed everything down, otherwise there\u2019s no point,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"974e04d527caf1222235793dc5724e2ec8e9f25c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/974e04d527caf1222235793dc5724e2ec8e9f25c/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Owner JJ Floyd stands outside JJ\u2019s Down Home Cafe in downtown Odessa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owner JJ Floyd stands outside JJ\u2019s Down Home Cafe in downtown Odessa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barrett Emke/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Floyd doubts she will be able to stay in business if the restrictions continue beyond the start of May. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose my place. I\u2019ve only been here four years,\u201d she said.</p> <p>There is plenty of sympathy for Floyd\u2019s plight in Odessa, a town of about 5,300 people named after the port city in Ukraine. But there is also division over the way forward, as some residents clamour for the city to get back to work, and others fear that Parson, backed by Donald Trump, will risk lives by opening up the state again too soon.</p> <p>That divide is seen across the country in a <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/04/20/when-america-reopens-poll\">YouGov poll</a> showing that 60% of Americans oppose the recent spate of protests demanding the closures be lifted, including a majority of Republicans. More than two-thirds of Americans fear that lifting restrictions too soon could result in a surge of Covid-19 infections.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>60% of Americans oppose the recent spate of protests demanding the lifting of the closures</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The same disagreement is playing out in Odessa, although in a far less confrontational way, and not necessarily along political lines. Some of the president\u2019s supporters in Odessa want to see the shutdown continue, but critics are among the most vocal in claiming the closures have been unnecessary and damaging.</p> <p>Tiffany Watkins, who owns the Black Box Coffee shop across the road from Floyd\u2019s restaurant, has also struggled with loss of business, which is now conducted across a table outside her door. She has laid off four part-time workers and now runs the cafe alone. Sales have halved, although that is better than she expected thanks to a campaign to support local businesses.</p> <p>Watkins said ,she is against Parson\u2019s plan to open up shops again. \u201cI\u2019m on the side of \u2018I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry\u2019. If I have to stay operating like this for months, I\u2019ll do my best to stay open.

I really don\u2019t understand the protesters, because if they open up too soon, everybody\u2019s going to be sick and everybody\u2019s going to stay hurt. It\u2019s not going to make it any better. So I\u2019m totally on board with a slow reopening,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe they opened the beaches in Florida and everybody ran out to them. I can\u2019t understand that mentality.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Watkins is concerned about the long-term damage if the shutdown continues.</p> <p>Like many small midwestern cities and towns, Odessa went into decline in recent decades. For years, the heart of the old town was dotted with abandoned stores as shoppers drove to malls and large supermarkets. But recently it has revived ,and is now lined with shops including a bakery, a creamery, a spa, and a clutch of antique stores that bring shoppers from Kansas City.</p> <p>For many residents, it felt like the city was back. Now they fear all of that is at risk. \u201cI\u2019m nervous if some of the smaller businesses can withstand it. I hope that they can, because we don\u2019t want a ghost town,\u201d said Watkins.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a delicate balance between protecting the community and not ruining the economy.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cynthia Gross was picking up coffee at Watkins\u2019 cafe, wearing a \u201cSave the small town\u201d T-shirt. She thinks the shutdown was an overreaction. \u201cI think it\u2019s been a little extreme. If we protect the vulnerable better, like our nursing homes, I think we can open up,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of questioning if it\u2019s wise to jeopardise our economy and our jobs. It\u2019s a delicate balance between protecting the community and not ruining the economy. There has been very few cases around here.\u201d</p> <p>Odessa is in Lafayette county, which has had 30 confirmed coronavirus infections and one death. But it is less than an hour\u2019s drive from Kansas City, which has seen at least 103 deaths across its metro area. Missouri had more than 6,100 confirmed Covid-19 infections and more than 235 deaths by Thursday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3a8cfd01f537c67c9c4929f8c7cb70c7cf4284da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a8cfd01f537c67c9c4929f8c7cb70c7cf4284da/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Odessa Chiropractic Center owner Tim Kesemann. \u2018It was an overreaction to shut everything down.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Odessa Chiropractic Center owner Tim Kesemann. \u2018It was an overreaction to shut everything down.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barrett Emke/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One state representative, Mike Moon, said that was not enough to warrant the shutdown, and introduced a resolution in the legislature calling for the \u201cimmediate termination\u201d of the state of emergency in Missouri on the grounds that \u201cno natural or man-made disaster of major proportions has actually occurred\u201d.</p> <p>Gross, like many people in Odessa, acknowledges it is difficult to know the extent to which the distancing measures have kept the infection rate down. But others agree with Moon, in questioning whether there was ever any real danger at all.</p> <p>Tim Kesemann, a chiropractor with a practice in the middle of town, is one of those residents who is firmly opposed to Trump on almost every issue. But he thinks the president\u2019s right about opening up businesses again.</p> <p>\u201cI despise the man. Really, really despise Trump. However, I agree with him that the country needs to be reopened,\u201d said Kesemann. \u201cIt was an overreaction to shut everything down. That wasn\u2019t necessary. They\u2019re killing jobs. It should have been more where nursing homes and the like were quarantined.\u201d</p> <p>Kesemann questions the underlying claims about the danger Covid-19 poses, and how many lives have been lost to coronavirus \u2013 or if it\u2019s just a contributory factor in deaths that would have happened anyway from heart disease and other conditions. But even taking the numbers at face value, Kesemann said the shutdown was an overreaction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c8c6c00fa91501878020740fb6b7d1483cde5730\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8c6c00fa91501878020740fb6b7d1483cde5730/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Cook: \u2018I think it was a good thing.

But it can\u2019t go on much longer. \u201cWe\u2019re doing about $300 of business a day, where we were doing 17 or 1800 before,\u201d said Floyd. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work to pay my workers when you don\u2019t have the income.\u201d So far Floyd has kept on her eight employees, although she\u2019s losing money and has almost no income for herself. She is clinging on, in the hope that Missouri\u2019s governor, Mike Parson, will make good on his promise to let restaurants and other businesses open back up when the state\u2019s stay-at-home order expires on 3 May \u2013 a shutdown she had doubts about in the first place. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it\u2019s any different from the flu. Closing down was too far. People are losing their jobs. And the dollar stores, they\u2019re all open. How do we know it\u2019s not spreading in there? If they were going to shut down, they should have closed everything down, otherwise there\u2019s no point,\u201d she said. Floyd doubts she will be able to stay in business if the restrictions continue beyond the start of May. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose my place. I\u2019ve only been here four years,\u201d she said. There is plenty of sympathy for Floyd\u2019s plight in Odessa, a town of about 5,300 people named after the port city in Ukraine. But there is also division over the way forward, as some residents clamour for the city to get back to work, and others fear that Parson, backed by Donald Trump, will risk lives by opening up the state again too soon. That divide is seen across the country in a YouGov poll showing that 60% of Americans oppose the recent spate of protests demanding the closures be lifted, including a majority of Republicans. More than two-thirds of Americans fear that lifting restrictions too soon could result in a surge of Covid-19 infections. The same disagreement is playing out in Odessa, although in a far less confrontational way, and not necessarily along political lines. Some of the president\u2019s supporters in Odessa want to see the shutdown continue, but critics are among the most vocal in claiming the closures have been unnecessary and damaging. Tiffany Watkins, who owns the Black Box Coffee shop across the road from Floyd\u2019s restaurant, has also struggled with loss of business, which is now conducted across a table outside her door. She has laid off four part-time workers and now runs the cafe alone. Sales have halved, although that is better than she expected thanks to a campaign to support local businesses. Watkins said ,she is against Parson\u2019s plan to open up shops again. \u201cI\u2019m on the side of \u2018I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry\u2019. If I have to stay operating like this for months, I\u2019ll do my best to stay open. I\u2019d much prefer to be on the side of caution,\u201d she said. Is that view widely shared in Odessa? \u201cNo. I\u2019ve heard rumblings. I really don\u2019t understand the protesters, because if they open up too soon, everybody\u2019s going to be sick and everybody\u2019s going to stay hurt. It\u2019s not going to make it any better. So I\u2019m totally on board with a slow reopening,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe they opened the beaches in Florida and everybody ran out to them. I can\u2019t understand that mentality.\u201d Still, Watkins is concerned about the long-term damage if the shutdown continues. Like many small midwestern cities and towns, Odessa went into decline in recent decades. For years, the heart of the old town was dotted with abandoned stores as shoppers drove to malls and large supermarkets. But recently it has revived ,and is now lined with shops including a bakery, a creamery, a spa, and a clutch of antique stores that bring shoppers from Kansas City. For many residents, it felt like the city was back. Now they fear all of that is at risk. \u201cI\u2019m nervous if some of the smaller businesses can withstand it. I hope that they can, because we don\u2019t want a ghost town,\u201d said Watkins. Cynthia Gross was picking up coffee at Watkins\u2019 cafe, wearing a \u201cSave the small town\u201d T-shirt. She thinks the shutdown was an overreaction. \u201cI think it\u2019s been a little extreme. If we protect the vulnerable better, like our nursing homes, I think we can open up,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of questioning if it\u2019s wise to jeopardise our economy and our jobs. It\u2019s a delicate balance between protecting the community and not ruining the economy. There has been very few cases around here.\u201d Odessa is in Lafayette county, which has had 30 confirmed coronavirus infections and one death. But it is less than an hour\u2019s drive from Kansas City, which has seen at least 103 deaths across its metro area. Missouri had more than 6,100 confirmed Covid-19 infections and more than 235 deaths by Thursday. One state representative, Mike Moon, said that was not enough to warrant the shutdown, and introduced a resolution in the legislature calling for the \u201cimmediate termination\u201d of the state of emergency in Missouri on the grounds that \u201cno natural or man-made disaster of major proportions has actually occurred\u201d. Gross, like many people in Odessa, acknowledges it is difficult to know the extent to which the distancing measures have kept the infection rate down. But others agree with Moon, in questioning whether there was ever any real danger at all. Tim Kesemann, a chiropractor with a practice in the middle of town, is one of those residents who is firmly opposed to Trump on almost every issue. But he thinks the president\u2019s right about opening up businesses again. \u201cI despise the man. Really, really despise Trump. However, I agree with him that the country needs to be reopened,\u201d said Kesemann. \u201cIt was an overreaction to shut everything down. That wasn\u2019t necessary. They\u2019re killing jobs. It should have been more where nursing homes and the like were quarantined.\u201d Kesemann questions the underlying claims about the danger Covid-19 poses, and how many lives have been lost to coronavirus \u2013 or if it\u2019s just a contributory factor in deaths that would have happened anyway from heart disease and other conditions. But even taking the numbers at face value, Kesemann said the shutdown was an overreaction. \u201cWe\u2019re not at the level of a pandemic. We shut down the entire country for 40,000 deaths? I think that view is 50-50 around here,\u201d he said. But it\u2019s not shared at the local gun shop \u2013 one of the few businesses in town that is not only fully open but has seen sales surge. \u201cIt just went crazy,\u201d said Bill Cook, a salesman. \u201cWe\u2019re selling all kinds of guns. You can\u2019t get gunpowder now. People are loading their own bullets.\u201d Sympathy for Trump is not in short supply at the Lafayette Trading Post, where liberals and their attempts to intrude on gun rights are openly scorned. But Cook is behind the shutdown, and is not in a hurry to see it lifted. \u201cI think it was a good thing. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the right time to open up or not. It\u2019s just tossing a coin,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying the peak is yet to come.\u201d",

We have a small window of opportunity, in overcoming the challenges of the current crisis, to avoid sowing the seeds of future ones.\u201d</p> <p>Professors Josef Settele, Sandra D\u00edaz and Eduardo Brondizio led the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/06/human-society-under-urgent-threat-loss-earth-natural-life-un-report\">most comprehensive planetary health check</a> ever undertaken, which was published in 2019 by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). It concluded that human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth\u2019s natural life-support systems.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://ipbes.net/covid19stimulus\">article published on Monday</a>, with Dr Peter Daszak, who is preparing the <a href=\"https://ipbes.net/nexus\">next IPBES assessment</a>, they write: \u201cRampant deforestation, uncontrolled expansion of agriculture, intensive farming, mining and infrastructure development, as well as the exploitation of wild species have created a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 for the spillover of diseases.\u201d</p> <p>These activities cause pandemics by bringing more people into contact and conflict with animals, from which 70% of emerging human diseases originate, they said.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus pandemic is likely to be followed by even more deadly and destructive disease outbreaks unless their root cause \u2013 the rampant destruction of the natural world \u2013 is rapidly halted, the world\u2019s leading biodiversity experts have warned. \u201cThere is a single species responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 us,\u201d they said. \u201cRecent pandemics are a direct consequence of human activity, particularly our global financial and economic systems that prize economic growth at any cost. We have a small window of opportunity, in overcoming the challenges of the current crisis, to avoid sowing the seeds of future ones.\u201d Professors Josef Settele, Sandra D\u00edaz and Eduardo Brondizio led the most comprehensive planetary health check ever undertaken, which was published in 2019 by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). It concluded that human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth\u2019s natural life-support systems. In an article published on Monday, with Dr Peter Daszak, who is preparing the next IPBES assessment, they write: \u201cRampant deforestation, uncontrolled expansion of agriculture, intensive farming, mining and infrastructure development, as well as the exploitation of wild species have created a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 for the spillover of diseases.\u201d These activities cause pandemics by bringing more people into contact and conflict with animals, from which 70% of emerging human diseases originate, they said. Combined with urbanisation and the explosive growth of global air travel, this enabled a harmless virus in Asian bats to bring \u201cuntold human suffering and halt economies and societies around the world. This is the human hand in pandemic emergence. Yet [Covid-19] may be only the beginning.\u201d \u201cFuture pandemics are likely to happen more frequently, spread more rapidly, have greater economic impact and kill more people if we are not extremely careful about the possible impacts of the choices we make today,\u201d they said.

The Covid-19 audit approach will be outlined in a revised 2020-21 Annual Audit Work Plan (AAWP) which will be provided to the JCPAA in early May 2020 to consider the priorities of the Parliament. The draft AAWP will also be available for public consultation during May 2020.

They will provide more timely assurance to the parliament than the annual review undertaken by the ANAO in the current circumstances in which the appropriation for Advances to the finance minister has been significantly increased to support Australian government activities in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Reports on the assurance reviews are expected to be tabled in parliament each month.</p> \n   <p>You have drawn attention in your correspondence to the amendment agreed by the parliament to the Coronavirus Economic Response Package Omnibus Bill 2020 giving certain powers to the Minister for Families and Social Services. I do not consider that the specific use of such powers lend themselves to the audit and review functions of the ANAO. However, a future audit of the effectiveness of programs or activities undertaken by the government in response to Covid-19 could consider the quality of evidence developed within the public sector to inform the minister\u2019s decisions in this area. <br></p> \n   <p>The monitoring of the use of the powers may be something that the parliament may wish to consider in other ways including the Senate

      "bodyText": "We will wrap up this Australian live coverage now. Thank you for your company and correspondence. We will return tomorrow as this country, and this world, continues to grapple with the Covid-19 pandemic. All of you, stay well, and stay safe. As of tonight: The global death toll from Covid-19 has surpassed 206,000. There are more than 2.9m confirmed cases worldwide, more than 861,000 people have recovered. Australia recorded just nine new cases in the last 24 hours. Australia has had a total of 6,714 confirmed cases. More than 1.89m Australians have downloaded the government\u2019s Covidsafe app. Western Australia and Queensland have, or are seeking to ease some social distancing restrictions. Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy warned \u201ceven if we release restrictions in the future, people need to change the way they interact permanently\u201d. Murphy said: \u201cAnd in the sensible way, like keeping distance from each other, hand hygiene, probably not permanently not shaking hands, but for the foreseeable future. If we are going to relax these distancing measures, the things we have closed, we have to change how we interact as human beings until we are through with this virus.\u201d In New Zealand, some of that country\u2019s restrictions on movement and work will ease, prime minister Jacinda Ardern saying the country had suppressed the \u201cwidespread, undetected community transmission\u201d of Covid-19. To continue following global updates, see our international blog here. In news that is of intense interest to your correspondent, Bondi, Bronte and Tamarama beaches are set to reopen for swimming and surfing at 7am tomorrow morning. In the interests of journalistic rigour, I shall be at Tama at 7.01am to see how it\u2019s all going. Thank me not, beloved readers, it\u2019s all part of the service. From AAP: Waverley council mayor Paula Masselos says the waters at Bondi, Bronte and Tamarama beaches will reopen on Tuesday morning \u201cfor the sole purpose of exercising\u201d. The beaches themselves will remain closed given the local area has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in Australia. People will be able to swim or surf at Bondi and Bronte and surf only at Tamarama between 7am and 5pm on weekdays. Access to the water will be via designated entry and exit points. \u201cOur beaches remain closed to all land-based activities including social gatherings, sunbaking, walking and jogging,\u201d Masselos said in a statement on Monday. \u201cThere will be no relaxing or gathering around on the sand. The sand remains strictly off limits other than for access to the water for exercising. \u201cWaverley is still a hot spot and presently has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in Australia.\u201d The mayor said the \u201cswim and go\u201d and \u201csurf and go\u201d measures were strictly for Waverley residents exercising locally and people shouldn\u2019t drive to the beaches from further afield. Neighbouring Randwick City Council reopened its beaches \u2013 including Clovelly, Coogee and Maroubra \u2013 a week ago but was forced to close them again on Friday when crowds descended on the sand and people couldn\u2019t follow safe social distancing practices. The patrolled beaches were reopened on Saturday but only from 6am to 9am until Monday. All of Randwick\u2019s beaches will again reopen from Tuesday without any time restrictions. Residents are allowed on the sand so long as they are \u201cjogging or doing some legitimate exercise\u201d. \u201cLifeguards, rangers and other council staff will continue to monitor numbers on the sand and in the water and will restrict access or temporarily close beaches if crowd numbers exceed safe limits,\u201d Randwick council said in a statement on Monday. Mayor Danny Said said: \u201cOur message could not be simpler \u2013 Randwick City beaches are to be used for exercise only.\u201d Northern Beaches council chief executive Ray Brownlee on Monday said only Dee Why, Freshwater and Manly beaches were closed in the city\u2019s north. \u201cCouncil will continue to review the situation .... in the coming week,\u201d he said in a statement. Victoria has tested more than 100,000 people for coronavirus over three months. It now wants to double that number in a fortnight. This, from the state\u2019s premier, Dan Andrews, who argues a more widespread testing regimen will more accurately map the extent of the virus in the community. In New Zealand - where strict lockdowns are set to ease tonight - prime minister Jacinda Ardern has successfully suppressed the \u201cwidespread, undetected community transmission\u201d of Covid-19. Confusing and stressful: the debate around around children and coronavirus as some Australian schools reopen. Melissa Davey has filed this important story: With some schools around Australia set to reopen during the second school term, debate has reignited as to whether school staff, students and their families are at risk, and whether measures to halt the spread of coronavirus will be jeopardised. My indefatigable colleague Paul Karp has been following up earlier reports about a $90,000 in specialist cleaning contracts entered into by the home affairs department as a response to Covid-19. The cleaning contracts are not related to the home affairs minister Peter Dutton\u2019s infection with the virus. A spokesperson said: The Department of Home Affairs has entered into standing orders with vendors to undertake specialist precautionary cleaning. The standing orders do not relate to minister [Peter] Dutton\u2019s illness. Protecting the privacy of our officers and staff is important and it would be inappropriate to comment further. Latrell Mitchell and Josh Addo-Carr have been fined by NSW police for breaking social distancing laws as the NRL continues to investigate their weekend gathering near Taree. Mitchell admitted on Instagram the Kangaroos stars had \u201cslipped up\u201d, as he and the Melbourne winger both apologised for their behaviour amid a pandemic. Photos posted by Addo-Carr showed the pair with 10 other men around a fire, prompting the NRL to label the pictures as disappointing and unacceptable. The fine also came on the same day the league further pushed its claim for a return, discussing its strict biosecurity rules with clubs on Monday afternoon. But Mitchell insisted they did not mean to flout rules imposed by the federal and state governments to stem the coronavirus pandemic. Mitchell said in a video: I have been up here with my family for four or five weeks practising social distancing. It was a little bit of a slip up. Foxy (Addo-Carr) reached out, his cousins are going through a bit of stuff up in Sydney. He just wanted to get up to the bush and make sure they were getting cultured and connected again. That was the whole part of the concept of what the weekend was. I wasn\u2019t here to break any rules or hurt anyone. We\u2019re not being selfish, I couldn\u2019t turn down the brothers in a time of need. On behalf of Foxy and all my mob, we do want to apologise. A repentant Addo-Carr said \u201cnothing was intentional or deliberate\u201d as he tried to \u201cput a smile on the faces\u201d of family members going through a tough time. Newcastle are also investigating the involvement of Tyronne Roberts-Davis after their NRL squad member was seen in one of Addo-Carr\u2019s photos. But the NSW police decided they had broken health rules, slapping the trio with a fine late on Monday afternoon. Under NSW guidelines people can only leave the house for work, essential shopping, exercise, medical appointments and compassionate visits. President of the Australian Medical Association Dr Tony Bartone has been speaking with Patricia Karvelas on the ABC. He says he has signed up to the CovidSafe app and \u201cI\u2019ve certainly recommended it to all my family and friends, my patients, and my colleagues\u201d. Bartone has said Australians have responded \u201cmarvellously\u201d to the impositions of isolation, shutdowns and social distancing. But he has warned Australia has not defeated the virus yet, and there is a significant risk that if restrictions are lifted too early or too hastily, a second peak of infection could be worse than the first. I think it\u2019s important to understand that as we come out of this initial first phase of Covid-19, and I do stress this is a first phase, we\u2019ve dealt with the initial wave and there is still a very long way to go. So lifting the restrictions too quickly or too early will see us, perhaps, even in a worse state than what we anticipated we would have been in. We need to keep the pressure on but we need to obviously get on with our life where and when we can. So gradual, sensible, logical-paced lifting of those restrictions is part of it. Some states will be able to do it sooner than others because they\u2019re at different points or different parts of that trajectory of that curve, which has now obviously flattened considerably. As an aside: there is historical precedent for this: in the immediate aftermath of WWI, Australia was spared the very worst of the Spanish flu outbreak, aided by geography and the delay the steam-ship age afforded a distant continent to implement a strict quarantine regime. But when the flu did break in Australia, it killed an estimated 17,000 people, and it did so in three waves, the first in February, the second in April. The third wave, in July, was by far the most deadly. Our spoilsport friends at AAP have reported the end of the mystery surrounding this alleged underground dinner party of doctors. An investigation into claims of an \u201cillegal dinner party\u201d of health workers in northwest Tasmania has found no evidence a gathering occurred. A police investigation has found no evidence health workers in north-west Tasmania held an \u201cillegal dinner party\u201d that contributed to Covid-19 spread. The probe was launched earlier this month after the claim was made by Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy in evidence to a NZ parliamentary hearing, which he then quickly rescinded. \u201cInvestigators have determined that there is no evidence of such a gathering occurring,\u201d Tasmania Police said in a statement on Monday. All but one of the state\u2019s 11 virus deaths have been in the north-west, amid an outbreak at the private and public hospitals in Burnie where scores of staff tested positive. Good afternoon, Ben Doherty here. My grateful thanks to my antecessors Amy Remeikis and Michael McGowan. An update from Western Australia, and it is excellent news again. There have been no new cases reported in the state over the past 24 hours. This is the second day in a row of no new cases. The state\u2019s total stands at 549, with 55 active cases. Of these, 23 are from the Artania cruise ship, two are from interstate and 30 cases are WA locals. This morning, Western Australia started a \u201ccautious relaxation\u201d of some of the restrictions, scrapping the two-person rule and allowing for indoor and outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people. And that\u2019s the end of my short stint at the wheel. I\u2019ll hand you over to Ben Doherty who will take you through the evening. NRL stars Latrell Mitchell and Josh Addo-Carr have apologised as NSW Police and the NRL investigate whether the Kangaroos duo broke social-distancing laws. AAP reports that Mitchell admitted on Instagram on Monday afternoon the pair had \u201cslipped up\u201d after Addo-Carr on Sunday posted images on social media of them among a group on a property near Taree over the weekend. On the same day the NRL gave clubs a draft of strict new biosecurity rules for the ambitious season restart on 28 May, the photos showed the pair with 10 other men around a fire. The NRL on Monday labelled the images as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. But Mitchell insisted they did not mean to flout rules imposed by the federal and state governments to stem the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI have been up here with my family for four or five weeks practising social distancing,\u201d Mitchell said in a video. \u201cIt was a little bit of a slip up. \u201cFoxy [Addo-Carr] reached out, his cousins are going through a bit of stuff up in Sydney. \u201cHe just wanted to get up to the bush and make sure they were getting cultured and connected again. That was the whole part of the concept of what the weekend was. It wasn\u2019t here to break any rules or hurt anyone. We\u2019re not being selfish, I couldn\u2019t turn down the brothers in a time of need. On behalf of Foxy and all my mob, we do want to apologise.\u201d A repentant Addo-Carr said \u201cnothing was intentional or deliberate\u201d as he tried to \u201cput a smile on the faces\u201d of family members going through a tough time. All NRL players agreed to health and safety protocols when the competition was stopped for the shutdown. Melbourne said they would leave any punishment of Storm winger Addo-Carr over the matter to \u201crelevant authorities\u201d, while South Sydney said they\u2019d ensure Mitchell cooperates with investigations. Newcastle are also investigating the involvement of Tyronne Roberts-Davis after their NRL squad member was seen in one of Addo-Carr\u2019s photos. If you missed this earlier, Australian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes has urged his industry to \u201cturn the ... angry mob mode off\u201d and support the Covidsafe app. Writing on the tech social news board Hacker News, the Atlassian co-founder said he believed the government when it said it would release the app\u2019s source code, and said he commended them \u201con some smart privacy and security choices\u201d. My very clever colleague Josh Taylor has produced this handy explainer about the government\u2019s Covidsafe app. Very worth reading if, like me, you still have unanswered questions. Professor Peter Doherty is perhaps Australia\u2019s foremost expert on Covid-19. In 1996 he won the Nobel prize for medicine for his work studying the immune system, and the Doherty Institute that bears his name is at the forefront of Australian research on the virus. Now he has also (accidentally) won the prize for best Tweet of the pandemic. And in New South Wales a 48-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly coughing at a security guard in Wollongong earlier today. Police allege that at about 9am, as the man was allegedly leaving a government building, he allegedly became verbally abusive towards security staff. As a security officer directed the man to leave the building, he allegedly turned and coughed in his face. Officers from Wollongong attended a short time later and began inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the incident. A 48-year-old man was arrested outside the building and taken to Wollongong police station, where he was charged with assault. He was refused bail and is due to appear in Wollongong local court today. NSW has introduced $5,000 fines for people who cough or spit at workers. Good afternoon. Thanks as always to the keeper of the flame (blog), Amy Remeikis. I\u2019ve just been on my daily trip to the corner deli for a can of Coke - easily the most exciting thing in my life right now - and am ready and raring to take you through the next few hours. As Queensland prepares to relax some of its Covid-19 restrictions, the state\u2019s police are not stepping back from enforcement. They\u2019ve set up an online form encouraging people to dob on each other for potential breaches of Public Health Orders. Queensland has issued 1,400 fines for breaches of the orders. Josh Garlepp has that little piece of levity the ABC just had to apologise for broadcasting (the perils of a live outside broadcast). And on that note, I shall hand you over to Michael McGowan, with the same energy. Thank you again for joining me today. I very much appreciate it, and your messages. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning. Please \u2013 take care of you. Liberal senator, David Fawcett, a member of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security has strongly backed the government\u2019s hard line in rejecting China\u2019s threats over an investigation into Covid-19. Fawcett told Guardian Australia: In late 2017 (following release of the foreign policy white paper and passage of the foreign interference laws) the [Chinese Communist Party] tried the same tactic (threat of consumer boycott) to no avail. We will stand up for Australia, for a rules based order and for transparency between nations. Reuters are reporting the CCP have also been pressuring the EU not to report on concerns about actions by the CCP in relation to Covid-19. There is a Chinese proverb that says \u2018a man with a straight foot need not fear a crooked shoe\u2019. If their actions have been as they claim, the CCP should welcome the proposal for full transparency and cooperation by all nations, a call well expressed by foreign minister Marise Payne in her OpEd of 22 April.\u201d WA is also pushing to increase the number of flu vaccinations in the state. Health minister Roger Cook was asked what his message to anti-vaxxers was and responded: The important message is vaccinations save lives. This program is fundamental to keep older people and the vulnerable members of our community safe. Vaccination has clinically been proven over many years. Anti-vaxxers, get out of the way or stay home because we need the community to be protected from this very difficult disease. Eighty people lost their lives last year to the flu. The best protection we can have is people getting their flu jabs to make sure we can protect everyone in the community. For those wondering, this time around, Mark McGowan responded to the exuberant constituent hanging out of what I assume was his best friend\u2019s ride, trying to holler at him, with That\u2019s not the sort of language you normally hear in Rockingham. AAP reports that the \u201cswim and go\u201d and \u201csurf and go\u201d beach openings will be extended to Bondi beach tomorrow morning: Waverley Council mayor Paula Masselos says the waters at Bondi, Bronte and Tamarama beaches will reopen on Tuesday morning \u201cfor the sole purpose of exercising\u201d. People will be able to swim or surf at Bondi and Bronte and surf only at Tamarama between 7am and 5pm on weekdays. Access to the water will be via designated entry and exit points. \u201cOur beaches remain closed to all land-based activities including social gatherings, sunbaking, walking and jogging,\u201d Masselos said in a statement on Monday. \u201cThere will be no relaxing or gathering around on the sand. The sand remains strictly off-limits other than for access to the water for exercising. \u201cWaverley is still a hot spot and presently has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in Australia.\u201d The mayor said the \u201cswim and go\u201d and \u201csurf and go\u201d measures were strictly for Waverley residents exercising locally and people shouldn\u2019t drive to the beaches from further afield. It is a public holiday in WA, so Mark McGowan is in a polo shirt. These are the sorts of things which keep me amused at the moment. As does West Australians driving past and yelling \u201cI fucking love you\u201d out their window. Which just happened, making McGowan laugh almost as half as he did when he said \u201cwe are not making it unlawful to go for a run and eat a kebab\u201d. Memories. They light the corner of my mind. Western Australia joins the list of jurisdictions with no new cases in the past 24 hours But the chief medical officer again warns people not to get too excited too quickly: I don\u2019t want to preempt the national cabinet discussion, it\u2019s not just the local epidemiology, we have to assure the national cabinet that our public health response is up to scratch. We think it may be one of the best in the world, we want it to be the best in the world, so we have to have that testing expansion we talked about, we have to have all the elements in place as well as the local epidemiology. We do strongly feel that making too many changes too quickly, could be risky. We have seen what\u2019s happened in other countries, that suddenly had a problem that appeared they didn\u2019t know about. And his advice to people who began gathering in large numbers again this weekend just gone? Don\u2019t! Brendan Murphy says there doesn\u2019t have to be zero cases of Covid-19 to convince national cabinet to relax restrictions: National cabinet has endorsed a strategy of significant suppression, if we get elimination as part of that which we are probably are seeing in some parts of the country that is fantastic, elimination is never a certain situation, because you can never be sure, the fact you haven\u2019t detected in cases for a week doesn\u2019t mean there might be some cases circulating, so you still have to have all those public health response measures. On New Zealand, which went harder than Australia in an attempt to eliminate the virus, the professor says: It is a semantic difference between our situation here and New Zealand is very similar, in terms of per capita case numbers they have certainly because they are a smaller population with very few cases at the moment, but they would recognise elimination as a label, because you cannot be 100% sure there aren\u2019t cases you are not detecting. So you still have to do all of that surveillance, testing, and have all the response capabilities ready if you release measures, you can\u2019t be sure about elimination for many months, until after you have released measures. We are in a very similar position, it\u2019s a somewhat semantic difference, both countries are committed to really controlling the virus to as low as possible, and of possible elimination, that\u2019s great. Chris Knaus and Ben Smee have just published this story: The app only takes note of someone you have been around for 15 minutes. Prof Brendan Murphy says there is a reason for that \u2013 privacy, being one: You have to make a balanced assessment on that. Obviously you wouldn\u2019t want to be capturing every brief contact. Our case definition based on the epidemiology that we\u2019ve seen around the world, that that sort of level of time in a contact presents a much higher risk than just brushing past someone in the corridor. We don\u2019t want to give the contact tracers a list of 1,000 phone numbers when there are 25 that are much more relevant in terms of potential contact, so those decisions are made on the best available epidemiological advice at the time. The commonwealth has no access to any of the data. We have locked this down so completely, so thoroughly with the bio security bill and legislation that is coming, the only people who can access the data are the state and territory health officials. All we are told is how many people are updating it because we won\u2019t know anything about who they are all where they live because we have a contract with the Australian public. This app will only ever be used by public health officials in the purposes of contact tracing. That is what it is for, it will never be used for any other purpose. The source code for the tracing app (as much as the security agencies will allow to be released) will be available within two weeks. The chief medical officer does not want to comment on NRL players breaking physical restriction measures to go camping, and then posting it on social media. I am not aware of the circumstance of that, so I really can\u2019t comment. It is disappointing when anyone breaches restrictions, but the behaviour of individuals shouldn\u2019t interfere with a holistic assessment of any proposals we might get in the future. But professor Brendan Murphy again reminds people that life will not be going back to what we knew as normal, until there is a vaccine: Obviously the lower the numbers and the better the testing it is more difficult to catch it, but we have seen outbreaks of 35 people from one case in a wedding. It is highly infectious, so if you have someone, particularly who we believe sheds a lot of virus, what we call a super spreader, that person can infect a lot of people quickly. Even though we may have very low numbers of cases we want everyone to practise social distancing. Even if we release restrictions in the future, people need to change the way they interact permanently \u2013 permanently. And in the sensible way, like keeping distance from each other, hand hygiene, probably not permanently not shaking hands, but for the foreseeable future. If we are going to relax these distancing measures, the things we have closed, we have to change how we interact as human beings until we are through with this virus. The chief medical officer once again urged Australians to download the tracing app: We will start testing for asymptomatic people to try and be absolutely sure that we are capturing every case that we can and we are not missing cases, we don\u2019t think we are missing significant numbers of cases in Australia, but if we are going to consider at the national cabinet in a few weeks time in relaxation of distancing measures, we have to be so well-prepared. Part of that preparedness is the app. I am really excited over a million Australians downloaded it just in the first evening. That is an amazing and really gratifying outcome. I am so proud of my fellow citizens. He says everyone in his family (including him) all the doctors he knows, and he assumes journalists have downloaded the app as well. It\u2019s voluntary, so read up on it and make your own decision, based on what you are comfortable with. Professor Brendan Murphy is giving the national update on where Australia stands, today: Over the last week we have certainly seen daily numbers that were significantly lower than the previous week, but as I have said on many occasions, the fact we are still picking up new cases means that we obviously cannot be complacent. Someone was asking about the number of hospitalised patients, there are 113 people in hospital at the moment, 43 people still in intensive care and 27 people currently receiving support from ventilators. Those numbers again have come down significantly, over the last few weeks. As you know there are some jurisdictions in Australia that have had no new cases for some days. Our suppression strategy is working well. From the chatter I have seen on social media, it seems being able to order takeaway food is the thing our trans-Tasman cousins are most excited about. I wish them all the dumplings in the world. You can read the full story here: Jacinda Ardern says there is \u201cno widespread underlying community transmission in New Zealand. We have won that battle,\u201d as the country prepares to relax some of its restrictions. AAP has some more on that press conference we touched on a little while ago: Ardern said about 400,000 Kiwis would return to their workplaces on Tuesday with the lessening of the country\u2019s clampdown from level four to level three. The shift has only a small effect on the social lives of New Zealanders, who are still being asked to stay home and to practice social distancing. But the change is vital for business, with many industries severely sidelined over the last month. Ardern has maintained a health-first approach to fighting Covid-19, arguing a drastic short-term action would benefit the economy in the long run. The result has produced remarkably low case numbers. On Monday, health officials reported the country\u2019s 19th death from 1,122 confirmed coronavirus cases. The latest death was a woman aged in her 90s, linked to the St Margaret\u2019s residential aged care facility in Auckland. All of New Zealand\u2019s deaths have been elderly people, with a majority from clusters linked to either the St Margaret\u2019s home or Rosewood rest care home in Christchurch, with 10 deaths. Hospitalisation rates have shown the strength of New Zealand\u2019s public health response; fewer than 90 people have been to hospital with the disease. The federal education minister, Dan Tehan, has signalled he will look at providing help to childcare centres that rely on migrant workers who are excluded from the jobkeeper wage subsidy. As Amy mentioned earlier today, Tehan has announced $27m will be spent on grants of up to $10,000 per service to keep childcare centres open. In an interview on Sky News, Tehan acknowledged the government was having to step in to deal with some unintended consequences of the \u201ccompletely new\u201d funding system that it had put in place extremely quickly. \u201cThere will always be some unintended consequences,\u201d he said. Interestingly, Tehan said childcare centres that relied on migrant workers \u2013 who are ineligible for the jobkeeper payments that were meant to go hand in hand with the broader childcare relief package \u2013 would be considered as part of the imminent review into how the system is working.\u201d That\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re going to be looking at when we do the one-month review ... that we are starting next week.\u201d As it stands the childcare relief package \u2013 with its promise of free childcare \u2013 is due to expire at the end of June (three months), but the government has always suggested it could be in place for six months, in line with other economic support measures. Tehan said childcare services were currently running at 40-60% of normal capacity. He said hopefully as the country continued to flatten the curve and more restrictions were lifted, attendance rates would increase and the old system could come back into effect, but \u201cwe don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet\u201d. On schools, Tehan reaffirmed his previous call for all states and territories to have classroom instruction back to normal for all age levels by the end of May. The ACCC has released its interim report as part of its inquiry into Australian home loans. It found that there wasn\u2019t a lot of transparency in the cost of loans, or difference in the mortgage rates for the four big banks. It also found that the banks only dropped their rates when the RBA slashed the cash rate. And it could take a while to do even that, meaning the banks picked up revenue in the lag time. While each big four bank announced their rate changes on the day of or the day following the RBA\u2019s cash rate decision, changes to the big four banks\u2019 headline variable rates came into effect 9 to 21 days after the banks announced their rate changes (see table 1.2). We refer to the time between a bank\u2019s announcement date and the date the bank\u2019s rate change came into effect as the lag period. Each bank had a consistent lag period following each of the three headline variable rate changes in June, July and October 2019; with CBA consistently having a significantly longer lag period than the other big four banks.The banks informed the ACCC that their respective lag periods allowed sufficient time to implement the required business and operational changes that follow a change in the headline variable rate. You\u2019ll find the whole report here Chris Bowen, who has downloaded the app, says it is one more step towards whatever new normal will greet Australia once the restrictions begin being relaxed: Just as we see some encouraging signs around the country when it comes to infection rates. But there\u2019s a long way to go yet. No room for complacency. No room for people thinking we\u2019re through this. Tomorrow of course the Katy Gallagher-chaired Covid-19 committee will also sit, hear evidence from the treasury, and explore the economic handling of the Covid crisis. We\u2019re glad that parliament is now going to sit on May 11 and that week. We want it to sit more than that. In the meantime, through the Senate committee and through other committees, we\u2019ll hold the government to account and provide constructive engagement to the government on the task at hand. ACT Health has released its daily update \u2013 there have been no new cases of Covid diagnosed in the territory in the last 24 hours, which is becoming quite the trend (as it is for the NT and South Australia). There have been no new cases of Covid-19 recorded in the ACT in the past 24 hours. The ACT\u2019s total is still 106. A total of 100 cases have recovered from Covid-19 and have been released from self-isolation. There is currently one (1) Covid-19 patient in a Canberra hospital. They are in a stable condition. The remaining cases are isolating at home with ACT Health support. The ACT has recorded three (3) deaths. The number of negative tests in the ACT is now 7,996. The NT is announcing the relaxation of restrictions now but, like Queensland, they won\u2019t be lifted until the weekend. The Northern Territory joins WA and Qld in announcing a slight relaxation of restrictions. Here was Michael Gunner on ABC radio this morning: \u201cWe\u2019re aiming towards people in the Northern Territory to live the new normal in June. \u201cPlease go back to that context, saying we\u2019re safe, but not immune. I want people to understand that. \u201cThe second wave of these things are possible. The last thing I\u2019ll be touching are the borders.\u201d Speaking at a press conference now, Gunner says if restrictions are relaxed, the responsibility on residents grows even bigger \u2013 and he warns \u201cdon\u2019t be a Bondi\u201d. The Chinese ambassador spoke to the AFR on the weekend and said Australia\u2019s pursuit of an inquiry into the origins of Covid-19 and China\u2019s reaction could result in a consumer retaliation. You can find that story here Marise Payne has responded: Australia has made a principled call for an independent review of the Covid-19 outbreak, an unprecedented global crisis with severe health, economic and social impacts. This would be undertaken at an appropriate time, fully acknowledging that many countries are continuing to deal with the challenges of the virus. A transparent and honest assessment of events will be critical as we emerge from the pandemic and learn important lessons to improve our response in the future. We hope all members of the WHO would cooperate in such an effort, including to strengthen the WHO\u2019s role in responding effectively to a pandemic. We reject any suggestion that economic coercion is an appropriate response to a call for such an assessment, when what we need is global cooperation. In case anyone was still at a loss as to which minister was in charge of Services Australia (formerly Centrelink), it\u2019s Stuart Robert. Australians who were today expecting a boost to their welfare payments courtesy of the government\u2019s new $550 a fortnight coronavirus supplement will have to wait a little longer. Although the Treasury website states the boosted payments will flow from 27 April, it will only be paid once welfare recipients have \u201creported income for the period that covers 27 April\u201d, Services Australia advised on Monday. However, the clarification has frustrated some welfare recipients, who had expected the boosted payments to flow from today. \u201cPeople who reported their income last week were expecting to receive the boosted rate this week \u2014 they were counting on it,\u201d said Jeremy Poxon, of the Australian Unemployed Workers Union. Welfare recipients are required to report their income to Centrelink over a fortnightly period in order to receive their next payment. However, government messaging on the Treasury and Services Australia websites merely stated that the supplement would \u201ccommence from 27 April 2020\u201d. Looks like the SA education server has been overloaded The confusion continues, particularly for some of our most vulnerable After Labor requested the auditor general review of the Covid-19 spending, to ensure oversight, the office has said it will look over the economic response. From the auditor general\u2019s letter: I intend to develop and publish an audit program of the government\u2019s Covid-19 response, and work is now under way to develop the approach. The audit program will focus on providing parliament with transparency and assurance on management of the response. It is normal practice for the AAWP to take account of the audit priorities of the parliament determined by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA). The Covid-19 audit approach will be outlined in a revised 2020-21 Annual Audit Work Plan (AAWP) which will be provided to the JCPAA in early May 2020 to consider the priorities of the Parliament. The draft AAWP will also be available for public consultation during May 2020. I expect that the ANAO\u2019s 2020-21 AAWP will be released in July 2020, although some Covid-19 related audits may commence before then. I have decided to conduct assurance reviews of the Advances to the Finance Minister (AFM). These reviews will be conducted in accordance with section 19A of the Auditor-General Act 1997 (the Act). They will provide more timely assurance to the parliament than the annual review undertaken by the ANAO in the current circumstances in which the appropriation for Advances to the finance minister has been significantly increased to support Australian government activities in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Reports on the assurance reviews are expected to be tabled in parliament each month. You have drawn attention in your correspondence to the amendment agreed by the parliament to the Coronavirus Economic Response Package Omnibus Bill 2020 giving certain powers to the Minister for Families and Social Services. I do not consider that the specific use of such powers lend themselves to the audit and review functions of the ANAO. However, a future audit of the effectiveness of programs or activities undertaken by the government in response to Covid-19 could consider the quality of evidence developed within the public sector to inform the minister\u2019s decisions in this area. The monitoring of the use of the powers may be something that the parliament may wish to consider in other ways including the Senate Select Committee on Covid-19. The chief medical officer, professor Brendan Murphy, will give the national Covid update at 2pm. That\u2019s about an hour earlier than usual, so the meetings must be getting shorter. Bob Katter starts off with the right idea \u2013 that it is kinda absurd to count a \u201cstrategic oil reserve\u201d, which is designed to ensure a nation has emergency fuel stocks in the event of a conflict or a supply chain cut, IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, but then he strays into Bob Katter territory and the statement falls off the edge of a cliff (let a thousand flowers bloom): \u201cThree submarines could simply cut off Australia\u2019s entire oil supply,\u201d Katter said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have an operational defence force without petrol and diesel; it leaves us extremely vulnerable to attack. \u201cOur current storage and refining infrastructure leaves us with less than a month of fuel supply.\u201d Katter said ethanol was the solution to the current crisis and called on the federal and state governments to mandate ethanol and build an adequate amount of fuel storage infrastructure \u2013 including more refineries. \u201cI have been talking about ethanol for 30 years; Katter\u2019s Australian party has endorsed ethanol since its inception,\u201d he said. \u201cMore people die a year in Australia from petrol fumes than they have from coronavirus (Ref: 1,715 deaths in 2019, Sydney Morning Herald). \u201cEvery other country on earth has moved to ethanol for that very reason. \u201cThe studies done in California left no question that the particles and carcinogens in petrol make it extremely volatile, not in regional areas, but most certainly in built up city areas like Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. \u201cAustralia seems to be the only country on earth that doesn\u2019t care if a few thousand of its citizens die from motor vehicle emissions each year, and is happy to leave its army powerless to defend the nation.\u201d Australia will be allowed to count oil reserves held in the United States towards its stockpiling commitments, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has confirmed. Last week the energy minister, Angus Taylor, announced the government would take advantage of historically low fuel prices and spend $94m to start building a national oil reserve - but the move raised eyebrows because the oil will be stored in the US at first. Under IEA rules, Australia and other member countries have an obligation to hold emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net oil imports as part of planning to avoid a hit from any major disruption to oil supplies. But Australia\u2019s stocks were equivalent to just 55 days as of December. We contacted the IEA to check whether the oil to be held in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the US would count towards Australia\u2019s IEA 90-day stockpiling commitment. \u201cThe answer is simply: yes, we can confirm,\u201d the IEA\u2019s press office replied. Fatih Birol, the IEA director, welcomed the announcement, saying it would not only boost Australia\u2019s oil security but support efforts to stabilise global oil markets. The IEA allows member countries to store emergency stocks abroad as long as a bilateral agreement is in place to guarantee access during a crisis. A woman in her 90s, who had been diagnosed with Covid-19, has become the 19th person to die in New Zealand. AAP has the latest from Aristocrat leisure \u2013 the gaming giant is seeing whether or not it is eligible for the Australian wage subsidy, as well as what it is eligible for in the US: Gaming giant Aristocrat Leisure will cut staff and impose pay cuts on employees and management and won\u2019t declare a dividend as it copes with the fallout from COVID-19 lockdowns. The poker machine manufacturer is standing down 1,000 staff from May 1 until June, eliminating another 200 roles and transitioning another 200 jobs to part-time until September. An Aristocrat Leisure spokeswoman says most of the stood-down roles are in the United States, where the company has the bulk of its workforce, but it has also stood down \u201ca few hundred\u201d workers in Australia. It is also cutting the pay of 1,500 of its 4,000 staff until the end of September. Most of the pay cuts are from 10 to per 20 per cent, while chief executive Trevor Croker takes a 30 per cent reduction in his base salary. Mr Croker made $1.6 million in 2019, plus another $4 million in bonuses and share-based payments, according to the company\u2019s annual report. This is all going very well NSW Health, which is urging more people to get tested as it works to identify community spread (if any) has released an update on areas it is concentrating on: NSW Health is urging people with symptoms, including mild symptoms, to be tested to ensure as many cases of Covid-19 in the community are as identified as quickly as possible. This is particularly important in several new areas, following a small number of locally acquired cases. These include: \u00b7 City of Lithgow Local Government Area \u00b7 City of Blue Mountains Local Government Area \u00b7 Hornsby Shire Council Local Government Area \u00b7 Lane Cove Council Local Government Area \u00b7 Northern Beaches Council Local Government Area Jacinda Ardern says New Zealand is 11 hours away from lifting its lockdown to level three \u2013 what Australia has now. She says New Zealand\u2019s sentinel testing (testing across the community, including those without symptoms) shows the virus has not spread across the community unchecked and authorities have a handle on it. NZ has had one new case in the past 24 hours. Ardern sends her love to the families of 18 New Zealanders the country was \u201cunable to save\u201d with its lockdowns. Meanwhile, while I am not advocating physical distance restrictions be broken, this seems a little over the top, given that NRL players are about to be allowed to train together again \u2013 and last time I checked, that included some pretty close contact: Queensland may be open to the NRL returning on 28 May, if the restrictions are all followed: The Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, has announced an independent review into what happened with the north-west outbreak: It will be undertaken at a time that is appropriate in terms of our response. I\u2019m not convinced that type of investigation and report needs to wait until the pandemic emergency concludes. But what I am absolutely convinced of is it must be at a time that enables us to keep our senior people focused on what they\u2019re doing. And our senior people need to be able to continue provide 100% and remain 100% of their focus on this \u2013 both outbreak and response \u2013 more broadly across the state. I want to be clear \u2013 an independent review will be conducted. It will be conducted by people with appropriate qualifications, and as I said, either a person or persons. We\u2019ll work through that and frame up the terms of reference and we\u2019ll ensure that that takes place at an appropriate time. But, to be clear, that doesn\u2019t mean we are going to wait until this pandemic is over. What it does mean is it will ensure that we can keep our senior people focused on the task at hand, at the moment, as we work through these challenging circumstances but when the time is right, the review and investigation will take place. For more information on the Victorian mass Covid-19 testing plan, you can head here. Better housing options should always be a priority in any developed economy. Australia has an opportunity to rethink how it treats social housing in the near future \u2013 as well as help the economy, this piece argues. Daniel Andrews: I also just want to provide a small note of caution. There are a number of cities and countries around the world that have eased off the sort of restrictions that they had in place. That might have made them very popular at the time, but not long after that, the virus got away from them. They were left in the terrible position where they had to wind back, they had to put even harder lockdown provisions in place. We don\u2019t want that here. We don\u2019t want to have a situation where our frustration gets the better of us and we give back all the gains that we have made. However, if people follow the rules and get tested, we will have options. Those options will have been hard-won. We will still proceed carefully and cautiously so as not to give back all the gains that we have made. People have given too much, people have done too much hard work to have a situation where we waste it away because we are getting impatient and frustrated with the new normal. I get it, I understand, it is very challenging. There is also a lot of frustration and very real pain out there. Do it for those who may die because of coronavirus, do it for those who are working so hard to protect all of us. Do it for those people who have lost their jobs. It doesn\u2019t matter for what reason, do it because it is the right thing and it is the smart thing. Follow the rules and over the next two weeks, get tested. Daniel Andrews says Victoria won\u2019t move to relax the restrictions without looking at the data first. And as part of that, he says the state plans on testing 100,000 people over the next two weeks as part of the biggest testing program in the state\u2019s history, to ensure it has a handle on the Covid-19 outbreak. Victoria has recorded one new case of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. It has moved one case from its tally to NSW though, so its state total stays at 1,349. There are 23 people in hospital, with 11 patients in intensive care. Crossbench senator Pauline Hanson, who made a big deal of laying down on her own property to see if police would arrest her during the height of the lockdowns (despite lying down in the land surrounding your fancy Queenslander property never having been against the rules) is now making it clear she will not be downloading the app, because she doesn\u2019t want the government to have her information. (Not that they need an app for that \u2013 there are the books, plus the never-ending Facebook posts, plus the blog posts, plus the media appearances whenever someone has a camera in the vicinity, plus the billboards, plus she \u2018has the guts to say what you\u2019re thinking\u2019, plus the Senate speeches, plus the opinion pieces, plus the skywriting (I assume).) Anyways, Hanson is still on breakfast TV, for \u201creasons\u201d. The Home Affairs Department has spent a total of $90,000 on a series of four contracts for \u201cdecontamination services\u201d and \u201cspecialist cleaning of areas exposed to Covid-19\u201d. The contracts went to Kamberra Indigenous Cleaning Pty (Fyshwick, ACT), Asset Restoration Pty Ltd (Minto, NSW), OS Group Australia Pty Ltd (Bankstown, NSW) and GJ &amp; K Cleaning Services Pty Ltd (Collingwood, Victoria). It was revealed on 13 March that the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, had contracted coronavirus after a trip to the US, and reported that commonwealth offices in Sydney were cleaned by workers in full protective gear as a result. But the four contracts, all awarded by limited tender, are for periods which start on 27 March, 6 April or 7 April \u2013 so it\u2019s unclear if they relate to Dutton\u2019s illness or some other exposure. I\u2019ve asked the department to clarify. Some good news. National Australia Bank plans to raise $3.5bn in new capital as it grapples with the impact of Covid-19 crisis on its customers. The bank brought forward the announcement of its half-year results, revealing profit is down 51% to $1.31bn in the six months to 31 March 2020. That\u2019s a $1bn hit to NAB\u2019s bottom line. NAB has the largest exposure to small business of the big four banks and is the first to announce a major capital raising to bolster its balance sheet. But it has also had to balance the needs of its retail investors, many of whom are self-funded retirees and has said it will continue to pay dividend. The move could trigger a round of capital raisings by banks and highlights how the shutdown of the economic activity is rippling through sectors. The bank will raise $3bn from institutional investors and a further $500m through a retail placement with its shareholders. CEO Ross McEwan said the bank\u2019s base-case scenario was based on an 8.4% fall in GDP and unemployment rising to 11%. He said the bank had modelled for both a V-shaped and a U-shaped recovery, and while he was hoping for a quick V-shaped bounceback, he said \u201cat this stage we don\u2019t know and would be very surprised if anyone did\u201d. Against the advice of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, it has decided to continue to pay a dividend of 30 cents a share. McEwan said the bank needed to balance returning capital to shareholders while having a strong balance sheet. Greg Hunt was speaking to the Nine Network a little earlier this morning and said there were 10 new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, across Australia. New Zealand is also seeing its case numbers continue to drop, which is why it is moving ahead with relaxing its restrictions to level 3, which is essentially, what Australia is under now. In Queensland, just three people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. Victorian schools look like remaining pupil-free until the end of term two. Queensland schools are pupil-free until at least 22 May (midway through term two) although parents can speak to their school\u2019s principals if they want to send their children back earlier. NSW is working on a face-to-face rostering system, but also is primarily, remaining pupil-free for at least the first half of term two (which in NSW starts today). Gladys Berejiklian: I think it\u2019s important to note that neither Queensland nor Victoria are having schools go back to face to face this term. So the fact that New South Wales is the largest state and having students go back to face to face teaching is a very big move and I\u2019m very excited about that. But also I hope that sends a message to the community that we have done well. I deeply appreciate that everybody\u2019s respected the restrictions, as difficult as it\u2019s been, the vast majority of citizens have done an outstanding job. That\u2019s allowed us to move confidently in getting children back to school. Dan Tehan has announced another $27m will be spent on grants to keep childcare centres open. The government is paying 50% of operating costs for childcare centres, as well as providing the wage subsidy, while giving parents free childcare for six months. But some centres are still struggling to stay open. For those which have more students than they did, but less funds, grants of up to $10,000 can be awarded to cover immediate costs: Where services have increased demand and feel they cannot afford to meet it based on current levels of support, exceptional circumstances funding is available. This means if a service has more children attending now than it had during the reference period it can apply to receive a higher payment from the Morrison government. This funding is also available to services which are not eligible for JobKeeper payments. Services not eligible for JobKeeper can apply for a supplementary payment under the early childhood education and care relief package and the jobkeeper package. The government is working with providers and the sector to ensure that demand for services is met, particularly where it relates to the children of essential workers and vulnerable children. Part of the package is a planned review after the government has collected four weeks of data. This review will prioritise ensuring services that have capacity based on our relief package are providing care to the children of essential workers and vulnerable children. The government is monitoring data for evidence of services that are artificially keeping attendance below capacity while receiving the government\u2019s support payment, which is in contravention of the conditions of the package. Information about such practices can be directed to the Department of Education, Skills and Employment\u2019s tip-off line 1800 664 231 or emailing tipoffline@dese.gov.au. One of the MPs Chris Bowen was talking about there, who have said they won\u2019t be downloading the app, is Barnaby Joyce, which had the immediate affect of making app opponents question their stance. On the question of privacy, Chris Bowen said the government needs to release the source code (so people can check what is at the back end of the app, or whether or not any extras are included) but that downloading it was a personal decision: I think on balance given the size of the challenge before Australia, and given the opportunities available to Australia, if we can defeat Covid-19 on balance, that\u2019s a decision I am personally comfortable to make. That\u2019s a decision that as far as I\u2019m aware, all the Labor MPs are making. I\u2019ve seen a number of Labor MPs say they\u2019ve downloaded the app, the only MPs I\u2019ve seen say they are not downloading the app are Liberal and National MPs. But certainly that\u2019s the approach we\u2019re taking to provide as much constructive engagement as we can. Ultimately, there are matters before the government which don\u2019t require legislation which, in and of itself doesn\u2019t require legislation. The government has done it, and they\u2019re entitled to do it. It\u2019s a legitimate function of executive government to do it. We\u2019ve suggested legislation would be appropriate to ensure one, that it\u2019s truly voluntary, that you know, there can\u2019t be any requirements on people to do it, to become a customer or employee of any particular body. And secondly, that the information can only be accessed very genuinely by state health officials for the purposes of contact tracing. Now, we\u2019re told that\u2019s what the legislation will do. And on that basis, if that\u2019s what the legislation does, then certainly we would support it. Chris Bowen has downloaded the app \u2013 here he is talking to ABC radio this morning: Yes, I have downloaded the app, downloaded it last night, along with many other Australians. We\u2019ve always said this app could play an important role, a constructive role, part of our response to defeating Covid-19. Of course, there are legitimate concerns to be worked through that many Australians would have. But it is ultimately a personal decision as to whether you download the app or not. I have, my family has, because I think Australians have shown that they do want to do what it takes to help defeat Covid-19 and downloading the app can be a part of that if people are comfortable. We have had a few messages from people who have phones connected to international app stores (something impacting expats and backpackers and travellers who may have bought and set up their phone overseas but use an Australian SIM) who are unable to register their phone with the tracing app. Greg Hunt says there are people who will look at that (some countries have made the app they have used internationally available. Australia\u2019s is locked to the Australian app store) I am happy to ask the advice of the experts on that but we have been focusing on people in Australia, with an Australian base. We will have a look into that, as an additional question as well. One of the critical things here is we have set up a voluntary system and we have looked to make sure that privacy was above all else the paramount goal and the decisions that have been taken have always been on the basis of what is going to secure and protect the privacy of Australians, whilst giving them the access to advice if they have been in contact with somebody who has been diagnosed with the disease. This is a very important story \u2013 there are so many people who need a few extra thoughts during this pandemic. How many people does Greg Hunt want to download the app? There is no magic number, as both [chief medical officer] Brendon Murphy and I said yesterday. Any addition is over and above what we started from. It is about assisting our disease experts find people who might have been exposed and we are well ahead of our best hopes and expectations already. The more that are able to do this, as many as possible is our real goal, then that just protects people, it assists with what we\u2019re doing with our borders, our testing, our contact tracing, which is where you look back at somebody who has been engaging with somebody who has been diagnosed and try and contact them and our distancing and isolation practices. All these things together are working and this assists that process. It automates what is being done manually at the moment and as many people as possible who can, each person will make that difference and it is really an extraordinary response so far. As of 6am, Greg Hunt says, 1.13 million Australians have downloaded the tracing app. Peter Dutton has been Duttoning all over the place since coming back to work. Last week he attacked the Queensland government for not opening up schools fast enough (it announced some weeks ago parents who needed to send their kids to school could, with the pupil-free status to be re-examined on 15 May), which went against what Scott Morrison had been saying as part of national cabinet. Morrison, when asked about Dutton\u2019s attacks, said he was speaking as a Queenslander. There is an election in Queensland in October, but I am sure that has absolutely nothing to do with it. Newspoll is out, if you are in to that sort of thing. Scott Morrison\u2019s personal popularity is hovering around 68% but the Coalition as a whole couldn\u2019t hold on to its two-party-preferred boost, dropping from 51 to 49 points, to 50-50. There are a lot of people who still want to see the source code for the tracing app the government is promoting, which is apparently going to be released just as soon as the right people in the government speak to the boffins in our security agencies. In the meantime, the Australian privacy commissioner, Angelene Falk, says safeguards have been put in place to ensure any information gathered is just used for public health reasons: Under the Australian Government Agencies Privacy Code, an agency must undertake a written Privacy Impact Assessment for projects involving new ways of handling personal information. \u201cMy office has worked constructively to provide advice and guidance to Government as it considered the privacy issues through its Privacy Impact Assessment,\u201d Commissioner Falk said. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) will have independent oversight of personal information handling by the app and the National COVIDSafe Data Store. \u201cMy office will watch the implementation of the contact tracing app closely. We can audit the system and investigate complaints from the public about privacy issues. \u201cWe will also closely review the legislation that is intended to be introduced and monitor the implementation of the Privacy Impact Assessment recommendations.\u201d We are still waiting to hear whether or not the assistance and access bill 2018 \u2013 you know the one that lets the authorities into your phone without you knowing \u2013 can apply here. Part of the reason there is a trust deficit is because of all the national security bills which have been passed, on a bipartisan basis, in the past few years, which give authorities and the government a lot more access to data than is always warranted. So you can see why some people are hesitant to download the app. In NSW, just two people were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. Gladys Berejiklian: Out of the 4,400 people who got tested, only two were positive for Covid-19. That is a good result. We do urge everybody to come forward and get tested. We know, as the states consider restrictions, as we consider what May and June look like, we must rely on testing and people coming forward and getting tested even if you have been in direct contact with someone with the virus, it is important for everybody to come forward and get tested. As for whether or not she has downloaded the app, Penny Wong gave the same answer as Kristina Keneally, who was asked about her intentions on Insiders yesterday (so we can take this to be the Labor position on this until May). No, not yet. I do intend to. And like most Australians, I also hope that the federal government will do what it says and that is to put proper protections into legislation when we go back in May. Penny Wong then had a few things to say about the home affairs minister, who came back after recovering from Covid-19 with quite a lot of things to say himself when it comes to China: Peter Dutton, I think, he\u2019s always good for a comment. And I don\u2019t think that given that we\u2019re talking about transparency and disinformation, I don\u2019t think that peddling some of the conspiracy theories which have been discounted internationally, as he did, was very sensible. I done think that that is a sensible way to approach things. We have to be upfront and clear about our view, just as the opposition has been. We agree that there should be an independent inquiry why into the origin of the virus. Penny Wong had a chat to ABC News Breakfast this morning. She said it was time for Australia to stop thinking short term when it came to China \u2013 and to engage in a rethink of the relationship. Look, even before the pandemic, our relationship with China wasn\u2019t straightforward. We know that. In fact, in October, I said that we were entering a new phase of the relationship. We\u2019ve seen China become much more assertive. We\u2019ve seen at times that there are differences in our views on important issues. So we do need to rethink our relationship. We need to rethink how it is that we approach the relationship while standing up for our sovereignty, our interests and our values. But I make the point that disengagement isn\u2019t an option. We know that we need to continue to engage with China. You ask what would I do? Well, I think that we should approach it with discipline and consistency. I think that we should engage the Australian people in a discussion about the challenges of the relationship. And perhaps, most of all, we should think of this relationship in long-terms, through the long-term. China thinks of relationships and strategy in terms of 30 years. Often, Australian governments look to one electoral term. So instead of three years, we should also be thinking about 30 years. Meanwhile, the lobbying to ease most restrictions has begun in earnest. From AAP: The Australian economy could take a $400bn hit if restrictions adopted to fight the spread of Covid-19 continue for six months, modelling by the Business Council of Australia shows. The data released on Monday shows the gross domestic product impact on the economy would be $402.6bn, or 20.7%, in calendar 2020 if a longer-term \u201cU-shaped\u201d recovery option was implemented. This compared with a $197.3bn loss with a one0month \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery plan, or a $278.3bn loss if a three-month \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery was implemented, the BCA modelling found. The federal government has already flagged the restrictions and measures set up around the virus could remain for six months. The business lobby group, which is campaigning for an early easing of restrictions to get the economy going again, also said Australia must consider whether changes to industrial relations and taxation laws adopted during the crisis should continue. That statement continued: We thank aged care minister Richard Colbeck and the chief medical officer Prof Brendan Murphy for joining the aged care industry in constructive dialogue in the national webinar, as we work together to care for and support vulnerable older Australians. However, we impressed upon them that it is incorrect to characterise the sector as having kept residents isolated, under lock and key, in their rooms. Nor are they secret places. There are widespread communications with families, visits at a distance and extensive social media connections. It does a disservice to the hundreds of thousands of dedicated aged care staff \u2013 working on the frontline and putting their own health at risk \u2013 as they work tirelessly to keep residents safe and happy. Our members report local surveys showing the vast majority of families support the current approach to restricted visitations by their aged care homes. We also note considerable community concern about potentially unidentified cases and the possibility of asymptomatic cases infecting aged care homes, as we have seen overseas and in Australia. Providers who have implemented enhanced resident protections are appealing to people to minimise visits, while providers continue their dedication to maintaining connections with their loved ones in care via a range of alternative and innovative communication channels. In line with the national cabinet\u2019s recommendations, visitation requests for compassionate reasons are being carefully facilitated, in close consultation with residents and families. Our focus remains on continuing the balance of compassionate care with the protection of our residents and staff. Australia\u2019s leading aged care providers have banded together to make a statement in response to what the prime minister and chief health minister had to say last week about opening up centres to visits or face applying to the commonwealth to close. Almost 1,000 aged care providers have signed up to the statement, saying some facilities had made the decision to stop visitation because it was the only way to protect residents, with the decisions being made with \u201cthe support of the majority of residents and their families\u201d. The group say they need help, including: A revised statement from the government regarding enhanced resident protections that confirms that in some cases additional restrictions beyond AHPPC guidance are necessary for public health and resident safety. A process for the rapid escalation and resolution of case-by-case issues reported by families, residents or advocates, plus a process of guidance sharing for providers on leading practice. A timely response to the aged care rescue package put to the government several weeks ago to meet the increased costs of keeping vulnerable older Australians safe from coronavirus. Pressures on aged care workers will further intensify from the major costs of controls and resources needed to continue protecting aged care residents and to allow the safe access for visitors that has been stipulated \u2013 but there has been little additional support from Government to achieve this. The funding provided that equates to an average of $2 per resident per day is not enough for aged care operators to keep winning the fight to keep coronavirus out of aged care homes. $2 a day per resident does not cover all the additional requirements such as PPE, cleaning and sanitation, backfilling staff who have to isolate, technology and social distancing measures. The CovidSafe tracing app has been in app stores for less than 24 hours and 1 million Australians have already downloaded it. That is bound to have Greg Hunt and Scott Morrison smiling this morning. The legislation accompanying that app won\u2019t be dealt with until parliament sits in May, but expect to hear the words \u201cbluetooth handshake\u201d a lot before then. Elsewhere, Western Australia has started a \u201ccautious relaxation\u201d of some of the restrictions, scrapping the two-person rule and allowing for indoor and outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people. Queensland has announced it too will be relaxing some restrictions, with picnics, retail shopping and drives of up to 50km from home once again allowed. So, small steps. We\u2019ll have all the news today as it happens. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day. Ready?",

And for some, violence continued to haunt them even after their arrival.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first arrived here in Oakland, I felt less safe than in Guatemala,\u201d student Kevin Xiloj said in Spanish, his second language after the native indigenous language K\u2019iche.</p> <p>Xiloj left Guatemala when he was 17 to get away from the gangs that dominated his rough neighborhood in the city of Huehuetenango. But when he finally made it to East Oakland in 2015, he was greeted by frequent gunfire in his new neighborhood.</p> <p>He said his American peers mocked him for not speaking English and were eager to pick fights. Xiloj followed the same rules he had learned growing up in Huehuetenango: Listen. Watch. Stay quiet.</p> <p>Yet he found Oakland\u2019s unfamiliar streets more intimidating. At least back in Huehuetenango, Xiloj explained, \u201cI knew people, I knew my neighborhood, I knew who was who.\u201d</p> <p>Even as the gun homicide rate in Oakland fell by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/jun/03/gun-violence-bay-area-drop-30-percent-why-investigation\">44%</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/jun/03/gun-violence-bay-area-drop-30-percent-why-investigation\"> between 2007 and 2017</a>, it remains a persistent problem. More than 60 people have been killed by gunshot wounds each year in the city for the past several years. People of color are disproportionately affected. Latino Bay Area residents are 3.5 times more likely to be victims of gun homicides than their white counterparts. Black residents are 22 times more likely.</p> <p>There are also signs that new immigrants in Oakland may be increasingly vulnerable.</p> <p>Ricardo Garcia-Acosta of Youth ALIVE!, an Oakland-based violence intervention organization, found the tally of recent immigrant gun homicide victims have inched up in the past four years, even as total gun homicides in the city have fallen. In 2019, Youth ALIVE! documented 11 such cases in Oakland, up from six in 2016.</p> <p>Many victims were Latin American adult men fatally shot in what appeared to be robberies, Garcia-Acosta said. He noted non-English speaking immigrants may be targeted because they are less likely to notify police and are often unfamiliar with \u201cthe landscape and rules of the uniquely challenging streets of Oakland\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57f880bef4f3e89ffe72f43a2d02d2ef16ab7db4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57f880bef4f3e89ffe72f43a2d02d2ef16ab7db4/0_0_4500_3599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anibal Andres Ramirez\u2019s body was found on a bench in East Oakland in this plaza near Foothill Blvd and Seminary Ave on 10 October 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anibal Andres Ramirez\u2019s body was found on a bench in East Oakland in this plaza near Foothill Blvd and Seminary Ave on 10 October 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Hussin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Anibal\u2019s case, older teenage boys seemed to have been after him, his parents said. On a few occasions, the boy came home beaten up. Once, he was robbed of his cellphone. \u201cHe was bullied,\u201d his father, Gilberto Ramirez, recalled.</p> <p>The 13-year-old often wore red clothing, which may have been a show of support for the gang that operated in his neighborhood, or a way to gain protection from it.</p> <p>Nathaniel Dunstan, who oversees refugee and newcomer students for the district\u2019s English language learners and multilingual achievement team, said he grew concerned about Anibal months before he was killed and initiated a number of home visits.</p> <p>\u201cAt that time, the best way I knew to engage students at risk was to get them involved in Soccer Without Borders,\u201d Dunstan recalled, referring to a soccer program for immigrant and refugee youth.</p> <p>But Anibal was not interested in soccer, and Dunstan said his outreach efforts \u201cfelt really inadequate\u201d.</p> <p>Capt Trevelyon Jones of Oakland police department\u2019s Ceasefire violence intervention program was one of the first officers on the scene the night Anibal was shot.</p> <p>\u201cI was there like maybe 45 seconds after he got shot,\u201d Jones recalled. \u201cI remember seeing him sitting there, [and] thinking like, \u2018Wow, this is a little kid.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Anibal was wearing red the night he was shot. His clothing may have made him a target from rival groups. Sgt Brad Baker of Oakland police department declined to provide details about the open homicide investigation, but said there were \u201cgang connections\u201d to the case.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Anibal\u2019s shooting catalyzed Dunstan and other educators to take action.</p> <p>\u201cAfter Anibal was killed, my office and administrators from across the district realized that we needed another tool, another intervention, to support newcomers that had safety concerns,\u201d Dunstan said.</p> <p>The district had already hired bilingual social workers and therapists to work specifically with newcomers and their families. It had also forged relationships with local pro bono immigration attorneys to take on students\u2019 immigration cases. And since many older newcomer students must support themselves, the district had opened a new continuation high school, Rudsdale Newcomer high school, with a class schedule designed to make it easier for students to juggle classes and jobs.</p> <p>When Rudsdale first opened its doors, Emma Batten-Bowman, the founding assistant principal, noticed her incoming students often faced danger walking to and from school. \u201cOur newcomers are targeted. They\u2019re jumped. They\u2019re held at gunpoint,\u201d she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our newcomers are targeted. They\u2019re jumped. They\u2019re held at gunpoint</p> <footer> <cite>Emma Batten-Bowman</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the months following Anibal\u2019s murder, educators, community partners and newcomer students met periodically to brainstorm about what else to do. They identified dozens of factors making newcomer students vulnerable to becoming victims or perpetrators of violence, including dangerous local neighborhoods, past trauma, poverty, debts to smugglers and a lack of support systems.

Students were jumped.</p> <p>\u201cThere were so many violent incidents that I was responding to them as fast as I could,\u201d Qui\u00f1onez recalled.</p> <p>Qui\u00f1onez needed to help newcomer students across the school district, so he recruited Jose Garcia to take over as safety specialist for Rudsdale Newcomer.</p> <p>Garcia, a youth educator, activist and artist who had himself immigrated to Oakland as an 11-year-old from Mexico, discovered that adults involved in local criminal organizations were manipulating some newcomer students. The students were coerced into selling drugs or stealing in exchange for housing, he said. Some female students were ensnared by sex trafficking rings.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of these kids are falling into a lot of predatory dynamics just because they have no family,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThey have no support system, they really have nobody.\u201d</p> <p>The new safety specialists became that support system for the most at-risk newcomers. Qui\u00f1onez and Garcia designed a program to cycle the most vulnerable students into intensive case management \u2013 supporting them as they got out of dangerous situations, assisting them if they had run-ins with the criminal justice system, checking whether they had safe housing, linking them to social services, and eventually, helping students plan for their futures.</p> <p>They created a class where at-risk students practice non-violent conflict resolution techniques, learn about commonalities between their Central American cultures, express themselves through art projects and burn off frustration with physical exercises like boxing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a1646591f4ca5c880952423a36bd8ab359e65228\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1646591f4ca5c880952423a36bd8ab359e65228/0_0_4500_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jose Garcia, the safety specialist coordinator for Oakland unified school district\u2019s newcomer students, outside his Fruitvale home with his dog Rollo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jose Garcia, the safety specialist coordinator for Oakland unified school district\u2019s newcomer students, outside his Fruitvale home with his dog Rollo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Hussin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Garcia named the program \u201cYoung Hawks\u201d because hawks are sacred to many indigenous groups in the Americas. \u201cBut the problem with the hawk\u2019s energy is that if it\u2019s not channeled or is not given a purpose, then it can be destructive,\u201d Garcia said.</p> <p>He noticed many students came to the US fleeing gangs and violence from Central America, but had little knowledge of the historical context that created those conditions.</p> <p>\u201cThey just blame [themselves] automatically for everything wrong with them and their communities,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThey just feel like that\u2019s how the world works.\u201d</p> <p>Garcia responded by immersing his students in history, teaching about the violence indigenous peoples suffered during Europe\u2019s colonization of the Americas, and the United States\u2019 record of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/19/central-america-migrants-us-foreign-policy\">fueling violent conflicts</a> in Central America.

In an interview in Spanish, he called Garcia, \u201cA loyal friend.\u201d</p> <p>Michael said he left El Salvador when he was 13 because a cousin insisted he had to either join his gang, or be killed.

      "bodyText": "Gilberto Ramirez spent three years in Oakland, California, working long hours pruning trees and grooming lawns with one goal in mind: saving up enough money for his wife and four children back in San Pedro Necta, Guatemala, to come join him. In March 2016, Ramirez got his wish when his wife, three sons and daughter reunited with him in East Oakland. They joined the fast-growing number of Central American immigrants building new lives in the Bay Area, many of whom came escaping violence and poverty in their home countries. But within 19 months, the family\u2019s youngest son, eighth-grader Anibal Andres Ramirez was shot and killed. Police found his body on a bench on the evening of 10 October 2017 near the intersection of Foothill Blvd and Seminary Ave, blocks from the apartment the family rented. Anibal became the city\u2019s youngest gun homicide victim that year at just 13 years old. The case has not been solved, and nearly two and a half years later, Gilberto Ramirez is still trying to make sense of how his plan to give his son a better life in Oakland backfired so badly. \u201cIt was my dream to have my family together in the United States,\u201d Ramirez told the Guardian in a recent interview in Spanish, which is his second language after the indigenous language Mam. \u201cSo much effort and suffering to raise the money to bring my son here, only to have some lowlife cut off my son\u2019s life. It hurts.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Anibal Andres Ramirez\u2019s arrival in Oakland coincided with a surge in the local immigrant youth population. The number of \u201cnewcomers\u201d \u2013 immigrant students who have arrived in the last three years and speak a language other than English \u2013 has nearly doubled in the Oakland unified school district since 2014. This year, one in seven high schoolers in the district are newcomers. The kids come from countries all over the world, but the majority are from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. Some arrived with their parents, but many came as unaccompanied child migrants. Alameda county, where Oakland is located, has received more than 2,500 unaccompanied child migrants from federal shelters since 2015, making it California\u2019s top destination for these young people after Los Angeles county. Before arriving in Oakland, many newcomer kids have already lived through trauma in their home countries or on the journey to the US. And for some, violence continued to haunt them even after their arrival. \u201cWhen I first arrived here in Oakland, I felt less safe than in Guatemala,\u201d student Kevin Xiloj said in Spanish, his second language after the native indigenous language K\u2019iche. Xiloj left Guatemala when he was 17 to get away from the gangs that dominated his rough neighborhood in the city of Huehuetenango. But when he finally made it to East Oakland in 2015, he was greeted by frequent gunfire in his new neighborhood. He said his American peers mocked him for not speaking English and were eager to pick fights. Xiloj followed the same rules he had learned growing up in Huehuetenango: Listen. Watch. Stay quiet. Yet he found Oakland\u2019s unfamiliar streets more intimidating. At least back in Huehuetenango, Xiloj explained, \u201cI knew people, I knew my neighborhood, I knew who was who.\u201d Even as the gun homicide rate in Oakland fell by 44% between 2007 and 2017, it remains a persistent problem. More than 60 people have been killed by gunshot wounds each year in the city for the past several years. People of color are disproportionately affected. Latino Bay Area residents are 3.5 times more likely to be victims of gun homicides than their white counterparts. Black residents are 22 times more likely. There are also signs that new immigrants in Oakland may be increasingly vulnerable. Ricardo Garcia-Acosta of Youth ALIVE!, an Oakland-based violence intervention organization, found the tally of recent immigrant gun homicide victims have inched up in the past four years, even as total gun homicides in the city have fallen. In 2019, Youth ALIVE! documented 11 such cases in Oakland, up from six in 2016. Many victims were Latin American adult men fatally shot in what appeared to be robberies, Garcia-Acosta said. He noted non-English speaking immigrants may be targeted because they are less likely to notify police and are often unfamiliar with \u201cthe landscape and rules of the uniquely challenging streets of Oakland\u201d. In Anibal\u2019s case, older teenage boys seemed to have been after him, his parents said. On a few occasions, the boy came home beaten up. Once, he was robbed of his cellphone. \u201cHe was bullied,\u201d his father, Gilberto Ramirez, recalled. The 13-year-old often wore red clothing, which may have been a show of support for the gang that operated in his neighborhood, or a way to gain protection from it. Nathaniel Dunstan, who oversees refugee and newcomer students for the district\u2019s English language learners and multilingual achievement team, said he grew concerned about Anibal months before he was killed and initiated a number of home visits. \u201cAt that time, the best way I knew to engage students at risk was to get them involved in Soccer Without Borders,\u201d Dunstan recalled, referring to a soccer program for immigrant and refugee youth. But Anibal was not interested in soccer, and Dunstan said his outreach efforts \u201cfelt really inadequate\u201d. Capt Trevelyon Jones of Oakland police department\u2019s Ceasefire violence intervention program was one of the first officers on the scene the night Anibal was shot. \u201cI was there like maybe 45 seconds after he got shot,\u201d Jones recalled. \u201cI remember seeing him sitting there, [and] thinking like, \u2018Wow, this is a little kid.\u2019\u201d Anibal was wearing red the night he was shot. His clothing may have made him a target from rival groups. Sgt Brad Baker of Oakland police department declined to provide details about the open homicide investigation, but said there were \u201cgang connections\u201d to the case. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Anibal\u2019s shooting catalyzed Dunstan and other educators to take action. \u201cAfter Anibal was killed, my office and administrators from across the district realized that we needed another tool, another intervention, to support newcomers that had safety concerns,\u201d Dunstan said. The district had already hired bilingual social workers and therapists to work specifically with newcomers and their families. It had also forged relationships with local pro bono immigration attorneys to take on students\u2019 immigration cases. And since many older newcomer students must support themselves, the district had opened a new continuation high school, Rudsdale Newcomer high school, with a class schedule designed to make it easier for students to juggle classes and jobs. When Rudsdale first opened its doors, Emma Batten-Bowman, the founding assistant principal, noticed her incoming students often faced danger walking to and from school. \u201cOur newcomers are targeted. They\u2019re jumped. They\u2019re held at gunpoint,\u201d she said. In the months following Anibal\u2019s murder, educators, community partners and newcomer students met periodically to brainstorm about what else to do. They identified dozens of factors making newcomer students vulnerable to becoming victims or perpetrators of violence, including dangerous local neighborhoods, past trauma, poverty, debts to smugglers and a lack of support systems. It became clear no existing local youth violence prevention program addressed the specific challenges facing newcomers. Ultimately, the school district partnered with a local not-for-profit, Bay Area Community Resources, to hire safety specialists to implement a school district-wide violence prevention program for newcomers. The new initiative launched the following school year. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Starting up the new violence prevention program fell to Ernesto Qui\u00f1onez, the district\u2019s first newcomer safety specialist. Qui\u00f1onez, who was born in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, was gang-affiliated as a teenager and had been incarcerated for a string of offenses he committed as a juvenile, including assault and battery with a deadly weapon and armed robbery. By August 2018, Qui\u00f1onez had been out of prison three years, and wanted to spend his time helping youth and \u201cundo some of the violence that I\u2019ve done\u201d. He spent the fall of 2018 based out of Rudsdale Newcomer high school, a small campus of portable classrooms clustered around a courtyard. Qui\u00f1onez\u2019s background allowed him to understand the unique pressures her students were facing, Batten-Bowman, the assistant principal, said: \u201cYou need somebody who knows the streets.\u201d Right away, Qui\u00f1onez was busy. A new student who had arrived only months earlier from Guatemala and did not yet understand the seriousness of gang colors, wore red T-shirts to school and was followed home and shot at by another student with a realistic-looking BB gun. A recent graduate was hospitalized after he was shot twice in the stomach. Students were jumped. \u201cThere were so many violent incidents that I was responding to them as fast as I could,\u201d Qui\u00f1onez recalled. Qui\u00f1onez needed to help newcomer students across the school district, so he recruited Jose Garcia to take over as safety specialist for Rudsdale Newcomer. Garcia, a youth educator, activist and artist who had himself immigrated to Oakland as an 11-year-old from Mexico, discovered that adults involved in local criminal organizations were manipulating some newcomer students. The students were coerced into selling drugs or stealing in exchange for housing, he said. Some female students were ensnared by sex trafficking rings. \u201cA lot of these kids are falling into a lot of predatory dynamics just because they have no family,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThey have no support system, they really have nobody.\u201d The new safety specialists became that support system for the most at-risk newcomers. Qui\u00f1onez and Garcia designed a program to cycle the most vulnerable students into intensive case management \u2013 supporting them as they got out of dangerous situations, assisting them if they had run-ins with the criminal justice system, checking whether they had safe housing, linking them to social services, and eventually, helping students plan for their futures. They created a class where at-risk students practice non-violent conflict resolution techniques, learn about commonalities between their Central American cultures, express themselves through art projects and burn off frustration with physical exercises like boxing. Garcia named the program \u201cYoung Hawks\u201d because hawks are sacred to many indigenous groups in the Americas. \u201cBut the problem with the hawk\u2019s energy is that if it\u2019s not channeled or is not given a purpose, then it can be destructive,\u201d Garcia said. He noticed many students came to the US fleeing gangs and violence from Central America, but had little knowledge of the historical context that created those conditions. \u201cThey just blame [themselves] automatically for everything wrong with them and their communities,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThey just feel like that\u2019s how the world works.\u201d Garcia responded by immersing his students in history, teaching about the violence indigenous peoples suffered during Europe\u2019s colonization of the Americas, and the United States\u2019 record of fueling violent conflicts in Central America. He explains that a high portion of guns in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador can be traced back to the United States. \u201cWe dive into those things so that they don\u2019t blame themselves or their parents for the world they inherited,\u201d Garcia said. \u2022\u2022\u2022 At the beginning of this school year, the Bay Area violence that Ernesto Qui\u00f1onez had been helping to quell struck close to home. His 19-year-old younger brother was shot and killed in San Francisco. The tragedy deepened his resolve. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to this work,\u201d Qui\u00f1onez said. \u201cAnd we need to keep doing it.\u201d Qui\u00f1onez has moved on to an oversight role of the Young Hawks program at Bay Area Community Resources and Garcia now supervises two other full-time safety specialists. The three safety specialists manage caseloads for about 120 newcomer students district-wide. Earlier this year, Garcia said his workday began \u201cwhenever that phone rings\u201d. \u201cSometimes it starts at 3 in the morning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might not be on my contract. But that\u2019s what it takes to get the job done correctly.\u201d \u201cWhenever I need him, he is there,\u201d said Michael, a 17-year-old student who asked to only be identified by his first name for safety reasons. In an interview in Spanish, he called Garcia, \u201cA loyal friend.\u201d Michael said he left El Salvador when he was 13 because a cousin insisted he had to either join his gang, or be killed. Other relatives helped smuggle him out of town, and he eventually made it to Oakland. He described feeling a mix of surprise and disappointment when he discovered gangs were also active in his new neighborhood, and a sense of relief when he realized safety specialists could help him. Michael said last year he and a friend crossed paths with a group of men on Oakland\u2019s Bancroft Avenue who claimed to be gang members and tried to start a fight. Police arrived. At the time, Michael was attending Castlemont high school, and called that school\u2019s newcomer safety specialist, Daniel Silva, for advice. Silva\u2019s response was immediate. \u201cHe arrived to help me,\u201d Michael said. \u201cThe police let me and my friend go.\u201d Michael transferred to Rudsdale Newcomer last fall. He sometimes went to class after spending the entire previous night on his feet packing produce at a warehouse. \u201cIt relaxes me,\u201d he said about being on campus. Other Rudsdale Newcomer students echoed the same sentiment. Rudsdale Newcomer had turned a corner. Emma Batten-Bowman, the assistant principal, said there has not been any violence on campus or shootings involving her students so far this school year. She credits the safety specialists and Young Hawks. \u201cHaving a support person on campus who really understands what the kids are going through, the kids open up about their actual needs rather than make a bad decision,\u201d Batten-Bowman said. \u201cIt was just such a huge shift,\u201d she added. But just as the Young Hawks program was showing signs of sustained success, the Covid-19 pandemic upended the routines educators had worked hard to build. Oakland unified school district closed school campuses in mid-March, and Garcia and his colleagues now keep up with students individually by phone and social media. Many students are facing financial emergencies after losing jobs at the same time school abruptly shuttered. \u201cKids were using school to get food, encouragement and support,\u201d Batten-Bowman said. \u201cNow they don\u2019t have that outlet.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Oakland police department does not track homicide victims by immigration status or country of origin, but in an interview in early March, Capt Jones of the Ceasefire program said it had been several months since he had heard of a new shooting involving Central American newcomer youth. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing compared to what we typically see with our traditional groups and gangs in the city of Oakland, which we spend most of our time focusing on,\u201d Jones said. He said therapeutic approaches to gang intervention seem to be lowering Oakland\u2019s overall gang population and gun violence. \u201cWe know now we don\u2019t have a huge influx of gang members like we used to. So something\u2019s working.\u201d Before the coronavirus pandemic hit, both Nathaniel Dunstan at the school district and Jose Garcia hoped to see the Young Hawks program expand to all six Oakland unified school district schools serving high school-age newcomers. But more funding is needed to hire additional safety specialists, and Garcia said fundraising for newcomer safety was challenging even before the outbreak-related economic crisis. Garcia said although it is common to hear outrage in the Bay Area about how child migrants are treated by the federal government \u2013 including protests over \u201ckids in cages\u201d \u2013 that has not translated into resources for children when they are released into the community. Last month, Rudsdale Newcomer school administrators launched a GoFundMe to help their students pay for rent, bills and food through the summer. School staff, including Garcia, are assisting students to avoid eviction, pick up food at school sites, get internet access, find new jobs and apply for unemployment benefits if they qualify. They are also pleading with cellphone companies to not shut off students\u2019 phones over unpaid bills. \u201cWe are all social workers now,\u201d Batten-Bowman said. Garcia said he is grateful he had the chance to help at-risk students practice healthy habits and create positive support systems before this crisis hit. But he worries about very recent newcomers who have not yet enrolled in school or established a safety net. \u201cI\u2019m just kind of afraid that this [pandemic] is going to roll the boulder down the hill,\u201d Garcia said from his home where he is working remotely. \u201cIt might create a spike in violence or crime just out of sheer survival.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 These days, Gilberto Ramirez, his wife and children are cloistered together at home, sheltering in place. After Anibal\u2019s death, they moved away from their old neighborhood and now live in a rental home closer to the city\u2019s Fruitvale district. They don\u2019t hear nearly as many gunshots any more. A framed photo of Anibal hangs over the family\u2019s couch. He is pictured with neatly gelled black hair, holding his hands up in the shape of a heart. Ramirez has not been able to work since everything in the Bay Area shut down last month. \u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen,\u201d Ramirez said about whether his job delivering office furniture will ever start up again. \u201cWe are waiting to see.\u201d The long days at home, sharing simple meals of rice, beans and chicken soup with his children, give Ramirez time to ponder whether anyone will ever be punished for Anibal\u2019s murder. He is growing agitated that nearly two and a half years have passed and police have not arrested anyone. \u201cWhy won\u2019t they do justice in this case?\u201d Ramirez questions. \u201cPolice will arrest you for speeding, but how come if someone is doing violence, harming your family, why not then?\u201d He said he can\u2019t help wondering if justice for a poor Latino boy is not a police priority. The Oakland police department\u2019s Sgt Brad Baker said the homicide was \u201cstill an open, active investigation\u201d, and that, \u201cwe treat all these cases equally across the board\u201d. Anibal\u2019s mother, Florinda, described him in her limited Spanish as \u201ca good son\u201d who always offered to help her by running errands for her at the store. In the period after his death, Ramirez said his wife wept constantly and was too distraught to leave the house. Late last year, they welcomed a new baby girl. Ramirez has started to wonder if he should think about moving his family of six out of Oakland for safety reasons. \u201cThere are a lot of criminals and murderers here,\u201d Ramirez said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t fight with their hands \u2013 they fight with guns.\u201d Still, he is grateful to Oakland for one kindness. A city official raised money for Anibal\u2019s funeral expenses. The donations helped Ramirez send Anibal\u2019s body back to Guatemala, where the boy is buried in his home town.",

Surgeons can be fascinating company but they are invariably driven by huge ego. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced that as well,\u201d Nadim says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if reconstructive surgeons have the biggest egos but you need huge confidence when cutting up a human being. You have to fix the situation. These no-shit doctors inspire me. I\u2019ve always been near doctors who are headstrong and know what they\u2019re going to do, and how they\u2019re going to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Great footballers also have swaggering confidence. \u201cDefinitely. I\u2019ve not seen anyone with low confidence make a big difference in football. If I see someone shaking, I\u2019m not going to think: \u2018Oh, I have such confidence in you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But there is also a necessary tenderness within reconstructive surgery. Rebuilding a face or a limb after a car crash or bombing requires delicate work amid devastation. It is work for which Nadim is equipped because her compassion runs even deeper than her confidence. \u201cI know the value of helping a person when they have no hope. I\u2019m a walking reminder of that. All the help I was given in my life made me the person I am today. So I really want to offer this help. Someone\u2019s face can be blown up and it\u2019s hard for them to exist. I\u2019m going to give them some of their identity back.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af9d1696550045f712c2612d2721ae71daf88bf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af9d1696550045f712c2612d2721ae71daf88bf9/0_0_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nadia Nadim in action for PSG against Lyon this season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nadia Nadim in action for PSG against Lyon this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred Tanneau/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nadim\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p082gx1t\" title=\"\">personal story</a> is worth examining if you\u2019ve not heard it before but we both want to talk more about the lesser-known corners of her experience. Rather than reliving the nightmare of how the Taliban made her father disappear when she was 12, Nadim discusses more complicated feelings. When her mum looks at her and considers the courage and fire which have enabled her to achieve so much over the past 20 years, she sees Nadim\u2019s father.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes me happy,\u201d Nadim says \u201cbecause I remember most that he was a cool person. He could do everything. On the other hand I\u2019m sad because for the majority of my life I haven\u2019t experienced my dad. Even the time I did experience, most of it I don\u2019t remember because I was young. I still have my mother and she\u2019s a really cool lady. Even before the Taliban came, she knew the power of education. That\u2019s something she\u2019s really given to us. She also used to try to teach other kids in Afghanistan. It takes one person to make a change and she\u2019ll always try to be that person.\u201d</p> <p>Nadim has changed lives. She tells a story of how, during last year\u2019s World Cup, she spoke on a panel about empowering young women through football. \u201cI\u2019m sitting among all these beautiful ladies from around the world and everyone starts sharing their stories about what they had to overcome to play football. At first I thought it was really sad. Nowadays we\u2019re fighting for equality, especially in terms of pay, which is great, but in other parts of the world women and girls are not even allowed to touch a fucking ball. It\u2019s crazy.</p> <p>\u201cThis girl put her hand up. She\u2019s from Pakistan. She starts half\u2011crying, saying: \u2018I can\u2019t believe Nadia Nadim is here.\u2019 She says how she used to play football in this tiny town but everyone was saying girls could not play football because of her Muslim background. She said: \u2018I was about to run away and never play the game again but I came across your story and it made me believe I can play football, too.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a really emotional person but I don\u2019t cry easily in front of people but she made me tear up. Here we have this young girl from Pakistan saying: \u2018You saved my life. I play football now and I\u2019ve started a team in the area. This is thanks to you. You told your story and you said it was hard but if you really love something, you should push it.\u2019 So many people don\u2019t care what girls go through around the world but it\u2019s not impossible to get out of it and it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s football or anything else you believe in. You have to maintain the hope.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a19f22adccec42651853f5acb174fbe57f0caca6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a19f22adccec42651853f5acb174fbe57f0caca6/0_145_4300_2580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nadia Nadim training in January.

They\u2019re just in the background \u2013 \u2018These poor kids in Africa or Afghanistan.\u2019 No one really cares. I hope this brings the compassion and empathy that was being lost in our world.</p> <p>\u201cLike what does it mean to be human? It means you care for others. So even if you\u2019re healthy and strong and seem to have no symptoms you need to stay home to save someone else.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI\u2019m only 32 but I feel like I\u2019ve experienced a lot more, like 200 years of life, in bad ways and good ways,\u201d Nadia Nadim says near the end of an hour\u2011long conversation that has been more exhilarating than sobering. We have moved from the way her life \u201cchanged in the blink of an eye\u201d when the Taliban stopped her going to school at the age of 11 and then murdered her father. She has reflected on how her mother found a way to help her and her four sisters flee Afghanistan. We have remembered how she fell for football in a refugee camp in Denmark and her life changed for ever. Nadim has since played 93 times for Denmark and, as a prolific goalscorer, become one of the world\u2019s most significant women footballers. She has played professionally in Denmark, New Jersey, Portland, Manchester and now Paris where she helped PSG reach the Champions League quarter-finals. They were due to face Arsenal last month. She speaks seven languages fluently and is one semester from graduating as a reconstructive surgeon. Meanwhile, during this interview, she swears like a trooper and makes me laugh. Nadim is at home with her family in Denmark, finding solace and hope in lockdown life while reflecting on a past like no other. \u201cWhen I have time to reflect I\u2019m like: \u2018Holy shit!\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think many people can say they\u2019ve experienced all this in their entire lifetime. I don\u2019t want to sound arrogant but I think I have more insight than most people when it comes to other human beings, culture, religion, language. This has been built inside me from different worlds. Does that make sense?\u201d It does because we\u2019ve just discussed how retirement from football will be more bearable for Nadim because she can replace one form of intensity with another. When a career ends for most footballers they understandably lament the fact nothing will match the sensations they experience on the pitch. It is different for Nadim. Working as a surgeon will feel even more dramatic than playing for PSG or scoring the opening goal in the European Championship final as she did when Denmark faced the Netherlands in 2017. \u201cWhen they ask me: \u2018How does it feel to score?\u2019 I\u2019m like: \u2018It\u2019s really wonderful.\u2019 But I experience similar emotions or adrenaline rush in the operating room. Not so long ago I played a game and I was really tired but soon after the game I assisted one of our doctors in a kidney surgery. I was standing there for two hours, in the same position, holding an instrument so he could see better. I was hurting everywhere because of the match but I still was feeling so great and my pulse was racing. \u201cI had this rush of adrenaline, thinking: \u2018Holy shit, this is so cool. I\u2019m literally looking inside someone\u2019s stomach.\u2019\u201d Nadim laughs, as she does with infectious frequency, before becoming more thoughtful. \u201cThere will come a time as a surgeon when all the responsibility is on me and it\u2019s going to be more extreme than anything I\u2019ve experienced.\u201d I once wrote a book about heart transplant surgeons and so I know even Zlatan Ibrahimovic would seem self-effacing if he ended up in this different world. Surgeons can be fascinating company but they are invariably driven by huge ego. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced that as well,\u201d Nadim says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if reconstructive surgeons have the biggest egos but you need huge confidence when cutting up a human being. You have to fix the situation. These no-shit doctors inspire me. I\u2019ve always been near doctors who are headstrong and know what they\u2019re going to do, and how they\u2019re going to do it.\u201d Great footballers also have swaggering confidence. \u201cDefinitely. I\u2019ve not seen anyone with low confidence make a big difference in football. If I see someone shaking, I\u2019m not going to think: \u2018Oh, I have such confidence in you.\u2019\u201d But there is also a necessary tenderness within reconstructive surgery. Rebuilding a face or a limb after a car crash or bombing requires delicate work amid devastation. It is work for which Nadim is equipped because her compassion runs even deeper than her confidence. \u201cI know the value of helping a person when they have no hope. I\u2019m a walking reminder of that. All the help I was given in my life made me the person I am today. So I really want to offer this help. Someone\u2019s face can be blown up and it\u2019s hard for them to exist. I\u2019m going to give them some of their identity back.\u201d Nadim\u2019s personal story is worth examining if you\u2019ve not heard it before but we both want to talk more about the lesser-known corners of her experience.

There were no signs coronavirus had entered the nursing home facility in Hayward, California, where she was living. Seven days later, the 74-year-old woman suffocated to death from Covid-19, and by mid-April, the virus had also killed two of her friends at the facility. Arena Burke, Maynard\u2019s daughter, told the Guardian her family heard little from the staff at Gateway care and rehabilitation center as the infection spread to encompass at least 100 residents and employees at the facility. Precautions to curb the outbreak at the center seemed non-existent, Burke said. So far, at least 13 residents have succumbed to the virus. \u201cThere are so many people there who should not have died,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThey cheated us out of so many good times.\u201d Like facilities in New York and New Jersey, nursing homes in California have been hit hard by coronavirus. Gateway is one of more than 250 skilled nursing homes in the state suffering from coronavirus outbreaks, with a total of more than 5,700 confirmed cases inside the facilities. Every corner of California is hit. In Los Angeles county, nursing home residents have accounted for more than 30% of Covid-19 deaths and 72% in the city of Long Beach. At one Central Valley facility, nearly all 167 residents and staff tested positive, and at a home in Riverside, nearly 100 residents were evacuated after staff failed to show up due to an outbreak. The Gateway center is now under criminal investigation. Behind the staggering numbers, advocates say, is a poorly regulated industry with a long history of chronic understaffing, inadequate infection control, a lack of critical equipment and weak labor standards. Experts and attorneys say the public health catastrophe was preventable, and that the botched response of some nursing homes constitutes criminal neglect. \u2018They think they are above the law\u2019 Skilled nursing facilities care for older residents with advanced medical needs, a population that is uniquely vulnerable to Covid-19 and at higher risk of death regardless of the standards of care. But experts say the crisis in these care facilities is exacerbated by longstanding problems with staffing and training, and because of a massive delay in testing. Even before corona, nearly 400,000 people die each year from infections inside long-term care facilities in America, said Charlene Harrington, a University of California, San Francisco professor emerita and an expert on nursing homes. Undertrained staff are responsible for too many patients with complex challenges, which means they rush from room to room and skip basic steps such as proper hand-washing, she said. In the case of a pandemic, the emergency quickly spirals. \u201cWhen a virus comes along, they just aren\u2019t able to cope. The nursing homes should have immediately staffed up, but they don\u2019t want to spend the money,\u201d she said. \u201cThe staff is calling in sick. They are skimming on care \u2026 And now a lot of them are trying to cover it up.\u201d Nearly one in every 10 nursing homes across the US is reporting coronavirus cases.

At Gateway, located in the city of Hayward, just south of Oakland, inspectors found the facility broke infection control rules in 2017 by not changing gloves or swapping out urine bags.

Gateway did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Hayward officials announced last week the city would help with testing at the facility. Nursing homes seek broad immunity: \u2018It\u2019s abhorrent\u2019 The California public health department began publicizing a list of nursing homes with coronavirus outbreaks last week, after weeks of intense public pressure. The state is also sending teams of nurses to facilities with outbreaks \u201cto ensure infection measures are in place, mitigate further infections, isolate residents, and assess for exposures\u201d, a spokesperson said in an email. The health department is further working to place positive patients in alternative sites when they don\u2019t require hospitalization. But because of Covid-19, the department has stopped doing routine in-person inspections, a development that has deeply worried advocates. The spokesperson said the state was still doing on-site investigations for \u201cissues that might cause serious risk to residents\u201d. Lobbyists for the nursing home industry are now pushing for California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, to grant the facilities broad immunity from civil lawsuits and criminal prosecution, arguing that liability laws should be waived and they should be shielding from litigation while fighting the pandemic. Advocates said they have already been limited in their ability to uncover what\u2019s happening inside due to the lockdowns, and that immunity would have dire consequences. \u201cIt\u2019s abhorrent,\u201d said Scott Akrie, whose family intends to sue Gateway. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely ridiculous for them to ask to not be held accountable for anything.\u201d For families who have lost loved ones inside nursing homes, it was particularly devastating that Covid-19 robbed them of a proper goodbye. Burke said she was cherishing the goofy voicemail her mother left her in March, in which she joked that she and her friends would \u201crally and wave banners\u201d until the nursing home provided Kentucky Fried Chicken, one of her favorites. When she heard it the first time, she never imagined it would be her mother\u2019s final voicemail.",

      "body": "<p>Many shops outside shopping malls are reopening in the Czech Republic after the government brought forward its five-stage lockdown exit plan, amid reports that the British government is closely watching the country\u2019s back-to-business strategy.</p> <p>Under increasing pressure to lift parts of the UK\u2019s lockdown and limit the damage to the economy, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is understood to be studying the Czech Republic\u2019s approach to lifting the tight restrictions it imposed earlier than most countries further west, which have helped it limit cases to 7,400, with just 221 deaths.</p> <p>Prague was one of the few governments to declare a state of emergency before the country had recorded its first coronavirus death. By 11 March it had closed all schools, limited public gatherings, banned all public events, sealed its borders and shuttered all non-essential stores. It also made face masks obligatory in public.</p> <p>Early this month it became the first European country to relax its restrictions, initially by allowing citizens to cycle, jog and walk in the countryside without wearing their masks, as long as they stayed 2 metres apart.</p> <p>Some sports facilities, such as tennis courts and golf courses, were allowed to reopen as long as no more than two people played together, and selected non-essential shops \u2013 including cycle stores, repair shops and hardware and DIY stores \u2013 also returned to business on 9 April.</p> <p>On 15 April the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/czechs-grapple-with-how-to-ease-covid-19-lockdown\">unveiled a detailed five-step plan</a> to reopen the broader economy, with the deputy prime minister, Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek, dividing businesses and activities into five main groups which would reopen their doors in stages over the following eight weeks.</p> <p>Craft shops, car dealerships and farmers\u2019 markets were the first to reopen from 20 April, with smaller shops outside shopping malls scheduled to follow on 27 April, then larger shops outside malls, driving schools and fitness centres.</p> <p>The final stages were to happen in late May and early June, with restaurants allowed to serve customers outside, and hairdressers and beauty salons permitted to reopen, followed by shopping malls. Bars and restaurants were to be allowed to resume indoor service by 9 June, with hotels also allowed to reopen.</p> <p>Public amenities and meeting places, such as museums and galleries, as well as cultural venues including theatres, would be among the last facilities to reopen, while schools were to start returning from 11 May.

      "bodyText": "Many shops outside shopping malls are reopening in the Czech Republic after the government brought forward its five-stage lockdown exit plan, amid reports that the British government is closely watching the country\u2019s back-to-business strategy. Under increasing pressure to lift parts of the UK\u2019s lockdown and limit the damage to the economy, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is understood to be studying the Czech Republic\u2019s approach to lifting the tight restrictions it imposed earlier than most countries further west, which have helped it limit cases to 7,400, with just 221 deaths. Prague was one of the few governments to declare a state of emergency before the country had recorded its first coronavirus death. By 11 March it had closed all schools, limited public gatherings, banned all public events, sealed its borders and shuttered all non-essential stores. It also made face masks obligatory in public. Early this month it became the first European country to relax its restrictions, initially by allowing citizens to cycle, jog and walk in the countryside without wearing their masks, as long as they stayed 2 metres apart. Some sports facilities, such as tennis courts and golf courses, were allowed to reopen as long as no more than two people played together, and selected non-essential shops \u2013 including cycle stores, repair shops and hardware and DIY stores \u2013 also returned to business on 9 April. On 15 April the government unveiled a detailed five-step plan to reopen the broader economy, with the deputy prime minister, Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek, dividing businesses and activities into five main groups which would reopen their doors in stages over the following eight weeks. Craft shops, car dealerships and farmers\u2019 markets were the first to reopen from 20 April, with smaller shops outside shopping malls scheduled to follow on 27 April, then larger shops outside malls, driving schools and fitness centres. The final stages were to happen in late May and early June, with restaurants allowed to serve customers outside, and hairdressers and beauty salons permitted to reopen, followed by shopping malls. Bars and restaurants were to be allowed to resume indoor service by 9 June, with hotels also allowed to reopen. Public amenities and meeting places, such as museums and galleries, as well as cultural venues including theatres, would be among the last facilities to reopen, while schools were to start returning from 11 May. Havl\u00ed\u010dek stressed that the government reserved the right to adjust its dates. As its infection curve continued to fall, however, the government last Thursday brought forward its exit plan, speeding up the process. Most venues are now to reopen two weeks earlier than initially planned, with gyms and all stores smaller than 2,500sq m outside shopping malls allowed to reopen on Monday. The five-stage plan is now a four-stage plan: outdoor restaurant and bar areas reopen from 11 May, along with hairdressers and beauty salons, with restaurants expected to resume indoor service and hotels allowed to reopen from 25 May, two weeks earlier than the previous 8 June date. The government also unexpectedly announced it would open its borders for outbound foreign travel after recording a decline in the number of infections. The health minister, Adam Vojt\u011bch, said returning travellers would have to prove they were uninfected or spend 14 days in quarantine. Face masks will remain mandatory until the end of June, but restrictions are being eased on movement within the country, with groups of up to 10 now permitted to gather, compared with a previous limit of two. The full breakdown of the country\u2019s lockdown exit plan is as follows: Already open (since 20 April): Craftspeople and tradespeople with shops Farmers\u2019 markets Car dealerships Weddings for up to 10 people 27 April: Most shops below 2,500sq m, unless in big shopping malls Driving schools Gyms, although changing rooms and showers remain closed Libraries Outdoor areas of zoos and botanical gardens Church services for fewer than 15 people 11 May: Retail stores in malls Retail stores larger than 2,500sq m outside malls Hairdressers, beauty salons, massage parlours Outdoor and garden areas of restaurants, pubs and cafes Museums, galleries, and art halls 25 May: Indoor service in restaurants, bars and cafes Hotels Taxis Theatres Tattooists",

      "body": "<p>With the shutters down on high streets and retail parks around the world, meaning that home delivery is the only option for almost anything other than food and medicine, it\u2019s no surprise that Amazon is seeing business boom. The online retailer, already a one-stop shop for many people, has seen customers flock through its virtual doors in the weeks since coronavirus hit.</p> <p>The site is experiencing an extended period of sales at the level usually reserved for the shopping frenzy of Black Friday, with reported surges reaching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/15/amazon-lockdown-bonanza-jeff-bezos-fortune-109bn-coronavirus\">$11,000 (\u00a38,800) a second</a>. Its share price is booming, too, making its already rich founder, Jeff Bezos, even richer.</p> <p>But while the site offers everything you could need at the moment, from food to films, via fish tanks and photo frames, there are many who feel uncomfortable about adding to its dominance. Concerns about its treatment of workers, how little tax it pays and its impact on smaller retailers are not new, but this crisis has shone the spotlight on them again.</p> <p>In the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/20/amazon-warehouse-workers-sickout-coronavirus\">some Amazon workers are protesting against their treatment</a>, accusing the company of putting revenue above safety by not supplying enough face masks or checking that employees are not sick when they turn up to work.</p> <p>In December, the UK campaign group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/02/new-study-deems-amazon-worst-for-aggressive-tax-avoidance\">Fair Tax Mark put</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/02/new-study-deems-amazon-worst-for-aggressive-tax-avoidance\"> Amazon at the top of a list of companies that it said were \u201caggressively avoiding\u201d tax</a>, saying it had paid just $3.4bn in tax on revenues of $960.5bn and profits of $26.8bn. With countries needing to rebuild their finances after the crisis, attention is likely to fall on corporations that are not seen to be paying their fair share.</p> <p>It is also worth remembering that however quick the delivery might be, it is not always as handy as being able to go to a shop and bring something home straight away. We will, one day, be back to that situation, so it is worth protecting your local retailers in the short term if you can. It is also worth looking for online alternatives.</p> <p><strong>Electronics</strong></p> <p>You can often cut out the middleman if you are buying electronics. For computers, phones and TVs, <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-uk?~ck=mn\">Dell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/\">Samsung</a> are all offering free delivery on their products, although Samsung has suspended orders to Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Scottish Highlands. For gaming, <a href=\"https://store.nintendo.co.uk/nintendo-switch/nintendo-switch-lite/consoles.list\">Nintendo has the Switch Lite for sale</a> on its website, although the Switch is out of stock.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.box.co.uk/\">Box.co.uk</a> sells kitchen appliances such as toasters and coffee makers alongside gaming consoles, TVs and computers from its base in Birmingham. Free delivery takes five days, but you can pay to get items the next day. During the crisis the <a href=\"https://www.box.co.uk/bursary\">company is offering a total of \u00a310,000-worth of products to deserving individuals</a> who are nominated through the website.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/index.html\">Currys PC World</a> is taking orders and has a sale on some of the equipment that you might be looking for at the moment, including printers, wifi extenders and coffee machines. Next-day delivery costs \u00a35; standard delivery is free, but will take five to 10 days.</p> <p>John Lewis is offering free standard delivery on orders over \u00a350 or next-day delivery for \u00a36.95. It is not offering two-person deliveries, and is calling ahead to check whether customers are self-isolating. Orders can be delivered to Waitrose, Co-op and Booths stores, too.</p> <p>It is worth seeing if independent retailers near you are still operating. In Carlisle, for example, <a href=\"https://www.athomepc.co.uk/\">@Home PC</a> is advertising contact-free delivery on laptops and accessories.</p> <p>In the US, you can find most electronic goods on <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/\">Best Buy</a>, which has an Amazon-price-match guarantee. With an added in-store Geek Squad to deal with all your electronic woes (once the shutdown is over, of course), it strikes a nice balance between online convenience and in-store customer service. It is currently offering curbside deliveries, too, which helps to keep you and your courier safe.</p> <p><strong>Household products</strong></p> <p>Environmentally friendly cleaning products, pet food and baby gear are available at <a href=\"https://www.ethicalsuperstore.com/\">Ethicalsuperstore.com</a>. Standard delivery in the UK is free on orders over \u00a350, or \u00a33.95 on smaller orders. It is a good place to buy in bulk \u2013 Ecover laundry liquid, for example, is available in a range of sizes up to 15 litres, which sells for \u00a349.59. Its <a href=\"https://www.ethicalsuperstore.com/covid-19-update/\">website has a lengthy description</a> of what it is doing to keep staff safe.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.wilko.com/\">Wilko\u2019s stores</a> are still open, and so is its online shop. It is offering delivery within seven days for a \u00a35 fee. Cleaning products, pet food and nappies are all available, as well as items from its DIY, gardening and stationery ranges. However, the virtual toiletries aisle looks pretty bare (when we checked, most toothpaste and shower gel was out of stock).</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.viking-direct.co.uk/en/viking-advantages\">Viking-direct.co.uk</a> usually supplies offices, but individuals can register. It sells all kinds of things you might need at work, home or the current hybrid of the two, including bin liners, dishwasher tablets, toilet rolls and biscuits. Delivery is free on orders over \u00a330 and is usually next day.</p> <p>For US customers, <a href=\"https://www.target.com/\">Target </a>has it all, from nappies to kids\u2019 toys to groceries. The store lets you select items by delivery option, including same-day delivery and store pickup. The same-day option uses Shipt, meaning free delivery for Shipt members, or those using a free trial; the free trial lasts four weeks. If you are not a Shipt member, the markup is applied per item, so it can end up getting pricey. Currently, you can expect purchases made at the beginning of the week to be delivered at the end of the week \u2013 but these windows are particularly sensitive to change at the moment.</p> <p><strong>Beauty and personal care</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.superdrug.com/\">Superdrug</a>\u2019s shops are open, and it is running a same-day delivery service from some shops via a courier firm called <a href=\"https://www.superdrug.com/stuart-delivery\">Stuart</a>. The delivery charge starts at \u00a35.40. You need to check that it works from a local branch before you make your order. If it doesn\u2019t, you can use the usual delivery service, which is free for loyalty card holders on orders over \u00a310 and for everyone spending more than \u00a315.</p> <p>For high-end beauty items, take a look at the companies\u2019 own sites. <a href=\"https://www.clarins.co.uk/\">Clarins</a>\u2019 online shop is still open, for instance, and delivery is free on orders over \u00a350. <a href=\"https://www.benefitcosmetics.com/uk/en-gb/bestsellers/whats-new\">Benefit</a> warns that its orders are taking a couple of weeks to arrive, but it does have a sale on so it may be worth the wait.</p> <p>For electric toothbrushes, razors and the like, manufacturers often offer direct sales. <a href=\"https://www.philips.co.uk/\">Philips</a> is offering free delivery on a range that includes personal care items, baby bottle sterilisers and very upmarket juicers. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.very.co.uk/\">Very.co.uk</a> is effectively an online department store, with a huge range of beauty products at different price points, and tech from men\u2019s grooming products to hairdryers. It also stocks toys, appliances and a small range of DVDs and music.</p> <p>In the US, <a href=\"https://community.sephora.com/t5/COVID-19/Store-Closure-COVID-19-Update/m-p/5228757\">Sephora offers high-street and luxury beauty products</a>. Sephora is a multinational chain, so unlike platforms where you buy from individual sellers, there is less reason to worry about counterfeit products. Plus you get two free samples with every order. Standard shipping orders can take up to two weeks to arrive, or you can choose a range of <a href=\"https://www.sephora.com/beauty/shipping-information\">speedier delivery options</a>, normally at a higher cost.</p> <p>Depop is like eBay, but for trendy clothing and beauty products. The platform has listings from a range of individual sellers and stores, and there are star ratings so you can choose to buy from trusted sellers.

      "bodyText": "With the shutters down on high streets and retail parks around the world, meaning that home delivery is the only option for almost anything other than food and medicine, it\u2019s no surprise that Amazon is seeing business boom. The online retailer, already a one-stop shop for many people, has seen customers flock through its virtual doors in the weeks since coronavirus hit. The site is experiencing an extended period of sales at the level usually reserved for the shopping frenzy of Black Friday, with reported surges reaching $11,000 (\u00a38,800) a second. Its share price is booming, too, making its already rich founder, Jeff Bezos, even richer. But while the site offers everything you could need at the moment, from food to films, via fish tanks and photo frames, there are many who feel uncomfortable about adding to its dominance. Concerns about its treatment of workers, how little tax it pays and its impact on smaller retailers are not new, but this crisis has shone the spotlight on them again. In the US, some Amazon workers are protesting against their treatment, accusing the company of putting revenue above safety by not supplying enough face masks or checking that employees are not sick when they turn up to work. In December, the UK campaign group Fair Tax Mark put Amazon at the top of a list of companies that it said were \u201caggressively avoiding\u201d tax, saying it had paid just $3.4bn in tax on revenues of $960.5bn and profits of $26.8bn. With countries needing to rebuild their finances after the crisis, attention is likely to fall on corporations that are not seen to be paying their fair share. It is also worth remembering that however quick the delivery might be, it is not always as handy as being able to go to a shop and bring something home straight away. We will, one day, be back to that situation, so it is worth protecting your local retailers in the short term if you can. It is also worth looking for online alternatives. Electronics You can often cut out the middleman if you are buying electronics. For computers, phones and TVs, Dell, Apple and Samsung are all offering free delivery on their products, although Samsung has suspended orders to Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Scottish Highlands. For gaming, Nintendo has the Switch Lite for sale on its website, although the Switch is out of stock. Box.co.uk sells kitchen appliances such as toasters and coffee makers alongside gaming consoles, TVs and computers from its base in Birmingham. Free delivery takes five days, but you can pay to get items the next day. During the crisis the company is offering a total of \u00a310,000-worth of products to deserving individuals who are nominated through the website. Currys PC World is taking orders and has a sale on some of the equipment that you might be looking for at the moment, including printers, wifi extenders and coffee machines. Next-day delivery costs \u00a35; standard delivery is free, but will take five to 10 days. John Lewis is offering free standard delivery on orders over \u00a350 or next-day delivery for \u00a36.95. It is not offering two-person deliveries, and is calling ahead to check whether customers are self-isolating. Orders can be delivered to Waitrose, Co-op and Booths stores, too. It is worth seeing if independent retailers near you are still operating. In Carlisle, for example, @Home PC is advertising contact-free delivery on laptops and accessories. In the US, you can find most electronic goods on Best Buy, which has an Amazon-price-match guarantee. With an added in-store Geek Squad to deal with all your electronic woes (once the shutdown is over, of course), it strikes a nice balance between online convenience and in-store customer service. It is currently offering curbside deliveries, too, which helps to keep you and your courier safe. Household products Environmentally friendly cleaning products, pet food and baby gear are available at Ethicalsuperstore.com. Standard delivery in the UK is free on orders over \u00a350, or \u00a33.95 on smaller orders. It is a good place to buy in bulk \u2013 Ecover laundry liquid, for example, is available in a range of sizes up to 15 litres, which sells for \u00a349.59. Its website has a lengthy description of what it is doing to keep staff safe. Wilko\u2019s stores are still open, and so is its online shop. It is offering delivery within seven days for a \u00a35 fee. Cleaning products, pet food and nappies are all available, as well as items from its DIY, gardening and stationery ranges. However, the virtual toiletries aisle looks pretty bare (when we checked, most toothpaste and shower gel was out of stock). Viking-direct.co.uk usually supplies offices, but individuals can register. It sells all kinds of things you might need at work, home or the current hybrid of the two, including bin liners, dishwasher tablets, toilet rolls and biscuits. Delivery is free on orders over \u00a330 and is usually next day. For US customers, Target has it all, from nappies to kids\u2019 toys to groceries. The store lets you select items by delivery option, including same-day delivery and store pickup. The same-day option uses Shipt, meaning free delivery for Shipt members, or those using a free trial; the free trial lasts four weeks. If you are not a Shipt member, the markup is applied per item, so it can end up getting pricey. Currently, you can expect purchases made at the beginning of the week to be delivered at the end of the week \u2013 but these windows are particularly sensitive to change at the moment. Beauty and personal care Superdrug\u2019s shops are open, and it is running a same-day delivery service from some shops via a courier firm called Stuart. The delivery charge starts at \u00a35.40. You need to check that it works from a local branch before you make your order. If it doesn\u2019t, you can use the usual delivery service, which is free for loyalty card holders on orders over \u00a310 and for everyone spending more than \u00a315. For high-end beauty items, take a look at the companies\u2019 own sites. Clarins\u2019 online shop is still open, for instance, and delivery is free on orders over \u00a350. Benefit warns that its orders are taking a couple of weeks to arrive, but it does have a sale on so it may be worth the wait. For electric toothbrushes, razors and the like, manufacturers often offer direct sales. Philips is offering free delivery on a range that includes personal care items, baby bottle sterilisers and very upmarket juicers. Very.co.uk is effectively an online department store, with a huge range of beauty products at different price points, and tech from men\u2019s grooming products to hairdryers. It also stocks toys, appliances and a small range of DVDs and music. In the US, Sephora offers high-street and luxury beauty products. Sephora is a multinational chain, so unlike platforms where you buy from individual sellers, there is less reason to worry about counterfeit products. Plus you get two free samples with every order. Standard shipping orders can take up to two weeks to arrive, or you can choose a range of speedier delivery options, normally at a higher cost. Depop is like eBay, but for trendy clothing and beauty products. The platform has listings from a range of individual sellers and stores, and there are star ratings so you can choose to buy from trusted sellers. Purchases are protected by PayPal. Entertainment It\u2019s hard to avoid Amazon if you want to watch something that it has bought the rights for, but for films and music there are many other options. The BFI has new and classic films to rent on its website. One-off rentals start at \u00a32.50 each, or a subscription offers older films. That costs \u00a34.99 a month, but there is a 14-day free trial at the start. Curzon is offering the cinema experience at home, with very recent films such as Portrait of a Lady on Fire available to stream for less than \u00a310. You don\u2019t need to subscribe to watch, and there is a free film when you register your details. Cinema Paradiso has a wider range of films and TV programmes, but this is a DVD rental service so you can\u2019t watch straight away. Again there is a 14-day free trial; the monthly cost depends on which subscription you choose. The basic one is \u00a35.99 and offers two rentals a month. Zavvi is not on the high street any longer, but lives online selling DVDs, music and games \u2013 both electronic and board. You can buy a delivery pass for \u00a39.99, which gives you standard delivery for a year and reduces the cost of the next-day service. It is warning that, to protect staff, orders are taking 48 hours longer than usual. HMV does most of its business online these days, too, and is another option if you don\u2019t need to watch something straight away.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThis disease is very weird, the way it has a very different presentation in the population in different people \u2013 what we are showing is that isn\u2019t random,\u201d Spector said. \u201cIt is not mainly due to where you live or who you have seen; a lot of it is something innate about you.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think you can say that your likelihood of getting it at all, or getting it severely, is under some genetic control.\u201d</p> \n<p>The team hopes the findings will help scientists ascertain the mechanisms by which Covid-19 acts on the body, as well as offering a possible way to predict those most at risk from the disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cUnderstanding how symptoms of [the disease] Covid-19 pass through the population may indicate the pathogenic mechanisms of [the virus] Sars-CoV-2 infection, as well as offering utility in the allocation of scarce healthcare resources, particularly intensive care beds,\u201d the team writes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>They say the results could also help researchers around the world identify genetic variants that play a role in explaining why some individuals show no, or only mild, symptoms of Covid-19, which could in turn aid the development of drugs for the disease.</p> \n<p>But there were other possible targets, Spector said, noting that genetics were closely linked to the immune system and microbes found in the gut.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt reassures everyone that it is worth exploring this whole triangle of genes, immune system and gut microbes,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is too early to tell if the Covid-19 pandemic will produce an artistic legacy on a par with Edvard Munch\u2019s Spanish flu portraits, but this virus and its fallout have already garnered a huge response by artists. Unlike Munch\u2019s horrifying self-portrait made while he was struck down with the early 20th-century disease, or a morose second painting made in recovery, the work produced by today\u2019s artists in response to coronavirus has been to either raise morale or money for charity. One of the most depressing things about the lockdown is that it coincided with the advent of spring. Playing on this melancholia is a new print by London-based artist Nicholas Cheveldave depicting a pink cherry blossom emerging in full bloom. There\u2019s a darkness to the work, which is being sold by Emalin gallery in London to raise funds for the Hackney Food Bank: the artist has overlaid the image with Use By stickers and scratched tally marks, a sign perhaps that the season will pass while we\u2019re still imprisoned at home. The seasonal bloom features, too, in a photograph by Nan Goldin, a branch in a vase taken by the artist on her first days quarantined at home in Brooklyn. Proceeds from the sale of the prints (in an edition of 150) will go to Urban Survivors Union, which works with drug users. Goldin, who has been vocal about her own battle with opioids, notes that those with addiction issues often have compromised immune systems, making them particularly susceptible to Covid-19.

      "bodyText": "The sprawling trade fair and exhibition centre on the outskirts of Bergamo, the Italian city hardest hit by coronavirus, is now a field hospital. Instead of pavilions and stands there are 142 beds, only 38 of them occupied. Inside the hospital\u2019s red zone, where the sickest patients are treated, there are almost as many Russian medical staff as patients: 32 military doctors and nurses and eight interpreters, all sent by Moscow in a controversial aid gesture. Accessing intensive care here is a complex process: two layers of protective gear have to go on: first a white hospital gown and then a disposable surgical suit, plastic sandals, gloves, transparent glasses, a transparent welding mask, all sanitised several times with hydroalcoholic gel. . Even then, it\u2019s hard to feel 100% shielded from the virus that tore through this city and the surrounding region, leaving thousands dead in the space of a few weeks. Volunteer medics from an Italian NGO, who worked on the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone and medical teams from Bergamo\u2019s Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital which bore the brunt in the first devastating phase of this region\u2019s outbreak, staff the field facility. But the Russians are instantly recognisable because they brought their own distinctive PPE; white hazmat suits with blue stripes. The Russians also brought their own logo: two hearts, one wrapped in the Russian flag, the other in the Italian flag, conjoined by the words: From Russia with Love. A poster carrying the logo has been stuck on the wall of the field hospital. The controversy in Italy surrounding the Russian presence, which La Stampa newspaper suggested was cover for an intelligence-gathering operation and which others have speculated is either aimed at getting the EU to lift sanctions, or a PR exercise to exploit the EU\u2019s lack of cohesion, is not something the Russian doctors are keen to discuss. Lt Col Alexander Yumanov, head of the Russian medical team, says: \u201cWe do not want to get involved in this political controversy, we are doctors who do their job. There is a tradition in Russia that if someone asks us for help, we have to give it to them.\u201d \u201cWe arrived fully equipped, our medical and nursing teams were ready to work from day one, as we had our eight ventilators.

Where were the tests sent? \u201cWe suggested that Italy give them to Bergamo, but we don\u2019t know where they ended up\u201d. When are they planning to return to Russia? \u201cThese terms have not been defined, for the moment we are trying to give the best of ourselves\u201d, says Alexander Volosatov, the deputy head of media of the Russian defence ministry, who accompanies Yumanov throughout. Are they waiting for everyone to be cured? \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the epidemiological situation to stabilise\u201d Volosatov says. It is still not clear how the Russian involvement came about.

      "body": "<p>Jumping into a turquoise infinity lake at the top of a Oaxacan mountain, Dom and his sister, Lizzie, are awestruck. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anything as beautiful as that in my entire life,\u201d Dom says. \u201cI\u2019d have been gutted if we\u2019d missed this.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, two rivals in their adventure, the married couple Jen and Robbie, are hot, sweaty and weighed down by their giant rucksacks on the outskirts of Mexico City. They have mistakenly travelled to a metro station, rather than an international bus terminal 100km (62 miles) away. \u201cOh my God,\u201d fumes Jen. \u201cWhere\u2019s the bloody bus station? We\u2019re LOST.\u201d</p> <p>Anyone who has strapped on a backpack and boarded a 6am long-haul flight will have nodded in recognition all the way through the latest series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/21/race-across-the-world\">Race Across </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/21/race-across-the-world\">the World</a> (BBC Two). As the contestants soon found out, that is the thing with travel: sometimes you accidentally discover a hidden wonder of the world, other times you are sunburnt and on the edge of a breakdown at a ticketing booth.</p> <p>Perhaps it was this sense of holiday deja vu \u2013 alongside the heartwarming displays of kindness from strangers \u2013 that made more than 4 million people watch the five couples, unaided by smartphones or air travel, race 25,000km through Latin America.</p> <p>Halfway through the series\u2019 broadcast, the Covid-19 pandemic spread rapidly, prompting most countries to lock down and suspend international travel. With each following episode, Race Across the World took on a bittersweet quality, as journeying so freely \u2013 and being within touching distance of strangers! \u2013 instantly looked as if it were from another era. While only one couple took home the \u00a320,000 prize in Sunday\u2019s episode (no spoilers ahead), the greater prize for all the contestants was being among the last people \u2013 for a while, at least \u2013 able to explore the world on a whim.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fca0960912792d1e3cab838deb71c9ad57eef501\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fca0960912792d1e3cab838deb71c9ad57eef501/0_0_4284_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam (left) and Jo in Race Across the World series two.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Travel TV is a window on the world that awaits us all\u2019 ...

Lizzie agrees: \u201cIt definitely makes it seem more epic than we ever realised before.\u201d They add that the show \u2013 and those 28-hour bus rides \u2013 unwittingly prepared them for life in isolation: \u201cWe are both quite used to waiting now \u2013 but at least we have the comfort of our phones, TV, beds and proper meals. We\u2019re still bickering every day, though \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Tim Harcourt, the show\u2019s executive producer, says: \u201cWatching the show back now, it reminds me that we all took our freedom to travel for granted. But I hope the series serves as inspiration that\u2019s especially needed during these times.

But its executive producer, Caroline Matthews, believes the timing of the series\u2019 broadcast \u2013 in which seven celebrities walked the Sultan\u2019s Trail from Serbia to Turkey \u2013 and its theme of peaceful contemplation struck a chord with viewers in lockdown: \u201cI saw on Twitter that quite a few people have been commenting on the<strong> </strong>mindfulness and spirituality that\u2019s kind of been resonating with everybody at the moment because we\u2019re going through such tough times,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Matthews says they would have expected to be in the development stage for the fourth series \u2013 which films in September \u2013 but this has been put on hold. \u201cWe do have a slight advantage in that a pilgrimage is all about physical distancing and isolation by its nature.\u201d</p> <p>On the issue of the need to be mindful about bringing a cast and crew into remote areas in future, she adds: \u201cWe have a skeletal crew \u2013 the minimal amount of people to deliver the show, anyway.

      "bodyText": "Jumping into a turquoise infinity lake at the top of a Oaxacan mountain, Dom and his sister, Lizzie, are awestruck. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anything as beautiful as that in my entire life,\u201d Dom says. \u201cI\u2019d have been gutted if we\u2019d missed this.\u201d Meanwhile, two rivals in their adventure, the married couple Jen and Robbie, are hot, sweaty and weighed down by their giant rucksacks on the outskirts of Mexico City. They have mistakenly travelled to a metro station, rather than an international bus terminal 100km (62 miles) away. \u201cOh my God,\u201d fumes Jen. \u201cWhere\u2019s the bloody bus station? We\u2019re LOST.\u201d Anyone who has strapped on a backpack and boarded a 6am long-haul flight will have nodded in recognition all the way through the latest series of Race Across the World (BBC Two). As the contestants soon found out, that is the thing with travel: sometimes you accidentally discover a hidden wonder of the world, other times you are sunburnt and on the edge of a breakdown at a ticketing booth. Perhaps it was this sense of holiday deja vu \u2013 alongside the heartwarming displays of kindness from strangers \u2013 that made more than 4 million people watch the five couples, unaided by smartphones or air travel, race 25,000km through Latin America. Halfway through the series\u2019 broadcast, the Covid-19 pandemic spread rapidly, prompting most countries to lock down and suspend international travel. With each following episode, Race Across the World took on a bittersweet quality, as journeying so freely \u2013 and being within touching distance of strangers! \u2013 instantly looked as if it were from another era. While only one couple took home the \u00a320,000 prize in Sunday\u2019s episode (no spoilers ahead), the greater prize for all the contestants was being among the last people \u2013 for a while, at least \u2013 able to explore the world on a whim. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy watching the race back now,\u201d says Dom, back home in the UK. Lizzie agrees: \u201cIt definitely makes it seem more epic than we ever realised before.\u201d They add that the show \u2013 and those 28-hour bus rides \u2013 unwittingly prepared them for life in isolation: \u201cWe are both quite used to waiting now \u2013 but at least we have the comfort of our phones, TV, beds and proper meals. We\u2019re still bickering every day, though \u2026\u201d Tim Harcourt, the show\u2019s executive producer, says: \u201cWatching the show back now, it reminds me that we all took our freedom to travel for granted. But I hope the series serves as inspiration that\u2019s especially needed during these times. Families and young people especially are tapping into these shared experiences and discovering the world the only way they can at the moment \u2013 through exciting, adrenaline-filled travel TV.\u201d With holidays cancelled, weddings and festivals postponed and people having no idea when they will be allowed to leave their home towns, Harcourt is right in that viewers are looking to TV to transport them across continents and cultures.

      "body": "<p>A Russian aid shipment sent to Italy in late March as Rome struggled to contain the coronavirus outbreak has raised questions about the Kremlin\u2019s motives, amid cracks in EU solidarity.</p> <p>Russia, which has cultivated good relations with Italy in recent years, was one of the first countries to come to the rescue during the early stages of Italy\u2019s outbreak. It dispatched 122 military doctors, personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators and mobile disinfection machines on cargo planes from Moscow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/bergamo-field-hospital-russia-putin-italy-politics-aid\">Inside the Bergamo hospital where Russia has planted a flag</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Nato general Tod Wolters said this month that he was chiefly concerned about the presence of Russian military staff in Italy. \u201cIt is of concern. I pay very close attention to Russian malign influence,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The aid gesture, accompanied by the message \u201cFrom Russia with love\u201d, has been branded by observers as propaganda.</p> <p>Lorries emblazoned with both countries\u2019 flags and the aid slogan were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvOUuhaM4bM\">broadcast on Russian state TV</a> as they made the long journey from a military base near Rome to Bergamo, the province most severely affected by the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>But Italy\u2019s political leadership was dealt a series of blows over the aid. On 25 March a high-level political source told Jacopo Iacoboni, a journalist from La Stampa newspaper, that 80% of the Russian PPE was \u201cuseless\u201d. A Russian defence spokesman attacked the story on social media, ending his message with the veiled warning to Iacoboni that \u201c[he] who digs the grave crashes into it\u201d. La Stampa\u2019s story was not denied by the Italian government.</p> <p>In a further embarrassment, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said at a press conference that the request had come from the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, whose requests for essential aid from other EU member states had been rebuffed. Conte\u2019s office did not respond to questions from the Guardian about the aid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Italy\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Italy\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Andrea Armaro, a former spokesperson at Italy\u2019s defence ministry, said Russia was \u201cplaying to weaken Europe and Italy\u201d. He questioned the need for Russian military medics to disinfect areas when there were already nuclear, biological and chemical military teams in Italy capable of doing the job.</p> <p>\u201cAnd why did they land at Pratica di Mare, a very important military airport near Rome, instead of Bergamo airport or even Milan?\u201d he said. \u201cIf these were sincere operations with nothing to hide, you would land at the closest airport.

      "bodyText": "A Russian aid shipment sent to Italy in late March as Rome struggled to contain the coronavirus outbreak has raised questions about the Kremlin\u2019s motives, amid cracks in EU solidarity. Russia, which has cultivated good relations with Italy in recent years, was one of the first countries to come to the rescue during the early stages of Italy\u2019s outbreak. It dispatched 122 military doctors, personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators and mobile disinfection machines on cargo planes from Moscow. The Nato general Tod Wolters said this month that he was chiefly concerned about the presence of Russian military staff in Italy. \u201cIt is of concern. I pay very close attention to Russian malign influence,\u201d he said. The aid gesture, accompanied by the message \u201cFrom Russia with love\u201d, has been branded by observers as propaganda. Lorries emblazoned with both countries\u2019 flags and the aid slogan were broadcast on Russian state TV as they made the long journey from a military base near Rome to Bergamo, the province most severely affected by the coronavirus outbreak. But Italy\u2019s political leadership was dealt a series of blows over the aid. On 25 March a high-level political source told Jacopo Iacoboni, a journalist from La Stampa newspaper, that 80% of the Russian PPE was \u201cuseless\u201d. A Russian defence spokesman attacked the story on social media, ending his message with the veiled warning to Iacoboni that \u201c[he] who digs the grave crashes into it\u201d. La Stampa\u2019s story was not denied by the Italian government. In a further embarrassment, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said at a press conference that the request had come from the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, whose requests for essential aid from other EU member states had been rebuffed. Conte\u2019s office did not respond to questions from the Guardian about the aid. Andrea Armaro, a former spokesperson at Italy\u2019s defence ministry, said Russia was \u201cplaying to weaken Europe and Italy\u201d. He questioned the need for Russian military medics to disinfect areas when there were already nuclear, biological and chemical military teams in Italy capable of doing the job. \u201cAnd why did they land at Pratica di Mare, a very important military airport near Rome, instead of Bergamo airport or even Milan?\u201d he said. \u201cIf these were sincere operations with nothing to hide, you would land at the closest airport. [Russia was] taking advantage of a \u2018friendly\u2019 government, as well as a sloppy and inattentive one . \u201cIt was the largest and most successful propaganda operation carried out in a Nato territory at practically zero cost. I hope someone in Washington and Brussels wakes up before it\u2019s too late.\u201d As Russia\u2019s own outbreak has intensified, so too have domestic questions about aid shipments. During a conference call on Monday last week, Putin defended deliveries to Italy and the US, calling them \u201cnot just a one-way street\u201d. Russia analysts said there were some straightforward motivations for the foreign aid campaign, including diplomatic interests and the possibility of garnering return aid at a later date. \u201cNo country does humanitarian assistance purely because of the kindness of its heart,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian politics and security, adding that Russia was interested in currying favour with the Italians and framing a new narrative about its partnership with Europe. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together, which obviously can be used to chip away at sanctions.\u201d A Kremlin spokesman denied that the aid was aimed at getting EU sanctions on Russia lifted, saying there was no discussion of \u201cconditions or hopes or expectations\u201d.

      "body": "<p><strong>What has happened to Jared Kushner\u2019s face?<br></strong><em>Richard, by email</em></p> <p>People get a little antsy about the subject of cosmetic surgery: they don\u2019t like to be asked if they have had it, and public speculation over whether someone else has had it is generally considered to be de trop. I don\u2019t really get this. Maybe it\u2019s because I am 100% the world\u2019s worst liar, but pretending to not see that someone\u2019s face has completely changed is a form of magical thinking that is just beyond my capabilities.</p> <p>This column <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/11/tennis-marion-bartoli-inverdale-sexism-renee-zellwegger\">touched on this subject briefly four years ago</a> when a male film critic got in trouble for pointing out that Ren\u00e9e Zellweger no longer really looks like Ren\u00e9e Zellweger. My feelings remain unchanged: anyone who can convincingly claim they don\u2019t see it when an actor looks suddenly incredibly different should win an Oscar themselves.</p> <p>But what\u2019s more interesting than an actor changing their face is why they may have felt the need to do so. The cause rather than the effect, you see, and this is generally absent in discussions in celebrity magazines about \u201cwho\u2019s gone for the tuck?????\u201d. According to<a href=\"https://www.surgery.org/sites/default/files/ASAPS-Stats2015.pdf\"> 2015 figures from the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery</a>, men account for only 10% of cosmetic surgical procedures. Thus, articles about cosmetic surgery have focused on sneering at women for getting it and ignored the truth that women feel they have to because if they dare to look a day over 30 they will be on the professional, sexual and social slag heap. Hence the subject is seen by more sensitive types as a bit tricky and unsisterly, and one any good liberal soul should stay away from.</p> <p>Until we come to Jared Kushner. Now, I don\u2019t like Kushner. Chances are, you don\u2019t like Kushner. It is incredibly hard to like someone who believes he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/02/jared-kushner-middle-east-peace-plan\">can cure the Middle East</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/28/15075416/kushner-solve-opioid-crisis\">America\u2019s opioid crisis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/opinion/jared-kushner-coronavirus.html\">coronavirus</a> when <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/jared-kushner-worlds-worst-real-estate-developer\">he has repeatedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/03/30/i-worked-with-jared-kushner-hes-the-wrong-businessman-to-reinvent-government/\">proven to be barely able</a> to put his shoes on after his socks.</p> <p>But that is by the by here, because there are lots of people I don\u2019t like \u2013 Kushner\u2019s wife, Kushner\u2019s in-laws, Kushner\u2019s father, pretty much everyone connected to him, actually. And yet I don\u2019t spend my time wondering if any of them have had cosmetic surgery. (This is not entirely true: I have been known to Google \u201cIvanka Trump original nose\u201d, but that\u2019s because I\u2019m an intellectually curious journalist.) But Kushner: have you seen his face recently? Looking at <a href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/mrKSoStzhP54nkYh6\">photos of him from 2015</a> (dimpled, crinkle-eyed, generically cute) and <a href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/3bH53vHmm3RqyFgR9\">photos of him now</a> (hollow-cheeked, round-eyed, vision of evil), you can see he is the greatest PSA against changing your face since Jocelyn Wildenstein, AKA the <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/story-behind-changing-face-catwoman-9422943\">Bride of Wildenstein</a>.</p> <p>Chat about Kushner\u2019s face started last year after he was interviewed on HBO and his weirdly dewy and immobile skin led some to compare him to a \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/_JennyHollander/status/968654381460705281\">wet, haunted doll</a>\u201d. This has stepped up a notch after his appearance this month to explain to the media how he \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-story-behind-jared-kushners-curious-acceptance-into-harvard\">man whose father </a><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-story-behind-jared-kushners-curious-acceptance-into-harvard\">may have bought him his college acceptance</a> (the family denies this) \u2013 will cure coronavirus. We will, in all likelihood, never know what is happening with Kushner\u2019s face, but we can state, with absolute certainty, that the man is an idiot.</p> <p>What makes speculation about Kushner\u2019s face so fascinating, and guilt-free, is that he is hardly the typical candidate for such speculation: he is a 39-year-old man, who is \u2013 let\u2019s be generous here \u2013 some kind of political-slash-businessperson. So I don\u2019t think we can blame the patriarchy for any possible tweakments. But what is going on? The obvious answer is that he sold his soul to the devil when he took his 10 million jobs in his father-in-law\u2019s administration, and what we see now is the discarded husk Satan looked at, after eating the soul, and thought: \u201cThese scraps? Not even hell needs them.\u201d</p> <p>But this is not Kushner\u2019s first time at the rodeo of awful people. After all, his father <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/13/nyregion/donor-apologized-to-sister-for-seduction-of-husband.html\">once paid a prostitute to seduce his sister\u2019s husband, William Schulder, and then sent the tape to his sister</a>, as revenge for Schulder testifying against him when he was being investigated for tax evasion and illegal campaign donations. Kushner\u2019s father ended up serving time, so li\u2019l Jared was hardly an innocent babe when he hooked up with the Trumps. And yet, he looked like a normal person. Well, as Sally says to Harry in the movie: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DecLmDVcrj4\">You look like a normal person, but actually you are the angel of death</a>.\u201d Serving time in Trump\u2019s White House has revealed Kushner\u2019s true nature through his face. Well that, or an absolute ton of Botox.</p> <p><em>Post your questions to Hadley Freeman, Ask Hadley, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

      "bodyText": "What has happened to Jared Kushner\u2019s face? Richard, by email People get a little antsy about the subject of cosmetic surgery: they don\u2019t like to be asked if they have had it, and public speculation over whether someone else has had it is generally considered to be de trop. I don\u2019t really get this. Maybe it\u2019s because I am 100% the world\u2019s worst liar, but pretending to not see that someone\u2019s face has completely changed is a form of magical thinking that is just beyond my capabilities. This column touched on this subject briefly four years ago when a male film critic got in trouble for pointing out that Ren\u00e9e Zellweger no longer really looks like Ren\u00e9e Zellweger. My feelings remain unchanged: anyone who can convincingly claim they don\u2019t see it when an actor looks suddenly incredibly different should win an Oscar themselves. But what\u2019s more interesting than an actor changing their face is why they may have felt the need to do so. The cause rather than the effect, you see, and this is generally absent in discussions in celebrity magazines about \u201cwho\u2019s gone for the tuck?????\u201d. According to 2015 figures from the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, men account for only 10% of cosmetic surgical procedures. Thus, articles about cosmetic surgery have focused on sneering at women for getting it and ignored the truth that women feel they have to because if they dare to look a day over 30 they will be on the professional, sexual and social slag heap. Hence the subject is seen by more sensitive types as a bit tricky and unsisterly, and one any good liberal soul should stay away from. Until we come to Jared Kushner. Now, I don\u2019t like Kushner. Chances are, you don\u2019t like Kushner. It is incredibly hard to like someone who believes he can cure the Middle East, America\u2019s opioid crisis and coronavirus when he has repeatedly proven to be barely able to put his shoes on after his socks. But that is by the by here, because there are lots of people I don\u2019t like \u2013 Kushner\u2019s wife, Kushner\u2019s in-laws, Kushner\u2019s father, pretty much everyone connected to him, actually. And yet I don\u2019t spend my time wondering if any of them have had cosmetic surgery. (This is not entirely true: I have been known to Google \u201cIvanka Trump original nose\u201d, but that\u2019s because I\u2019m an intellectually curious journalist.) But Kushner: have you seen his face recently? Looking at photos of him from 2015 (dimpled, crinkle-eyed, generically cute) and photos of him now (hollow-cheeked, round-eyed, vision of evil), you can see he is the greatest PSA against changing your face since Jocelyn Wildenstein, AKA the Bride of Wildenstein. Chat about Kushner\u2019s face started last year after he was interviewed on HBO and his weirdly dewy and immobile skin led some to compare him to a \u201cwet, haunted doll\u201d. This has stepped up a notch after his appearance this month to explain to the media how he \u2013 a man whose father may have bought him his college acceptance (the family denies this) \u2013 will cure coronavirus. We will, in all likelihood, never know what is happening with Kushner\u2019s face, but we can state, with absolute certainty, that the man is an idiot. What makes speculation about Kushner\u2019s face so fascinating, and guilt-free, is that he is hardly the typical candidate for such speculation: he is a 39-year-old man, who is \u2013 let\u2019s be generous here \u2013 some kind of political-slash-businessperson. So I don\u2019t think we can blame the patriarchy for any possible tweakments. But what is going on? The obvious answer is that he sold his soul to the devil when he took his 10 million jobs in his father-in-law\u2019s administration, and what we see now is the discarded husk Satan looked at, after eating the soul, and thought: \u201cThese scraps? Not even hell needs them.\u201d But this is not Kushner\u2019s first time at the rodeo of awful people. After all, his father once paid a prostitute to seduce his sister\u2019s husband, William Schulder, and then sent the tape to his sister, as revenge for Schulder testifying against him when he was being investigated for tax evasion and illegal campaign donations. Kushner\u2019s father ended up serving time, so li\u2019l Jared was hardly an innocent babe when he hooked up with the Trumps. And yet, he looked like a normal person. Well, as Sally says to Harry in the movie: \u201cYou look like a normal person, but actually you are the angel of death.\u201d Serving time in Trump\u2019s White House has revealed Kushner\u2019s true nature through his face.

That question will decide the complexion of our politics, and the quality of our public infrastructure and services for years to come. Unless we tackle this issue, coronavirus debts will be the battering ram for a new campaign of austerity.</p> <p>The scale of the challenge is huge. Hard cases like Italy grab the headlines.

As a result of the crisis it will likely rise to 155%. But it is no longer an extreme outlier. According to the IMF, the debt ratio of the average advanced economy will exceed 120% next year. In the US, the debt to GDP ratio may soon surpass that at the end of the second world war.</p> <p>These numbers are impressive, daunting even. They offer an open door to conservative scaremongering. The first move in that tradition of debt politics is to invoke the tenuous analogy to a household. In this picture, debts are a burden on the profligate; a moral obligation that must be honoured on pain of national bankruptcy and ruin.</p> <p>There are some circumstances in which this analogy is apt, specifically when you are an impoverished and desperate country dependent on foreign creditors who will lend to you only in the currency of another country, most commonly that of the US. Many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/coronavirus-disaster-developing-nations-global-marshall-plan\">poorer countries</a> are in this position. Few rich countries are. Indeed, one of the definitions of being an advanced economy is that you are not.</p> <p>Advanced economies borrow in their own currency and overwhelmingly from their own citizens. For them, the household analogy is profoundly misleading. In fact, those seeking to rebut the misconceptions of the household analogy sometimes say we merely owe government debts to ourselves.</p> <p>That is a liberating thought. It makes clear that we are not in the position of a subordinate debtor nation. But it has a dizzying circularity to it. If we are our own creditors, are we not also our own debtors \u2013 master and slave at the same time? Ultimately, it is a <em>bon mot </em>that relies on treating the economic nation as a unit. That may look like liberation, but it is an illusion achieved by removing the real politics of debt \u2013 which are about class, not nationality.</p> <p>Historically, government debts were assets owned by the middle and upper classes, the famous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/30/wealth-banks-google-facebook-society-economy-parasites\">rentiers</a>. And taxes were overwhelmingly indirect and thus fell disproportionately on lower incomes.</p> <p>Today, the richest still own a disproportionate share of government debt. But the liabilities of the government are now widely distributed. They are staple investments for pension funds and insurers. Government debt is not simply a burden; it is a highly useful financial asset, offering modest interest rates in exchange for safety. It is all the more useful for the fact that the government lives for ever and will generate revenue for ever through taxation. So it enables very long-term planning.</p> <p>The tax base today is much broader than it was a century ago. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/tax-change-coronavirus-stimulus-act-millionaires-billionaires\">who pays taxes</a> \u2013 and who does not \u2013 remains one of the most urgent questions of the moment. A world in which coronavirus debts are repaid by a wealth tax or a global crackdown on corporate tax havens would look very different from one in which benefits are slashed and VAT is raised. And it is very possible that debt service will be taken out of other spending, whether that be schools, pensions or national defence.</p> <p>As the great Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter remarked in the aftermath of the first world war, \u201cthe budget is the skeleton of the state stripped of all misleading ideologies\u201d, the truest reflection of the distribution of power and influence.</p> <p>It is a distributional issue. But not only that. Debts may also affect the size of the cake itself. As we know only too well, a regime of austerity that keeps taxes high and government spending low is not conducive to rapid economic growth. And yet for debt to be sustainable, what we need is growth in GDP \u2013 to be precise, growth in nominal GDP, which includes real economic growth and inflation. Inflation matters because it acts as a tax on debts that are owed in money that is progressively losing its value. Price stability, the objective of monetary policy since the 1970s, no doubt has benefits for everyone, but most of all the creditor class.</p> <p>This is the awesome dilemma we will face in the aftermath of Covid-19. This is the battle for which we must brace. Not right now, but once the immediate crisis has passed. After the financial crisis of 2007-08, it was in 2010 that the push for belt-tightening began. Like revenge, austerity is a dish best served cold.</p> <p>Progressive politics cannot, of course, shrink from a battle about budgetary priorities. But it should resist fighting on the terms set by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/debt-relief-coronavirus-crash\">austerian debt-fear</a>. In the circumstances of the UK or the US, alarmism about debt is false. And how false is being demonstrated by the crisis itself.</p> <p>There is one mechanism through which we can ensure we truly owe the debts to ourselves. That mechanism is the central bank. Its principal job is to manage public debt \u2013 and at a moment of crisis central banks do what they must. They buy government debts or, in what amounts to the same thing, they open overdraft accounts for the government.</p> <p>That has two effects that, acting together, have the potential to negate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-bailouts-need-to-be-paid-back-or-do-they\">debt as a political issue</a>. Central bank intervention lowers the interest rate. If interest rates are held down, debt service need not be an onerous burden. At the same time, the central bank purchases remove government IOUs from private portfolios and put them on the balance sheet of the central bank. There, they are literally claims by the public upon itself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/economic-crisis-degrowth-green-new-deal\">In the midst of an economic crisis, can 'degrowth' provide an answer? | Lola Seaton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the central bank buys the debt it does so by creating money. Under ordinary circumstances one might worry about that causing inflation. But given the recession we face that is a risk worth running. Indeed modest inflation would help us by taking a bite out of the real value of the debt.</p> <p>Of course, ensuring that the central banks continue their crisis-fighting methods into the recovery period will itself require a political battle.

As the great Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter remarked in the aftermath of the first world war, \u201cthe budget is the skeleton of the state stripped of all misleading ideologies\u201d, the truest reflection of the distribution of power and influence. It is a distributional issue. But not only that. Debts may also affect the size of the cake itself. As we know only too well, a regime of austerity that keeps taxes high and government spending low is not conducive to rapid economic growth. And yet for debt to be sustainable, what we need is growth in GDP \u2013 to be precise, growth in nominal GDP, which includes real economic growth and inflation. Inflation matters because it acts as a tax on debts that are owed in money that is progressively losing its value. Price stability, the objective of monetary policy since the 1970s, no doubt has benefits for everyone, but most of all the creditor class. This is the awesome dilemma we will face in the aftermath of Covid-19. This is the battle for which we must brace. Not right now, but once the immediate crisis has passed. After the financial crisis of 2007-08, it was in 2010 that the push for belt-tightening began. Like revenge, austerity is a dish best served cold. Progressive politics cannot, of course, shrink from a battle about budgetary priorities. But it should resist fighting on the terms set by austerian debt-fear. In the circumstances of the UK or the US, alarmism about debt is false. And how false is being demonstrated by the crisis itself. There is one mechanism through which we can ensure we truly owe the debts to ourselves. That mechanism is the central bank. Its principal job is to manage public debt \u2013 and at a moment of crisis central banks do what they must. They buy government debts or, in what amounts to the same thing, they open overdraft accounts for the government. That has two effects that, acting together, have the potential to negate debt as a political issue. Central bank intervention lowers the interest rate. If interest rates are held down, debt service need not be an onerous burden. At the same time, the central bank purchases remove government IOUs from private portfolios and put them on the balance sheet of the central bank. There, they are literally claims by the public upon itself. When the central bank buys the debt it does so by creating money. Under ordinary circumstances one might worry about that causing inflation. But given the recession we face that is a risk worth running. Indeed modest inflation would help us by taking a bite out of the real value of the debt. Of course, ensuring that the central banks continue their crisis-fighting methods into the recovery period will itself require a political battle. Fearmongering about inflation is the close cousin of fearmongering about debt. We should resist both blackmails. We have the institutions and techniques to neutralise the coronavirus debt problem. We owe it to ourselves to use them. \u2022 Adam Tooze directs the European Institute at Columbia University and is the author of Crashed",

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s swift return to duty is welcome. He has clearly been through a personal nightmare. Given the pressures on him, he deserves sympathy and congratulations. In his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/boris-johnson-uk-beginning-to-turn-the-tide-on-coronavirus\">address to the nation</a> this morning he was characteristically Churchillian. He says Britain has come through coronavirus so far with flying colours. \u201cNow we must prepare to win phase two as we have won phase one.\u201d</p> <p>It is hard to know what news the prime minister has been watching or listening to. Johnson\u2019s language was opaque to the point of waffle. The British people are in the dark, more so than any in Europe. Though statistics are still desperately unreliable, all we do know is that Britain has not performed well during the coronavirus pandemic. It is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/uk-could-have-europes-worst-coronavirus-death-rate-says-pandemic-expert\">among the most dilatory nations</a> in securing recovery.</p> <p>The only strategy mentioned by Johnson was the need to \u201celiminate the risk of a second spike\u201d. There is no way such a risk can be eliminated, short of never taking it. But it is unacceptable to hamstring the entire economy indefinitely, as Johnson implied, merely to stop further infection \u201coverwhelming our NHS\u201d. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/chaos-and-panic-lancet-editor-says-nhs-was-left-unprepared-for-covid-19\">unpreparedness of the NHS</a> has contributed to Britain\u2019s plight. Its future \u201cprotection\u201d is not a sufficient reason for the scale of cost now being imposed on the economy.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s swift return to duty is welcome. He has clearly been through a personal nightmare. Given the pressures on him, he deserves sympathy and congratulations. In his address to the nation this morning he was characteristically Churchillian. He says Britain has come through coronavirus so far with flying colours. \u201cNow we must prepare to win phase two as we have won phase one.\u201d It is hard to know what news the prime minister has been watching or listening to. Johnson\u2019s language was opaque to the point of waffle. The British people are in the dark, more so than any in Europe. Though statistics are still desperately unreliable, all we do know is that Britain has not performed well during the coronavirus pandemic. It is now among the most dilatory nations in securing recovery. The only strategy mentioned by Johnson was the need to \u201celiminate the risk of a second spike\u201d. There is no way such a risk can be eliminated, short of never taking it. But it is unacceptable to hamstring the entire economy indefinitely, as Johnson implied, merely to stop further infection \u201coverwhelming our NHS\u201d. The unpreparedness of the NHS has contributed to Britain\u2019s plight. Its future \u201cprotection\u201d is not a sufficient reason for the scale of cost now being imposed on the economy. If there is another spike, the NHS must be helped to face it. The rest of Europe \u2013 an entity Johnson despises \u2013 is already well advanced into what he presumably means when he says phase two. Yet his speech was empty of specifics. There was no indication of ending the bias against the private care sector, the neglected \u201cpoor bloody infantry\u201d of coronavirus.

Our mum moved Katie out of her assisted living home a few weeks ahead of the government shutdown to live with her, which was absolutely the right thing to do, but they are now in a very rural part of mid-Wales and have limited access to resources.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m shocked but not surprised that she has been excluded \u2013 I have no faith that this government knows or cares how to support the most vulnerable members of society. I would love to understand what their criteria was, and why someone on oxygen was not automatically regarded as vulnerable.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>N</strong><strong> A</strong><strong> Le Bren, 37, London</strong></h2> <p>\u201cMy housemate is severely visually impaired. I use a wheelchair. We are both autistic. I\u2019ve been campaigning since the list went live because it excludes so many of us. I managed to get on the Tesco list a few days ago but the earliest delivery available is 17 May and when I talk to supermarkets they don\u2019t seem to get that the government list is in effect useless. I\u2019ve had disabled friends tell me to lie about my conditions to get on the list but that\u2019s fraud. And I shouldn\u2019t have to. Neither my housemate nor I drive and we are dependent on her 70-year-old dad and Amazon Prime and takeaways.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Clara, 62, South Tyneside</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI had lung cancer (I am a non-smoker) and had half of my left lung removed four months ago. It left me unable to function on a day-to-day basis, so Macmillan helped me apply for PIP [personal independence payments] in January.</p> <p>\u201cMy home visit was set for 5 March but cancelled [due to the lockdown] and I\u2019m now waiting for a letter to tell me when I will have a telephone assessment.</p> <p>\u201cIn the meantime, I am really struggling to manage. I am not classed as vulnerable, even though catching the virus could kill me. I can\u2019t get out of the house and have only \u00a3200 a month. It\u2019s difficult and I feel like I\u2019m stuck in a hiatus. I\u2019m not in a dire situation, and not the worst off by any means, but it\u2019s very annoying and frustrating. You just fall through the net. People like me are just a statistic.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Anonymous small care home owner</strong></h2> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re unable to register on the government\u2019s vulnerable website as a residential home. When we signed up for online shopping from Sainsbury\u2019s some 10 years ago, it was in the manager\u2019s name, therefore, on the government website he is not identified as a vulnerable person. The home is invisible.</p> <p>\u201cOur residents have learning disabilities, early onset dementia, autism and another has cerebral palsy. My staff, who are working to ensure their safety by self-isolating with them, are now in a position where they have to go out to the supermarket to buy food for the home.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Stephen Cook, 61, Glasgow</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI can barely walk. Both hips need replacement. No friends or relatives nearby. Neighbours indifferent. Taxis and public transport difficult to use to access supermarket. I don\u2019t have a car as the DWP [Department for Work and Pensions] didn\u2019t award sufficient points for [my disability benefits], though deemed severely disabled. Online shopping is clogged. So I do a small shop at local 100m away once a day. It\u2019s not at all easy. The walk gets done in three or five times the normal walking speed, with crutches. Painful. Queuing outside supermarkets when I get there is impossible. I contacted my support worker three weeks ago regarding prioritisation for online shopping. No response.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Sandra O\u2019Donovan, 42, Leeds</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI have been unable to register as vulnerable, even though the reality of me dying if I contract coronavirus is extremely high. I can\u2019t feed myself or go to the toilet myself. I use my chin and mouth to use a computer. I have sleep apnoea and need to use a CPAP [breathing] machine every night, arthritis, chronic pain and fatigue and often struggle to get out of bed.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t fit on the government\u2019s list, I am prone to chest infections and can get very ill very quickly, which is why I now have emergency antibiotics at home. I have had pneumonia twice and in 2016 I spent three weeks on and off a ventilator. Due to my disability, I have 24/7 personal assistance [but] every time my PA needs to go to the shop there is a heightened risk of them carrying the virus to me.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Dolores, 73, London</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a severely disabled pensioner with ME and bad osteoarthritis. I\u2019m often house/bed bound and unable to shop at supermarkets. For over a year I\u2019ve depended entirely on home delivery services. I have not received a letter from the government classing me as highly vulnerable. I\u2019ve self-referred and registered three times. I\u2019ve had no reply or any news to date. I\u2019ve no family, friends or any support network whatsoever. It\u2019s like it\u2019s in the laps of the gods and if the gods are in a good mood then you\u2019ll get help.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been able to get Tesco to offer me a priority slot but I have to wait for them at midnight. I\u2019m amazed and disgusted by the levels of incompetence reached by this current administration.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been very difficult. I felt completely invisible for the first few weeks of the pandemic \u2013 it was very unsettling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Linda Miller, 58, in Perth, Scotland</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI\u2019m struggling to care for my 77-year-old mum, my 30-year-old autistic son and my 40-year-old daughter who has mental health issues and is also 20 weeks pregnant.

      "body": "<p>Her fertility medication had arrived and Ellen Rayment was waiting for the first day of her period so she could begin taking it. Rayment, a 40-year-old health professional from East Sussex, had been trying to conceive with her wife Debby for three years. It had been costly and emotionally draining. The Rayments were declined treatment on the NHS because they were using donor genetic material, so they had spent in excess of \u00a320,000 on private IVF.</p> <p>In November 2019, Rayment had miscarried twins at 22 weeks. After taking some time to both physically recover and grieve, Rayment\u2019s doctor gave her the go-ahead to proceed with egg implantation using the final frozen embryo from their second round of IVF in March. She was waiting for her period to start before taking the medication to thicken her uterine wall, ahead of embryo implantation. But when that came it was on the same day Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus. All non-urgent medical procedures, including IVF, would be postponed. Her clinic called her to confirm the bad news.</p> <p>With each month that Britain spends under lockdown, Rayment can feel her dreams of motherhood slipping away. \u201cMy biological clock is ticking louder and louder,\u201d she says. Rayment is aware that, after 40, it is difficult to conceive through IVF. \u201cIt just feels horrific, to be honest,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Rayment is one of a number of women whose IVF treatments have been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Although many IVF clinics decided to suspend treatment after Johnson\u2019s 23 March announcement, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which oversees all NHS IVF clinics, did not officially stop all fertility treatments until 15 April. Exceptions are being made only when women are undergoing fertility-preservation treatment ahead of radiotherapy or chemotherapy for serious diseases.</p> <p>\u201cWe will do all we can to lift this restriction as soon as possible but we cannot give a date when this will happen given the current situation with the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK \u2026 our aim is for the UK fertility sector to restart as soon as possible and we are keeping the situation under regular review,\u201d says an HFEA spokesperson. Whereas the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish authorities have confirmed that fertility patients will not be disadvantaged by coronavirus when clinics reopen, meaning that clinics will pick up where they left off \u2013 with patients receiving the same treatment according to the same criteria that they would have been entitled to before the pandemic \u2013 England has not made the same promise. There are fears that IVF provision in England \u2013 which has already been squeezed by national cuts, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/19/uks-oldest-ivf-clinic-at-risk-of-closure-amid-increasing-privatisations\">some hospital trusts</a> selling or considering closing their IVF clinics, or offering a reduced number of IVF cycles \u2013 could be further cut after the coronavirus pandemic, to help rebalance the NHS funding black hole. </p> <p>For women who had already started fertility treatment and were on a cocktail of fertility-boosting drugs when the pandemic hit, the IVF ban was a bitter blow. \u201cThat was the hardest bit,\u201d says Kara*, a 34-year-old social worker from Sheffield. \u201cTaking all those drugs that affect you so much, for nothing.\u201d After Kara found out her NHS IVF treatment was cancelled in March, she had to continue taking oral and injectable oestrogen and progesterone for a further two weeks, to complete her monthly cycle. Kara and her husband have been trying to conceive for five years; she has miscarried five times.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>IVF is a long road, littered with obstacles; now the coronavirus pandemic is one more thing that\u2019s out of your control</p> <footer> <cite>Seetal Savla</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Being full of pregnancy-inducing hormones without being pregnant, in the midst of a global pandemic, did not do much for Kara\u2019s physical or mental health. \u201cI was devastated,\u201d she says. \u201cAll those hormones make you really emotional and the injectable progesterone makes your stomach sore, and you get so tired.

Towler was due to commence her first round of NHS IVF this April, nearly four years after she first visited her GP about her fertility issues. \u201cI am very worried about my egg reserves,\u201d Towler says. \u201cI will be 39 at the end of this year. The decline will be steep from now on.\u201d</p> <p>A lack of clarity from the government about when the lockdown will end adds to many women\u2019s anxiety and sense of powerlessness. \u201cSo much of IVF is beyond your control,\u201d says Seetal Savla, a 38-year-old PR manager from London. \u201cIt\u2019s a long road that\u2019s littered with obstacles, and now the coronavirus pandemic is one more thing that\u2019s out of your control.\u201d After her first round of NHS IVF failed in 2017, Savla and her husband Neil turned to private clinics. Savla has low egg reserves, meaning that her chances of becoming a mother are already low. \u201cIf the government would say that in two or three months, IVF can start again, that would be something to count down towards,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the uncertainty that\u2019s difficult to accept.\u201d</p> <p>An exit strategy for the fertility sector is needed, says Dr Geeta Nargund, a fertility expert at St George\u2019s NHS Trust. \u201cWe need a proactive approach to restarting these services, detailing which social distancing measures and safety approaches will be required, and what protective equipment will be made available for staff,\u201d she says. When the lockdown is lifted, Nargund wants priority to be given to women with low egg reserves, or those who are older. \u201cTime is of the essence for them,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>All the women understand the pressures on the NHS. \u201cI get that we have to protect the NHS,\u201d says Kara. \u201cI understand why they\u2019ve cancelled all the treatments.

      "body": "<p>Week six and it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re through all the stages of grief now and are stuck at boredom. We\u2019ve had shock and denial (\u201cWhat, in my house? <em>Inside </em>my house?\u201d); we\u2019ve had pain and guilt (\u201cI\u2019ll do two YouTube workouts a day and somehow also write a novel\u201d); there was that fortnight of anger and bargaining (\u201cHands off my 36-pack of Andrex or I am calling the police\u201d); then the depression, reflection and loneliness (this means \u201cmaking sourdough\u201d, by the way. Sourdough is a depressed person\u2019s idea of bread); the upward turn (cracking open a can \u201cto furlough!\u201d every day at 4pm); reconstruction (building a new society where the only jailable offences are \u201cbeing in a park while the park is busy\u201d and \u201cnot clapping loud enough for the NHS\u201d); and then through to acceptance and hope (I\u2019ve started texting \u201csee you in 2021!\u201d unironically to friends and family). Every jigsaw has been done, every boxset has been binge-watched, every manuscript has been abandoned. Bored now. Done with this. Over it.</p> <p>Boredom is not a threatening feeling on its own, but it is in quarantine. In the US, the last couple of weekends have been dominated by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/19/protests-maryland-texas-ohio-coronavirus-stay-at-home-orders-video-report\">semi-formless protest movement</a> \u2013 nameless, mindless, shapeless, but bored \u2013 made up of a Tea Party-esque, libertarian-adjacent freedom-above-all faction who take masks and billboards and semi-automatic weapons and stand outside monuments, demanding the right to be allowed out to do the things they love: eat well-done steaks in restaurants, wear wraparound shades inside well-lit malls, run over wild animals with 4X4s. If you think this sort of thing will never make its way to the UK, can I remind you how many 5G towers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/06/at-least-20-uk-phone-masts-vandalised-over-false-5g-coronavirus-claims\">have been torn down</a> in the past month because people think they are beaming out coronavirus particles. If anything, it\u2019s weird the protests haven\u2019t made it here already.</p> <p>Which brings us to Boris Johnson, who is alive. On Monday morning, Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/boris-johnson-uk-beginning-to-turn-the-tide-on-coronavirus\">took to a podium outside Downing Street</a> to say that right, listen, no, lockdown restrictions won\u2019t be lifted any time soon, and can everyone stop thinking the problem is solved just because they haven\u2019t yet personally suffered at the hands of it. \u201cI know it is tough,\u201d he said, \u201cand I want to get this economy moving as fast as I can, but I refuse to throw away all the effort and the sacrifice of the British people and to risk a second major outbreak and huge loss of life and the overwhelming of the NHS.\u201d He might have spent the week hiding from public view so nobody said, \u201cSo, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-38-days-when-britain-sleepwalked-into-disaster-hq3b9tlgh\">the Sunday Times</a>\u2026\u201d at him, but it seems like roughly the right call.</p> <p>The pressure to relieve lockdown isn\u2019t just coming from a small revolutionary group of bored Britons, of course (and I do mean small: describing the lockdown as \u201cunlawful imprisonment\u201d on social media and \u201cbeing so mad at the TV licence that you end up going to court about it\u201d seem, to me, to share the same vibe) \u2013 it\u2019s also coming from big business. This week\u2019s Sunday Times bore the front-page headline \u201cTory grandees tell PM: it\u2019s time to ease the lockdown\u201d, where \u201cTory grandees\u201d can be read as \u201cbusiness owners with long histories of donating to the Conservative party who would quite like their shop floors back, thanks\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Week six and it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re through all the stages of grief now and are stuck at boredom. We\u2019ve had shock and denial (\u201cWhat, in my house? Inside my house?\u201d); we\u2019ve had pain and guilt (\u201cI\u2019ll do two YouTube workouts a day and somehow also write a novel\u201d); there was that fortnight of anger and bargaining (\u201cHands off my 36-pack of Andrex or I am calling the police\u201d); then the depression, reflection and loneliness (this means \u201cmaking sourdough\u201d, by the way. Sourdough is a depressed person\u2019s idea of bread); the upward turn (cracking open a can \u201cto furlough!\u201d every day at 4pm); reconstruction (building a new society where the only jailable offences are \u201cbeing in a park while the park is busy\u201d and \u201cnot clapping loud enough for the NHS\u201d); and then through to acceptance and hope (I\u2019ve started texting \u201csee you in 2021!\u201d unironically to friends and family). Every jigsaw has been done, every boxset has been binge-watched, every manuscript has been abandoned. Bored now. Done with this. Over it. Boredom is not a threatening feeling on its own, but it is in quarantine. In the US, the last couple of weekends have been dominated by a semi-formless protest movement \u2013 nameless, mindless, shapeless, but bored \u2013 made up of a Tea Party-esque, libertarian-adjacent freedom-above-all faction who take masks and billboards and semi-automatic weapons and stand outside monuments, demanding the right to be allowed out to do the things they love: eat well-done steaks in restaurants, wear wraparound shades inside well-lit malls, run over wild animals with 4X4s. If you think this sort of thing will never make its way to the UK, can I remind you how many 5G towers have been torn down in the past month because people think they are beaming out coronavirus particles. If anything, it\u2019s weird the protests haven\u2019t made it here already. Which brings us to Boris Johnson, who is alive. On Monday morning, Johnson took to a podium outside Downing Street to say that right, listen, no, lockdown restrictions won\u2019t be lifted any time soon, and can everyone stop thinking the problem is solved just because they haven\u2019t yet personally suffered at the hands of it. \u201cI know it is tough,\u201d he said, \u201cand I want to get this economy moving as fast as I can, but I refuse to throw away all the effort and the sacrifice of the British people and to risk a second major outbreak and huge loss of life and the overwhelming of the NHS.\u201d He might have spent the week hiding from public view so nobody said, \u201cSo, the Sunday Times\u2026\u201d at him, but it seems like roughly the right call. The pressure to relieve lockdown isn\u2019t just coming from a small revolutionary group of bored Britons, of course (and I do mean small: describing the lockdown as \u201cunlawful imprisonment\u201d on social media and \u201cbeing so mad at the TV licence that you end up going to court about it\u201d seem, to me, to share the same vibe) \u2013 it\u2019s also coming from big business. This week\u2019s Sunday Times bore the front-page headline \u201cTory grandees tell PM: it\u2019s time to ease the lockdown\u201d, where \u201cTory grandees\u201d can be read as \u201cbusiness owners with long histories of donating to the Conservative party who would quite like their shop floors back, thanks\u201d. Even Keir Starmer \u2013 who I will not trust until he drops the info on where he\u2019s getting his hair cut right now \u2013 penned one of those entirely useless letters to the prime minister where he talked in vague terms about an \u201cexit strategy\u201d. The message is there, rumbling in the background, an ominous grey cloud on the horizon: capitalism wants its ball back, and Westminster wants to help lob it over the fence. And, weirdly, the voice of resistance here is \u2026 hold on, I can\u2019t be reading this correctly. Boris Johnson? One fact I always used to repeat a lot when I was boring people in the pub \u2013 a treasured memory from a life I had 100 years ago \u2013 was the Black Death inadvertently led to the creation of the middle class. Peasants were overwhelmingly affected by the spread of the disease, population numbers dwindled, a recovering economy of landowners v workers evened the odds for those who ploughed the land, and the savviest among the survivors negotiated pay rises and land of their own in exchange for their services. Long story short, we now have Waitrose, Heston Blumenthal and the Range Rover Evoque.

If Johnson thinks his Downing Street statement bought him time, it didn\u2019t; it fired the starting gun for a race towards some real transparency, a wider debate of maturity and complexity, undertaken with better, fuller information. If he can\u2019t get there by 7 May, when the next review of the lockdown is due, the country will simply outpace him. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

But, in other European countries, leaders are coming under growing pressure to move faster and Germany was locked in a row over how and when to lift restrictions amid concerns the country is in danger of gambling away its achievements so far. Over 3 million people have been infected by the coronavirus around the world and more than 208,000 have died, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The world\u2019s worst pandemic in a century has forced governments into a dilemma. People confined to their homes for weeks are growing frustrated and anxious and, with economic activity all but dead, prolonged recessions are forecast in many countries. But with an antidote or vaccine yet to be found, leaders are also acutely aware of the danger of a second wave of infections. The Swiss stopped short of full lockdown in emergency measures introduced last month, but on Monday began the first of a three-stage lifting plan with doctors, dentists, nursery schools, hairdressers and massage and beauty salons permitted to reopen along with hardware stores, garden centres and florists. A week after it reopened its pre-schools, Norway sent its younger primary school pupils back to class \u2013 with a maximum of 15 in each, and many parents far from reassured \u2013 after a month and a half of remote learning from home. In the Czech Republic, which declared a state of emergency before its first Covid-19 death, a five-stage lockdown exit plan has been moved forward, allowing gyms and stores smaller than 2,500 sq metres outside shopping malls to reopen on Monday. The central European country\u2019s detailed roadmap, which divides businesses and amenities into five \u2013 since reduced to four \u2013 categories according to the risk of new infections each poses, is understood to be being studied by the UK government. Croatia on Monday also began easing curbs, allowing smaller shops, libraries and museums to reopen, while Serbia permitted small businesses and food markets to open their shutters, eased an overnight curfew and allowed elderly people to venture outside three times a week.

Spain\u2019s nearly 47 million people have spent more than six weeks under one of the strictest lockdowns in the world, with only adults authorised to leave home to buy food and medicines or walk the dog. Authorities cautiously prepared further steps to loosen confinement on Monday after children were allowed to leave their homes for the first time in six weeks on Sunday, causing concern about crowds in some areas. Italy, which has the world\u2019s third highest rate of coronavirus deaths at more than 26,000, will allow factories and building sites to reopen from 4 May and permit limited family visits as it prepares a staged end to Europe\u2019s longest lockdown, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said at the weekend.

In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.</p>\n    <p>The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.</p>\n    <p>In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Vallance said there was interest in the Sage meetings across Whitehall from early on.

It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/singapore-coronavirus-increase-revives-fears-of-post-lockdown-surge\">resurgence in infections</a>&nbsp;despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.</p>\n    <p>Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">cramped dormitory accommodation</a>&nbsp;used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.</p>\n    <p>Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are experts worried about?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.</p>\n    <p>The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.</p>\n    <p>In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, days later the release scheme was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/18/uk-coronavirus-prison-plan-suspended-after-six-mistakenly-released\">temporarily suspended</a> after six inmates were mistakenly freed and then recalled.</p> \n<p>Late on Monday the Ministry of Justice published analysis by a Public Health England (PHE) expert that said early data suggested the \u201cexplosive outbreaks\u201d of Covid-19 that were feared at the beginning of the pandemic were not being seen.</p> \n<p>The paper was written by Dr \u00c9amonn O\u2019Moore, the national lead for health and justice at PHE and a director at the UK collaborating centre for the World Health Organization\u2019s health in prisons programme. </p> \n<p>He said physical distancing and reduction in prison transfers could be behind the fact the reproduction rate of the virus in prisons was below one, meaning each case of infection passed the bug on to no more than one other person.</p> \n<p>PHE has undertaken modelling that suggests maintaining this reduction in contacts will have a \u201csignificant impact on the risk of infection in prison populations and consequences such as hospitalisation or death\u201d, the paper said. </p> \n<p>Buckland struck an optimistic tone as he told MPs there were \u201cpositive signs\u201d that the approach in prisons was working, although he cautioned: \u201cWe are not out of the woods yet.\u201d</p> \n<p>In response to a question by the shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, Buckland told the House of Commons: \u201cWith regard to the question of early release, progress has been careful and slow but we\u2019ve reached a position now where, also taking into account the release of pregnant women, a total of 33 prisoners have been released.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is a scheme I\u2019ve not embarked upon lightly.

The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, told the Commons that those released included pregnant prisoners and women in mother and baby units (MBUs). The Ministry of Justice had said on 4 April that the Prison Service would free up to 4,000 prisoners who were within two months of their release date and had passed a risk assessment. On 15 April the justice minister Lucy Frazer told MPs on the justice select committee that a \u201cfew hundred\u201d prisoners were set for release the next day. However, days later the release scheme was temporarily suspended after six inmates were mistakenly freed and then recalled. Late on Monday the Ministry of Justice published analysis by a Public Health England (PHE) expert that said early data suggested the \u201cexplosive outbreaks\u201d of Covid-19 that were feared at the beginning of the pandemic were not being seen. The paper was written by Dr \u00c9amonn O\u2019Moore, the national lead for health and justice at PHE and a director at the UK collaborating centre for the World Health Organization\u2019s health in prisons programme.

Work on the \u00a360m, 16,000-seat stand was to begin in December, subject to planning permission, in order for an 18-month development to be completed in the summer of 2022. A close season is required to put the finishing touches to the construction, a timeline Liverpool also followed when building the new main stand. However, with no guarantee the time-sensitive project can start in December, club officials have delayed the expansion. Liverpool hope to start work on increasing Anfield\u2019s capacity to more than 61,000 in December 2021, with a view to completion in the summer of 2023.

It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/singapore-coronavirus-increase-revives-fears-of-post-lockdown-surge\">resurgence in infections</a>&nbsp;despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.</p>\n    <p>Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">cramped dormitory accommodation</a>&nbsp;used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.</p>\n    <p>Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are experts worried about?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.</p>\n    <p>The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.</p>\n    <p>In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Speaking to the Guardian, Eyal Winter said ministers could allow a broader resumption of activity, but only if it was accompanied by a stricter level of enforcement.</p> \n<p>Winter said the Cabinet Office was deeply concerned that some people would behave inappropriately as soon as lockdown was ended. One fear was that pubs would get very full. \u201cPeople are starving for pubs. They are an important part of British culture,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Winter, an economist at Lancaster University, is part of a team of behavioural experts who have been advising the government since April.</p> \n<p>His views have been shared with the cabinet office as ministers consider a range of options for how the UK might emerge from the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n<p>Winter said he opposed opening up the UK economy sector by sector. He has argued his blueprint would be more equitable than a gradual easing of restrictions, which could fuel resentment among those still unable to work.</p> \n<p>He said the government should follow a German-style approach, with clear dates and targets. \u201cOne of the most important things is to have a programme, to say, \u2018in two weeks we will do such and such\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to make the rules crystal clear, and to explain to the public the rationale behind each one of them.\u201d</p> \n<p>He was sceptical that official \u201cnudge\u201d warnings would keep people out of bars, putting them at risk of getting the virus or unwittingly passing it to others. One solution would be for landlords to ration how much beer they serve, to two or three pints, he said. Customers would then be politely asked to go home.</p> \n<p>Landlords and shop owners should be tasked with enforcing these new rules and to monitoring customer numbers, he said.</p> \n<p>He envisaged theatres and cinemas would also reopen but sell half as many tickets as before, with gaps in seating. Prices could be raised to cover revenue shortfalls.</p> \n<p>A similar empty \u201cmiddle-seat\u201d policy was likely to be introduced on planes, he said. Travel would restart with a \u201clow version of social distancing\u201d. Winter was dismissive of Michael O\u2019Leary, the boss of Ryanair, who last week said he wouldn\u2019t bother flying his planes in this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/22/ryanair-boss-says-airline-wont-fly-with-idiotic-social-distancing-rules\">\u201cidiotic\u201d scenario.</a> Winter pointed to the recent collapse in the global oil price. Restrictions \u201cwouldn\u2019t be for eternity\u201d, he stressed.</p> \n<p>Some changes, such as the use of Zoom and other homeworking technologies, were good, he said. Overall, Winter said he was confident the world would eventually return to its pre-virus state. This would probably take two years, assuming the planet avoided future pandemics.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cSome people have an apocalyptic view of this. I\u2019m old enough to remember 9/11. We had exactly the same impression afterwards then. We thought: \u2018It\u2019s over. We will lock ourselves in shelters. We will stop flying.\u2019 It never happened,\u201d he pointed out. He added: \u201cIt will take a lot of time to move back to January 2020. But we will get there.\u201d</p> \n<p>Winter \u2013 who is also a professor at the Hebrew University\u2019s centre for the study of rationality \u2013 was speaking from his home between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. He has also been advising the government in Israel, where the death toll from coronavirus has been significantly lower than in the UK. He is due to hold further discussions on Tuesday with the Cabinet Office\u2019s behavioural science group. The group feeds policy ideas to government. Not all are accepted, Winter said.</p> \n<p>Another prominent adviser to the Cabinet Office is Daniel Kahneman, the Israeli-American economist and Nobel laureate, celebrated for his work on the psychology of judgement and decision making. Kahneman declined to comment.</p> \n<p>Winter said that the group had discussed the gruelling psychological toll that lockdown was having on individuals. Some were \u201ctaking more risks\u201d. Others were experiencing high levels of anxiety, which left them open to being scammed or to going on irrational spending sprees.</p> \n<p>He predicted that crime and violence were likely to jump once the lockdown was over. He also anticipated a period of social division, with grievances among those who felt they had suffered more than others. Branding some workers essential and others superfluous was unwise. This could leave citizens feeling they had been treated unfairly, he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The Cabinet Office confirmed its team had spoken to Winter about exit lockdown strategy. It said the government sought advice from a wide range of experts including academics, healthcare professionals and business leaders.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson has been<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/boris-johnson-uk-beginning-to-turn-the-tide-on-coronavirus\"> reluctant to explain his thinking</a> on how the lockdown might end. This is causing frustration among some Tory MPs, as well as to millions of workers who have seen their incomes evaporate.

He said the government should follow a German-style approach, with clear dates and targets. \u201cOne of the most important things is to have a programme, to say, \u2018in two weeks we will do such and such\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to make the rules crystal clear, and to explain to the public the rationale behind each one of them.\u201d He was sceptical that official \u201cnudge\u201d warnings would keep people out of bars, putting them at risk of getting the virus or unwittingly passing it to others. One solution would be for landlords to ration how much beer they serve, to two or three pints, he said. Customers would then be politely asked to go home. Landlords and shop owners should be tasked with enforcing these new rules and to monitoring customer numbers, he said. He envisaged theatres and cinemas would also reopen but sell half as many tickets as before, with gaps in seating. Prices could be raised to cover revenue shortfalls. A similar empty \u201cmiddle-seat\u201d policy was likely to be introduced on planes, he said. Travel would restart with a \u201clow version of social distancing\u201d. Winter was dismissive of Michael O\u2019Leary, the boss of Ryanair, who last week said he wouldn\u2019t bother flying his planes in this \u201cidiotic\u201d scenario. Winter pointed to the recent collapse in the global oil price. Restrictions \u201cwouldn\u2019t be for eternity\u201d, he stressed. Some changes, such as the use of Zoom and other homeworking technologies, were good, he said. Overall, Winter said he was confident the world would eventually return to its pre-virus state. This would probably take two years, assuming the planet avoided future pandemics. \u201cSome people have an apocalyptic view of this. I\u2019m old enough to remember 9/11. We had exactly the same impression afterwards then. We thought: \u2018It\u2019s over. We will lock ourselves in shelters. We will stop flying.\u2019 It never happened,\u201d he pointed out. He added: \u201cIt will take a lot of time to move back to January 2020. But we will get there.\u201d Winter \u2013 who is also a professor at the Hebrew University\u2019s centre for the study of rationality \u2013 was speaking from his home between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. He has also been advising the government in Israel, where the death toll from coronavirus has been significantly lower than in the UK. He is due to hold further discussions on Tuesday with the Cabinet Office\u2019s behavioural science group. The group feeds policy ideas to government. Not all are accepted, Winter said. Another prominent adviser to the Cabinet Office is Daniel Kahneman, the Israeli-American economist and Nobel laureate, celebrated for his work on the psychology of judgement and decision making. Kahneman declined to comment. Winter said that the group had discussed the gruelling psychological toll that lockdown was having on individuals. Some were \u201ctaking more risks\u201d. Others were experiencing high levels of anxiety, which left them open to being scammed or to going on irrational spending sprees. He predicted that crime and violence were likely to jump once the lockdown was over. He also anticipated a period of social division, with grievances among those who felt they had suffered more than others. Branding some workers essential and others superfluous was unwise. This could leave citizens feeling they had been treated unfairly, he said. The Cabinet Office confirmed its team had spoken to Winter about exit lockdown strategy. It said the government sought advice from a wide range of experts including academics, healthcare professionals and business leaders. Boris Johnson has been reluctant to explain his thinking on how the lockdown might end. This is causing frustration among some Tory MPs, as well as to millions of workers who have seen their incomes evaporate. The UK\u2019s position is increasingly anomalous: other European countries have revealed timetables for the reopening of schools and non-essential businesses.",

It is not just racing. The whole country, the entire economy, is in lockdown. Millions are wondering whether they will have a job to go back to when the restrictions eventually ease. Every sector in the travel, tourism, leisure and entertainment industries, including racing, is experiencing a devastating loss of business and revenue while also facing up to the likelihood \u2013 the near certainty, in fact \u2013 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/prepare-for-the-coronavirus-global-recession\">a deep recession is just around the corner</a>.</p> <p>In these circumstances, special pleading from any one sector, suggesting that its needs are more urgent than those elsewhere, is a terrible look. It is also one that, thus far, the locked-down racing industry has managed to avoid. The message has been clear and consistent (even when the line from government has been anything but): racing in some form will be ready to resume <em>as soon as the national restrictions in place to combat the coronavirus pandemic allow it to do so</em>.</p> <p>When the moment arrives, it will be days, not weeks, before the first horses go to post to race behind closed doors, thanks to an immense amount of work at BHA headquarters to pick a path through the most challenging circumstances the sport has ever faced. Beckett, above all, should be aware of what has been happening, since he will be the president of the National Trainers Federation in 2021 and he has been in the loop from the start.</p> <p>It will not look like racing as we knew and loved it this time last year, or even as it was three months ago, and in some respects, it probably never will be. Owners, trainers and horses will be lost to the sport over the coming months and years, and possibly several racecourses too. An annual fixture list with 1,500 meetings may well be a thing of the past. But it will be a vital first step on a very long road towards a new normal, and quite what any of the trainers who emailed Phelps to demand Rust\u2019s head expected to achieve in doing so is all but impossible to divine.</p> <p>There was never any chance that Phelps would ask for Rust\u2019s resignation, nor any valid reason for her to do so. Quite the opposite, in fact: the BHA board confirmed that Rust has its \u201cfull and unequivocal support\u201d, while racing-minded MPs from both sides of the house have also rallied around.</p> <p>Everyone in racing is suffering during lockdown, including many in a much more challenging situation than trainers like Johnston and Beckett. If special pleading is a terrible look, it is worse still when it is initiated by some of the (relatively small) group of trainers whose major owners include a few who will emerge on the other side of the current crisis with their sovereign wealth largely intact.</p> <p>There are some in racing who have never accepted Rust as the sport\u2019s chief executive because of his previous life in bookmaking. That does not necessarily include any of the trainers whose emails were leaked, but the BHA employees who work under Rust seem fiercely loyal to the CEO and have been working tirelessly as a team to come up with a plan to get racing again as soon as possible. That a cabal of trainers should seek to undermine him at this time above all seems perverse.</p>",

The message has been clear and consistent (even when the line from government has been anything but): racing in some form will be ready to resume as soon as the national restrictions in place to combat the coronavirus pandemic allow it to do so. When the moment arrives, it will be days, not weeks, before the first horses go to post to race behind closed doors, thanks to an immense amount of work at BHA headquarters to pick a path through the most challenging circumstances the sport has ever faced. Beckett, above all, should be aware of what has been happening, since he will be the president of the National Trainers Federation in 2021 and he has been in the loop from the start. It will not look like racing as we knew and loved it this time last year, or even as it was three months ago, and in some respects, it probably never will be. Owners, trainers and horses will be lost to the sport over the coming months and years, and possibly several racecourses too. An annual fixture list with 1,500 meetings may well be a thing of the past. But it will be a vital first step on a very long road towards a new normal, and quite what any of the trainers who emailed Phelps to demand Rust\u2019s head expected to achieve in doing so is all but impossible to divine. There was never any chance that Phelps would ask for Rust\u2019s resignation, nor any valid reason for her to do so. Quite the opposite, in fact: the BHA board confirmed that Rust has its \u201cfull and unequivocal support\u201d, while racing-minded MPs from both sides of the house have also rallied around. Everyone in racing is suffering during lockdown, including many in a much more challenging situation than trainers like Johnston and Beckett. If special pleading is a terrible look, it is worse still when it is initiated by some of the (relatively small) group of trainers whose major owners include a few who will emerge on the other side of the current crisis with their sovereign wealth largely intact. There are some in racing who have never accepted Rust as the sport\u2019s chief executive because of his previous life in bookmaking. That does not necessarily include any of the trainers whose emails were leaked, but the BHA employees who work under Rust seem fiercely loyal to the CEO and have been working tirelessly as a team to come up with a plan to get racing again as soon as possible. That a cabal of trainers should seek to undermine him at this time above all seems perverse.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s smallest businesses will be offered 100% government-backed rescue loans after sharp criticism for the slow take-up of emergency bank lending during the coronavirus crisis. In a climbdown following mounting pressure on the government to overhaul its emergency loan scheme after thousands of cash-starved firms were denied support, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said small firms would be offered new \u201cbounce back loans\u201d from next week with full government backing. Sunak had said as recently as last week he was \u201cnot persuaded\u201d by calls to provide a 100% state guarantee, despite less than half of all applicants for support securing an emergency loan. Designed to provide smoother access to cash for small companies facing difficulty accessing existing government-backed lending, Sunak said businesses would be able to apply for \u201cmicro-loans\u201d worth up to 25% of their turnover, up to \u00a350,000. The chancellor had faced rising pressure from business groups and Labour to boost the generosity of the government guarantee on its emergency loan scheme during the pandemic. However, Sunak stopped short of providing a 100% guarantee to big firms, saying taxpayers shouldn\u2019t be exposed to the risks of large company failures. Announcing the scheme in parliament, Sunak said small firms could apply for the new loans from high-street banks from as early as next Monday. \u201cI know that some small businesses are still struggling to access credit. They are in many ways the most exposed businesses to the impact of the coronavirus and find it hard to access credit in the first place. They will need extra support to get through this crisis,\u201d he said. The new loans provide high-street banks with a guarantee that the state will refund the bank for the entire value of the loan if a borrower is unable to repay, up from 80% on the government\u2019s existing coronavirus business interruption loan (CBILs). Although firms do not get government money if they cannot repay a loan, the scheme is designed to encourage banks to lend to firms when they might ordinarily turn down a loan application, because the state shoulders all of the risk. The Treasury had previously resisted calls to offer 100% guarantees, believing that banks needed to share the risk with taxpayers.

The commander slapped and beat him all over his body using a stick. Then he proceeded to take out his gun and threaten him with it, but [the teenager] managed to escape.\u201d</p> <p>UN refugee agency spokesperson Elise Villechalane said her office is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the \u201calleged case of sexual abuse against a refugee at the Gashora emergency transit mechanism. Our protection teams are present at the centre and appropriate measures have been taken to provide the alleged victim with all the necessary support, including legal and psychosocial assistance.\u201d</p> <p>Rwanda\u2019s police force has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rwandapolice/status/1251286981037961216?s=20\">accused the refugees of lying</a>, saying they were unhappy with coronavirus-related restrictions and that the boy was drunk.</p> <p>\u201cThey conspired to make up a story of physical and attempted sexual assault. Preliminary findings show that the complainant used the occasion to try to avoid punishment for violating curfew and instead raised other grievances about the food menu, medical services, and police presence at the camp,\u201d the organisation said on Twitter.</p> <p>The police said refugees had been playing music in the week commemorating the 26<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Rwandan genocide. Refugees said they were listening to a preacher read prayers in the run-up to Eritrean Easter. \u201cWhen everyone wants to pray they use the speaker and everyone prays in [their] room, because everyone was using social distancing,\u201d said one man.</p> <p>\u201cStill the commander is there, circulating all the time,\u201d another said.</p> <p>The Rwandan government did not respond to requests for comment, but confirmed an investigation is underway.</p> <p>Most of the refugees evacuated to Rwanda are survivors of sexual or physical abuse and spent months or years in Libya with smugglers known to <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/africa/inside-the-smuggler-s-warehouse-africa-s-21st-century-slave-trade-1.4224073\">torture victims who can\u2019t pay large sums of money</a>. They were then caught trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe and were locked up in detention centres associated with the UN-backed Libyan government, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/03/libya-migrants-tripoli-refugees-detention-camps\">forced labour, food deprivation and other abuses have been reported</a>.</p> <p>Evacuees arriving in Rwanda have been interviewed for the chance to be resettled.

Refugees said the organisation is not active or responsive. Alight did not reply to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment.</p> <p>The Guardian has visited Gashora twice, most recently last month, shortly before the lockdown. Refugees have repeatedly said they are happy to follow restrictions. Many have had tuberculosis or other health problems, making them vulnerable.</p> <p>On Saturday, refugees told the Guardian they were growing increasingly upset and frustrated that the alleged assault was not being taken seriously. \u201c[There is] no fucking justice in this society,\u201d said one Eritrean in his 20s. \u201cThey want to suppress our voice totally.

      "bodyText": "An allegation that a Rwandan police commander sexually assaulted a child refugee has rocked an EU-funded scheme, under which hundreds of refugees and asylum seekers have been evacuated from detention centres in Libya. The allegation was made by a 16-year-old Eritrean boy, who had returned to Gashora transit centre, south of Kigali, after a coronavirus-related curfew on 13 April. Refugees say the boy was detained there along with three others \u2013 an Eritrean and two Sudanese boys \u2013 between 6.30pm and 10.30pm, and picked out by the police commander in charge. \u201c(He) ordered him to take off his clothes,\u201d said a refugee leader who spoke to the teenager afterwards. \u201cThe kid did as he was told since he thought he was going to be searched, but then he was asked to take off his pants, which he refused. The commander slapped and beat him all over his body using a stick. Then he proceeded to take out his gun and threaten him with it, but [the teenager] managed to escape.\u201d UN refugee agency spokesperson Elise Villechalane said her office is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the \u201calleged case of sexual abuse against a refugee at the Gashora emergency transit mechanism. Our protection teams are present at the centre and appropriate measures have been taken to provide the alleged victim with all the necessary support, including legal and psychosocial assistance.\u201d Rwanda\u2019s police force has accused the refugees of lying, saying they were unhappy with coronavirus-related restrictions and that the boy was drunk. \u201cThey conspired to make up a story of physical and attempted sexual assault. Preliminary findings show that the complainant used the occasion to try to avoid punishment for violating curfew and instead raised other grievances about the food menu, medical services, and police presence at the camp,\u201d the organisation said on Twitter. The police said refugees had been playing music in the week commemorating the 26th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide. Refugees said they were listening to a preacher read prayers in the run-up to Eritrean Easter. \u201cWhen everyone wants to pray they use the speaker and everyone prays in [their] room, because everyone was using social distancing,\u201d said one man. \u201cStill the commander is there, circulating all the time,\u201d another said. The Rwandan government did not respond to requests for comment, but confirmed an investigation is underway. Most of the refugees evacuated to Rwanda are survivors of sexual or physical abuse and spent months or years in Libya with smugglers known to torture victims who can\u2019t pay large sums of money. They were then caught trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe and were locked up in detention centres associated with the UN-backed Libyan government, where forced labour, food deprivation and other abuses have been reported. Evacuees arriving in Rwanda have been interviewed for the chance to be resettled. The first groups left for Sweden and Canada earlier this year, before the pandemic forced resettlement to be put on hold. On Thursday refugees in Gashora held a protest presenting seven demands, including a proper investigation, the removal of the commander from the centre, and for a UNHCR staff member to be present at all times for their safety. They also asked for Alight (formerly the American Refugee Committee), responsible for the protection of minors, to be replaced. Refugees said the organisation is not active or responsive. Alight did not reply to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. The Guardian has visited Gashora twice, most recently last month, shortly before the lockdown. Refugees have repeatedly said they are happy to follow restrictions. Many have had tuberculosis or other health problems, making them vulnerable. On Saturday, refugees told the Guardian they were growing increasingly upset and frustrated that the alleged assault was not being taken seriously. \u201c[There is] no fucking justice in this society,\u201d said one Eritrean in his 20s. \u201cThey want to suppress our voice totally. They will fade this incident and we can\u2019t do anything about it because we are refugees.\u201d",

It puts the solution in our own hands and we have already done things differently in a range of different matters where that\u2019s been right for us,\u201d he said. Wales was the first nation to offer testing to hospital staff and postpone routine operations. The Welsh government has also put into law the two-metre social distancing rule, which is government advice in England. Drakeford said the government needed to step up its contact with the leaders of the devolved nations and has requested Michael Gove, the de facto deputy prime minister, speak with them early this week and then invite them to a Cobra meeting before the weekend. That \u201crhythm\u201d of contact is essential, he said, with his last conversation with Gove was more than 10 days ago. Johnson said on Monday that he would be reaching out to build a consensus across the country and with opposition parties as the government tries to win \u201cphase two\u201d of the crisis, although no details of what that would entail have been released. The first minister\u2019s plan for Wales to incrementally leave lockdown if there is a clear decline in coronavirus cases in the next two weeks would operate on a traffic light system. He said 50% of general acute care beds in Wales are currently unoccupied. Drakeford said the first changes he would implement in the \u201cred phase\u201d would not look very different to the lockdown and would be cautious and careful and their consequences well mapped out. Already in Wales, shops are able to open if they can use a click and collect system, and people can exercise twice a day if there is a medical reason to do so. Drakeford denied he was undermining a UK-wide response, saying his plans could and should contribute to what is being worked on in Westminster. A row over whether people can continue to stay in their second homes in Wales during the lockdown period ignited over the weekend when it was claimed wealthy second home owners were claiming business grants from their Welsh address. However Drakeford told the BBC that banning people from their second homes was a \u201cvery draconian\u201d response and he was not sure it was a legal position they could back up and might have human rights implications.",

The chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, signalled that older people who are vulnerable can expect to have to be \u201cshielded\u201d away from physical contact with their family for an extended period. \u201cIf she\u2019s in a group which is vulnerable, then the answer is it might well be prudent for her not to get into a situation where she is putting herself at risk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important that people who are vulnerable continue to be protected, even after whatever the next steps are, occur.\u201d Hancock added: \u201cWe understand the impact of not being able to hug your closest family. If affects us, too.\u201d",

There are now large parts of central London where the only people you see are homeless people, drug dealers and police. There is a growing sense of desperation. We have been ramping up numbers every week.\u201d</p> <p>The newly-homeless also include people like Robin Clark, released last week from prison, and still trying to get his life together. \u201cI can look after myself but it is hard with no showers or toilets.\u201d Lalji Kanbi has been homeless for a while, and is hoping for a hotel room. \u201cThe hotels \u2013 it\u2019s like a lottery, if you win, you win. I\u2019ve given them my details twice.\u201d</p> <p>Within the rough sleeper populations there are hierarchies of destitution. There are those like Colin Reynolds, 47, currently sleeping in a tent near the Thames because he was unable to live with his parents during lockdown, who feel they are just about coping. But there are others who look close to death.</p> <p>About 10 people are sheltering beneath a scaffolded shop front near Charing Cross station (where the underpasses that used to shelter dozens of homeless have been closed off); volunteers said most had long-term drug and alcohol problems. One man was lying in a foetal position on the cold pavement, passed out, watched over by his girlfriend. No one here was hungry, but they accepted water and biscuits for their dogs.</p> <p>Tom Copley, London\u2019s deputy mayor for housing, acknowledged that there was more work to be done, noting that a count last week had registered 498 people still sleeping rough. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the actual number will be larger, but we\u2019ve been working at this as fast as we can; we\u2019re trying to get more people in every day.\u201d But he remained optimistic that the government drive to get most rough sleepers in for the duration of the lockdown could have positive long-term consequences. \u201cWe could transform the way we deal with rough sleeping and homelessness to make sure that the issue is dealt with in the long term,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There is caution from others involved in the process. \u201cThere is no clear exit strategy from central government. Some councils are working to make sure that no one is returned to the streets, but that is very difficult to sustain unless there is a commitment to funding because the cost of that is so beyond what\u2019s available from central government,\u201d one official, working on the national drive to house rough sleepers centrally, said.</p> <p>Jason Moyer-Lee, the general secretary of the <a href=\"https://iwgb.org.uk/\">Independent Workers of Great Britain Union</a>, which represents agency staff, said more needed to be done for people made homeless after being sacked. \u201cLow-paid service sector jobs, with zero-hour contracts and agency workers, were extremely precarious before this situation, and the fact that, despite the government schemes, some people are being driven into homelessness demonstrates the inadequacy of these schemes. This needs to be sorted now.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 April 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to Amrit Maan as the manager of the Punjab restaurant in Covent Garden.

Tom Copley, London\u2019s deputy mayor for housing, acknowledged that there was more work to be done, noting that a count last week had registered 498 people still sleeping rough. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the actual number will be larger, but we\u2019ve been working at this as fast as we can; we\u2019re trying to get more people in every day.\u201d But he remained optimistic that the government drive to get most rough sleepers in for the duration of the lockdown could have positive long-term consequences. \u201cWe could transform the way we deal with rough sleeping and homelessness to make sure that the issue is dealt with in the long term,\u201d he said. There is caution from others involved in the process. \u201cThere is no clear exit strategy from central government. Some councils are working to make sure that no one is returned to the streets, but that is very difficult to sustain unless there is a commitment to funding because the cost of that is so beyond what\u2019s available from central government,\u201d one official, working on the national drive to house rough sleepers centrally, said. Jason Moyer-Lee, the general secretary of the Independent Workers of Great Britain Union, which represents agency staff, said more needed to be done for people made homeless after being sacked. \u201cLow-paid service sector jobs, with zero-hour contracts and agency workers, were extremely precarious before this situation, and the fact that, despite the government schemes, some people are being driven into homelessness demonstrates the inadequacy of these schemes. This needs to be sorted now.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 28 April 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to Amrit Maan as the manager of the Punjab restaurant in Covent Garden. He is the owner.",

Although the coronavirus lockdown has temporarily cleared the skies, it has done nothing to cool the climate, which needs deeper, longer-term measures, the scientists say. Heat records have been broken from the Antarctic to Greenland since January, which has surprised many scientists because this is not an El Ni\u00f1o year, the phenomenon usually associated with high temperatures. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration calculates there is a 75% chance that 2020 will be the hottest year since measurements began. The US agency said trends were closely tracking the current record of 2016, when temperatures soared early in the year due to an unusually intense El Ni\u00f1o and then came down. The US agency said there was a 99.9% likelihood that 2020 will be one of the top five years for temperatures on record. A separate calculation by Gavin Schmidt, the director of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, found a 60% chance this year will set a record. The Met Office is more cautious, estimating a 50% likelihood that 2020 will set a new record, though the UK institution says this year will extend the run of warm years since 2015, which is the hottest period on record. Abnormal weather is increasingly the norm as temperature records fall year after year, and month after month. This January was the hottest on record, leaving many Arctic nations without snow in their capital cities. In February, a research base in the Antarctic registered a temperature of more than 20C (68F) for the first time on the southern continent. At the other end of the world Qaanaaq, in Greenland, set an April record of 6C on Sunday. In the first quarter, the heating was most pronounced in eastern Europe and Asia, where temperatures were 3C above average. In recent weeks, large parts of the US have sweltered.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak also unveiled more measures to support businesses, with a 100% government-backed \u201cbounce back loan\u201d of up to \u00a350,000 for small businesses - following intense criticism that not enough funding was getting through to businesses. Here are some of the the other important developments today in the business world: US oil prices fell heavily again as the largest exchange-traded fund was forced to sell off futures for June delivery. One of Donald Trump\u2019s economic advisers, Kevin Hassett, has predicted that America will suffer its worst economic contraction since the Great Depression - a fall of as much as 30% (if you take the annualised rate). Unemployment in France jumped sharply last month, with the number of French citizens filing jobless claims jumping by 246,100 in March to over 3.7m people. That\u2019s an increase of over 7% - the biggest monthly gain since records began in 1996. Airbus has said that job cuts are likely as it tries to survive a brutal downturn in aviation demand. The planemaker put 3,200 employees in north Wales on furlough. Boris Johnson returned to work on Monday, signalling that he was a long way off ending lockdown in the UK.

JJ Oil futures prices have fallen steeply again on Monday, with the US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), losing 26%. One barrel of WTI for June delivery will set back traders $12.38. Brent crude, the global benchmark, has fallen by 8% to $19.66. It came after the world\u2019s largest oil-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF) said it would adjust its holdings to avoid a repeat of the market turmoil that saw US oil prices fall below zero a week ago. That happened because of concerns that storage facilities were running out, making traders desperate to get the oil off their hands. Here\u2019s what Reuters said about the ETF, the US Oil Fund: The United States Oil Fund will exit its position in the front-month June crude oil futures contract and may need to hold more cash to satisfy potential margin requirements, the largest oil-focused US exchange-traded product (ETP) said on Monday. After avoiding potentially catastrophic losses when May oil futures traded below $0 per barrel for the first time ever last Monday, USO has been scrambling to diversify its holdings into later-dated contracts, from the most heavily traded front-month contract. The 4m people furloughed in the UK account for about 12% of the number of people in employment recorded in December to February by the Office for National Statistics. And those furloughed account for about 6% of the entire UK population, which was estimated at 66.4m in 2018. If all of those people had been unemployed it would mean the fewest people in work since 2006 - a period during which the UK\u2019s labour force has increased through immigration. Of course, not every furloughed worker would have been laid off without the scheme, but it\u2019s a handy comparison to see just how far-reaching the crisis has been. And remember, there were also 1.3m people who were unemployed in the December to February figures. Unemployment was at a historic low before the crisis, but is likely to have risen significantly since then, despite the presence of the job retention scheme. Labour has backed investor calls for companies to consider cutting executive pay if they have received government support during the coronavirus crisis. The Investment Association has even suggested that companies could claw back bonuses from executives if they are forced to cancel dividend payouts. Lucy Powell MP, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for business and consumers, said: Labour believes that the government is right to support business at this critical time, to safeguard jobs, livelihoods and our economy, but companies receiving state support should show responsibility on executive renumeration packages, so that they do not undermine public support for these measures. You can read the full report here: European share indices have gained across the board. The Euro Stoxx 600 rose by 1.6%, while London\u2019s FTSE 100 rose by a provisional 1.3%, at 5,829 points. France\u2019s Cac 40 increased by 2.3%, while Germany\u2019s Dax gained 2.9%. The new 100% government-backed loan scheme has come after intensive lobbying from business groups. They appear happy. The Confederation of British Industry\u2019s director-general\u2019s reaction: Adam Marshall, the British Chamber of Commerce\u2019s director-general, said: The chancellor has demonstrated he is listening to the concerns of our business communities and taking steps to get cash to the front line where it is needed. This new route for our smallest companies to apply quickly and get a fast decision will be crucial to those who have struggled to get a CBILS loan. Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: This crucial new initiative should enable thousands of small businesses to access the working capital they need quickly, helping to protect the millions of jobs they provide in every part of the UK. This step forward marks another decisive intervention from the Treasury and the business department, building on existing support in an innovative way. Swift delivery is now key, and we also look forward to working with government in the long-term to enhance market competition, including that provided by non-bank lenders. A reminder: the 100% guarantee means that the banks who give out the loans take none of the financial risk. That should mean that (after carrying out basic due diligence checks) they should be able to give out loans to small businesses much faster. Sunak\u2019s Twitter account has more details on his announcements on what he is calling \u201cbounce back loans\u201d for small businesses. That adds to the pre-existing job retention scheme, business interruption loan scheme, Covid-19 corporate finance facility and various other bits and bobs like cash grants and bans on evictions. Labour\u2019s new shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds has responded to Sunak in parliament, calling for changes to get money to businesses faster and allowing for part-time work. At the moment all furloughed workers must stop completely to qualify, which could discourage companies from continuing work. Speaking in the almost empty parliament that has characterised lockdown politics, she said: To ensure as many people as possible have a job to go back to, we need a flexible furlough scheme. The chancellor told me previously it can\u2019t currently be made more flexible - but other countries have done this. Will he work to amend the furlough scheme, to allow workers to come back on a part-time basis? And on the loan schemes, she said: Other countries are guaranteeing 100% of their SME loans and have stripped off normal commercial loan requirements. And while it\u2019s a relief to hear from the chancellor that there will now be a full guarantee for loans of up to \u00a325,000, we need to know that normal commercial loan requirements will not continue to clog up the system. So will he also be changing the rules for the scheme, so we can get money to those SMEs that really need it? Sunak said he remains unconvinced of backing all loans 100%. He does not think it is appropriate to back all loans to 100%. The loan scheme has faced criticism for not getting money to enough businesses quickly enough, with concerns that banks are having to consider their own financial risk on the loans, which are currently only 80% guaranteed. Chancellor Rishi Sunank has unveiled a new micro loan scheme. Small companies will be able to borrow up to \u00a350,000 each, up to 25% of their turnover. The loans will be available from 9am next Monday, he said. There will be no tests against businesses\u2019 future viability, no complex eligibility criteria, just a simple form, he said. For most firms loans should arrive within 24 hours of approval. The government will back 100% of the loans. More than 20,000 coronavirus business interruption loans have now been approved, Sunak said. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has revealed that more than 4m workers in the UK have been furloughed. You can follow his statement to parliament live at the below link. There was a time when every raised eyebrow during the Brexit negotiations could move the pound. Sars-Cov-2 has intervened, but the talks are still going on (via video), and the government is sticking doggedly to its plans to end the transition period at the end of 2020. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has popped up saying that the odds of a deal are better than two to one. It is entirely possible that they will be concluded in time, he said. The coronavirus crisis should concentrate the minds of negotiators, he added. (There are widespread concerns that what was already looking like a tight timetable might become impossible with so much government resource focused elsewhere.) For the record, sterling is pretty much unmoved, up by 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1448, while against the US dollar it\u2019s up by 0.15% to $1.0835. And it\u2019s Jasper Jolly taking over from Graeme Wearden through the European stock market close. The S&amp;P 500 index has also opened higher, gaining 17 points to 2,853 (up 0.6%). As in Europe and Asia, shares are benefiting from hopes that some Covid-19 lockdowns will be eased in the coming weeks (despite the risk of a second spike in infections if policians move too early) Wall Street has opened higher, despite the prospect of a sickening slump in growth this quarter. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 109 points, or 0.46%, to 23,884 as a new week\u2019s trading begins. London\u2019s market is slightly off the boil, with the FTSE 100 now up 55 points or 1% at 5809. Alexandra Scaggs of Barrons has spotted that General Motors\u2019 banks pushed it to suspend its dividend (as flagged earlier). Here\u2019s another clip from Kevin Hassett\u2019s interview, in which he argues that growth will pick up in the third quarter of 2020. More encouragingly, Kevin Hassett also predicted that growth will pick up in the third quarter of this year (after plunging in the current quarter). He also told CNBC that US businesses are adapting to the crisis, and the challenge of physical distancing. \u201cAt the beginning of this, there was rapid, rapid spread sadly in the places where there are a lot of essential workers. But the variance has really, really declined over time suggesting people have learned ... about safe practices,\u201d Blimey. One of Donald Trump\u2019s economic advisers has predicted that America will suffer its worst economic contraction since the Great Depression. Kevin Hassett told CNBC that second-quarter GDP \u201cis going to be the biggest negative number that we\u2019ve seen since the Great Depression.\u201d He explained: You\u2019re looking at something like minus 20%, minus 30% in the second quarter. And the question then is what happens next, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on at the White House. Hassett also predicted that GDP growth in January-March will probably be negative too (we get that data on Wednesday). He also warned that the US unemployment rate to hit 16 or 17% for April (very plausible, as over 26 million jobless claims have been filed in the last 5 weeks) Last year Hassett stepped down as chair of the council of economic advisers, but has now returned to help the White House deal with the current emergency. Wall Street is expected to open higher in 90 minutes, following today\u2019s gains in Europe and Asia. Newsflash: US auto giant General Motors has suspended its dividend, and its share repurchasing programme, as part of a drive to \u201cfortify its balance sheet\u201d. Wall Street\u2019s fear index has dropped to its lowest level since early March. The VIX index, which measures volatility in the markets, has fallen below 36 points for the time in over seven weeks. Falling volatility suggests investors are less scared about the coronavirus crisis, even though we\u2019ve entered a desperately deep recession. Joshua Mahony of IG says traders are expecting to learn more about the economic and financial costs of the pandemic this week, as more firms report financial results. \u201cExpectations of major volatility giving way to more calm and serene trading. This week marks the beginning of perhaps the most important four days in Q1 earnings season, with over a quarter of the S&amp;P 500 reporting. With big hitters across tech, travel, energy, and manufacturing all due to shed light on their coronavirus experiences, we will finally have a much better idea of exactly how this crisis has affected USA Inc. Markets have been very focused on future prosperity over current suffering, and thus it is likely that market sentiment will be guided heavily by corporate outlooks rather than just the short-term impact of the temporary lockdown measures. French manufacturer Airbus isn\u2019t sharing today\u2019s optimism. The aerospace giant has warned its 135,000 employees that it may not survive the coronavirus lockdown unless it takes immediate action . CEO Guillaume Faury told staff in a letter on Friday that the plane maker was \u201cbleeding cash at an unprecedented speed\u201d, due to the slump in demand for new planes following the Covid-19 pandemic. Faury warned that the firm \u201cmay now need to plan for more far-reaching measures\u201d - which could mean job cuts, adding. \u201cThe survival of Airbus is in question if we don\u2019t act now.\u201d Shares in Airbus are down 3% on the Paris stockmarket, making it the biggest faller on the CAC 40. After a risk-on morning, Europe\u2019s stock markets are all holding their gains. Investors are shrugging off the record surge in French unemployment, and Boris Johnson\u2019s caution about lifting the UK\u2019s lockdown. Stoxx 600: up 1.6% at 334 points FTSE 100: up 1.4% at 5,833 German DAX: up 2.4% at 10,582 points French CAC: up 1.8% at Trevor Greetham, Head of Multi Asset at Royal London Asset Management, says the markets are generally calmer - thanks to the recent emergency stimulus measures from governments and central banks. \u201cMarkets usually stop panicking when policy makers start to. Stocks recovered about half of their losses after massive fiscal and monetary easing was announced. With sentiment back to neutral, the outlook from here depends on the uncertain path back to normality. \u201cIn our multi asset funds, we are taking a flexible approach. We currently have a small overweight in equities and a strong preference for high yield bonds, which benefit from effective policy maker support, over commodities and property, which don\u2019t. We are overweight US equities versus the UK and technology versus financials at the sector level.\u201d Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley has warned that Europe\u2019s recession will be even deeper than first feared. Morgan Stanley now expects eurozone GDP to shrink by 11% in 2020 -- a desperate plunge -- not the 5% previously forecast. It now expects Covid-19 lockdowns to last longer than previously thought, and to be relaxed more slowly (with large scale events banned for some time, and investment and consumption staying weak). Greece, which has been praised for implementing an early lockdown, is now getting ready to relax it. Bloomberg explains: The relaxation of restrictions in Greece designed to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus will be gradual and targeted while the stages of lifting the measures will be spaced apart in order to evaluate their effectiveness, Government Spokesman Stelios Petsas said. The first phase starting on May 4 will see the reopening of shops and hairdressers, churches will also open their door for personal worship while some schools will start operating in a second phase and travel between regions will be permitted on a gradual basis, Petsas said in Athens. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis will present Greece\u2019s overall plan for a transition out of a total lockdown situation on Tuesday while ministers will provide specific details afterward, he said. Just in: Unemployment in France jumped sharply last month, as the Covid-19 lockdown hit its economy. The number of French citizens filing jobless claims jumped by 246,100 in March, according to the Labour Ministry, to over 3.7 million people. That\u2019s an increase of over 7% -the biggest monthly gain since record began in 1996. Global markets are also being cheered by another central bank stimulus package. Earlier today the Bank of Japan tripled the amount of corporate debt it would buy, and pledge to buy unlimited amount of government bonds to help Japan\u2019s economy. The BoJ also slashed its growth forecasts, and admitted that inflation would (once again) miss its targets. BoJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda\u2019s latest move reassured investors that central bankers will keep printing money to ward off a Covid-19 depression (which should keep asset prices buoyant). Global oil traders are braced for another gloomy week after crude prices slumped this morning despite plans for major oil production cuts from Friday. The market jitters are most acute in the US where oil storage tanks are filled to the brim. The price of West Texas Intermediate, the US crude benchmark, fell by almost $2.50 to $14.69 a barrel while the price of Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell by more than a $1 to $20.36 a barrel in early trade. Analysts at Rystad predict that oil prices will continue to fall until a significant amount of output is \u2018shut-in\u2019, by producers closing their wells. The plan to rein in oil production from the world\u2019s largest oil producers, spear-headed by Saudi Arabia, is due to come in to force in May but \u201care not enough to alter the current situation\u201d. Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at Rystad, warns: \u201cThe storage clock is ticking for producers and we are approaching the final countdown if no further action is taken.\u201d Barclays has put out some data showing that 13% of consumer scams targeting its customers have been related to coronavirus. The bank says consumers are falling victim to order scams for products like hand sanitiser and face masks, that on average leads to losses of around \u00a3209. This is according to data which the bank collected between 9-14 April. Nearly 43% of all scams have taken place on social media, with a fake company asking for an upfront deposit before asking for full payment, which makes it seem like a lower risk. In many cases, after the customer sends the payment, customers never receive the goods and never hear back from the sellers again. Barclays is warning consumers to be wary of prices that look too good to be true, or companies that claim to have products in stock when everyone else seems to be sold out. It also says consumers should check whether a website is a genuine address by looking at the spelling in their website\u2019s URL. Ross Martin, Head of Digital Safety at Barclays said: Many of us are at home spending more time online using social media and browsing the internet. There is a risk people will be lured into purchasing items with a big discount or that are unavailable elsewhere. Don\u2019t become a victim of these scams and always check who you\u2019re purchasing from and do your research before making a payment. Bangladesh\u2019s textile industry is returning to work today, in another sign that some lockdown measures are easing. Reuters has the details: More than 500 garment factories in Bangladesh that supply to global brands reopened on Monday after a month-long shutdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus, while in India calls grew for an easing of its lockdown which has caused deep economic pain. Clothing manufacturers in Bangladesh\u2019s capital Dhaka and the port city of Chittagong have been permitted to resume work. Some of the world\u2019s biggest clothing firms including Gap, Zara-owner Inditex, and H&amp;M source their supplies from Bangladesh. \u201cWe are making sure the workers wear masks, wash hands at the entrance, undergo temperature checks, and maintain physical distancing,\u201d said Mohammad Hatem, vice president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association. Industry groups for the sector, which boasts some 4,000 factories employing 4.1 million workers, had warned the shutdown could cause the country to lose $6 billion in export revenue this financial year. Boris Johnson\u2019s call for patience hasn\u2019t caused any ructions in the City. The FTSE 100 is still solidly higher, up 1.5% or 85 points at 5837. The smaller FTSE 250, which contains more UK-focused firms, is up 1.8% today. Bookmaker William Hill, which has been hit by sporting cancellations, are up 10%. Newsflash: Boris Johnson has urged Britain to contain its impatience about ending the lockdown, until the risk of a second peak in Covid-19 infections has receded. Speaking outside Downing Street as he returns to work following his own Covid-19 infection, the prime minister says he understands concerns about the lockdown among shopkeepers, entrepreneurs, the hospitality sector, and beyond. Johnson says there is no economy without wealth creators, no cash to pay for public services, no way to fund NHS. He shares the urgency to reopen the economy again. But, the government must also recognise the risk of a second spike in the coronavirus infection, Johnson continues. If Britain allows the reproduction rate to rise over 1, then it risks \u201ca new wave of death and disease, but also an economic disaster\u201d. A second spike would force the government to \u201cslam on the brakes\u201d again on the economy again, and reimpose restrictions again - causing \u201cmore and lasting damage\u201d. The PM says: So, I know it is tough, and I want to get this economy moving as fast as I can, but I refuse to throw away all the effort and the sacrifice of the UK people and risk a second major outbreak and huge loss of life and the overwhelming of the NHS. And I ask you to contain your impatience, because I believe we are coming now to the end of the first phase of this conflict. Johnson then explains that the government will \u201crefine\u201d the current restrictions and start to fire up the engines of the economy, once this first phase is over. Further details will be outlined \u201cin the coming days\u201d, but Johnson cautions that the government cannot yet say when these changes will be made. Our main UK coronavirus liveblog has full details: After an hour\u2019s trading, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is up a healthy 98 points or 1.7% at 5850. That\u2019s nearly its highest level in six weeks, a reminder that stocks have recovered from some of March\u2019s wild sell-off. At its worst moment, the index dropped below 5,000 points -- having been worth over 7,400 before the Covid-19 panic began. Italy\u2019s stock market is having a particularly good morning, with the FTSE MIB index jumping 2.3% in early trading. Traders are relieved that credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s agency didn\u2019t downgrade Italy\u2019s government debt on Friday night. That reprieve lowers the risk that Italy is plunged into \u2018junk\u2019 territory soon. Italian bonds are ralliyng this morning, closing the gap with German debt (a reassuring sign). Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains: Italian and German yield spreads came in after S&amp;P didn\u2019t downgrade Italian debt. This is good news for the ECB, which may well increase its pandemic asset purchase programme by \u20ac500bn this week. European stock markets are all higher in early trading, lifting the Stoxx 600 index up by 1.7%. Adam Cole of RBC Capital Markets says \u201cmarkets are risk on....as countries, including Australia, continue to slowly wind down COVID-19 constraints on economic activity.\u201d Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has jumped by 90 points at the start of trading, up 1.55% to 5841 points. Nearly every stock is up. Travel companies are among the risers, with cruise operator Carnival gaining 4%, Intercontinental Hotels up 4.2% and IAG (which owns British Airways) gaining 3.8%. From Melbourne, IG analyst Kyle Rodda says that \u201cpositivity\u201d about the prospect of the easing of social distancing measures in Australia lifted its stock market today (up 1.5%). The Australian economy and the ASX200 is a long way from being anywhere what might be considered \u201cout of the woods\u201d. However, to slightly mix metaphors, the light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little brighter for Australia. Only 10 new COVID-19 cases across the country have so far been confirmed today, as the number of active cases falls to 1,052. It\u2019s prompted further talk from State and Federal leaders that some social distancing measures may be eased in coming weeks, as policymakers experiment with re-opening parts of the domestic economy. Though it\u2019s been stated a full re-opening of business will still be a long way off, a small lift of the restrictions on public movement may well be less than a month away for parts of the country. There\u2019s a big difference between easing a lockdown and ending it. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, says her country must remain vigilant - after moving swiftly to impose a tough lockdown that appears to have prevented a major Covid-19 outbreak. Ardern is moving New Zealand\u2019s lockdown from Level 4 to 3 -- which will allow restaurants and cafes to offer takeaway food. Some children will be allowed to attend school, and employees can return to work if there are appropriate health and safety and physical distancing measures. But, people should still avoid mingling beyond a small social \u2018bubble\u2019, and work from home still if they can. Ardern says: \u201cWe are opening up the economy, but we\u2019re not opening up people\u2019s social lives.\u201d UK businesses are pushing the government hard for information on when the lockdown here might start to ease. My colleague Zoe Wood explains: The Institute of Directors said its 28,000 members were \u201cclamouring\u201d for information so they could start drawing up return-to-work plans. Jon Geldart, its director general, said it was in everyone\u2019s interests to kickstart the economy again once it is safe to do so. \u201cDirectors from all parts of the UK need to make plans for riding out this tempest, but they can\u2019t get very far if they have no idea what will be happening in a few weeks\u2019 time,\u201d Geldart said. \u201cBusiness leaders know [the end of restrictions] will not happen all in one go, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s even more important to tell them what they need to prepare for.\u201d Here\u2019s a handy map showing which countries have already started to relax some of their coronavirus restrictions, and which are preparing to do so: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets are starting the new week on the front foot, as some countries prepare to lift some of the lockdown measures imposed in recent weeks. Equities have rallied across Asia-Pacific bourses already, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei gaining 2.8% and China\u2019s CSI 300 up 1%. South Korea\u2019s KOSPI 200 has gained 1.8%, and Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 is 1.5% higher. We\u2019re expecting a solid start to trading in Europe too. The FTSE 100 is being called up 75 points, or 1.5%, at 5826 points. Traders are (relatively) upbeat as France, Italy, Spain, Australia and New Zealand prepare to loosen some of their coronavirus restrictions. Italy is being watched particularly closely, as the first European country to impose lockdown measures seven weeks ago prepares to lift them again. Last night, prime minister Giuseppe Conte said the measures would be relaxed from 4 May. Italian parks, factories and building sites will reopen, and people will be allowed to visit their relatives in small numbers. Schools, though, won\u2019t restart until September. Spain is also trying to move towards \u201ca new normality\u201d. Yesterday, children under 14 were allowed out to exercise for the first time since mid-March. France is also looking to ease some lockdown restrictions soon. Yesterday, French PM Edouard Philippe said he would present the government\u2019s exit strategy on Tuesday. It will focus on six themes: \u201chealth (including masks, testing and isolation), school, work, shops, transport and gatherings\u201d. In Downing Street, Boris Johnson has returned to work, and must decide whether to relax some of the UK\u2019s restrictions. The PM must balance pressure to help the economy against concerns that a early easing will create a second coronavirus spike. Many MPs, and some Conservative Party donors, have been pushing for a partial end to the lockdown, as my colleague Heather Stewart explains: The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will underline the costs of shuttering the economy to tackle the crisis on Monday, as he makes a statement to the House of Commons on the Treasury\u2019s response to the crisis. He will point to forecasts by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility that suggested a three-month lockdown could lead to a catastrophic 35% decline in GDP in the second quarter of the year. Sunak is among those cabinet ministers who have been keen to see some businesses reopen, and officials have been working on proposals for deciding which should come first \u2013 based on how easy it would be for them to work safely, and how critical they are to the economy. Over the weekend, the UK\u2019s total hospital deaths from the virus broke through 20,000, a grim milestone in a pandemic that has spread tragedy and misery. The true death toll is feared to be much higher, once care home deaths are included. But Britain\u2019s daily death total did drop to a four-week low yesterday, at 413 - mirroring similar falls in other countries. Jeffrey Halley of trading firm OANDA says investors are hopeful that the worst of the virus could be behind us. Peak virus seemed to be the overriding theme of the week, with the rate of new cases and deaths falling in Europe and the United States, the COVID-19 epicentres. Plans appear to be accelerating also for partial reopening\u2019s around the world. New Zealand returns to work tomorrow, Australia plans a partial effort this week, New York has announced protocols for a mid-May reopening with some US states already tentatively opening. European hotspots such as Italy, Spain, Germany and the UK are also planning partial reopenings or will be doing so this week. There\u2019s no major economic data due today. It\u2019s going to be a busy week, though, with US and eurozone growth figures coming up. There\u2019s also lots of earnings results to watch, with Alphabet/Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple and Amazon all reporting this week.",

So rather than hold a press conference where he might be expected to face some tricky questions, Boris Johnson chose to mark his return with a quick statement outside a Downing Street decorated with children\u2019s tributes to the NHS shortly after 9am in the morning.</p> <p>Given that it\u2019s only two weeks since he came out of intensive care, this was unsurprisingly very much a Boris-lite appearance. Literally so, for he seemed to have lost weight with his suit now being several sizes too large, his face washed out and tired and his hair in urgent need of a trim.

      "bodyText": "Even the Messiah needs to ease himself back to work gently. So rather than hold a press conference where he might be expected to face some tricky questions, Boris Johnson chose to mark his return with a quick statement outside a Downing Street decorated with children\u2019s tributes to the NHS shortly after 9am in the morning. Given that it\u2019s only two weeks since he came out of intensive care, this was unsurprisingly very much a Boris-lite appearance. Literally so, for he seemed to have lost weight with his suit now being several sizes too large, his face washed out and tired and his hair in urgent need of a trim. Nor were there any of the familiar upbeat enthusiasm and ebullience to his speech.

He has, after all, emerged from his own very intimate bout with the virus.

As linguists such as George Lakoff have pointed out, the metaphors we choose both reflect our prejudices and influence our approach to the world.

It was \u201can unexpected and invisible mugger\u201d, he told the nation, giving a colourful twist to the martial metaphors he and his cabinet have tended to use when talking about the disease (in March, he described the crisis as a \u201cfight \u2026 in which every one of us is directly enlisted\u201d). Perhaps it\u2019s appropriate that the prime minister chose to personify Covid-19 more directly than in the past. He has, after all, emerged from his own very intimate bout with the virus. And it\u2019s not surprising that the pandemic has proved fertile ground for linguistic invention either: things aren\u2019t readily accessible to the five senses \u2013 whether abstract concepts like Brexit, or invisible pathogens \u2013 tend to get \u201ctranslated\u201d, via metaphor, into easily graspable images. That process, though, is not a neutral one. As linguists such as George Lakoff have pointed out, the metaphors we choose both reflect our prejudices and influence our approach to the world. With Brexit, no deal was either a \u201ccliff edge\u201d or a \u201cclean break\u201d, depending on where your sympathies lay. The \u201cphysical assailant\u201d metaphor is one way to look at the challenge of coronavirus, but it is not the only one. Some have taken to social media to complain that the idea of the \u201csurprise attack\u201d disguises the fact that the government had many weeks to prepare a better response to the pandemic than the one it has executed. People with cancer have long lamented the drawbacks of framing the disease process as a \u201cbattle\u201d. And the prime minister\u2019s idea that we \u201cwrestle [coronavirus] to the floor\u201d would seem at odds with the patient, precise work that will have to be done, over many months, to keep it at bay.

The estimate, contained in a report by Per Capita released on Tuesday, has prompted the progressive think tank to call for a review of the current system, which is expected to come under unprecedented strain amid soaring unemployment. Under the Jobactive system, about 40 privately run employment agencies and not-for-profits receive fees for each jobseeker placed on their books, and additional incentive payments when people are placed into a job. Based on a projection of an extra 700,000 unemployed people being assigned to providers during the pandemic, Per Capita found the \u201cemployment services sector can expect to receive an estimated injection of service fees in the amount of approximately $210m\u201d. But the total haul is likely to be much higher, with authors Simone Casey and Abigail Lewis noting that providers also receive up to $1,550 for each person they place into work in what will be a further \u201cproblematic drain on expenditure\u201d. Payments for job placements are set on a scale based on the jobseeker\u2019s level of disadvantage, but the authors argue providers would reap significant sums from many newly unemployed people who would would require only \u201cnegligible support\u201d.

Facing calls to overhaul the system from business and welfare groups, the government opted to extend the existing Jobactive contracts until 2022, while it piloted a new, streamlined program that it says will give providers more time to focus on disadvantaged jobseekers. But Per Capita, which criticised Jobactive in a report released in 2018, said the new model was \u201cconceived in economic conditions that are vastly different from those that will follow the Covid-19 economic shock\u201d. It said the new model, as well as Jobactive, were \u201chamstrung by a dependency on job outcome payments\u201d which led to under-investment on more needy jobseekers. The current Jobactive system costs about $1.3bn a year in what has been described as the second largest area of government procurement, after defence. But employment service providers have argued Australia spends about 0.23% of GDP on employment services, well below the OECD average of 0.53%. An investigation into the Jobactive system by the Guardian last year revealed that less than 20% of the nearly 2 million Jobactive participants in the life of the program had been placed into a job for more than six months. Meanwhile, 120,000 jobseekers had three or more \u201cplacements\u201d recorded, which triggers a payment to an employment service agency each time, in what critics have labelled a punitive system. The result has been that while the job-ready are placed into work, and often churned through several positions, the average period a person can expect to spend on the dole has ballooned because more disadvantaged jobseekers remain locked out of the labour market. Last week, the government said 587,686 people had been granted the jobseeker payment following an unprecedented deluge of claims and most of those people could be expected to be placed into the Jobactive program. It already boasted 750,000 participants at 31 March, according to government figures. A damning Senate inquiry report released last year noted the average jobseeker caseload per consultant was 148.

Among the most hyped drugs are hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial which is also used to treat people with painful autoimmune conditions, and lopinavir and ritonavir, both antiretroviral drugs. Antibiotics are also being studied.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v2\">a study of Covid-19 hospital patients given hydroxychloroquine</a> in the US found no benefit from the drug, either alone or given in combination with an antibiotic. In fact, the patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone had a higher mortality rate. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://marlin-prod.literatumonline.com/pb-assets/products/coronavirus/MEDJ1.pdf\">researchers in China found that neither lopinavir or ritonavir showed any benefit</a> in patients admitted to hospital with mild-to-moderate cases of the disease.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia's coronavirus email signup button\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018A lot still to learn\u2019</h2> <p>The findings come as all patients with Covid-19 being admitted to intensive care at the Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s hospital in Queensland are being given hydroxychloroquine as part of their treatment. Neither the Queensland department of health nor the hospital responded to multiple requests for comment from Guardian Australia as to whether the trial would be reassessed in light of evidence from overseas.</p> <p>A separate study, known as Ascot (AustralaSian COVID-19 Trial), is under way in more than 70 Australian hospitals and will test whether lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination, prevents deterioration of Covid-19 patients. A leader of the Ascot study, Prof David Paterson, said despite the disappointing findings from the US, the Australian study would go ahead. The US study was retrospective and conducted in a relatively small group of patients, whereas the Ascot study is being conducted as a randomised control trial, the strongest type of study and the gold standard for evidence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/controversial-malaria-drug-hydroxychloroquine-to-be-given-to-coronavirus-patients-in-australia\">Controversial drug hydroxychloroquine to be given to coronavirus patients in Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe conclusions of the authors of the US study were that randomised trials are needed,\u201d Paterson said. \u201cThis is exactly what we are undertaking with Ascot. Many commentators have observed that the US study was observational in design, and that it may have been that people who were not very sick were given no treatment and therefore had a greater chance of surviving, while those who were very sick and were at a greater intrinsic chance of dying were given hydroxychloroquine or other treatments in desperation.</p> <p>\u201cThere is clearly a lot still to learn about treatments for Covid-19.

      "bodyText": "The results of early studies from the US and China, which show disappointing results in the use of an antimalarial drug and an anti-retroviral drug in treating Covid-19, will not impact trials of the drug under way in Australia, researchers say. To date more than 300 clinical trials in humans are under way around the world to investigate treatments for the virus, with several of these occurring in Australia. Among the most hyped drugs are hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial which is also used to treat people with painful autoimmune conditions, and lopinavir and ritonavir, both antiretroviral drugs. Antibiotics are also being studied. But a study of Covid-19 hospital patients given hydroxychloroquine in the US found no benefit from the drug, either alone or given in combination with an antibiotic. In fact, the patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone had a higher mortality rate. Meanwhile, researchers in China found that neither lopinavir or ritonavir showed any benefit in patients admitted to hospital with mild-to-moderate cases of the disease. \u2018A lot still to learn\u2019 The findings come as all patients with Covid-19 being admitted to intensive care at the Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s hospital in Queensland are being given hydroxychloroquine as part of their treatment. Neither the Queensland department of health nor the hospital responded to multiple requests for comment from Guardian Australia as to whether the trial would be reassessed in light of evidence from overseas. A separate study, known as Ascot (AustralaSian COVID-19 Trial), is under way in more than 70 Australian hospitals and will test whether lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination, prevents deterioration of Covid-19 patients. A leader of the Ascot study, Prof David Paterson, said despite the disappointing findings from the US, the Australian study would go ahead. The US study was retrospective and conducted in a relatively small group of patients, whereas the Ascot study is being conducted as a randomised control trial, the strongest type of study and the gold standard for evidence. \u201cThe conclusions of the authors of the US study were that randomised trials are needed,\u201d Paterson said. \u201cThis is exactly what we are undertaking with Ascot. Many commentators have observed that the US study was observational in design, and that it may have been that people who were not very sick were given no treatment and therefore had a greater chance of surviving, while those who were very sick and were at a greater intrinsic chance of dying were given hydroxychloroquine or other treatments in desperation. \u201cThere is clearly a lot still to learn about treatments for Covid-19. Large randomised clinical trials like Ascot are the only way to do this.\u201d A federal Department of Health spokesman said the government was closely monitoring the results of studies from around the world investigating treatment or preventions for Covid-19. \u201cThe clinical evidence base is currently limited and results from large, prospective and controlled studies are required before the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine is better understood,\u201d he said. \u201cClinical trials in Australia are conducted by a sponsor who has overall responsibility for the trial, with oversight by a human research ethics committee. Within the bounds of a clinical trial, safety is carefully monitored and the sponsor and committee can halt a trial at any time should serious safety issues emerge.\u201d \u2018Panic causing bad decisions\u2019 However, despite advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee that experimental use of medications is not recommended for Covid-19, and should only be prescribed as part of a clinical trial, some hospitals around Australia are giving the drugs to critically unwell patients outside of trials. This differs from advice from the drugs regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, that the drugs can be given as part of clinical trials or to severely unwell Covid-19 patients. Infectious diseases physician and former adviser to the World Health Organization, Prof Peter Collignon, said this was concerning. \u201cI think this is an indication of panic causing bad decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cEven in the face of evidence showing it\u2019s doing no good we continue to use these drugs. Of course, doctors are able to use drugs off-label.

Dr Gaetan Burgio, an Australian National University infectious disease specialist , said given the lack of proven efficacy and the potential serious toxicity on seriously unwell patients, he also believes hydroxychloroquine should not be administered to patients outside of clinical trials. However, he said there was no reason to stop Australian clinical trials as a result of the findings from overseas so far. \u201cIn my view, as the patients are a well controlled clinical setting and thoroughly monitored, there is no reason to halt them.\u201d Maintaining scientific standards Australian states and territories have differed in their approach to off-label use of drugs to treat Covid-19.

      "bodyText": "Grahame Best keeps a ghost light burning 24/7 in his Wollongong home. It\u2019s a gesture of solidarity and sympathy with the now darkened auditoriums that are doing likewise, observing the old custom that requires a lamp to be left lit on the stage when a theatre is empty. Unable to see any live theatre, Best, 73, feels the loss more keenly than most. He is one of the moveable fixtures of Sydney\u2019s theatre scene. Many stage actors and audience members know his face even if they don\u2019t know him by name because he\u2019s \u201cstanding ovation man\u201d \u2013 the patron who unfailingly gets to his feet to applaud every show he sees. \u201cThe actor Toby Schmitz first called me that,\u201d Best says. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve done for years. I do it for the performers and for everyone involved \u2013 the director, the musicians, the backstage crew, even the admin staff \u2026 all the people who bust a gut to get a show on.\u201d Best also encourages other patrons to get to their feet \u2013 often in vain. \u201cI even get abused by some of them,\u201d he confides to Guardian Australia. \u201cI\u2019ve been told I\u2019m an embarrassment to theatre but it doesn\u2019t stop me. The actors love it.\u201d He normally sees three to four shows a week, but \u2013 like everyone during the coronavirus crisis \u2013 has been stuck indoors for a month, and the theatres are all closed. \u201cMy mind has gone black,\u201d he says. \u201cJust like the theatres \u2026 Theatre used to keep my mind so activated. I used to think about it all the time and what I\u2019d just witnessed. [My wife] Doris tells me she\u2019s noticed a big change. I\u2019m bored. I\u2019m lonely. I miss it so much. Theatre is a tonic for my brain!\u201d Last year, Best attended 130 shows. The year before, 128. This year, he has only seen 14 as the theatregoing came to an abrupt halt on 17 March when the government banned gatherings over 100 people (\u201cDoomsday,\u201d Best says). This year would have marked his 60th year as one of Australia\u2019s most diligent theatre patrons. Until the arrival of Covid-19, nothing kept him from seeing a show: not distance (he catches the train to Sydney from Wollongong and back); not pain (he has endured a serious back condition for 40 years); and not the strokes that left him unable to speak. He sees all the big productions (he subscribes to several theatre company seasons) but he prefers to haunt the independent theatres. \u201cI\u2019d say about 85% of the shows I see are the small ones,\u201d he says. He has already paid for many of his tickets for 2020 but is not taking any refunds. Instead he has made donations or accepted a credit to see a show when the theatres reopen. \u201cBefore every show, I still feel the adrenaline pumping through my veins. I get excited. It\u2019s something real and alive, you know? I always sit in the front row so I can feel like I\u2019m in the scene with the actors,\u201d Best says. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a boring show and I\u2019ve never walked out on a play. People say to me, what\u2019s your favourite play? I can never answer because it\u2019s all of them.\u201d After every production, a musical, play or cabaret, Best writes his impressions and thoughts in a tiny notebook. His reports fill dozens of notebooks dating back to 1960. He names every actor and member of the crew. Every detail from the lighting to the costumes is recorded. For Best, attending theatre is more than a pleasurable pastime. It\u2019s essential to his wellbeing and sense of self. \u201cI like to hang around after a show and talk to the actors and thank them but I never force myself on anyone,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes I wait an hour or more but sometimes I have to catch the last train back to Wollongong.\u201d After the strokes that left him partially incapacitated and unable to speak, he credits going to the theatre for his recovery. \u201cWhen I was let out of hospital, I went straight to the theatre. I just sat there trying to mouth the words the actors were saying and over time \u2026 I got my voice and speech back and eventually I walked again, too. The brain has mysterious ways. It finds new avenues.\u201d Best is one of thousands across the country for whom the ritual of weekly theatregoing is suspended indefinitely. \u201cNow all I do is go for an early morning walk when no one is around, I go to the supermarket or the chemist, I wash my hands and I don\u2019t touch my face,\u201d he says with a chuckle. While there is already talk of a limited relaxation of the rules controlling social gathering, it seems likely that live performance will be among the very last parts of the economy to return to normal. TV shows and the new plethora of streamed theatre is no substitute, says Best. \u201cTheatre is people right there, telling you their stories. Streaming is just TV. The atmosphere isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s boring.\u201d He has just joined Facebook so he can stay in touch with the actors. Doris, whom he met when they both worked at Reader\u2019s Digest, says he is addicted. \u201cI have 160 friends now!\u201d he says. \u201cAll of them actors.\u201d",

The health secretary, Matt Hancock, made his commitment on 2 April to reach the target by the end of the month and he has said he is still on target to hit the figure despite increasing uncertainty.

Updated figures on the number of deaths in care homes from earlier in the month will be released on Tuesday. Hancock told Monday\u2019s daily press conference that the UK\u2019s capacity for testing was now higher than South Korea, which used a test and trace strategy to flatten the curve and did not opt for a lockdown. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that we\u2019ve already gone past the number of tests per day that they carry out in South Korea.

However, he confirmed the country was moving \u201cthrough the peak\u201d of the virus\u2019s spread.

The children affected appear to have been struck by a form of toxic shock syndrome. All have been left so seriously unwell that they have had to be treated in intensive care. At least one has received extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment, which is used when someone\u2019s life is at risk because they can no longer breathe for themselves. NHS bosses are so concerned that they have written to doctors alerting them to the emergence of these cases and asked them to urgently refer any children with similar symptoms to hospital. Most of the children affected have Kawasaki disease, a rare vascular condition that is the main cause of acquired heart disease in under-18s in the UK. There are estimated to be 4.5 cases for every 100,000 children under the age of 18 in the UK. \u201cThese cases happen when someone with Kawasaki disease gets Covid-19 and that produces complications,\u201d said one NHS source.

      "body": "<p>The UK\u2019s coronavirus frontline has switched from hospitals to care homes, according to sector leaders who have dismissed Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that the virus has been \u201cwrestled to the floor\u201d as premature.</p> \n<p>Deaths in some of the largest care home networks have surged by more than 70% in the last week or two, operators said on Monday. Official figures due on Tuesday are expected to show a significant increase.</p> \n<p>In the week ending 19 April, 651 of the 682 coronavirus outbreaks reported across the whole of England were in care homes, Public Health England (PHE) reported.</p> \n<p>Leaders in the sector have demanded greater medical help and said the peak of social care fatalities is yet to come.</p> \n<p>Care UK reported 244 Covid-19 deaths in its facilities, a 74% rise in six days, including 18 deaths in a single home in north London where a care worker also died.</p> \n<p>Four Seasons Health Care reported a 79% increase in deaths in two weeks, bringing its death toll to 286, while the UK\u2019s largest private provider, HC One, announced a 50% increase in deaths in 10 days, to 616. Bupa, which operates 125 homes, revealed it had lost well over 200 residents with confirmed or suspected coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The figures contrasted with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/boris-johnson-uk-beginning-to-turn-the-tide-on-coronavirus\">prime minister\u2019s Downing Street speech</a> on his first day back at work in which he declared: \u201cWe are now beginning to turn the tide.\u201d Johnson highlighted \u201cfewer hospital admissions, fewer Covid patients in ICU, and real signs now that we are passing through the peak\u201d.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cIf this virus were a physical assailant \u2013 an unexpected and invisible mugger, which I can tell you from personal experience it is \u2013 then this is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d2303496-2b61-48fb-94f3-914c26e89800\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eZioiFaqydk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Vic Rayner, the director of the National Care Forum, which represents charitable care home operators, said: \u201cWe are nowhere near a peak in care homes and this is absolutely the wrong time to turn away from actions to fight the virus.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a one-round fight. We need to make sure the care sector gets the resources it needs, and we haven\u2019t yet seen the level of action we need to get this right. The frontline of this virus has moved into care homes and the clinical focus now needs to shift.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jeremy Richardson, the chief executive of Four Seasons, said: \u201cWe\u2019re on the plateau rather than wrestling anything to the floor.\u201d</p> \n<p>The number of deaths across all care homes has been hard to pin down.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s coronavirus frontline has switched from hospitals to care homes, according to sector leaders who have dismissed Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that the virus has been \u201cwrestled to the floor\u201d as premature. Deaths in some of the largest care home networks have surged by more than 70% in the last week or two, operators said on Monday. Official figures due on Tuesday are expected to show a significant increase. In the week ending 19 April, 651 of the 682 coronavirus outbreaks reported across the whole of England were in care homes, Public Health England (PHE) reported. Leaders in the sector have demanded greater medical help and said the peak of social care fatalities is yet to come. Care UK reported 244 Covid-19 deaths in its facilities, a 74% rise in six days, including 18 deaths in a single home in north London where a care worker also died. Four Seasons Health Care reported a 79% increase in deaths in two weeks, bringing its death toll to 286, while the UK\u2019s largest private provider, HC One, announced a 50% increase in deaths in 10 days, to 616. Bupa, which operates 125 homes, revealed it had lost well over 200 residents with confirmed or suspected coronavirus. The figures contrasted with the prime minister\u2019s Downing Street speech on his first day back at work in which he declared: \u201cWe are now beginning to turn the tide.\u201d Johnson highlighted \u201cfewer hospital admissions, fewer Covid patients in ICU, and real signs now that we are passing through the peak\u201d. He added: \u201cIf this virus were a physical assailant \u2013 an unexpected and invisible mugger, which I can tell you from personal experience it is \u2013 then this is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor.\u201d Vic Rayner, the director of the National Care Forum, which represents charitable care home operators, said: \u201cWe are nowhere near a peak in care homes and this is absolutely the wrong time to turn away from actions to fight the virus. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a one-round fight. We need to make sure the care sector gets the resources it needs, and we haven\u2019t yet seen the level of action we need to get this right. The frontline of this virus has moved into care homes and the clinical focus now needs to shift.\u201d Jeremy Richardson, the chief executive of Four Seasons, said: \u201cWe\u2019re on the plateau rather than wrestling anything to the floor.\u201d The number of deaths across all care homes has been hard to pin down. Last week the Department of Health and Social Care said the official death toll in care homes in England had doubled in five days, to more than 2,000 by 15 April. Figures for that period will be confirmed by the Office of National Statistics on Tuesday alongside the release of Care Quality Commission data.

      "body": "<p>This is going to sound like the setup to a surreal joke, but nevertheless: last week, a young man from St Helens called Harry Roberts was lying in bed when he looked up and saw the comedian Johnny Vegas standing at his bedroom window, bearing a box of face masks.</p> <p>As it turned out, Roberts \u2013 a 19-year-old St Helens fan who suffers from cerebral palsy and quadriplegia \u2013 had been the unwitting beneficiary of a visit from the Steve Prescott Foundation, the charity set up by the 1990s and 2000s Saints full-back who died in 2013 of a rare form of stomach cancer. Over the last decade the foundation has become one of rugby league\u2019s best known philanthropic enterprises. During the coronavirus crisis it has been delivering food and protective equipment to households in St Helens and, as a proud Saints fan at a temporary loose end, Vegas has been cheerfully mucking in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/22/referees-need-supporting-too-lockdown-tests-rugby-league-officials\">'Referees need supporting too': life in lockdown for rugby league officials | Aaron Bower</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just a single snapshot of how a sport, even in the absence of sport, can still make itself useful. Leeds Rhinos have been identifying elderly and vulnerable fans via their ticketing database and getting club stalwarts such as Stevie Ward and Kevin Sinfield to ring them and check if they\u2019re OK. Castleford and Keighley are among the clubs to have designed special charity jerseys. The former England forward Ben Westwood has been turning up at Warrington hospital <a href=\"https://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/18393691.warrington-wolves-ben-westwood-gives-bacon-butties-nhs/\" title=\"\">with hundreds of bacon sandwiches</a> for the staff. The Swinton prop Lewis Hatton has fast-tracked the last six months of his nursing studies in order <a href=\"https://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/18351569.rugby-leagues-lewis-hatton-tackles-coronavirus-nursing-frontline/\" title=\"\">to help out on the front line</a>. While athletes in other sports wrangle over wages and kick their heels, rugby league mucks in first and asks questions later.</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing new or faddish about any of this, of course. The vast majority of rugby league clubs have always been deeply embedded in their communities, often some of the most deprived and forgotten in the country. But perhaps it\u2019s only at times like this that their true value becomes apparent. When towns are relying on the powerful cohesive force of their local club more than ever. And when those very same clubs are fighting for their own lives.</p> <p>Rugby league is hanging on by a thread. Never a fantastically profitable enterprise even in the good years, the onset of Covid-19 and the ensuing economic downturn have driven a sport overwhelmingly reliant on match-day revenue to the very brink. According to the Wakefield chief executive, Michael Carter, just a single postponed home fixture costs his club about \u00a360,000 in lost income. Project that over an entire season, which now looks like the likeliest scenario, and for clubs that count their revenue in the thousands rather than the millions, the effect could be disastrous.</p> <p>In a way, the sport\u2019s smallness offers it a certain protection. Furloughing of players and staff, the vast majority of whom are on modest wages (even in Super League the average annual salary is \u00a360,000), has helped relieve the burden. But with no broadcast revenue \u2013 Sky\u2019s last payment was on 1 April, with another due in July \u2013 and without access to the substantial credit lines available to Premier League football clubs, the margins are small and vanishing fast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"024e939bc7f7f41940cfbd5fd784a4268278559c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/024e939bc7f7f41940cfbd5fd784a4268278559c/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Helens\u2019 Totally Wicked Stadium lies empty with the Super League season on indefinite hold.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Helens\u2019 Totally Wicked Stadium lies empty with the Super League season on indefinite hold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The owner of Hull Kingston Rovers, Neil Hudgell, has warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/26/hull-kr-owner-rugby-league-could-cease-to-exist-full-time-sport-coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">rugby league could cease to exist</a> as a full-time sport by this time next year without some sort of government funding. And if you\u2019re not a rugby league fan and that doesn\u2019t overly bother you, then it\u2019s worth considering that when a town loses its rugby league club, it doesn\u2019t just lose a sliver of its local economy and some residual income for pubs and taxi drivers. It loses a part of itself.</p> <p>This goes beyond tries and trophies, beyond nostalgia and tradition and pride. For example, every single school in Warrington gets six weeks of free coaching sessions from Wolves players and staff. Wath Brow, a small amateur club in Cumbria, run a community gym that is open for all to use. St Helens run a veterans\u2019 cafe and support groups for those with autism and dementia. For so many of these places, the club is the town. The town is the club. As Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary and Wigan MP, puts it: \u201cFew sports encapsulate a place like rugby league does. The survival and success of rugby league is a symbolic test for the government\u2019s commitment to our towns.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/26/hull-kr-owner-rugby-league-could-cease-to-exist-full-time-sport-coronavirus-outbreak\">Hull KR owner warns rugby league could 'cease to exist' as a full-time sport</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over recent weeks, rugby league\u2019s administrators have been in talks with the government over a potential rescue package. Political geography is a factor here, of course: for successive Conservative administrations, rugby league territory was Labour territory, industrial towns populated almost exclusively by the sort of people who would never vote for them, and who thus could be safely ignored. No longer: northern towns are the new frontier of British politics, as unthinkable as it might have seemed a generation ago, and, though few in the sport would be impolite enough to say so explicitly, the fact that rugby league\u2019s heartlands are now electorally live may just ensure them a proper hearing.</p> <p>But the fate of rugby league is a bellwether for wider concerns, too. There has been plenty of talk since the start of the crisis about the role the state can or should play in supporting small business. Rugby league clubs aren\u2019t charities, but neither are they run entirely on profit. They\u2019re the community cafe, the small independent bookshop up the road, the record store, the tech start-up, the neighbourhood restaurant. Perhaps their demise won\u2019t make the evening news. But if they go, something quiet and devastating will be lost, and probably for good.</p>",

As it turned out, Roberts \u2013 a 19-year-old St Helens fan who suffers from cerebral palsy and quadriplegia \u2013 had been the unwitting beneficiary of a visit from the Steve Prescott Foundation, the charity set up by the 1990s and 2000s Saints full-back who died in 2013 of a rare form of stomach cancer. Over the last decade the foundation has become one of rugby league\u2019s best known philanthropic enterprises. During the coronavirus crisis it has been delivering food and protective equipment to households in St Helens and, as a proud Saints fan at a temporary loose end, Vegas has been cheerfully mucking in. Just a single snapshot of how a sport, even in the absence of sport, can still make itself useful. Leeds Rhinos have been identifying elderly and vulnerable fans via their ticketing database and getting club stalwarts such as Stevie Ward and Kevin Sinfield to ring them and check if they\u2019re OK. Castleford and Keighley are among the clubs to have designed special charity jerseys. The former England forward Ben Westwood has been turning up at Warrington hospital with hundreds of bacon sandwiches for the staff. The Swinton prop Lewis Hatton has fast-tracked the last six months of his nursing studies in order to help out on the front line. While athletes in other sports wrangle over wages and kick their heels, rugby league mucks in first and asks questions later. There\u2019s nothing new or faddish about any of this, of course. The vast majority of rugby league clubs have always been deeply embedded in their communities, often some of the most deprived and forgotten in the country. But perhaps it\u2019s only at times like this that their true value becomes apparent. When towns are relying on the powerful cohesive force of their local club more than ever. And when those very same clubs are fighting for their own lives. Rugby league is hanging on by a thread. Never a fantastically profitable enterprise even in the good years, the onset of Covid-19 and the ensuing economic downturn have driven a sport overwhelmingly reliant on match-day revenue to the very brink. According to the Wakefield chief executive, Michael Carter, just a single postponed home fixture costs his club about \u00a360,000 in lost income. Project that over an entire season, which now looks like the likeliest scenario, and for clubs that count their revenue in the thousands rather than the millions, the effect could be disastrous. In a way, the sport\u2019s smallness offers it a certain protection. Furloughing of players and staff, the vast majority of whom are on modest wages (even in Super League the average annual salary is \u00a360,000), has helped relieve the burden. But with no broadcast revenue \u2013 Sky\u2019s last payment was on 1 April, with another due in July \u2013 and without access to the substantial credit lines available to Premier League football clubs, the margins are small and vanishing fast. The owner of Hull Kingston Rovers, Neil Hudgell, has warned that rugby league could cease to exist as a full-time sport by this time next year without some sort of government funding. And if you\u2019re not a rugby league fan and that doesn\u2019t overly bother you, then it\u2019s worth considering that when a town loses its rugby league club, it doesn\u2019t just lose a sliver of its local economy and some residual income for pubs and taxi drivers. It loses a part of itself. This goes beyond tries and trophies, beyond nostalgia and tradition and pride. For example, every single school in Warrington gets six weeks of free coaching sessions from Wolves players and staff. Wath Brow, a small amateur club in Cumbria, run a community gym that is open for all to use. St Helens run a veterans\u2019 cafe and support groups for those with autism and dementia. For so many of these places, the club is the town. The town is the club. As Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary and Wigan MP, puts it: \u201cFew sports encapsulate a place like rugby league does. The survival and success of rugby league is a symbolic test for the government\u2019s commitment to our towns.\u201d Over recent weeks, rugby league\u2019s administrators have been in talks with the government over a potential rescue package. Political geography is a factor here, of course: for successive Conservative administrations, rugby league territory was Labour territory, industrial towns populated almost exclusively by the sort of people who would never vote for them, and who thus could be safely ignored. No longer: northern towns are the new frontier of British politics, as unthinkable as it might have seemed a generation ago, and, though few in the sport would be impolite enough to say so explicitly, the fact that rugby league\u2019s heartlands are now electorally live may just ensure them a proper hearing. But the fate of rugby league is a bellwether for wider concerns, too. There has been plenty of talk since the start of the crisis about the role the state can or should play in supporting small business. Rugby league clubs aren\u2019t charities, but neither are they run entirely on profit. They\u2019re the community cafe, the small independent bookshop up the road, the record store, the tech start-up, the neighbourhood restaurant. Perhaps their demise won\u2019t make the evening news. But if they go, something quiet and devastating will be lost, and probably for good.",

      "bodyText": "A Financial Times reporter has been suspended after the Independent accused him of listening in on sensitive Zoom meetings held by its senior managers telling staff about salary cuts and furloughs. Mark Di Stefano, who joined the FT from BuzzFeed in January, has been accused of listening to the audio feed of video conference calls held by the Independent and its sister title the Evening Standard about responding to the financial impact of coronavirus. In each case Di Stefano, a prolific tweeter with more than 100,000 followers, broke the news of the meetings on Twitter at the same time as staff were being informed. A story on the measures being introduced by the Evening Standard, which is edited by the former chancellor George Osborne, was subsequently published by the FT. A summary of the cuts at the online-only Independent was published in the FT\u2019s daily live blog. The Independent claimed Zoom log files showed an account registered to Di Stefano\u2019s FT.com email address joined the video call for Independent staff last week for 16 seconds. The caller\u2019s video was disabled, but some journalists apparently saw his name flash briefly on screen before he left the meeting. Minutes later a separate account joined the call, this time unnamed, the Independent said. It claimed the caller remained in audio-only mode with a black square displayed to journalists on the video call. The anonymous user account, which remained in the meeting until the end, was later shown to be linked to a mobile phone used by the same FT reporter. The FT began investigating Di Stefano after the Independent contacted senior figures at the paper with its allegations. The FT\u2019s story about the cuts cited \u201cpeople on the call\u201d as its source. The Independent has also alleged that the account it says is linked to Di Stefano\u2019s mobile phone gained access to an Evening Standard video call made by Osborne announcing large-scale furloughs and salary cuts on 1 April. The Independent editor, Christian Broughton, said: \u201cWe respect freedom of speech and understand the challenges of news gathering, but the Independent considers the presence of a third-party journalist in a staff briefing to be entirely inappropriate and an unwarranted intrusion into our employees\u2019 privacy. \u201cOur spokesperson had a full statement prepared for the press. Any interested reporters only needed to call and ask.\u201d A spokesperson for the Evening Standard said: \u201cFor a journalist from the FT to have illegitimately accessed a private Zoom call is unacceptable.

      "body": "<p>The coronavirus pandemic struck the United Kingdom when its National Health Service was on its knees suffering from staff shortages and the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50397856\" title=\"\">longest waiting times</a> ever recorded. A decade of austerity had taken a terrible toll. Yet public satisfaction in the NHS <a href=\"https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/news-item/public-satisfaction-with-the-nhs-rose-sharply-in-2019-why\" title=\"\">went up</a>. This surprising gap between the NHS failures and the public\u2019s belief in the health system seems to have been driven by the support from across the political spectrum for more funding. This probably, say researchers, started to impact on public perceptions, most notably on their optimism for the future.</p> <p>It would be a mistake to think the spread of Covid-19 can be checked by hope alone. The last 10 years have undermined the ability of the government to respond effectively and efficiently.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus pandemic struck the United Kingdom when its National Health Service was on its knees suffering from staff shortages and the longest waiting times ever recorded. A decade of austerity had taken a terrible toll. Yet public satisfaction in the NHS went up. This surprising gap between the NHS failures and the public\u2019s belief in the health system seems to have been driven by the support from across the political spectrum for more funding. This probably, say researchers, started to impact on public perceptions, most notably on their optimism for the future. It would be a mistake to think the spread of Covid-19 can be checked by hope alone. The last 10 years have undermined the ability of the government to respond effectively and efficiently. As the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty told the Guardian, the \u201cmost damaging aspects of \u2018austerity\u2019 cannot and will not be undone\u201d and represent \u201cthe fatal weakening of the community\u2019s capacity to cope\u201d. Even today ideology plays a bigger part in the government\u2019s response than many insiders care to admit. A more proactive mindset might have seen the state mobilise an effort to track down those in need of a coronavirus test and offer it to them. Instead voluntarism remains the creed of the current government which opted for an online booking system for tests that was predictably overwhelmed within hours. In the coming weeks there will be an argument about whether the shutdown is more deadly than the virus. The case for lifting the current restrictions can be rooted within Conservative thought which privileges individual autonomy and the promotion of individual responsibility. Calls for these to be dogmatically pursued run in the face of evidence that the old and the poor are more vulnerable to the disease.

Asked about the likely overall death toll, he said: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My view, actually, is we need to view this epidemic over the long run, and this has got a very long way to run.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019m really cautious about putting out these kind of absolute numbers, because this could go in a lot of different ways over the next many months until such time as we have a clear exit that has a vaccine or drugs or some other route that allows us to be able to say we now can stop people dying from this. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And later he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This has got a very long way to run. Just thinking about the first peak, which due to the fantastic work the whole nation has done and the work of the NHS we have actually managed to go through - we have still got some way before it is falling right off - but there is a long, long way to go beyond that. And I think it\u2019s a big mistake, in my view, just to consider just the first phase. We need to consider the epidemic as a whole. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Ministers insist their priority at the moment is to avoid a second peak. Whitty\u2019s comment suggests the scientists think some sort of second peak is inevitable.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that he was \u201cvery worried\u201d by reports of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/what-is-the-new-illness-affecting-children-and-is-it-linked-to-coronavirus\">a small number of children needing treatment in intensive care for for a condition called \u201cmulti-system inflammatory state\u201d.</a></strong> Whitty said it was \u201centirely plausible\u201d that this was linked to coronavirus.

She asked:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m missing my grandchildren so much. Please can you let me know if, after the five criteria are met, is being able to hug our closest family one of the first steps out of lockdown?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Whitty said this would depend on whether Lynne has a \u201csignificant medical problem in a way that means she has to be shielding and she\u2019s an older person\u201d. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If she\u2019s in a group that\u2019s vulnerable, then the answer is it might well be prudent - and this will depend entirely on individual circumstances - for her not to get into a situation where she\u2019s putting herself at risk.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hancock added:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We understand the impact of not being able to hug your closest family. We just hope we can get back to that as soon as possible.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock announced that the families of NHS and care staff who have died from coronavirus will receive payments of \u00a360,000.</strong> He said 82 NHS workers and 16 social care staff had died so far. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I feel a deep personal sense of duty that we must care for their loved ones. Today, I am able to announce that the government is setting up a life assurance scheme for NHS and social care frontline colleagues. Families of staff who die from coronavirus in the course of their essential frontline work will receive a \u00a360,000 payment. Of course, nothing replaces the loss of a loved one but we want to do everything we can to support families who are dealing with this grief.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The scheme could be extended to other frontline workers, he said.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said some NHS services which had been paused due to the coronavirus outbreak will be restored from tomorrow.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the government would be able to run a contact tracing system with 100,000 coronavirus tests (the government\u2019s target for the end of this week) being carried out a day.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said there were 3,190 spare critical care beds - adding \u201c42% of oxygen-supported beds in the NHS now lie empty\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He did not rule out the government introducing quarantine for travellers arriving in Britain in the next phase of the crisis.</strong> According to the Sunday Telegraph, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/04/25/two-weeks-quarantine-travelling-uk/\">the government may put new arrivals in quarantine for 14 days. </a>Asked about the proposal, Hancock did not deny it was an option. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Given the current level of infections, level of new cases in the UK, and the very low amounts of international travel that\u2019s going on right now, it is clear that the impact on the epidemic as a whole of the number of people coming through the borders as a proportion is very low.</p> \n   <p>But as we bring the number of new cases down in the UK, that proportion coming from those who are travelling internationally will rise.

A total of 321 inmates are confirmed to have contracted coronavirus as of 5pm on Saturday, and 15 have died, the justice secretary has confirmed. As many as 293 prison staff have also tested positive for Covid-19 in 53 jails and five have died.</p> \n  <p>All offenders must pass a risk assessment before their release is approved. But plans to release a \u201csignificant number\u201d over the last week had to be put on hold after six inmates were released by mistake due to an \u201cadministrative error\u201d before being returned to prison, the MoJ said.</p> \n  <p>Answering questions in the House of Commons on Monday, <strong>Justice Secretary Robert Buckland</strong> said: \u201cProgress has, I admit, been careful and slow, but we have reached a position now where, also taking into account the release of pregnant women, a total of 33 prisoners have been released.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s a scheme that I did not embark upon lightly, it is the result of very careful risk assessment, so that we want to minimise any risk to the public, and of course it\u2019s coupled with the reduction that we\u2019ve seen in prison places and prison capacity of about 3,000, which to my judgment and the judgment of those who advise me, is already making a big difference in creating the space that we need in order to increase compartmentalisation and to reduce the spread of the virus.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In another plan, low-risk offenders could be moved into temporary prison cells in the grounds of seven jails so fewer are sharing. Prison charities have launched legal action against the Justice Secretary, claiming measures taken so far to address coronavirus behind bars are \u201cunlawful\u201d because they will have a \u201cmanifestly insufficient impact\u201d.

Here are some of the main points so far.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Gove claimed that the coronavirus crisis could increase the chances of the UK and the EU striking a trade deal this year because it should \u201cconcentrate the minds of EU negotiators\u201d. </strong>Responding to a question from <strong>Hilary Benn,</strong> the committee chairman, about whether the coronavirus crisis altered the chances of the UK and the EU negotiating a trade deal by the end of this year, Gove said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think the Covid-19 crisis, in some respects, should concentrate the minds of EU negotiators, reinforcing the vital importance of coming to a conclusion.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also said that reaching a deal by the end of the year was \u201centirely possible\u201d. He described the statement put out by Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, at the end of last week\u2019s round of negotiations as \u201crelatively downbeat\u201d (an understatement - you can read it <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_20_739\">here</a>) and he said he thought the odds on a deal being struck were 2 to 1.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He refused to say whether the UK still planned to walk away from the talks if it had not made good progress towards a deal in June. </strong>Asked about this, he said he did not want to pre-empt the government\u2019s response.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He signalled that David Frost, the PM\u2019s chief Europe adviser, would be willing to give evidence to the committee.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T14:44:02.654Z\">at 3.44pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea6e73c8f08938b7d9f680b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T14:15:41.410Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Nation to hold minute's silence to honour Covid-19 key worker victims</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>They have lost their lives in the duty of helping others stricken by Covid-19. Tomorrow, the nation will fall silent in tribute to key workers, including NHS staff, who have died in the pandemic. </p> \n  <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>, who survived the disease after being treated in intensive care, will be among those observing a minute\u2019s silence at 11am tomorrow. </p> \n  <p>It is hoped the tribute will be followed nationwide, with government workers asked to take part. It comes after <strong>Unison</strong>, the largest trade union in the UK, the <strong>Royal College of Midwives </strong>and the <strong>Royal College of Nursing</strong> launched a campaign last week for the nation to take a moment to honour frontline staff who have died during the Covid-19 crisis. Between them, the organisations represent more than a million NHS and public service workers including porters, refuse collectors and care staff.</p> \n  <p>According to PA Media, more than 90 frontline NHS workers have died since 25 March, with other lives lost in other key sectors, including private social care and transport. The Guardian has also been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/doctors-nurses-porters-volunteers-the-uk-health-workers-who-have-died-from-covid-19\">chronicling the Covid-19 deaths of healthcare staff</a>. </p> \n  <p>On Monday, the PM\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cWe will be supporting the minute\u2019s silence. We will be asking everybody who works in the Government to take part and we would hope that others will take part nationwide as well.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Dame Donna Kinnair</strong>, the chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: \u201cThis moment will bring together a sombre but grateful nation. Whether in nursing or driving buses, our heroes kept going to work when many had the luxury of staying at home. Nobody should go out to work and risk their life.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This must not be the last time that sacrifice is recognised. The country and its leaders owes a tremendous debt to these key workers and the many more who are on shift again today.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Unison general secretary,<strong> Dave Prentis</strong>, said: \u201cBoris Johnson has seen first-hand how NHS staff are going to remarkable lengths to keep us all safe.

For example, Johnson has, [Johnson\u2019s biographer Andrew] Gimson told me, always preferred doing \u201ca lot of things imperfectly than one thing perfectly,\u201d choosing to press ahead on the basis of imperfect information rather than waiting until all the facts are clear. In the days and weeks ahead, this carries the risk of overreaching and overpromising \u2013 of moving too quickly based on information that confirms things he wants to be true, but might not be. Of course, this is also a reality of being in charge: As Henry Kissinger has observed, the skill of leadership is to make marginal decisions with imperfect information before others are comfortable doing so, taking a calculated gamble and being willing to stand alone first.</p> \n   <p>Today, the reality of the situation is that when Johnson was admitted to the hospital on 5 April, the death toll in Britain was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-toll/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-by-621-to-4934-idUSKBN21N0JO\">4,934</a>.

He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Thanks to your forbearance, your good sense your altruism, your spirit of community, thanks to our collective national resolve, we are on the brink of achieving that first clear mission to prevent our National Health Service from being overwhelmed in a way that tragically we have seen elsewhere.</p> \n   <p>And that is how and why we are now beginning to turn the tide.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This was Johnson effectively saying he remains committed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/19/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-london-lockdown-williamson-refuses-to-rule-out-government-putting-london-in-lockdown-by-weekend?page=with:block-5e73b1798f085e564ad87642#block-5e73b1798f085e564ad87642\">the prediction he made on 19 March</a> (five and a half weeks ago) when he said the UK would \u201cturn the tide within the next 12 weeks\u201d.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>But Johnson also effectively re-defined \u201cturning the tide\u201d, saying that the UK was now near the point where it could move from \u201cthe first phase\u201d to the \u201csecond phase\u201d.</strong> Last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/19/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-london-lockdown-williamson-refuses-to-rule-out-government-putting-london-in-lockdown-by-weekend?page=with:block-5e73b1798f085e564ad87642#block-5e73b1798f085e564ad87642\">when he made his \u201cturning the tide\u201d prediction</a>, Johnson said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think, looking at it all, that we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks and I\u2019m absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Now no one is talking about sending coronavirus packing (Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, said last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/22/uk-coronavirus-live-government-ppe-procurement-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ea079c18f08a1178d5afdf6#block-5ea079c18f08a1178d5afdf6\">coronavirus \u201cis not going to be eradicated\u201d)</a> and Johnson said the aims in phase one were to ensure the NHS did not get overwhelmed and to \u201cflatten the peak\u201d of the curve.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said that in the second phase lockdown restrictions would start to be lifted - but only \u201cgradually\u201d.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are meeting our five tests: deaths falling; NHS protected; rate of infection down; really sorting out the challenges of testing and PPE; avoiding a second peak.</p> \n   <p>Then that will be the time to move on to the second phase, in which we continue to suppress the disease and keep the reproduction rate, the r rate, down, but begin gradually to refine the economic and social restrictions and one by one to fire up the engines of this vast UK economy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He refused to make any predictions about what restrictions might be lifted, or when.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In that process [moving to phase two] difficult judgments will be made and we simply cannot spell out now how fast or slow or even when those changes will be made, though clearly the government will be saying much more about this in the coming days.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also avoided any prediction about life returning to normal, or even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/boris-johnson-returns-to-no-10-and-a-government-under-pressure\">the \u201cnew normal\u201d</a>, as ministers call it now.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that he wanted to build \u201cthe biggest possible consensus\u201d about how and when to relax the lockdown measures.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I want to serve notice now that these decisions [about relaxing lockdown measures] will be taken with the maximum possible transparency and I want to share all our working and our thinking, my thinking, with you the British people.</p> \n   <p>And of course, we will be relying as ever on the science to inform us, as we have from the beginning.</p> \n   <p>But we will also be reaching out to build the biggest possible consensus, across business, across industry, across all parts of our United Kingdom, across party lines, bringing in opposition parties as far as we possibly can, because I think that is no less than what the British people would expect.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In some ways this was the most novel element in the speech. In the three weeks while Johnson has been off work, Dominic Raab, who has been deputising for him, has not given this sort of commitment. The Scottish government <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/strategy-plan/2020/04/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making/documents/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making/govscot%3Adocument/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making.pdf?forceDownload=true\">(here)</a> and the Welsh government <a href=\"https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2020-04/leading-wales-out-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic.pdf\">(here)</a> have both published discussion papers about the issues to be considered as the lockdown gets lifted and Downing Street may be stung by the criticism that it is not consulting the public properly in a similar way. A good example is <a href=\"https://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/news/statement-covid-19-and-the-basics-of-democratic-governance\">this statement</a> from the <strong>Nuffield Council on Bioethics</strong> at the weekend. It says citizens\u2019 assemblies should be used to help determine the path forward.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson claimed that preparations were underway for the easing of the lockdown. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can tell you now that preparations are under way, and have been for weeks, to allow us to win phase two of this fight, as I believe we are now on track to prevail in phase one.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He did not elaborate, but he will have been referring to things like the ramping up of testing, and the introduction of contact tracing system.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He presented the government\u2019s fight against coronavirus so far as a success. He said:</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We defied so many predictions. We did not run out of ventilators or ICU beds, we did not allow our NHS to collapse, and on the contrary we have so far collectively shielded our NHS so that our incredible doctors and nurses and healthcare staff have been able to shield all of us from an outbreak that would have been far worse, and we collectively flattened the peak.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is one interpretation of events. An alternative view is that the UK has one of the worst coronavirus death rates in Europe, perhaps because it implemented the lockdown later than other countries, and that the government has been behind the curve in implementing testing and stockpiling PPE.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson stressed that he understood the pressure from business for the lockdown to be eased.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So let me say directly also to British business, to the shopkeepers, to the entrepreneurs, to the hospitality sector, to everyone on whom our economy depends: I understand your impatience, I share your anxiety, and I know that without our private sector without the drive and commitment of the wealth creators of this country there will be no economy to speak of, there will be no cash to pay for our public services no way of funding our NHS, and yes I can see the long term consequences of lock down as clearly as anyone.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This passage seemed to be addressed in particular to Johnson\u2019s colleagues in the Conservative party. \u201cI still a free-market Tory,\u201d he was telling them - while failing to offer them any actual concessions on policy.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He depicted coronavirus as a mugger.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If this virus were a physical assailant, an unexpected and invisible mugger, which I can tell you from personal experience it is, then this is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor, and so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity, this is the moment when we can press home our advantage.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He thanks the public for their contribution so far.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Once again, I want to thank you, the people of this country, for the sheer grit and guts, you have shown and are continuing to show.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Every ministerial public statement now contains a passage of thanks to the public like this.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He ended by saying the UK could come out of this stronger.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If we can show the same spirit of unity and determination as we have all shown in the past six weeks, then I have absolutely no doubt that we will beat it together, we will come through this all the faster, and the United Kingdom, will emerge stronger than ever before.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson speeches almost always contain passage of evidence-free utopianism like this one. At a press conference last month he said he was often accused of being \u201cunnecessarily boosterish\u201d. Today\u2019s speech showed that, despite his illness, he has not really changed.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ab5795e02480b12d4f56f861cd366ce8f7361a0\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ab5795e02480b12d4f56f861cd366ce8f7361a0/0_384_7586_4555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking in Downing Street this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking in Downing Street this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T11:28:36.649Z\">at 12.28pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea6a9e48f0845d1c895e6a1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/damiancarrington\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T09:46:38.388Z\">10.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The coronavirus pandemic is likely to be followed by even more deadly and destructive disease outbreaks unless their root cause \u2013 the rampant destruction of the natural world \u2013 is rapidly halted, the world\u2019s leading <strong>biodiversity </strong>experts have warned.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere is a single species responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 us,\u201d they said. \u201cRecent pandemics are a direct consequence of human activity, particularly our global financial and economic systems that prize economic growth at any cost.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a summary of some of the key events in another day of fast-moving developments in the UK as the coronavirus pandemic continues: Boris Johnson says it is too soon to ease the lockdown. Speaking outside Downing Street after spending time recuperating at Chequers, the prime minister said although he acknowledged the pressure to relax the rules, he highlighted that this was also a moment of \u201cmaximum risk\u201d. He said: \u201cThis is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle [coronavirus] to the floor, and so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity. This is the moment when we can press home our advantage. It is also the moment of maximum risk, because I know that there will be many people looking now at our apparent success and beginning to wonder whether now is the time to go easy on those social distancing measures.\u201d The NHS will restart some vital services, including cancer care, from tomorrow, health secretary Matt Hancock says, as he admitted the government has a \u201clot of work\u201d to do to hit its 100,000 a day testing target. Some 29,058 tests had been carried out in England, Scotland and Wales in the 24 hours up to 9am on Saturday, according to the latest figures, suggesting the Government is way off its 100,000 a day target set for this Thursday. But Hancock claimed the government was \u201cbroadly where we expected to be\u201d in terms of testing capacity but admitted there was a lot of work to do to hit the 100,000 a day goal. A further 360 people have died in UK hospitals in the last 24 hours after contracting Covid-19, representing a dip in the daily number of fatalities. It means that so far 21,092 people have died in UK hospitals to date after testing positive for the virus. The figure does not include those who have died in care homes so the true coronavirus death toll is likely to be significantly higher. The 360 daily death toll is down from 413 yesterday. The families of NHS and social care staff who die during their coronavirus work will get payments worth \u00a360,000, health secretary Matt Hancock has announced. The government is looking at what can be done to help the families of other frontline workers who have died during the crisis, he says. So far, 82 NHS and 16 social care workers have died during the pandemic, he added. Firms will be able to get loans worth up to \u00a350,000, chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced, as part of a \u2018bounce back\u2019 scheme for businesses with 100% government backing. Companies will be able to get loans worth up to 25% of turnover, with a maximum payment of \u00a350,000, he told the Commons. The government will pay the interest for the first 12 months, he says. And the government will back them 100%. He describes them as \u201cbounce back\u201d loans, and he says people will be able to apply from Monday next week. There will be no forward-looking eligibility test, he says. Children are falling ill with a new and potentially fatal combination of symptoms apparently linked to Covid-19, including a sore stomach and heart problems. The children affected appear to have been struck by a form of toxic shock syndrome. Some have been left so seriously unwell that they have had to be treated in intensive care. At least one has undergone extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment, which is used when someone\u2019s life is at risk because they can no longer breathe for themselves. The names of some of the experts on the scientific group advising the UK government\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis will be published \u201cshortly\u201d, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser has said. It comes after the Guardian revealed the involvement of the prime minister\u2019s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, in meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Cummings\u2019 attendance and participation in the group\u2019s meetings raised questions about the independence of its scientific advice. After mounting pressure on Downing Street to disclose more details about the group \u2013 whose membership and advice the government has kept secret \u2013 Sir Patrick Vallance told a briefing for science journalists that the identities of the experts are usually revealed after the emergency is over, and that had also been the advice for the coronavirus crisis. Here\u2019s a video snippet of the health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s earlier announcement that the families of NHS and social care staff who die during their coronavirus work will get payments worth \u00a360,000. The government is looking at what can be done to help the families of other frontline workers who have died during the crisis, he says. So far, 82 NHS and 16 social care workers have died during the pandemic, he added. Here are the main points from the press conference. Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, said the coronavirus epidemic had \u201ca very long way to run\u201d. He also implied that further peaks were likely as social distancing measures start to ease. Asked about the likely overall death toll, he said: My view, actually, is we need to view this epidemic over the long run, and this has got a very long way to run. I\u2019m really cautious about putting out these kind of absolute numbers, because this could go in a lot of different ways over the next many months until such time as we have a clear exit that has a vaccine or drugs or some other route that allows us to be able to say we now can stop people dying from this. And later he said: This has got a very long way to run. Just thinking about the first peak, which due to the fantastic work the whole nation has done and the work of the NHS we have actually managed to go through - we have still got some way before it is falling right off - but there is a long, long way to go beyond that. And I think it\u2019s a big mistake, in my view, just to consider just the first phase. We need to consider the epidemic as a whole. Ministers insist their priority at the moment is to avoid a second peak. Whitty\u2019s comment suggests the scientists think some sort of second peak is inevitable. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that he was \u201cvery worried\u201d by reports of a small number of children needing treatment in intensive care for for a condition called \u201cmulti-system inflammatory state\u201d. Whitty said it was \u201centirely plausible\u201d that this was linked to coronavirus. (See 6pm.) Whitty was unable to reassure grandparents that they will be able to hug their grandchildren any time soon. He was responding to a question submitted by Lynne, a woman from Skipton, who was the first person to participate under a new initiative allowing a member of the public to submit a question every day. She asked: I\u2019m missing my grandchildren so much. Please can you let me know if, after the five criteria are met, is being able to hug our closest family one of the first steps out of lockdown? Whitty said this would depend on whether Lynne has a \u201csignificant medical problem in a way that means she has to be shielding and she\u2019s an older person\u201d. He went on: If she\u2019s in a group that\u2019s vulnerable, then the answer is it might well be prudent - and this will depend entirely on individual circumstances - for her not to get into a situation where she\u2019s putting herself at risk. Hancock added: We understand the impact of not being able to hug your closest family. We just hope we can get back to that as soon as possible. Hancock announced that the families of NHS and care staff who have died from coronavirus will receive payments of \u00a360,000. He said 82 NHS workers and 16 social care staff had died so far. He went on: I feel a deep personal sense of duty that we must care for their loved ones. Today, I am able to announce that the government is setting up a life assurance scheme for NHS and social care frontline colleagues. Families of staff who die from coronavirus in the course of their essential frontline work will receive a \u00a360,000 payment. Of course, nothing replaces the loss of a loved one but we want to do everything we can to support families who are dealing with this grief. The scheme could be extended to other frontline workers, he said. Hancock said some NHS services which had been paused due to the coronavirus outbreak will be restored from tomorrow. He said the government would be able to run a contact tracing system with 100,000 coronavirus tests (the government\u2019s target for the end of this week) being carried out a day. He said there were 3,190 spare critical care beds - adding \u201c42% of oxygen-supported beds in the NHS now lie empty\u201d. He did not rule out the government introducing quarantine for travellers arriving in Britain in the next phase of the crisis. According to the Sunday Telegraph, the government may put new arrivals in quarantine for 14 days. Asked about the proposal, Hancock did not deny it was an option. He said: Given the current level of infections, level of new cases in the UK, and the very low amounts of international travel that\u2019s going on right now, it is clear that the impact on the epidemic as a whole of the number of people coming through the borders as a proportion is very low. But as we bring the number of new cases down in the UK, that proportion coming from those who are travelling internationally will rise. That means the judgment in the measures needed at the border changes. More detail from the situation inside the country\u2019s jails as my colleague Jamie Grierson reports that the latest Ministry of Justice figures show the increase in confirmed cases of Covid-19 among prisons in England and Wales is continuing to slow. As at 5pm on Sunday, 324 prisoners had tested positive for the coronavirus across 71 prisons, an increase of less than 1% in 24 hours. The number of prison staff confirmed to have the disease increased by 1% in the same period to 296 workers across 59 prisons. There have been 321 confirmed cases of coronavirus among prisoners and 293 among staff. There are 81,500 prisoners in England and Wales and about 33,000 staff working in public sector prisons. Five members of prison staff and 15 prisoners are known to have contracted Covid-19 and died. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, struck an optimistic tone earlier on Monday as he told MPs \u201ccases and deaths are much lower than originally predicted\u201d in prisons with \u201cpositive signs\u201d the approach was working, although he cautioned: \u201cWe are not out of the woods yet.\u201d Opposition politicians in Gloucestershire have called for a public investigation into the decision to allow the Cheltenham racing festival and other sporting events to go ahead in March in the days immediately prior to the nationwide lockdown. Data about the higher number of cases in the county compared with other parts of the south-west has led to growing questions as to whether the four-day event attended by 125,000 people could have led to a spike in the numbers who caught the disease and even died. Paul Hodgkinson, the Lib Dem opposition leader on the county council, highlighted \u201cemerging evidence\u201d picked up by the Somerset County gazette, which show a marked uplift in cases in Gloucestershire from March 31, a little over two weeks after the festival ended on March 13. He said that the Lib Dems in Cheltenham \u201care subsequently calling for a public investigation into whether Government encouragement to proceed with sporting fixtures and mass-gatherings, at a time when other countries were struggling to contain Covid-19, increased the spread of infections throughout the UK and put the health of Cheltenham residents and visitors at risk\u201d. Last week the Guardian reported that public health experts said there should be an inquiry into whether Cheltenham led to a spike in coronavirus cases after mortality data showed that more people had died in Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Trusts (148) than nearby two trusts in Bristol (75 and 70) plus those in Swindon (79) and Bath (50). But local public health officials have been reluctant to make any connection with the festival, arguing that Gloucestershire is a separate case from the rest of the south west, with one nearby trust, Worcestershire Acute hospitals, registering 178 deaths. They say that \u201ca number of factors\u201d are behind Gloucestershire\u2019s case number. Just 33 prisoners have so far been freed from jail early as part of efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19, despite plans to release thousands. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) pledged earlier this month to release up to 4,000 low-risk prisoners on temporary licence to ease overcrowding, as well as pregnant inmates and mothers with babies, but it has managed only a tiny fraction of that number. It comes as there are now confirmed cases in more than half of jails in England and Wales. A total of 321 inmates are confirmed to have contracted coronavirus as of 5pm on Saturday, and 15 have died, the justice secretary has confirmed. As many as 293 prison staff have also tested positive for Covid-19 in 53 jails and five have died. All offenders must pass a risk assessment before their release is approved. But plans to release a \u201csignificant number\u201d over the last week had to be put on hold after six inmates were released by mistake due to an \u201cadministrative error\u201d before being returned to prison, the MoJ said. Answering questions in the House of Commons on Monday, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said: \u201cProgress has, I admit, been careful and slow, but we have reached a position now where, also taking into account the release of pregnant women, a total of 33 prisoners have been released. It\u2019s a scheme that I did not embark upon lightly, it is the result of very careful risk assessment, so that we want to minimise any risk to the public, and of course it\u2019s coupled with the reduction that we\u2019ve seen in prison places and prison capacity of about 3,000, which to my judgment and the judgment of those who advise me, is already making a big difference in creating the space that we need in order to increase compartmentalisation and to reduce the spread of the virus.\u201d In another plan, low-risk offenders could be moved into temporary prison cells in the grounds of seven jails so fewer are sharing. Prison charities have launched legal action against the Justice Secretary, claiming measures taken so far to address coronavirus behind bars are \u201cunlawful\u201d because they will have a \u201cmanifestly insufficient impact\u201d. They have called for a judicial review if urgent action is not taken to address their concerns. Bad news for music fans as it has been announced, perhaps inevitably, that the annual Latitude Festival has been cancelled this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The popular music and arts festival, which was due to take place in Suffolk in mid-July with headliners including Liam Gallagher, the Chemical Brothers and Haim, will offer refunds via ticketing partners or let people retain their tickets for next year. Confirming the cancellation, organisers said in a statement on Twitter: We\u2019ve been closely monitoring this unprecedented situation and it\u2019s become clear that it\u2019s just not possible for this year\u2019s festival to go ahead. Our heart goes out to the fans, artists, suppliers, performers, volunteers - our entire Latitude family.\u201d The statement added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to put our all into planning the best Latitude you\u2019ve ever been to and can\u2019t wait to see you in July 2021. For now keep safe, keep healthy and look after each other.\u201d Hancock says, if he had been told a month ago the NHS would be able to get to this point without its capacity being over-run, he would have been very pleased. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Hancock says the new Nightingale hospitals will not be used for general medical procedures. But they will ease the pressure on other hospitals, allowing more non-coronavirus patients to be seen. Powis says the Nightingale hospitals show how the NHS can be agile and flexible, adapting its model of care. Q: How long will it take for NHS operations that have been suspended to be reinstated? Hancock says the most urgent treatments should be rescheduled first. What happens will have to be locally driven, he says. Q: What do you know about the condition affecting a small number of children with coronavirus-type symptoms? (See 9.38am.) Hancock says he is \u201cvery worried\u201d about this and officials are looking at it closely. Powis says only a small number of cases have appeared. But he says the NHS and Public Health England are looking into this urgently. It is too early to say whether there is a link to coronavirus, he says. But he says this sort of disease is very rare. If parents are worried about their children, they should ring 111, or 999. The NHS is there for sick children. Whitty says this is a very rare situation. But he says it is \u201centirely plausible\u201d that there is a link with coronavirus. He says the numbers involved are very small. Here is the Health Service Journal story about this condition. And here is an article from our colleague Ian Sample, the Guardian\u2019s science editor. Q: Will the government cancel beer duty? Hancock says he will raise this suggestion with the chancellor. But he says Rishi Sunak\u2019s loan scheme announced today is an important step. Q: So are you saying there is no plan for opening schools? Hancock says it is \u201ctoo early\u201d to make decisions on this. People should follow the social distancing rules, he says. Whitty says there is \u201croom for manoeuvre\u201d between where R is now, and R hitting 1. The government is looking at what options are within those boundaries, he says. He says these are ultimately decisions for ministers. But he says there will have to be \u201cdifficult choices\u201d. You cannot do everything people want and still keep the R below 1, he says. Hancock says the NHS never stopped treating people. But, because it now has more capacity, it can do some procedures that were halted. Powis says the NHS is not undertaking some of the services that were paused. He says some cancer treatments were delayed for good clinical reasons. He says this should not be seen as evidence that the lockdown is being relaxed. The NHS can do this because the lockdown has been successful at reducing Covid numbers, he says. Q: To what extent has your advice on sending children to school changed? If they did go back, what impact would that have on the R number? And can children spread the virus amongst themselves? Whitty says the great majority of children do not get coronavirus, or only have minor symptoms. But there are a small number of relatively severe cases, he says. He says having schools open does contribute to increasing the R. Closing schools helped to get R below 1. He says there is quite a debate around the world about the contribution children make to the spread of this virus, and whether there is a difference between young children and older children. But we don\u2019t really know, he says. It is a new disease. He says children probably spread this less than they spread flu. But he says people are not sure what impact opening schools would have on R. Powis says the NHS has been worried about people not seeking treatment because they don\u2019t want to go to hospital because of the coronavirus situation. Attendance at A&amp;E is down, he says. He says it will become clearer over time what impact this is having on people\u2019s health. But \u201cthe NHS is always there for you\u201d, he says. Whitty says the government currently has an antibody test that can give a \u201cranging shot\u201d as to the proportion of people who have been exposed to coronavirus. But he says they do not have a test that can say, with absolute confidence, whether an individual has had it. Q: There were reports over the weekend that you may start quarantining people arriving in the UK. Why did you change your mind on this? And does that mean you do not want people to holiday abroad? Hancock says the government has been very clear that it is following the science. At the moment, given the levels of coronavirus in the UK and the low level of international travel, the impact of people arriving on the coronavirus epidemic is very low. But as these factors change, the judgment will change, he says. Whitty says the lower the reproduction number (R), the quicker the peak will move away. And the lower the R is, the more flexibility there is for ministers as they consider how they might ease the lockdown. The lower it is, the more \u201croom for manoeuvre\u201d they have. Q: What is your estimate of R for hospitals and care homes? Whitty says it is falling in hospitals. It is harder to work out for care homes, he says. But he says there is new ONS data coming out tomorrow. He says it varies from care home to care home. Q: What explains the mismatch between what you said the death toll might be initially, and what the situation is now? Whitty says he has always avoided putting a figure on the number of likely deaths. He repeats the point about how this has a very long way to go. He says it is a \u201cbig mistake\u201d just to look at what is happening in the first wave. Q: What would be a realistic figure for deaths now? We have missed the target of keeping deaths below 20,000? Whitty says the hospital death figure is already above that. He says the all-cause mortality figure will be higher. He says you have to look in the long run, \u201cand this has got a very long way to run\u201d, he says. He says that is why he is very cautious about putting numbers on likely deaths. Q: Will retired NHS staff who have come back to the NHS qualify for these new life assurance payments? Hancock says this is for frontline staff in NHS and social care. And the government is looking at what other groups it might refer to. Q: And if they take this money, that won\u2019t stop people suing for compensation if they feel negligence has been an issue? No, says Hancock. Q: Why are you so keen to get the reproduction number down to 0.5. Prof Neil Ferguson says he thinks the number is between 0.6 and 0.7. Whitty says he has never said the target is 0.5. He has said it is probably in a range between 0.5 and 1, probably around the mid point. He says he has said keeping it below 1 is essential. Above that, the disease will spread at an exponential rate. Q: Are you on track to meet your testing target? Hancock says he is broadly on target. Home testing has been very popular, he says. He says the government wants to make it as easy as possible for people to get these tests. Hancock reads out the first question from a member of the public. It is from Lynne, in Skipton, North Yorkshire. She has not recorded a message, so Hancock reads it out. She says she is missing her grandchildren. Will being able to hug grandchildren be one of the first steps out of lockdown? Hancock invites Whitty to answer. Whitty says it will depend very much on whether Lynne is in a shielded group, and on her age. Hancock says he understands how hard this is for people. And he says this shows how questions from members of the public can be as hard to answer as questions from journalists. Whitty is speaking now, and presenting the daily slides. He starts with the five tests. Next is a slide on transport use. The picture is broadly stable, he says. Whitty says the number of coronavirus cases in hospital is falling. But he says the number of people in critical care is not falling so quickly. Hancock says that, from tomorrow, cancer treatments in the NHS that have been on hold will resume. Hancock also said there had been 360 new coronavirus hospital deaths in the UK. That takes the total UK coronavirus hospital death toll to 21,092, he said. Hancock says families of NHS staff who die during their coronavirus work will get payments worth \u00a360,000. And he says the government is looking at what can be done to help the families of other frontline workers who have died during the crisis. Hancock starts by saying today, for the first time, a member of the public will ask a question. He says this is being introduced in response to strong demand for members of the public to be able to ask a question. It will be selected by a polling organisation, he says. He says he does not know what the question will be. More than 15,000 people submitted questions, he says. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has arrived for the daily government press conference. Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, is also here, along with Stephen Powis, the medical director for NHS England. Here is an analysis from the Centre for Evidence-based Medicine at Oxford University of today\u2019s coronavirus death figures for England. And here is a chart from the report showing death figures on the day they occurred. This is from Mel Stride, the Conservative chair of the Commons Treasury committee, on the Rishi Sunak loans announcement. (See 3.44pm.) The Treasury committee continues to receive evidence that some of the government\u2019s schemes to help businesses get through this difficult time are too complex and too slow. I have called for government to consider 100% guarantees for smaller-sized loans, so the introduction of \u201cBounce Back\u201d loans is extremely welcome. However, the success of the new scheme will still depend on the actions of lenders. It is essential, therefore, that there is full and regular transparency on the progress of this scheme in order to get this further vital lending out the door fast. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has already announced that he will extend the coronavirus job retention scheme, which pays firms to furlough staff on salaries of up to \u00a32,500 per month, until the end of June. But the government has not said what it will do after that. In the Commons, Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, asked if Sunak would adjust the scheme to allow for a \u201cgradual\u201d return to work. Sunak said Brady was making a very interesting suggestion. Sunak said the PM said this morning that there would be \u201cgradual refinements\u201d to the rules, and Sunak said that was how the government would proceed when it removed economic interventions, he said. That seemed a clear hint that, after June, instead of being removed altogether, the furlough scheme might be gradually scaled down. It has been estimated that the scheme will end up costing more than \u00a310bn per month. Here is reaction to the Rishi Sunak loans announcement. (See 3.44pm.) From Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary From George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor From the Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin From the Institute of Directors A coalition of more than 20 justice organisations has written to the lord chancellor asking for the strict, three-month deadline to lodge employment tribunal claims on the grounds of harassment and discrimination to be relaxed during the coronavirus crisis. In a letter to Robert Buckland QC, who is also the justice secretary, the directors of Liberty, Justice, the Law Centres Network, Advice UK, the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice, the Runnymede Trust and other groups are seeking a temporary extension of the time limit to six months. The letter states: The three-month time limit for bringing a discrimination or harassment claim is one of the shortest limitation periods for any kind of civil case. The argument for such a limit \u2013 that it encourages the prompt resolution of workplace disputes \u2013 cannot be maintained in current conditions. The pandemic is making it difficult for those who allege they have been unfairly discriminated against or dismissed to pursue claims. Many law firms have furloughed staff and advice agencies have had to restrict or halt advice clinics during lockdown. The letter adds: As the time limit for harassment and discrimination cases runs from what the tribunal concludes is the last unlawful act, this puts individuals without the benefit of specialist legal advice at a particular disadvantage, as they may not be able to identify when their time will run out ... While judges have a power to extend the time limit when it is \u2018just and equitable,\u2019 this is a high and uncertain bar upon which no prudent claimant would ever rely.\u201d The letter has been coordinated by Suzanne McKie QC, of Farore Law, an expert in employment litigation. She said she had already been contacted during the health crisis by employees who feel they have been chosen unfairly to be furloughed on the basis of race or nationality, and by women who suspect they are not being allowed to work from home because it is alleged they could be distracted by domestic chores. Here are the latest daily coronavirus death figures from Northern Ireland. There have been 10 more deaths, taking the total in Northern Ireland to 309. A foul clump of wet wipes and other unflushable items as heavy as a rottweiler has been dragged from a Thames Water sewer, as the number of blockages the company has to deal with has increased by 8% during lockdown. The grim 40kg bundle had snarled up a temporary pipe in Maidenhead, Berkshire, where Thames Water, the UK\u2019s largest water and wastewater company, has been repairing a collapsed sewer. Engineers are clearing such blockages at least once a week, with each operation taking at least two hours and using up valuable repair time. Releasing the new figures today, Thames Water said it had seen an increase of about 10 sewer blockages per day compared to normal. Many shoppers have been bulk-buying toilet roll as a result of the pandemic, leaving others turning to seemingly harmless alternatives such as wet wipes, tissues, kitchen roll and even newspapers. But these unflushables \u2013 which include nappies, sanitary products and cotton buds \u2013 don\u2019t biodegrade like toilet paper, causing blockages that can lead to flooding and pollution. They can also combine with fats, oils and grease \u2013 increased with people doing more cooking at home \u2013 to create \u201cfatbergs\u201d. The Treasury has posted these tweets from Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, on his new loan scheme. Scientists are aiming to have a Covid-19 antigen test \u2013 which can identify whether people have had the virus \u2013 ready within three months. A consortium of researchers striving to develop a test is working to a three-month timescale to have a test ready for mass production. It comes after a team at Oxford University identified an antigen that is being used as \u201cthe basis of the test\u201d, Dr Mario Gualano, chief executive of BBI Solutions, which is part of the consortium, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He said: So, as a consortium, we\u2019re pulling together the various components of a test. I think the analogy you would use probably is building a car, and in order to do that successfully you have to have all the individual components working very well in their own right, but also crucially making sure that they all work well together in order to deliver the required performance. And without oversimplifying matters, I think in this case we see the antigen is really the engine of the test and we\u2019ll build the rest of the capability around that. On the antigen identified by the Oxford team, he added: \u201cWe believe the antigen is good at picking up convalescent sera, ie serum from people that have been identified and are therefore are assumed to have some sort of immunity. It typically takes nine to 12 months to develop a test like this and we\u2019re looking at really driving that development in a much shorter timeframe.\u201d He said it was difficult to put a specific timeline on the availability of the test, but added: \u201cWe\u2019re certainly working to a timeline of three months, and hoping that we would be able to develop the test and have something available to go into production at that time.\u201d In the Commons, Sunak is summing up what the government has done so far. It has already provided an extra \u00a316bn for the NHS, he says. He says around 500,000 employers have used the coronavirus job retention scheme to pay the wages of more than 4 million workers. And another scheme for the self-employed is being implemented, he says. He lists all the business support schemes already implemented. And he announces a new scheme. Sunak announces new micro-loan scheme for businesses Firms will be able to get loans worth up to 25% of turnover, with a maximum payment of \u00a350,000. The government will pay the interest for the first 12 months, he says. And the government will back them 100%. He describes them as \u201cbounce back\u201d loans, and he says people will be able to apply from Monday next week. There will be no forward-looking eligibility test, he says. Other coronavirus loans offered by the government are only 80% backed by the government. That still exposes banks to 20% of the risk, and it has led to complaints that banks are not lending. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is now making a Commons statement about the economic response to the coronavirus crisis. He is in the Commons chamber, but most of the MPs asking questions will be appearing via Zoom. These are already tough times, and there will be more to come, he says. Sunak says his interventions have saved millions of jobs. But not every job can be saved, he says. He says the most important thing to help the economy is to avoid a second peak, he says. He says the government needs to provide a bridge to the future for business \u201cto maintain the productive capacity of the economy\u201d. He says the IMF has described the government\u2019s response as \u201cright\u201d. He says it has been one of the most comprehensive of any government around the world. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has been giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. Here are some of the main points so far. Gove claimed that the coronavirus crisis could increase the chances of the UK and the EU striking a trade deal this year because it should \u201cconcentrate the minds of EU negotiators\u201d. Responding to a question from Hilary Benn, the committee chairman, about whether the coronavirus crisis altered the chances of the UK and the EU negotiating a trade deal by the end of this year, Gove said: I think the Covid-19 crisis, in some respects, should concentrate the minds of EU negotiators, reinforcing the vital importance of coming to a conclusion. He also said that reaching a deal by the end of the year was \u201centirely possible\u201d. He described the statement put out by Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, at the end of last week\u2019s round of negotiations as \u201crelatively downbeat\u201d (an understatement - you can read it here) and he said he thought the odds on a deal being struck were 2 to 1. He refused to say whether the UK still planned to walk away from the talks if it had not made good progress towards a deal in June. Asked about this, he said he did not want to pre-empt the government\u2019s response. He signalled that David Frost, the PM\u2019s chief Europe adviser, would be willing to give evidence to the committee. They have lost their lives in the duty of helping others stricken by Covid-19. Tomorrow, the nation will fall silent in tribute to key workers, including NHS staff, who have died in the pandemic. Boris Johnson, who survived the disease after being treated in intensive care, will be among those observing a minute\u2019s silence at 11am tomorrow. It is hoped the tribute will be followed nationwide, with government workers asked to take part. It comes after Unison, the largest trade union in the UK, the Royal College of Midwives and the Royal College of Nursing launched a campaign last week for the nation to take a moment to honour frontline staff who have died during the Covid-19 crisis. Between them, the organisations represent more than a million NHS and public service workers including porters, refuse collectors and care staff. According to PA Media, more than 90 frontline NHS workers have died since 25 March, with other lives lost in other key sectors, including private social care and transport. The Guardian has also been chronicling the Covid-19 deaths of healthcare staff. On Monday, the PM\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cWe will be supporting the minute\u2019s silence. We will be asking everybody who works in the Government to take part and we would hope that others will take part nationwide as well.\u201d Dame Donna Kinnair, the chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: \u201cThis moment will bring together a sombre but grateful nation. Whether in nursing or driving buses, our heroes kept going to work when many had the luxury of staying at home. Nobody should go out to work and risk their life. This must not be the last time that sacrifice is recognised. The country and its leaders owes a tremendous debt to these key workers and the many more who are on shift again today.\u201d The Unison general secretary, Dave Prentis, said: \u201cBoris Johnson has seen first-hand how NHS staff are going to remarkable lengths to keep us all safe. The least we can all do tomorrow is spare a moment to pay our respects and show our gratitude to all the key workers who have lost their lives.\u201d Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has been answering coronavirus questions on Instagram. He will get more questions at 5pm, when he is leading for the government at the daily press conference. The country\u2019s biggest betting firms will remove all TV and radio advertising for games and products during the Covid-19 lockdown, amid concern over problem gamblers. Industry body, the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC), said firms have voluntarily agreed to remove all their gaming product advertising for at least six weeks. It comes a week after the government wrote to gambling firms asking them to provide regular updates on how they are tackling problem gambling during the lockdown. It also follows a survey revealing that people who gamble regularly online are doing so just as often or more frequently during the lockdown, despite the lack of sporting fixtures. The BGC said existing TV and radio advertising slots will be replaced by safer gambling messages, donated to charities or removed from broadcast where contracts allow. The BGC chief executive, Michael Dugher, said: From day one of this crisis, we have sought to protect customers potentially at risk, including announcing stepping up safer gambling measures as part of our 10 pledges for Covid-19 in March. This latest move by the regulated industry further underlines our commitment to safer betting and gaming, with many people cut off and feeling anxious. We are determined to do everything we can to protect customers potentially at risk during this lockdown period and beyond - and we are determined to drive the high standards that the public expect from us. I hope others follow our lead. Prompted partly by Boris Johnson\u2019s speech outside Downing Street this morning, Tom McTague has written a powerful and thoughtful article for the Atlantic about the extent to which Johnson\u2019s optimism is an advantage or a disadvantage. Here is an extract, but it is worth reading the whole thing. The next phase of the crisis plays to some of Johnson\u2019s strengths more obviously than the previous ones have, but also to some of his weaknesses. For example, Johnson has, [Johnson\u2019s biographer Andrew] Gimson told me, always preferred doing \u201ca lot of things imperfectly than one thing perfectly,\u201d choosing to press ahead on the basis of imperfect information rather than waiting until all the facts are clear. In the days and weeks ahead, this carries the risk of overreaching and overpromising \u2013 of moving too quickly based on information that confirms things he wants to be true, but might not be. Of course, this is also a reality of being in charge: As Henry Kissinger has observed, the skill of leadership is to make marginal decisions with imperfect information before others are comfortable doing so, taking a calculated gamble and being willing to stand alone first. Today, the reality of the situation is that when Johnson was admitted to the hospital on 5 April, the death toll in Britain was 4,934. Today, as he returns to work, after a week of emergency medical care and a fortnight of rest, the number of fatalities exceeds 20,000. His challenge is now to show that he can still shape the future \u2013 that optimism can inspire, character matters, and his is an asset, not a liability. People undergoing fertility treatment will be able to freeze embryos, eggs and sperm for an extra two years so that they are not unfairly caught out by the Covid-19 pandemic. Current storage limits are set at 10 years, at which point people must decide if they want to undergo fertility treatment, or have their frozen eggs, sperm and embryos destroyed. But ministers do not want patients to be \u201cunfairly caught out\u201d after procedures were paused earlier this month due to Covid-19. The time limits will be extended to give time for treatments to resume, the Department of Health said. The health minister Lord Bethell said: Many people rely on fertility treatment as their only hope to start a family and the current pandemic means some will have to put their hopes on hold. We are taking steps to ensure during these extraordinary times those that have embryos, sperm or eggs stored as part of their treatment are not unfairly caught out by the existing storage limits and have the best possible opportunity to start their family in the future. It comes as the Guardian today reports on women whose IVF treatments have been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. According to research by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UCL London and the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany, published today, the peak for coronavirus hospital deaths in England was probably passed on 8 April. Here is an extract from the news release. The researchers found that there has been a clear downward trend in numbers of people dying from Covid-19 in hospitals in England since 8 April, with London seeming to have the clearest pattern of decline compared to the rest of England. However, deaths among people aged less than 60 years only appear to have peaked on April 11. Data produced by the Intensive Care National Audit &amp; Research Centre suggests that up to 16 April only 3% of patients admitted to critical care were aged over 80 years, while overall this group of older people made up 52% of all deaths with Covid-19 in hospitals. This compares to those aged 40-59 years, who made up 39% of admissions to critical care units, but only constituted 8% of all hospital deaths ... Among the elderly aged 80 or more years there was a peak of deaths on April 8, but there is far less evidence of a subsequent sustained decline in numbers of deaths in this group. Prof David Leon, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who led the research, said: The fact a peak may have been reached on April 8 is not an argument for relaxing social contact. In fact, the opposite. Communicating clearly to the public that there has been a peak in mortality at the end of the first week of April might motivate people to persevere with the lockdown as they will then appreciate the sacrifices being made in lockdowns are paying off. At her news conference Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said that \u201cin the coming days\u201d she would be saying more about the different options for relaxing the lockdown, and \u201chow we\u2019re going about assessing those\u201d. The Scottish government has already published a document (pdf) explaining in outline what principles it will apply as it moves to ease physical distancing, and Sturgeon\u2019s comment will be seen as putting pressure on London to match her level of policy candour. NHS England has reported an extra 329 coronavirus hospital deaths, taking the total to 18,749. It says that patients were aged between 29 and 100 years old and that 22 of the 329 patients (aged between 29 and 89 years old) had no known underlying health condition. The full set of data for today is available here (pdf). The 329 figure is much lower than other recent daily figures have been. The equivalent daily figure announced on Saturday was 711. This will partly be explained by the weekend, because the number of deaths reported on Saturdays and Sundays always tends to be lower than during the week, because of staffing levels. There have been another eight coronavirus deaths in Wales, where the total is now 796, according to the latest figures from Public Health Wales. A total of 1,262 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by 13 from 1,249 on Sunday, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, announced at her news conference earlier. She said 10,521 people have now tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 197 from 10,324 the day before. There are 134 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms, an increase of one on Sunday, she added. The latest daily figures from Scotland are here. They are fortunate to have survived where others have tragically fallen victim to Covid-19. Now patients who have recovered from the disease are giving back by donating their blood plasma in a bid to help treat others infected with the virus. Around 6,000 people who tested positive for coronavirus have signed up to donate their blood plasma, including more than 500 people who were admitted to hospital. The plasma from former patients \u2013 rich in the antibodies that develop as somebody recovers from an illness \u2013 will be transfused into people who are seriously ill with Covid-19 and struggling to develop their own antibodies. Photos issued by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) show former patients giving their blood plasma at Tooting Blood Donor Centre, London, in a process known as plasmapheresis, which uses a machine similar to that used in regular blood platelet donation. The number of antibodies rises steadily in the bloodstream of those who have been ill and is thought to peak between 21 and 28 days after recovery. Donors must have tested positive for the illness either at home or in hospital, but should now be three to four weeks into their recovery, ideally 29 days. A donation session takes around 45 minutes to give two units of plasma, and can be repeated as regularly as every fortnight. More from an earlier post, as my colleague Denis Campbell reports that children are falling ill with a new and potentially fatal combination of symptoms apparently linked to Covid-19, including a sore stomach and heart problems. The children affected appear to have been struck by a form of toxic shock syndrome, he reports. Some have been left so seriously unwell that they have had to be treated in intensive care. At least one has undergone extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment, which is used when someone\u2019s life is at risk because they can no longer breathe for themselves. In a letter to GPs in north London, reported by Health Service Journal, NHS bosses said: There is a growing concern that a Sars-CoV-2-related inflammatory syndrome is emerging in children in the UK, or that there may be another, as yet unidentified, infectious pathogen associated with these cases.\u201d You can read the story here. More from the news earlier that the names of some of the experts on the scientific group advising the UK government\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis will be published, as Downing Street confirms it will happen \u201cin the coming days\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s right that only the names of those who wish to disclose their participation will be published,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said. This is to safeguard the personal security for the individuals and to protect them from lobbying which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice.\u201d The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) advice documents and evidence are expected to be published some time this week, he added. It comes after the Guardian revealed the involvement of the prime minister\u2019s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, in meetings of Sage. Cummings\u2019 attendance and participation in the group\u2019s meetings raised questions about the independence of its scientific advice. There was also an interesting line on Brexit at the No 10 lobby briefing. Downing Street said there would have to be \u201cpolitical movement on the EU side\u201d for the talks with the EU on a post-Brexit trade deal to succeed. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman was responding to Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, claiming last week that the UK was running down the clock in the negotiations. The spokesman said the government did not accept this. He went on: We are ready to keep talking but that does not make us any more likely to agree the EU\u2019s proposals in areas where they are not taking into account the UK\u2019s status as an independent state. All we are seeking is an agreement based on precedent which respects the sovereignty of both sides. Clearly there will need to be political movement on the EU side to move negotiations forward, particularly on fisheries and level playing field issues, in order to help find a balanced solution which reflects the political realities on both sides. Good news for fans of vegan sausage rolls, as Greggs becomes the latest highstreet retailer to announce plans to reopen stores during the lockdown. The bakery chain is due to reopen a small number of stores for takeaway and delivery after shutting all its sites due to the pandemic. It comes after firms such as B&amp;Q have reopened their doors to shoppers, while John Lewis has said it hopes to reopen all its shops next month. Rival chains, including Burger King, Pret a Manger and KFC, have already reopened a small number of sites for takeaway and delivery. It is understood that Leon is due to reopen six of its restaurants for delivery and click-and-collect, in addition to the 16 it has kept open to sell groceries. The boss of the bakery chain has told staff it plans to open 20 stores in the Newcastle area from Monday 4 May as part of a \u201ccontrolled trial\u201d. Roger Whiteside, the chief executive, said he hoped the trial would inform the business about what changes needed to be made to operate safely and meet physical distancing guidelines. He said he believed the trial, which will involve a limited product range and shorter trading hours, would take at least two weeks. In a letter to staff, Whiteside said he hoped to open around 700 stores, including 150 franchise shops, with new operational measures in place from 8 June. He said: We expect it will only be possible to open this many shops if the government has taken a first step in relaxing the lockdown, which could be to open the schools. This timing may change depending on future government announcements. The Downing Street lobby briefing has just finished. Here are the main coronavirus-related points. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said that the government would not be able to say on Thursday whether or not it had met the target of reaching 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month. Thursday is the last day of April. But the spokesman said that it took a while to get information about how many tests were carried out on a particular day. He said: We are not going to be able to tell on Thursday of this week whether or not we have met the 100,000 target. It will take a little while longer for that to be clear. He said that even on Friday it might not be \u201cdifficult\u201d to say whether the target had been hit. He said it took 72 hours for the results of home testing kits to be delivered, \u201cand therefore show up in the numbers\u201d. The spokesman said that government now has the capacity to carry out 53,000 tests per day. The most recent daily figures show more than 29,000 tests being carried out. The spokesman said that more than 40 drive-through testing centres are now open. He said there would be 48 by the end of the month, as well as 96 mobile testing sites by early May. Boris Johnson is due to speak to Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, this week about the coronavirus crisis, the spokesman said. The spokesman said that this would follow Johnson\u2019s declaration this morning that he wanted to work with the opposition parties on policies around relaxing the lockdown. (See 11.04am.) Johnson is also planning to speak to all opposition parties next week, the spokesman said. The spokesman confirmed that members of Sage, the scientific advisory group for emergencies, who are happy to be named as members of the committee, will soon have their names disclosed. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, also revealed this at a separate briefing this morning. (See 12.08pm.) The spokesman said that another tranche of evidence from Sage submitted to the government about coronavirus would be published this week. The spokesman refused to say whether Johnson anticipated the fight against coronavirus entering a third phase after the \u201csecond phase\u201d mentioned by the PM in his speech this morning. (See 11.04am.) Asked how many phases there would be, the spokesman said he was \u201cnot in a position to answer that question\u201d. The spokesman was unable to cite any evidence to justify a claim from Dominic Raab in an interview yesterday saying that deaths in care homes were going down. The spokesman said Johnson was back at work \u201cfull time\u201d now. Asked if that is what his doctors advised, the spokesman said he had been following their advice throughout. But the spokesman was unable to confirm that Johnson would be doing PMQs on Wednesday. But he said Johnson would be chairing cabinet this week, on Thursday. The spokesman said the government would not be involved in choosing the daily question submitted from a member of the public to be taken at the regular press conference. (See 11.30am.) A polling company (YouGov) will choose the questions. Matt Hancock will hold today\u2019s daily press conference, the spokesman said. He will be with Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Prof John Newton from Public Health England, who is described by No 10 as the government\u2019s \u201ctesting tsar\u201d. The spokesman said that the Department for Health and Social Care would be issuing statement later in response to a report from Health Service Journal saying doctors are concerned about a small number of children affected by a coronavirus-related syndrome. Here is the report. The British Hollywood actor Riz Ahmed has revealed he has lost two family members to Covid-19, as he warns about the impact of the pandemic on minorities across the world. The actor and rapper, who said the outbreak is \u201creflecting and revealing the faultlines in our society\u201d, added that he hopes the surge of appreciation for the NHS draws attention to prejudice against the people from ethnic minorities who keep it running. \u201cI\u2019m seeing reports of India, where the government are calling it \u2018corona-jihad\u2019 and they\u2019re trying to blame it on the spread of Muslims and they are segregating hospitals between Muslims and non-Muslims,\u201d he told GQ Hype. \u201cTrump is using it as an excuse to try to ban immigration and the Hungarian government is centralising power off the back of this. \u201cI\u2019m looking at the fact it\u2019s hitting African-Americans twice as hard; I\u2019m looking at the fact that 50% of NHS frontline workers \u2013 is it 50%? \u2013 are ethnic minorities.\u201d Referring to the viral video of Clap For Me Now \u2013 which features UK residents and people of foreign heritage reciting an anti-racist poem - he compared it to his latest album, in which he symbolically broke up with Britain. He said: It\u2019s almost like there is an alternate ending to The Long Goodbye! I\u2019ve walked off, but Britney\u2019s [a stand-in for Britain] called me back again. Britannia\u2019s saying: \u2018I need you! Come back!\u2019 She\u2019s saying: \u2018We need you frontline staff. We need you Uber drivers. We need you shelf stackers.\u2019 Who are the people who, for every moment of crisis in this country, have kept this country together? It\u2019s the people at the bottom of the barrel; the people being hit hardest by this pandemic. We say we love the NHS more than the royal family, more than the army, but do we love the people who keep the NHS alive? Because every time we tell people to f*** off back to where they came from, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re saying. So I really hope that this revelation, this awakening, opens our minds to that reality, to the stupidity of our prejudice. He added: \u201cI have lost two family members to Covid. I just want to believe their deaths and all the others aren\u2019t for nothing. We gotta step up to re-imagine a better future.\u201d He likened the pandemic to an alien invasion. \u201cIt\u2019s bringing humanity together against the common enemy. So there is this potential for this momentous, unique-in-the-history-of-our-species moment, of us all going through this crazy challenge together and only being able to get through this together. \u201cAnd yet, in the midst of that, insofar as any crisis is a mirror, reflecting your priorities and patterns, this crisis is reflecting and revealing the faultlines in our society, the broken records that are stuck in our head, the f***eries and the power plays that are still dominating how we are running our planet, the rising intolerance.\u201d A new NHS Nightingale hospital is to officially open in Bristol today, providing up to 300 intensive care beds for coronavirus patients. The facility, based at the University of the West of England\u2019s Frenchay campus, is one of seven Nightingale hospitals to be set up around the country. The opening comes amid criticism that the flagship 4,000-bed Nightingale hospital in east London is well under capacity and is becoming a \u201cwhite elephant\u201d. The Guardian revealed last week that dozens of patients with Covid-19 had been turned away from the new hospital because it had too few nurses to treat them. Until a week ago it had treated just 41 patients. The new Bristol hospital will be opened by the Earl of Wessex, who will be joined by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, via video link. Run by North Bristol NHS trust, the hospital will provide 300 fully ventilated beds if local services require them. This is six times the intensive care capacity of a large hospital in the south-west. Tomorrow, London\u2019s Nightingale hospital will hold a minute\u2019s silence at 11am for health and other key workers who have died from Covid-19. Councils are facing a funding shortfall of up to \u00a39.6bn as a result of the coronavirus crisis and some are considering axing services, town hall leaders have told MPs on the Commons housing and communities select committee. Additional spending, particularly on social care, and reductions in increasingly important commercial incomes mean they may need a central government bailout four times higher than the \u00a33.2bn already announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, according to Cllr James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association (LGA). The assessment of the shortfall is derived from a survey of councils carried out in April by the government, to which 98% of councils responded. Many councils rely on commercial investments. Luton borough council relies on a multi-million pound income from its shareholding in Luton airport to shore up the finances. Incomes from these have been hit hard by the lockdown. \u201cWe need the cast iron guarantee that we will be funded to the amount we are delivering to our communities,\u201d Jamieson said. The LGA told MPs that some councils were actively considering issuing section 114 notices to freeze some spending and limit council expenditure to essential services only, but said that none of these had been triggered yet. In response to Boris Johnson\u2019s speech, Sir Ed Davey, the acting Liberal Democrat leader, said: The prime minister has said that he will work with opposition parties as we enter the next phase and we welcome that. Liberal Democrats want to understand why, so long into this crisis, we still have carers on the frontline without the protection they need to keep them safe, and how the UK has fallen behind so many other countries in testing and tracing. We want to see the details of the government\u2019s plan for how they will rectify these crises. Barristers in England and Wales have gone from working on average 50 hours a week to only 18 hours now, a survey has found, with more than half of self-employed counsel reporting they will not be able to survive financially if the lockdown lasts six months. The snapshot of legal opinion comes as the courts enter their second month of closure with only a few urgent hearings continuing and a small number of online cases being dealt with through remote video sessions. The survey by the Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, reveals that Covid-19 is having a devastating effect on the profession\u2019s sustainability due to the abrupt drop-off in hearings and other legal work. The research also showed that the financial impact of Covid-19 is greater on barristers from BAME or state school backgrounds. The survey found that: 65% of self-employed barristers who responded had had a reduction in work: the typical barrister has gone from working more than 50 hours a week to working fewer than 18 hours a week. 53% of self-employed barristers cannot survive six months and 74% cannot survive a year. 31% of criminal barristers will not be able to continue to practise within three months; 69% will not last six months and 88% will no longer be practising within a year. 83% of young barristers (those in the first seven years of practice) cannot survive a year. 7% think access to justice is currently acceptable; 77% of self-employed barristers say people are now unable to properly access justice. Amanda Pinto QC, the chair of the Bar Council, said: Barristers and others involved in the justice system are rightly classed as key workers by the government because they are essential to ensuring that justice continues to be delivered for the public despite the pandemic. A threat to the barristers\u2019 profession survival is a threat to the future of our justice system. We can\u2019t bury our heads in the sand and ignore the ramifications this virus has for the future of justice which affects the public in a direct way, day in, day out. Legal issues cannot be put off indefinitely. If we fall into the trap of routinely delaying hearings, adding to the ever-growing backlog of cases, and taking work away from those whose livelihoods depend on it, we might very well find there are no barristers left to help pick up the pieces of the justice system after the crisis subsides. The names of some of the experts on the scientific group advising the UK government\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis will be published shortly, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser has said. It comes after the Guardian revealed the involvement of the prime minister\u2019s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, in meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Cummings\u2019 attendance and participation in the group\u2019s meetings raised questions about the independence of its scientific advice. After mounting pressure on Downing Street to disclose more details about the group \u2013 whose membership and advice the government has kept secret \u2013 Sir Patrick Vallance told a briefing for science journalists that the identities of the experts are usually revealed after the emergency is over, and that had also been the advice for the coronavirus crisis. \u201cBut I believe that we should be more prepared to publish names sooner, and intend to do so shortly,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we will be publishing names of those that are happy to have their names published.\u201d The group would also release a list of the documents, and eventually the documents themselves, that have fed into Sage meetings, he added. The Guardian also revealed that Ben Warner, who worked with Cummings on the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit, had attended Sage meetings. Downing Street insists there is nothing untoward about the pair\u2019s attendance at Sage meetings, saying they are largely taking part as silent observers. However, one attendee of Sage told the Guardian they felt Cummings\u2019 interventions had sometimes inappropriately influenced what is supposed to be an impartial scientific process. A second attendee said they were shocked when Cummings first began participating in Sage discussions, in February, because they believed the group should be providing \u201cunadulterated scientific data\u201d without any political input. A loophole in Ireland\u2019s lockdown laws means police cannot detain visitors from Northern Ireland, raising concern that some people may cross the border and defy physical distancing regulations. Garda\u00ed have been ordered not to arrest anyone from Northern Ireland because they have no powers of enforcement over people who do not live in the republic, RT\u00c9 reported. The disclosure prompted concern from politicians and residents in Donegal and other border counties that Northern Ireland residents frustrated at the UK\u2019s continued lockdown may visit holiday homes and tour beauty spots in the republic. Residents in the republic are chafing at a ban on travelling more than 2km from home and would bristle at any sign of cross-border visitors taking advantage of the loophole. Sinn F\u00e9in said the loophole reinforced the need for an all-island response to the coronavirus pandemic. The party has also cited the UK\u2019s higher death rate as further reason for an all-Ireland approach. The Ulster Unionist party accused Sinn F\u00e9in of \u201cperverse\u201d political point-scoring. The Royal Mint is to make 1.9m medical visors for the NHS in England and Wales to help protect medical workers. The South Wales based firm \u2013 best-known for manufacturing coins and investment products \u2013 has transformed its visitor attraction into an emergency production line to produce more than 100,000 medical visors a week exclusively for the NHS. The Royal Mint began making medical visors last month, after engineers created a design in just 48 hours and became the first firm in the UK to secure BSI safety approval. It has worked with its supply chain across the UK \u2013 including Brammer, TJ Morgan and Technical Foam \u2013 to source the materials to mass manufacture the design. More than 150,000 medical visors have already been made, with further supplies reaching hospitals across Britain shortly. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, who is also master of the Mint, said: It\u2019s vital our brave NHS workers have the protective equipment they need to safely care for those affected by the coronavirus outbreak. I applaud the Royal Mint for refocusing their efforts and working round the clock to play their part during this national emergency. Anne Jessopp, chief executive of the Royal Mint, said: When people think of the Royal Mint they think about the coins in their pockets, but we\u2019ve been making useful products for the nation for 1,100 years and have a team of skilled designers, engineers and production staff. Together they turned a rudimentary visor design into a working model in just 48 hours, and within a week we were manufacturing thousands every day. The family of a veteran NHS doctor who died after contracting Covid-19 have paid tribute to him as an \u201chonest, kind and generous man who was deeply respected\u201d. Dr Kamlesh Kumar Masson, who worked for the NHS for 47 years, died earlier this month, aged 78. His family, who described him as someone who \u201cwould have wanted to practise medicine for many more years to come\u201d, said he last worked on 12 March, adding that his career \u201ccame to an unexpected end last month, when he unfortunately contracted Covid-19\u201d. The doctor, who died on 16 April, founded Milton Road Surgery in Grays, Essex, in 1985 and worked there until 2017, after which he did locum work across Thurrock and Basildon. His family also described him as \u201can excellent clinician whose drive to constantly improve his clinical skills and knowledge with passion and enthusiasm will remain with us all as a reminder to always try to be the best\u201d. They said: Dr Masson was an honest, kind and generous man who was deeply respected by anyone who was privileged to cross paths with him. He was jovial, funny and kind, always wanting to make the best of any situation.\u201d He was well-known locally and recognised as a \u201cdedicated, determined, positive individual who would always do his utmost to help in all endeavours\u201d, they added. The family thanked the staff at University College London hospital who \u201cfought tirelessly\u201d to try to save him. Masson completed his medical training in India and also worked as a doctor in east Africa. He worked in different parts of the UK before settling in Essex in 1975. Masson is among a number of NHS and private healthcare staff, from heart surgeons to nurses, porters and volunteers, who have lost their lives to coronavirus in the UK. The Guardian has been chronicling their deaths here. Earlier this year Boris Johnson experimented with holding a \u201cpeople\u2019s PMQs\u201d on Facebook on Wednesday afternoons. Generally they were dreadful and, with coronavirus becoming a more serious issue in February and early March, No 10 seemed happy to abandon them. But the concept of getting Johnson to respond directly to questions from members of the public has not been abandoned, and No 10 is now inviting non-journalists to submit questions for the afternoon press conference. One question will be selected every day (alongside the questions from journalists), and the questioner will be invited to record a video, or to just submit their question in writing. You can apply to take part here. One drawback is that questions have to be submitted by midday. At that point we don\u2019t normally know who will be holding the press conference. (Hopefully this is just an exercise in transparency and accountability, although some journalists may worry that this is early evidence of the resurgence of the \u201cwar on the Westminster lobby\u201d that some in No 10 were merrily engaged in before the coronavirus crisis took hold.) He\u2019s better known for playing gangsters or superhero villains on the big screen, but Tom Hardy is adopting a different role during the coronavirus lockdown. The Hollywood hard man will read a CBeebies bedtime story urging children to remember their loved ones are always with them, even if they cannot hug them because of social distancing. It is a far cry from the 42-year-old actor\u2019s roles playing the Kray twins in the film Legend, or Batman\u2019s nemesis, Bain, in the Dark Knight Rises. But it\u2019s not the first time he has appeared on the children\u2019s TV channel, with the star first reading a story to children in 2016 \u2013 his stories have been requested more than 1m times on BBC iPlayer. Hardy will read a new story each day from 27 April to 1 May, with the date of a sixth story yet to be confirmed. On Monday, he will read Hug Me, by Simona Ciraolo, about a young cactus called Felipe who really needs a hug, but his family \u201cjust isn\u2019t the touchy-feely kind\u201d so he sets off to find a friend. He will open the story by saying: \u201cHello. I\u2019m Tom. Sometimes, on a day like this, I feel strong and happy. But on other days, I just need somebody to give me a hug. Tonight\u2019s bedtime story is all about a little cactus called Felipe, who just wants a hug too.\u201d Finishing the story, he will tell the channel\u2019s young viewers: \u201cSo, in the end Felipe found someone to hug. It\u2019s not always possible to hug the ones that you love. But they\u2019re always there, in your heart. It\u2019s time for bed. Off you go and I look forward to seeing you again for another bedtime story. Good night.\u201d CBeebies Bedtime Story is at 6.50pm on CBeebies and on BBC iPlayer. Boris Johnson identifies with Churchill and even wrote a book about him (mediocre on Churchill, extremely revealing about Johnson himself), and it was hard to listen to this without hearing some echo of Churchill\u2019s El Alamein speech. \u201cNow this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\u201d Johnson\u2019s own words won\u2019t be remembered in the way Churchill\u2019s are, but he was telling the nation this morning that it is reaching a turning point of sorts. He was also, in subtle ways, re-defining the terms of engagement. Here are the main points from the speech. Johnson said it was too soon to ease the lockdown measures now. Although he acknowledged the pressure to relax the rules, he said this was also a moment of \u201cmaximum risk\u201d. This is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle [coronavirus] to the floor, and so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity. This is the moment when we can press home our advantage. It is also the moment of maximum risk, because I know that there will be many people looking now at our apparent success and beginning to wonder whether now is the time to go easy on those social distancing measures. See 9.56pm for more on this argument. He said the UK was now \u201cbeginning to turn the tide\u201d. There were \u201creal signs now that we are passing through the peak\u201d, he said. He said: Thanks to your forbearance, your good sense your altruism, your spirit of community, thanks to our collective national resolve, we are on the brink of achieving that first clear mission to prevent our National Health Service from being overwhelmed in a way that tragically we have seen elsewhere. And that is how and why we are now beginning to turn the tide. This was Johnson effectively saying he remains committed to the prediction he made on 19 March (five and a half weeks ago) when he said the UK would \u201cturn the tide within the next 12 weeks\u201d. But Johnson also effectively re-defined \u201cturning the tide\u201d, saying that the UK was now near the point where it could move from \u201cthe first phase\u201d to the \u201csecond phase\u201d. Last month, when he made his \u201cturning the tide\u201d prediction, Johnson said: I think, looking at it all, that we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks and I\u2019m absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this country. Now no one is talking about sending coronavirus packing (Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, said last week coronavirus \u201cis not going to be eradicated\u201d) and Johnson said the aims in phase one were to ensure the NHS did not get overwhelmed and to \u201cflatten the peak\u201d of the curve. Johnson said that in the second phase lockdown restrictions would start to be lifted - but only \u201cgradually\u201d. He said: We are meeting our five tests: deaths falling; NHS protected; rate of infection down; really sorting out the challenges of testing and PPE; avoiding a second peak. Then that will be the time to move on to the second phase, in which we continue to suppress the disease and keep the reproduction rate, the r rate, down, but begin gradually to refine the economic and social restrictions and one by one to fire up the engines of this vast UK economy. He refused to make any predictions about what restrictions might be lifted, or when. He said: In that process [moving to phase two] difficult judgments will be made and we simply cannot spell out now how fast or slow or even when those changes will be made, though clearly the government will be saying much more about this in the coming days. He also avoided any prediction about life returning to normal, or even the \u201cnew normal\u201d, as ministers call it now. He said that he wanted to build \u201cthe biggest possible consensus\u201d about how and when to relax the lockdown measures. He said: I want to serve notice now that these decisions [about relaxing lockdown measures] will be taken with the maximum possible transparency and I want to share all our working and our thinking, my thinking, with you the British people. And of course, we will be relying as ever on the science to inform us, as we have from the beginning. But we will also be reaching out to build the biggest possible consensus, across business, across industry, across all parts of our United Kingdom, across party lines, bringing in opposition parties as far as we possibly can, because I think that is no less than what the British people would expect. In some ways this was the most novel element in the speech. In the three weeks while Johnson has been off work, Dominic Raab, who has been deputising for him, has not given this sort of commitment. The Scottish government (here) and the Welsh government (here) have both published discussion papers about the issues to be considered as the lockdown gets lifted and Downing Street may be stung by the criticism that it is not consulting the public properly in a similar way. A good example is this statement from the Nuffield Council on Bioethics at the weekend. It says citizens\u2019 assemblies should be used to help determine the path forward. Johnson claimed that preparations were underway for the easing of the lockdown. He said: I can tell you now that preparations are under way, and have been for weeks, to allow us to win phase two of this fight, as I believe we are now on track to prevail in phase one. He did not elaborate, but he will have been referring to things like the ramping up of testing, and the introduction of contact tracing system. He presented the government\u2019s fight against coronavirus so far as a success. He said: We defied so many predictions. We did not run out of ventilators or ICU beds, we did not allow our NHS to collapse, and on the contrary we have so far collectively shielded our NHS so that our incredible doctors and nurses and healthcare staff have been able to shield all of us from an outbreak that would have been far worse, and we collectively flattened the peak. This is one interpretation of events. An alternative view is that the UK has one of the worst coronavirus death rates in Europe, perhaps because it implemented the lockdown later than other countries, and that the government has been behind the curve in implementing testing and stockpiling PPE. Johnson stressed that he understood the pressure from business for the lockdown to be eased. He said: So let me say directly also to British business, to the shopkeepers, to the entrepreneurs, to the hospitality sector, to everyone on whom our economy depends: I understand your impatience, I share your anxiety, and I know that without our private sector without the drive and commitment of the wealth creators of this country there will be no economy to speak of, there will be no cash to pay for our public services no way of funding our NHS, and yes I can see the long term consequences of lock down as clearly as anyone. This passage seemed to be addressed in particular to Johnson\u2019s colleagues in the Conservative party. \u201cI still a free-market Tory,\u201d he was telling them - while failing to offer them any actual concessions on policy. He depicted coronavirus as a mugger. He said: If this virus were a physical assailant, an unexpected and invisible mugger, which I can tell you from personal experience it is, then this is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor, and so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity, this is the moment when we can press home our advantage. He thanks the public for their contribution so far. He said: Once again, I want to thank you, the people of this country, for the sheer grit and guts, you have shown and are continuing to show. Every ministerial public statement now contains a passage of thanks to the public like this. He ended by saying the UK could come out of this stronger. He said: If we can show the same spirit of unity and determination as we have all shown in the past six weeks, then I have absolutely no doubt that we will beat it together, we will come through this all the faster, and the United Kingdom, will emerge stronger than ever before. Johnson speeches almost always contain passage of evidence-free utopianism like this one. At a press conference last month he said he was often accused of being \u201cunnecessarily boosterish\u201d. Today\u2019s speech showed that, despite his illness, he has not really changed. The coronavirus pandemic is likely to be followed by even more deadly and destructive disease outbreaks unless their root cause \u2013 the rampant destruction of the natural world \u2013 is rapidly halted, the world\u2019s leading biodiversity experts have warned. \u201cThere is a single species responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 us,\u201d they said. \u201cRecent pandemics are a direct consequence of human activity, particularly our global financial and economic systems that prize economic growth at any cost. We have a small window of opportunity, in overcoming the challenges of the current crisis, to avoid sowing the seeds of future ones.\u201d Professors Josef Settele, Sandra D\u00edaz and Eduardo Brondizio led the most comprehensive planetary health check ever undertaken, which was published in 2019 by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). It concluded that human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth\u2019s natural life-support systems. Read the full story here: The full text of Boris Johnson\u2019s speech is now here, on the No 10 website. Here is the key extract from Boris Johnson\u2019s speech. It sums up his message; although he understands why people want to relax the lockdown, now would be too soon, he says. (For the sake of speed, I am posting this verbatim from the No 10 transcript. As you can see, despite being one of the best-paid newspaper columnists in the UK before becoming PM, Johnson does not seem to have mastered punctuation.) He said: I can see the long term consequences of lock down as clearly as anyone and so yes I entirely share your urgency it\u2019s the government\u2019s urgency and yet we must also recognise the risk of a second spike the risk of losing control of that virus and letting the reproduction rate go back over one because that would mean not only a new wave of death and disease but also an economic disaster and we would be forced once again to slam on the brakes across the whole country and the whole economy and reimpose restrictions in such a way as to do more and lasting damage and so I know it is tough and I want to get this economy moving as fast as I can but I refuse to throw away all the effort and the sacrifice of the British people and to risk a second major outbreak and huge loss of life and the overwhelming of the NHS and I ask you to contain your impatience because I believe we are coming now to the end of the first phase of this conflict and in spite of all the suffering we have so nearly succeeded Some uplifting news now. Captain Tom Moore, the 99-year-old who has raised more than \u00a329m for the NHS by walking laps of his garden, is to be honoured with a postmark. Royal Mail will stamp all letters sent between today and Friday with a message to celebrate the world war two veteran\u2019s 100th birthday. Post will be marked with: \u201cHappy 100th Birthday Captain Thomas Moore NHS fundraising hero 30th April 2020.\u201d Moore, from Bedfordshire, has extended his challenge to completing 200 laps of his 25m-long garden after finishing the first 100 laps ahead of schedule. On Friday, he became the oldest person ever to top the UK singles charts after his duet with Michael Ball went to number one. Their cover of You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone has sold more than 82,000 copies, with proceeds going to the NHS Charities Together Fund. An urgent alert issued to doctors has raised concerns that a serious coronavirus-related syndrome may be emerging in children in the UK. The alert states that in the past three weeks there has been a rise in children being admitted to hospital with a syndrome that has the characteristics of serious Covid-19, according to the Health Service Journal. Children have so far been deemed to be at low risk of serious ill health from the virus. The alert states: \u201c[In the] last three weeks, there has been an apparent rise in the number of children of all ages presenting with a multi-system inflammatory state requiring intensive care across London and also in other regions of the UK. \u201cThere is a growing concern that a [Covid-19] related inflammatory syndrome is emerging in children in the UK, or that there may be another, as yet unidentified, infectious pathogen associated with these cases.\u201d There is little information about how widespread the condition is but the number of children affected is likely to be small, the HSJ reports. Some of the children have tested positive for Covid-19, and some appear to have previously had the virus, it adds. The alert, first issued to GPs in north London, also describes the cases as showing features of toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease, which causes blood vessels to become inflamed. It advised doctors to \u201crefer children presenting with these symptoms as a matter of urgency\u201d. The Paediatric Intensive Care Society issued a separate \u201curgent alert\u201d on Sunday evening. Last week, doctors at the Children\u2019s National hospital in Washington DC said they had seen significant numbers of children admitted with coronavirus, with more than a quarter of them requiring admission, including critical care. Here is our colleague Kate Proctor\u2019s story about Boris Johnson\u2019s speech. And this is how it starts. Boris Johnson has said the UK is \u201cturning the tide\u201d on tackling coronavirus but is still facing a moment of \u201cmaximum risk\u201d and will not be forced to end the lockdown prematurely. Here is some reaction to Boris Johnson\u2019s speech from journalists and commentators on Twitter. From Piers Morgan, the Good Morning Britain presenter From the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson From Good Morning Britain\u2019s Anne Alexander From Michael White, the Guardian\u2019s former political editor From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh From our colleague Owen Jones From the Times\u2019s Matt Chorley Johnson says the government should only ease up on the lockdown when it is confident there will be no second peak. He says he wants \u201cmaximum transparency\u201d about how the decisions to relax restrictions are taken. He says he wants to involve the opposition parties as much as possible. He says measures are in place to win \u201cphase two\u201d, just as the UK is winning phase one. He says if the UK can show the same sense of optimism shown by Capt Tom Moore, we will come through this. And that\u2019s it. He has finished. We will post a full transcript, and analysis, shortly. Johnson says the progress being made against the virus is why people might be tempted to ease up now. But now is not the moment, he says. He says he understands the worries of shopkeepers, entrepreneurs, and everyone in business. He knows why they think that, without an economy, there will be no way of funding the NHS. He says he shares their urgency. Yet we must also recognise the risk of a second spike ... and letting the reproduction rate go back over one. That would risk a \u201cdisaster\u201d, he says. He says that would cause lasting damage to the economy. And so he refuses to throw that away, he says. I ask you to contain you impatience because I believe now we are coming to the end of the first phase of this conflict. Johnson says the country is making progress. There are real signs we are \u201cpassing through the peak\u201d, he says. He says the UK has stopped the NHS being overwhelmed. He says that is why he can say we are beginning to turn the tide. He says if the virus is a mugger - and he can say from personal experience it is - this is the moment when we are beginning to wrestle it to the floor. Boris Johnson starts by saying he is sorry to have been away from his desk for longer than he wanted. He thanks Dominic Raab for stepping up. But he wants to thank the public, he says. He says this is the biggest challenge the country has faced since the war. A lectern has been set up outside the door to No 10. Sky\u2019s Kay Burley thinks the statement from Boris Johnson is coming \u201cshortly\u201d. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the rest of the day. With Boris Johnson back at work at Downing Street this morning, the broadcasters have been told to expect him to make a TV statement this morning. From the BBC\u2019s political editor Laura Kuenssberg From Sky\u2019s political editor Beth Rigby People working in some of Britain\u2019s tourist hotspots will be the worst hit by the expected wave of unemployment following the coronavirus pandemic, according to economic forecasters. Workers in areas including the Lake District, Cornwall and Yorkshire beauty spots are at the highest risk of being left jobless, according to research by the Royal Society of Arts and Manufacturing. Those living in London, south-east England and the knowledge economies of Oxford and Cambridge are the least likely to lose their livelihoods, according to the study. More from Argar, who appears to be doing the media rounds for the government this morning. The health minister said Britons should expect \u201cdramatic increases\u201d in the number of people being tested for coronavirus. Asked if the government would meet its target of testing 100,000 people a day by the end of the month, he told the BBC: We\u2019ve seen in recent days an exponential increase in the number of tests being made available and we\u2019ve increased dramatically the eligibility for them. He added that the rollout of testing would not be a \u201csmooth increase\u201d and would instead rise dramatically day-by-day. Argar also said he would be investigating reports that some NHS staff were waiting 25 days to receive their test results. \u201cThe test results should be within around 48 hours,\u201d he told LBC. \u201cLonger delays than that - and there may be in some cases a scientific, clinical reason why a particular test doesn\u2019t work or is delayed.\u201d Johnson returns to lead the government as the country enters its sixth week in lockdown, and faces calls from Labour for clarity over how the measures will begin to be lifted. This morning, health minister Edward Argar echoed comments made by the foreign secretary Dominic Raab yesterday, saying that \u201cwe\u2019re not there yet\u201d when it comes to easing social-distancing. He told BBC Breakfast: I understand the frustrations that people are having with these measures, they are restrictive and they are very difficult. However, there are growing concerns about the economic impact of lockdown. On Sunday, Gerard Lyons, Johnson\u2019s economics adviser when he was London mayor, warned the UK could be the hardest-hit western economy if it does not unlock soon. This handy analysis from my colleague Robert Booth looks at the key areas the government will need to consider when easing the measures: Health minister Nadine Dorries has welcomed the prime minister\u2019s return to work but added that others who had been in intensive care with the virus would still be off work. Dorries, who herself tested positive for Covid-19 in March, said other patients who had spent time in an ICU would need at least three months to recover, in comparison to the three-weeks Johnson has taken off. The government\u2019s plans to move to tracking and tracing to deal with the next phase of the pandemic pose a \u201creal logistical challenge\u201d, a scientific adviser has said. Prof Peter Horby, chairman of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said the strategy would be \u201ccritical\u201d as the UK emerged from lockdown. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: We will have to be able to test all those people [declaring via apps that they are displaying coronavirus symptoms] and it is really a matter of scale and speed. \u201cOne issue is how many tests we need, and if we are looking at 1,000 to 5,000 new cases per day of people with symptoms, of which maybe 5-25% may have Covid, then you are talking about 25,000 to 100,000 tests per day.\u201d He added that speed could prove an issue, as results were needed quickly so that transmission could be reduced. Prisoners will make personal protective equipment (PPE) for NHS hospital workers during the coronavirus crisis, according to reports. Inmates at eight prisons across the country will begin making scrubs and face visors this week as prices for equipment surge, justice secretary Robert Buckland is said to have told the Telegraph. The items will cost around a third of current market rates, and will be made as part of a larger UK manufacturing race. John Lewis has also brought a group of its workers back from furlough to make clinical gowns amid worldwide shortages. Buckland told the paper: Staff in our NHS are doing an incredible job...and I\u2019m delighted that inmates are supporting them by producing equipment to keep them safe.\u201d Category B and C prisons which are involved in the effort include Swansea, Channings Wood in Devon, Wakefield, Highpoint in Suffolk, Whatton in Nottinghamshire and New Hall in West Yorkshire, which holds women and young offenders. According to the paper, prisoners will make scrubs for around \u00a35 a set, in comparison with their \u00a315 price tag on the open market. An initial order is said to have been made for 5,000 scrub tops and 5,000 laundry bags to be manufactured, while inmates will be paid a standard weekly wage of around \u00a312.50. Good morning. Prime minister Boris Johnson has returned to Downing Street to lead the UK\u2019s response to coronavirus, as ministers warned that physical distancing must become the \u201cnew normal\u201d \u2013 even when the lockdown is eased. Johnson is under pressure to explain how schools and businesses will be able to reopen without putting lives at risk, while the government has begun to set out how it hopes to manage the next phase of the pandemic, including by imposing quarantine restrictions on all arrivals at UK airports. On Sunday, hospital deaths from Covid-19 rose by 413, taking the total to 20,732. Although it is the lowest daily total since the end of March, the number is expected to increase again during the week. Elsewhere, scientists on the government\u2019s coronavirus advisory group have continued to voice concerns over the involvement of Johnson\u2019s key adviser, Dominic Cummings, in meetings. One attendee of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) told the Guardian they felt Cummings\u2019 interventions had sometimes inappropriately influenced what is supposed to be an impartial scientific process.

Unrest erupted in Seine-Saint-Denis a week ago after an incident in which a motorcyclist hit a police car, leading to clashes between youths \u2013 who set fire to rubbish bins and cars, and launched fireworks \u2013 and the police, who have been accused of a heavy-handed approach to the lockdown. The Seine-Saint-Denis department, the poorest in France, has been one of the worst hit by the coronavirus.",

A Guardian count has recorded 119 deaths of health professionals while Nursing Notes, a platform run by nurses for others in the profession, has found that at least 134 health and care workers have died of coronavirus. The website has been recording all deaths since the outbreak began, verifying all the information they receive using a number of independent sources and permissions sought from family, friends or colleagues. Hancock has repeatedly been challenged over whether frontline workers have adequate PPE to prevent them from contracting the disease. Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, where he announced an increase of 360 in the number of hospital deaths from the virus, Hancock said the NHS had been able to make treatment available to everyone who needed it, throughout the crisis. He said the government wanted to do \u201ceverything that we can\u201d to support families dealing with bereavement. \u201cI feel a deep personal sense of duty that we must care for their loved ones.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are also looking at which other groups of key workers that applies to who don\u2019t have a scheme already in place.\u201d Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said: \u201cNo amount of cash can make up for a family member who passes away but financial security should never add to the worries of those in grief. \u201cThe RCN and other health unions fought for this government announcement and we will examine the detail closely. It must be easily accessed, open to those in social care and primary care too and be paid promptly \u2013 no family should face a lengthy or complex process.\u201d Shadow health minister Justin Madders said: \u201cIt is welcome that the government has listened to workforce representatives and ensured that death-in-service benefits are available to everyone working in the NHS and social care sector. \u201cNow the government must finally get a grip over PPE supplies so that NHS and care staff aren\u2019t putting their lives on the line to do their job and protect the rest of us.\u201d",

The Guardian has been told that both sides of industry have been drafted into seven sector-by-sector meetings chaired by the business secretary, Alok Sharma, in recent days \u2013 after concerns arose in Whitehall that many employees may be reluctant to return to the workplace, even when the government gives the green light. Measures under discussion include the use of face masks and hand sanitiser on public transport, one-in-one-out rules and socially distanced queues for non-essential shops, and revised operating procedures for building sites. Some construction projects halted as a result of the virus have already restarted. Boris Johnson urged Tory colleagues pressing for an immediate end to the lockdown to \u201ccontain your impatience\u201d in a Downing Street address on his first day back at work on Monday, as the UK coronavirus hospital death toll passed 21,000. The prime minister said the country now had the opportunity to overcome Covid-19, but was at the \u201cmoment of maximum risk\u201d. But he also pledged to \u201cfire up the engines of this vast UK economy\u201d as soon as it is safe to do so. No 10 previously had little time for either business groups such as the CBI \u2013 which it regarded as a hotbed of remainers \u2013 or the trades unions. Yet, since the onset of the crisis, both groups have been closely involved in drawing up chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s economic rescue package \u2013 and they are now helping to prepare the ground for what Johnson called the \u201crefining\u201d of lockdown restrictions. While Tory donors and backbenchers have been calling for economic activity to resume as soon as possible, polling suggests strong support for lockdown measures remains, and government insiders pointed to so-called \u201cover-compliance\u201d with the restrictions already in place. When schools were ordered to stay open for key workers\u2019 children, ministers expected perhaps a fifth of pupils to attend \u2013 but the actual figure has been just 1% as concerned parents have kept the vast majority at home. Getting schools up and running again \u2013 and persuading parents their children will be safe \u2013 is regarded by ministers as a necessary precondition for allowing many people to return to work. Schools are not expected to reopen fully until June, after the spring half-term. In a characteristically upbeat statement delivered outside Downing Street two weeks after he was discharged from hospital following intensive care treatment for coronavirus, Johnson compared the virus to \u201can unexpected and invisible mugger\u201d. \u201cThis is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor and so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity.

Echoing the language used by Dominic Raab, deputising for the prime minister, on Sunday, Johnson said the government would \u201crefine\u201d the stringent distancing restrictions imposed on 23 March, which are due to be reviewed by Thursday next week. Conservative campaign chief Isaac Levido is involved in the task of replacing the government\u2019s \u201cStay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives\u201d slogan with a more nuanced message for what Johnson repeatedly called the \u201csecond phase\u201d of the crisis. Sunak disclosed on Monday that 4m workers had been furloughed under the government\u2019s unprecedented job retention scheme, in which the taxpayer underwrote the costs of paying staff wages as they are temporarily laid off. He also announced the creation of a new loans scheme for the smallest businesses, which will be 100% guaranteed by the government. Johnson stressed his determination to build a consensus over future measures, saying he would include opposition parties in his deliberations.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 28 April. Top stories Australian trials into the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19 are continuing, despite a study patients in the US finding no benefit from the drug. In fact, patients treated with it alone had a higher mortality rate. The thinktank Per Capita has released a report showing that privately run employment service agencies are set for a windfall of up to $210m as hundreds of thousands lose their jobs. The federal government will deliver a progress report to parliament on 12 May outlining Covid-19\u2019s hit to the economy . And a Guardian Essential Poll has found that 70% of voters approve of the government\u2019s response to the crisis. More than half said they were concerned about the security of personal information collected by the Covidsafe tracing app but 41% were confident the government would protect any data. More than 2 million people have downloaded the app. Donald Trump\u2019s rollercoaster White House coronavirus briefings are back on. The president cancelled them after being ridiculed for suggesting that disinfectant could cure Covid-19. A major meat producer has warned that the US food supply chain is on the verge of breaking. In a full-page ad in major newspapers, the Arkansas-based company cautioned \u201cthere will be limited supply of [their] products\u201d until they can reopen closed facilities. More than a dozen children in the UK have fallen ill with a new and potentially fatal combination of symptoms apparently linked to Covid-19, including a sore stomach and heart problems. NHS bosses are so concerned that they have written to doctors alerting them to the emergence of these cases and asked them to urgently refer any children with similar symptoms to hospital. And the World Health Organization has warned of a knock-on effect for diseases such as polio, measles, cholera, human papillomavirus, yellow fever and meningitis as the pandemic has meant 13m people have missed out on vaccines. The climate crisis will create an insurance market that will be unaffordable for the people who need it most, a consumer group has warned. In a submission to the royal commission into natural disasters, the Consumer Action Law Centre says increasing damage from extreme weather events will leave customers exploited and makes the case for an insurance price monitor, standard definitions of key terms such as \u201cfire\u201d and a modernised regime of what \u201cstandard cover\u201d means so policies can be easily understood and compared. \u201cInsurance promises to offer peace of mind, but with \u2026 [the] woeful responses to financial hardship by the insurance industry we\u2019re concerned that home insurance still isn\u2019t working for many people,\u201d says Gerard Brody, the centre\u2019s chief executive. Australia An Australian company that falsely claimed its coronavirus testing kits had been approved by medical regulators is now under investigation. Promedical Equipment usually sells cryogenic treatment and erectile dysfunction machines. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, is under renewed pressure over his attack on the City of Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore, for travel-related emissions. NSW police have found no evidence the false document Taylor\u2019s office used to attack Moore ever existed on the council\u2019s website. The Victorian government has cleared the release of the George Pell royal commission findings. The attorney general, Jill Hennessy, has advised that blacked-out sections from the institutional child abuse royal commission no longer need to be redacted. Good news for the orange-bellied parrot. The endangered bird has seen its numbers soar from low 20s to more than 100. In 2013, just three adult females remained in the wild, now a much larger group will leave Tasmania to fly north for the winter. The world A group of German doctors have posed naked in a protest highlighting a lack of personal protective equipment. Calling their protest Blanke Bedenken, or Naked Qualms, members of the group said calls for help over several months had gone unheeded. A Russian aid shipment sent to Italy in late March has raised questions about the Kremlin\u2019s motives. The aid gesture, accompanied by the message \u201cFrom Russia with love\u201d, has been branded by observers as propaganda. 2020 is on course to be the hottest year since records began, according to meteorologists. There is a 50% to 75% chance that temperatures will beat the record set four years ago. Recommended reads Grahame Best is a fixture of the Sydney theatre scene.

Photos of the gatherings in Newport Beach, Orange county, during a weekend heatwave sparked intense backlash and comparisons with Florida, where images of beachgoers raised alarms about the state\u2019s coronavirus strategy. In recent days, beach and park reopenings have also prompted debates and public health concerns in Texas, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and other regions looking to re-emerge from lockdowns. On Monday, California\u2019s governor Gavin Newsom chastised those who crowded the beaches, saying \u201cthis virus doesn\u2019t take the weekends off\u201d. \u201cThis virus doesn\u2019t go home because it\u2019s a beautiful, sunny day along our coast,\u201d the governor, who last week urged beach-goers to practice physical distancing, said at his daily news briefing. \u201cWe can\u2019t see the images like we saw, particularly on Saturday in Newport Beach and elsewhere,\u201d he added. Local officials in Los Angeles and the surrounding region have been deeply divided on the merits of allowing beach visitors. Many popular beaches have remained fully closed to the public due to Covid-19, though a handful have taken steps to permit visitors in a limited capacity while adopting a range of restrictions, enforcement plans and recommendations. California\u2019s statewide shelter-in-place order remains in effect, and police at the open Orange county beaches have attempted to enforce distancing rules.

      "body": "<p>Airbus is to furlough more than 3,000 staff working at its site in north Wales, the company has said.</p> <p>The announcement came after the plane maker\u2019s chief executive, Guillaume Faury, warned the company was \u201cbleeding cash at an unprecedented speed\u201d.</p> <p>Airbus said about half of the staff at its Broughton site would be placed on the UK government\u2019s job retention scheme, which pays 80% of wages up to \u00a32,500 a month. It is understood the company will top up salaries by a further 5% to 10%.</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic has led to airlines grounding the majority of their fleet and, earlier this month, Airbus announced a plan to cut its aircraft production rates by around a third.</p> <p>An Airbus spokesman said the company had \u201cagreed with its social partners to apply the government\u2019s job retention scheme for approximately 3,200 production and production-support employees at its commercial aircraft site in Broughton\u201d.</p> <p>Airbus employs 13,500 people in the UK, at Broughton and at Filton in Bristol, and 135,000 people worldwide.</p> <p>The aerospace manufacturer has already taken advantage of government schemes including a furlough programme in France to help pay nearly 3,000 local workers during the lockdown. It has also convinced banks to increase its line of credit, giving the airline \u201ctime to adapt and resize\u201d.</p> <p>Faury told staff in a letter that the plane maker was \u201cbleeding cash at an unprecedented speed\u201d, and had lost about a third of its business after scaling back production in response to the pandemic. </p> <p>He wrote: \u201cYes, one third. And, frankly, that\u2019s not even the worst-case scenario we could face. That may sound tough, but I want to be honest with you: there are still many unknowns.\u201d</p> <p>Airbus, which is one of the largest plane suppliers to commercial airlines, is considering other financial assistance including government-backed loans, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-airbus/airbus-warns-staff-on-jobs-with-its-survival-at-stake-idUSKCN2280S3\">according to Reuters</a>. However, Faury warned that further measures and deeper cuts may be needed in a bleak message that signalled major job cuts.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe may now need to plan for more far-reaching measures. That\u2019s because of the sheer magnitude of this crisis and its likely duration. Remember: we\u2019ve lost a third of our business almost overnight and we need to cut costs throughout the company.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re living through one of the largest economic shocks in history, so must consider all options. I am being straight and transparent with you, because I want to prepare you for the reality of our new operating environment. The survival of Airbus is in question if we don\u2019t act now.\u201d</p> <p>The warning came weeks after the group announced it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/airbus-reduces-jet-production-coronavirus-crisis\">slash the number of planes it produces</a> by a third, due to travel restrictions that have wreaked havoc on global airlines and drastically reduced demand for new aircraft.</p> <p>The company usually produces more than 60 of its most popular Airbus A320 model each month but is cutting that to 40. It will also reduce production of its A330 planes to two and A350s to six.</p> <p>Airbus could end up revealing fresh job cuts as early as Wednesday, when it is due to release its first-quarter earnings.</p> <p>A spokesman for Airbus said the company would not comment on internal communications.</p> <p>Rhys McCarthy, national officer for aerospace at Unite, the union, said the message from the Airbus chief executive should serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d to the UK government and governments throughout Europe that they must provide state support to protect highly skilled jobs.</p> <p>McCarthy added: \u201cGovernment support will not just protect the workers directly employed in the aerospace industry but also the 100,000 plus workers in the UK who are employed in the industry\u2019s supply chain.</p> <p>\u201cA do nothing approach will not only threaten tens of thousands of jobs, but make an economic recovery that more difficult and will result in UK forfeiting its leading role in aerospace.\u201d</p>",

Airbus said about half of the staff at its Broughton site would be placed on the UK government\u2019s job retention scheme, which pays 80% of wages up to \u00a32,500 a month. It is understood the company will top up salaries by a further 5% to 10%. The coronavirus pandemic has led to airlines grounding the majority of their fleet and, earlier this month, Airbus announced a plan to cut its aircraft production rates by around a third. An Airbus spokesman said the company had \u201cagreed with its social partners to apply the government\u2019s job retention scheme for approximately 3,200 production and production-support employees at its commercial aircraft site in Broughton\u201d. Airbus employs 13,500 people in the UK, at Broughton and at Filton in Bristol, and 135,000 people worldwide. The aerospace manufacturer has already taken advantage of government schemes including a furlough programme in France to help pay nearly 3,000 local workers during the lockdown. It has also convinced banks to increase its line of credit, giving the airline \u201ctime to adapt and resize\u201d. Faury told staff in a letter that the plane maker was \u201cbleeding cash at an unprecedented speed\u201d, and had lost about a third of its business after scaling back production in response to the pandemic. He wrote: \u201cYes, one third. And, frankly, that\u2019s not even the worst-case scenario we could face. That may sound tough, but I want to be honest with you: there are still many unknowns.\u201d Airbus, which is one of the largest plane suppliers to commercial airlines, is considering other financial assistance including government-backed loans, according to Reuters. However, Faury warned that further measures and deeper cuts may be needed in a bleak message that signalled major job cuts. He said: \u201cWe may now need to plan for more far-reaching measures. That\u2019s because of the sheer magnitude of this crisis and its likely duration. Remember: we\u2019ve lost a third of our business almost overnight and we need to cut costs throughout the company. \u201cWe\u2019re living through one of the largest economic shocks in history, so must consider all options. I am being straight and transparent with you, because I want to prepare you for the reality of our new operating environment. The survival of Airbus is in question if we don\u2019t act now.\u201d The warning came weeks after the group announced it would slash the number of planes it produces by a third, due to travel restrictions that have wreaked havoc on global airlines and drastically reduced demand for new aircraft. The company usually produces more than 60 of its most popular Airbus A320 model each month but is cutting that to 40. It will also reduce production of its A330 planes to two and A350s to six. Airbus could end up revealing fresh job cuts as early as Wednesday, when it is due to release its first-quarter earnings. A spokesman for Airbus said the company would not comment on internal communications. Rhys McCarthy, national officer for aerospace at Unite, the union, said the message from the Airbus chief executive should serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d to the UK government and governments throughout Europe that they must provide state support to protect highly skilled jobs. McCarthy added: \u201cGovernment support will not just protect the workers directly employed in the aerospace industry but also the 100,000 plus workers in the UK who are employed in the industry\u2019s supply chain. \u201cA do nothing approach will not only threaten tens of thousands of jobs, but make an economic recovery that more difficult and will result in UK forfeiting its leading role in aerospace.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Australia should urgently adopt the United Kingdom parliament\u2019s hybrid model of in-person and online attendance to allow for greater scrutiny of government during the Covid-19 crisis, according to former senior judge and integrity expert Anthony Whealy. Parliament is scheduled to resume for three days in May, which prime minister Scott Morrison has referred to as a \u201ctrial\u201d, as parliament had adjourned until August. Further sittings are likely to be determined by the government and opposition before parliament adjourns on 14 May, and a new Senate select committee has also been established to examine the broader Australian response to Covid-19. Whealy and the Centre for Public Integrity have released a short briefing paper that recommends the adoption of the UK\u2019s hybrid model, saying it would allow for a more comprehensive resumption of parliament, meet constitutional requirements, and comply with physical distancing rules. The paper warns the current diminished attendance of MPs could \u201climit the engagement of backbenchers, minor parties, and the crossbench\u201d. The hybrid approach would have a cohort of MPs attending parliament in Canberra \u2013 fulfilling the obligation to sit in the seat of government \u2013 and allow others to participate using video conferencing. The UK\u2019s hybrid model allows questions and statements to be delivered both in-person and via video conferencing platforms. The House of Commons, which has been fitted with screens, is able to sit 50 members in-person and have 120 members online. Questions and statements are organised by the speaker and government two days in advance. The UK is also considering extending the model to government motions, voting on divisions, and the consideration of legislation. The speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, said the model allowed for greater scrutiny of government while complying with the advice to stay home. \u201cBy initiating a hybrid solution, with steps towards an entirely virtual parliament, we are enabling members to stay close to their communities, while continuing their important work scrutinising the government,\u201d Hoyle said. Whealy said there was no reason Australia could not do the same. \u201cWe do expect the parliamentarians to set a good example for those who have to go out to the public sphere, and when you examine it, there\u2019s no reason at all that we cannot have a hybrid system operating,\u201d Whealy said. Labor\u2019s Anthony Albanese has argued parliament \u201cshould be sitting in the normal pattern\u201d and crossbencher Jacqui Lambie says sittings should resume as normal as soon as it is safe to do so. The Centre for Public Integrity says the hybrid model adopted overseas would help ensure all parliamentarians were represented, while complying with the constitution and social distancing. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental to the working of a democracy that we have a parliament, because that\u2019s the system under which all of our laws are passed, or checked, or amended, or rejected,\u201d Whealy said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a parliament sitting then the whole method under which the democracy works \u2013 namely driven by parliamentary legislation and scrutiny \u2013 falls to the ground.\u201d Whealy said the current debate about the government\u2019s contact tracing app showed the need for sittings. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling around that our privacy is threatened, that the information being collected will be misused in some way \u2013 so there\u2019s an element of \u2018can we trust the government on this?\u2019,\u201d Whealy said. \u201cNow the way in which you do get that trust is by having legislation brought forward by it being scrutinised, checked, amended, and finally, if it\u2019s satisfactory, approved, or if it\u2019s not, rejected.\u201d The government rolled out the app on Sunday but the legislation preventing the data from being used for other purposes will not be introduced into parliament until the three-day sitting week in May.",

More than a month into the UK\u2019s lockdown, the Resolution Foundation thinktank said jobs in shutdown parts of the economy were lower paid than average, with as many as one in four of the lowest earners in society working in sectors forced into temporary closure, compared with less than one in 20 of the highest paid. As the government comes under rising pressure to outline an exit strategy from lockdown conditions, the thinktank\u2019s report said the health risks from Covid-19 and the economic fallout would be far greater for some than others. Identifying 8.6 million key workers putting their health at risk to keep the country running, the study found women were more than twice as likely than men to occupy these roles. Dominated by almost 4 million health workers, as well as education, food and pharmaceutical retail staff, parents are also more likely to be key workers, including as many as two in five working mothers. The thinktank said key workers, such as nurses, teachers and care workers, typically earn less than employees further away from the centre of the crisis, with the bottom 30% of earners in Britain more than twice as likely to be in such jobs than the top 10%. As well as health risks facing women and low-income workers in sectors where staff are still going into work, the Resolution Foundation identified 6.3 million people in areas of the economy that have been ordered to shut down, including in hospitality, retail, arts, travel and leisure. It said jobs in sectors that have been effectively forced to close were typically lower paid than average, putting workers in these areas at greater risk of financial hardship as redundancies mount. One in four of the lowest 10% of all UK earners work in sectors where activity has ground to a halt amid tight restrictions on social and business life across Britain, compared with less than one in 20 of the highest paid. Young people are particularly likely to work in mothballed sectors, given the higher numbers of young adults in hospitality or retail, where their employers have been forced to close. As the generation to experience the toughest squeeze on pay following the 2008 financial crisis, the report warned that almost a quarter of millennials \u2013 born between 1981 and 2000 \u2013 currently work in shuttered sectors, compared with 16% of working baby boomers and other older adults born before them. Research around the world has shown that the impact of the pandemic will be unevenly felt by different groups in society. According to analysis of the first few weeks of unemployment benefit claims in Norway seen by the Guardian, the Norwegian labour ministry found workers with low wages, low education, and limited economic resources were overrepresented among the first to lose their jobs. In Britain about 1.8 million people have so far signed up to claim universal credit, with unemployment spiralling as the economy heads into the deepest recession since at least the second world war. Although the government is providing billions of pounds of emergency financial support to companies and individuals, millions are still expected to fall through the safety net.

      "bodyText": "Almost 400,000 home sales worth a total of \u00a382bn have been put on hold as a result of the housing market lockdown, according to Zoopla. The property website said that 373,000 sales had stalled since the end of March when ministers told people to delay their home moves if possible, and social distancing rules made valuations and viewings impossible. The majority of these sales were agreed between November 2019 and February 2020, and would have been expected to complete between April and June. Zoopla said the market was \u201cin suspended animation\u201d with those sales \u2013 which may still complete later in the year \u2013 along with others agreed based on viewings that took place before 26 March, being placed on pause. Since that time, the website said demand from new buyers had fallen by 70%. As a result, it expected the number of sales over the course of the year to be just half of 2019\u2019s figure. This is a steeper fall than that forecast by the property firm Knight Frank, which has suggested completions will drop from 1.17m last year to just 734,000 this year. Zoopla said the number of new sales agreed was running at about a 10th of the level achieved in early March, \u201cwith volumes similar to what you would expect to see in late December\u201d, when the market is traditionally quieter. Those who are still making offers may be tempted by low mortgage rates and a lack of competition from other buyers. Last week, Zoopla\u2019s rival Rightmove said buyers were making offers based on virtual viewings of properties, and builders have reported sales being agreed despite marketing suites remaining closed. The delay in completions means estate agents will have to wait longer for their commission. Zoopla estimated that commission payments on the 373,000 stalled sales added up to \u00a31bn. Despite the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic, there is little sign that people are being forced to pull out of purchases. Zoopla said the rate of sales falling through had peaked on 23 March, but the outlook \u201cdepends upon how long the restrictions remain in place, the scale of the economic impact, and how this impacts would-be buyers and their ability to proceed with sales\u201d. Knight Frank said that four in five purchases were still going ahead and that newly agreed sales were not attracting big discounts. Before lockdown, agreed prices were on average 97% of asking price and that had since dropped to 93%. Richard Donnell, the director of research at Zoopla, said: \u201cMany households have spent more time at home in the last few weeks and some may feel the urge to move and find more space or consider the potential for remote working. \u201cThis could boost activity in the second half of 2020, but this all depends upon how much the economy is impacted over the rest of the year and the impact on levels of unemployment.\u201d Donnell said it was too early to see what impact the crisis would have on prices. \u201cDemand is rising but there is a long way to go until we see a return to typical levels of market activity.\u201d \u2018We had hoped to move in summer\u2019 Jennifer Boon and her husband are among those who have been forced to put their moving plans on ice. \u201cWe live in a two-bedroom flat and we\u2019ve got a baby so we needed more room and somewhere a bit more residential to live. \u201cIn early March, we accepted an offer on our flat and had an offer accepted on a house in Finchley.

Trump\u2019s WHO funding block to be investigated The US House of Representatives\u2019 foreign affairs committee launches an investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s decision to block World Health Organization funding, giving the state department a week to provide relevant information. Writing to the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, the committee\u2019s chairman says he would support reform of the \u201cimperfect\u201d UN health agency, but cutting its funding \u201cwhile the world confronts the Covid-19 tragedy is not the answer\u201d. South Korea sees no sign of Kim virus infection Officials say they have detected no unusual movements in North Korea and caution against reports that Pyongyang\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, may be ill or is being isolated because of coronavirus concerns. Ireland unlikely to lift lockdown just yet The national public health emergency team will not recommend easing its lockdown next Tuesday unless progress on the spread and impact of the virus is made this week, the chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, says. Some countries have announced such measures and Holohan raised hopes Ireland would join them next week when he said on 16 April the country had contained the first wave of the outbreak. Argentina introduces stringent flight restrictions The country bans all commercial flight ticket sales until September; one of the toughest such measures in the world. While its borders have been closed since March, the new decree goes further by banning the sale and purchase of commercial flights to, from and within Argentina. Industry figures claim it will put too much strain on airlines and airports. Pandemic delays vaccines for 13m people Postponements to 14 vaccination campaigns because of the pandemic will affect more than 13m people, the World Health Organization says. The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, says vaccination drives against polio, measles, cholera, human papillomavirus, yellow fever and meningitis have not gone ahead. UK hospital deaths rise by 360 The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says 21,092 have now died in UK hospitals, as he announces 360 more deaths at the government\u2019s daily briefing. The figure does not include deaths in other settings, which some estimates suggest will account for a significant proportion of the total.",

One of the effects is that gradually more people become immune to the virus, which will eventually lead to herd immunity, as is the case for other viral infections. As we are dealing with a newly emerged virus, WHO correctly states that there is no certainty about the development of immunity against COVID-19, or about how long this immunity will last.

The clause anchored in the basic law \u201cdoes not exclude that we must die,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He stressed whilst the state should provide the best possible medical care for everyone, \u201cpeople will continue to die of coronavirus\u201d.</p> <p>He warned that the mood in the nation was in danger of tipping if the restrictions stayed in place for too long. \u201cIt will be harder, the longer it lasts,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"601b72e34580b2b9fe6d59c076b8d545f31d064d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/601b72e34580b2b9fe6d59c076b8d545f31d064d/0_0_4574_3262/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medics test a driver for coronavirus at a testing station in Mitte, Berlin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"713\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medics test a driver for coronavirus at a testing station in Mitte, Berlin</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile experts are calling on the government to more than double the level of Germany\u2019s current testing levels before it considers loosening restrictions.</p> <p>Currently Germany has the capacity to carry out up to 818,000 tests every week, according to Helge Braun, head of Merkel\u2019s chancellery, but advisers have said that figure should rise to 2 million.</p> <p>\u201cIncreasing the test capacity enables a detailed picture of the pandemic\u2019s progress and helps form a basis for the evaluation of possible relaxation measures by the government,\u201d he said.</p> <p>While many countries have looked in admiration at Germany\u2019s ability to carry out large-scale tests, the constant question being asked in the country is: why is there not more testing?</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T14:34:54.229Z\">at 3.34pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ea6e4698f0827bced41572f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/tomphillips\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T14:00:13.179Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lopez Obrador: Mexico 'tames' pandemic</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa2991be2562ed056631820dea637afd5bfb1a19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa2991be2562ed056631820dea637afd5bfb1a19/0_341_5509_3307/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Mexican president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: S\u00e1shenka Guti\u00e9rrez/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has claimed his country has managed \u201cto tame\u201d the coronavirus pandemic despite widespread suspicions that Covid cases are being undercounted in Latin America\u2019s second biggest economy.<br></p> <p>Mexico reported <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexico-confirms-first-case-of-coronavirus-11582898181\">its first Covid case</a> in late February and has now <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-mexico/mexico-coronavirus-infections-rise-to-14677-cases-and-1351-deaths-idUSKCN22900N\">registered</a> 1,351 deaths and 14,677 infections.

Primary school children in <strong>Norway</strong> have gone back to school after the government declared it had controlled the outbreak. <strong>Spain</strong> announced 331 more deaths as it begins to loosen lockdown rules. Greece is preparing to lift restrictions on movements to the islands. European stock markets have rallied. </p> <h2><strong>Boris Johnson says the UK is beginning to turn the tide </strong></h2> <p>The prime minister said the UK is turning the tide on tackling coronavirus but is still facing a moment of \u201cmaximum risk\u201d and he will not be forced to end the lockdown prematurely. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street on Monday, his first day back after recovering from coronavirus, he urged the public and business to contain their impatience to lift the restrictions. </p> <h2><strong>Iran announces 96 more deaths </strong></h2> <p>A further 96 people have died of coronavirus in Iran taking its death toll to 5,806, the ministry of heath announced. But Iran plans to go ahead with reopening of mosques in areas where the virus has not struck. </p> <h2>Russia has passed China in the number of new infections </h2> <p>Russia has confirmed 6,198 new coronavirus cases over the past day, bringing the total number in the country to 87,147 in all regions, the anti-coronavirus crisis centre reported on Monday. This is more than the 84,500 confirmed cases in China. Meanwhile, China has denied it is spreading disinformation about the virus. </p> <h2><strong>New Zealand prepares to move out of its strict lockdown measures</strong></h2> <p>The government reported only one new confirmed case of Covid-19 and said it had eliminated the virus. At 11.59pm on Monday, New Zealand will lift its level-4 lockdown which has been in place for more than four weeks. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the nation had \u201cwon the battle\u201d against widespread community transmission.</p> <h2><strong>More US states to end lockdown as economy crumbles</strong></h2> <p>Colorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee will join other US states in the lifting of lockdown restrictions, as economists predict an unemployment rate of 16% or higher for the month of April. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said some regions of the state might qualify to open sooner \u201cwith certain precautions\u201d, such as upstate New York, as the daily death toll was markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T11:04:45.098Z\">at 12.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ea6ac0d8f0845d1c895e6b1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T10:00:37.404Z\">11.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Iran announces 96 more deaths</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A further 96 people have died of coronavirus in <strong>Iran,</strong> taking its death toll to 5,806 the ministry of heath announced.

At least 206,549 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic, though the true toll is likely to be much higher due to under-reporting and some countries not including deaths among those with underlying conditions in their tolls.</li> <li><strong>New Zealand prepares to move out of its strict lockdown measures. </strong>The government reported only one new confirmed case of Covid-19 and said it had eliminated the virus. At 11.59pm on Monday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/new-zealand-prepares-to-lift-strict-lockdown-after-eliminating-coronavirus\">New Zealand will lift its level-4 lockdown</a> which has been in place for more than four weeks. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the nation had \u201cwon the battle\u201d against widespread community transmission.</li> <li><strong>More US states to end lockdown as economy crumbles. </strong>Colorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee will join other US states in the lifting of lockdown restrictions, as economists predict an unemployment rate of 16% or higher for the month of April. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said some regions of the state might qualify to open sooner \u201cwith certain precautions\u201d, such as upstate New York, as the daily death toll was markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday.</li> <li><strong>The UK economy will take three years to recover from coronavirus. </strong>It will take the UK economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/27/uk-economy-will-take-three-years-to-recover-from-coronavirus-ey\">three years to fully recover</a> from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a leading forecasting group. As the damage to jobs and growth unfolds, the EY Item Club said it would take until 2023 for the the economy to return to the level reached at the end of last year due to the depth of the crisis, Richard Partington reports.</li> <li><strong>British PM returns to Downing Street. </strong>Boris Johnson returned to Downing Street on Sunday night for the first time since he was admitted to hospital with Covid-19 on 6 April. The UK reported its lowest daily rise in the death toll since the end of March. The number of deaths in UK hospitals from the coronavirus has risen to 20,732 \u2013 an increase of 413 in the last 24 hours</li> <li><strong>Trump denies he will fire his health chief. </strong>US president Donald Trump, who for a second day skipped the White House press briefing, on Twitter denied reports that he planned to fire health and human services secretary Alex Azar. He said Azar was doing \u201can excellent job!\u201d. Trump also attacked the press, and was roundly mocked after tweeting about \u201cNoble\u201d prize for journalists, seeming to mean the Nobel prizes \u2013 which are not awarded in the field of journalism.</li> <li><strong>Lebanon\u2019s roads blocked in protest at dire economy. </strong>Demonstrators blocked roads through Lebanon late on Sunday to protest against the deteriorating economic situation, despite a lockdown and curfew imposed because of the coronavirus. Lebanon\u2019s worst economic crisis since the 1975-90 civil war is now compounded by the coronavirus lockdown. Forty-five per cent of the population are in poverty, according to official estimates. Its economy is forecast to contract 12% in 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund.</li> <li><strong>A million Australians downloaded a coronavirus tracking app. </strong>Health minister Greg Hunt said 1.13 million Australians downloaded the tracing app CovidSafe as of 6am (20.00 GMT) on Monday, nearly 4.5% of the country\u2019s population. </li> <li><strong>European countries announce easing of lockdown measures. </strong>Italy recorded lowest daily deaths since mid-March and prime minister Giuseppe Conte told the nation \u201cif you love Italy, maintain distance\u201d as he announced a plan that will see the country slowly ease lockdown measures from 4 May. The prime minister of France, Edouard Philippe, will on Tuesday present a national strategy for emerging from the coronavirus lockdown to the national assembly, while Spain partially relaxed its lockdown as its daily death toll dropped below 300 for the first time in weeks.</li> <li><strong>Egypt asks IMF for coronavirus bailout loan. </strong>Egypt declared on Sunday that it had asked the International Monitory Fund (IMF) for financial assistance to deal with the economic fallout caused by the coronavirus.

New Zealand has ended its strictest lockdown phase and entered Level 3, with 400,000 Kiwis returning to work, takeaways open, and fishing, surfing and swimming permitted. Local media reported lines outside McDonald\u2019s drive-through from 3am on Tuesday morning, and by 10am the food app Regulr \u2013 which many local cafes and restaurants are using to allow pick-ups \u2013 had crashed nationwide. Fast-food chains such as Dominos and Hells Pizza have warned customers to expect signficant delays as demand surges, and hired hundreds of extra employees to cope with the rush, and deliver food. NZ Domino\u2019s general manager Cameron Toomey said \u201czero contact delivery\u201d, more frequent hygiene and sanitisation practices, and physical distancing and temperature testing were now underway in all their stores, and essential workers would have priorities for pizza. In that press conference Trump also said that he believed China \u201ccould have stopped\u201d the coronavirus and that the US would conduct \u201cserious investigations\u201d into the outbreak. As Reuters report, Trump said: \u201cWe are doing very serious investigations ... We are not happy with China. \u201cWe believe it could have been stopped at the source. It could have been stopped quickly and it wouldn\u2019t have spread all over the world.\u201d Earlier, the director-general of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the \u201cworld should have listened\u201d to the WHO. He said the agency sounded the highest level of alarm over the novel coronavirus early on, but that not all countries heeded its advice. Trump\u2019s briefing has now ended. Trump was asked whether he has any information about Kim Jong Un\u2019s health, which has been the subject of rumors and speculation in recent days. He says: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you exactly. Yes, I do have a very good idea but I can\u2019t talk about it now.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence appears to be arguing that the administration actually met its goals because millions of test kits were distributed, even though they were not given and processed. That is quite an argument. We\u2019re hearing a lot about very large numbers of tests that will be done during the month of May. But it\u2019s worth remembering that we have heard big promises in the past about testing, such as the big promises of drive-through testing run by Google, that have yet to materialize. Asked if he takes any responsibility for reports of people ingesting disinfectant after his own remarks, Trump says: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d We\u2019ve moved on to questions from the press. A reporter asks why HHS secretary Alex Azar hasn\u2019t been fired. Trump says it\u2019s an unfair question and attacks Democratic politicians. Trump has previously denied reports he planned to fire Azar. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is now discussing an eight-part plan for testing. Apparently we are on step eight. We also heard from Krogers, Walmart and Rite-Aid. Now we\u2019re back to the president. Trump spoke again about testing, and has introduced the White House\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, to discuss a \u201cblueprint\u201d for states to expand testing. The chief executive of CVS Health just announced that the pharmacy chain will expand testing to 1,000 CVS facilities in May. For context, there are nearly 10,000 CVS locations across the US, so this means that approximately one out of 10 CVS locations will have testing capacity by next month. Next is the Walgreens boss, who says they will triple testing capacity, but does not provide hard numbers. Trump spoke briefly and generally about the pandemic before introducing a group of chief executives. We\u2019ve identified the first up as the Quest Diagnostics boss, Steve Rusckowski, who boasted that his company is now running 50,000 tests per day. In Washington, the US president Donald Trump has just come out to start his briefing, alongside the vice-president Mike Pence. Meanwhile, experts are calling on the government to more than double the level of Germany\u2019s current testing levels before it considers loosening restrictions. Germany has the capacity to carry out up to 818,000 tests every week, according to Helge Braun, the head of Merkel\u2019s chancellery, but advisers have said that figure should rise to 2 million. Increasing the test capacity enables a detailed picture of the pandemic\u2019s progress and helps form a basis for the evaluation of possible relaxation measures by the government. Whilst many countries have looked in admiration at Germany\u2019s ability to carry out large-scale tests, the constant question being asked within the country is: Why is there not more testing? The president of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, waded into the debate in a provocative way with his comments to the Sunday newspaper Der Tagesspiegel. He said Germany needed to better weigh up the social and economic costs with the desire to save lives, and decisions should not be left just to virologists. The massive economic, social, psychological and other effects need to be weighed up. To just bring everything to a halt for two years can also have horrific consequences. Sch\u00e4uble said he did not believe the first clause in the German constitution, \u201chuman dignity is inviolable\u201d, meant preserving human lives at all costs. The clause anchored in the basic law \u201cdoes not exclude that we must die\u201d, he said. He stressed that, while the state should provide the best possible medical care for everyone, \u201cpeople will continue to die of coronavirus\u201d. Sch\u00e4uble warned that the mood in the nation was in danger of tipping if the restrictions stayed in place for too long. \u201cIt will be harder, the longer it lasts,\u201d he said. German politicians are locked in a row over how and when to relax restrictions amid grave concern expressed by Angela Merkel and leading scientific figures that the country is in danger of gambling away the advantages it has gained. By Monday evening, there were 158,391 confirmed infections and there had been 6,088 deaths. Germany has done well on testing and contact tracing, as well as on boosting the number of its intensive care beds. Its death rate is quite a lot lower than that of other countries. But there are increasing references to the so-called \u2018prevention paradox\u2019 \u2013 by slowing down the virus\u2019s spread, the impression many have is that the dangers have been exaggerated and isn\u2019t it, therefore, about time the country got back to normal? Argentina has banned all commercial flight ticket sales until September, one of the toughest travel bans in the world. While the country\u2019s borders have been closed since March, the new decree goes further by banning the sale and purchase of commercial flights to, from and within Argentina. Industry figures have claimed it will put too much strain on airlines and airports. The decree, signed by the National Civil Aviation Administration, said it was \u201cunderstood to be reasonable\u201d to implement the restrictions, without elaborating. The chairman of the English Premier League club Watford has said a resumption of top-level football should be off the agenda until the burden on the NHS has become less severe, adding that he does not think \u201cfootball is important at the moment\u201d. Before the meeting of Premier League executives scheduled for Friday, and with the Bundesliga lined up to be the first major league to restart after a coronavirus lockdown, Scott Duxbury said: I feel uncomfortable at this stage even talking about football because there are people dying every day, there are stresses on the NHS, and that has to be the priority. Do I want to resume football? Absolutely, and when it\u2019s safe and the government says it\u2019s fine and all the players and support staff that follow football can return, then I\u2019m 100% behind that. But at the moment I feel all efforts have to be on beating the pandemic and supporting the NHS. Flaunting World Health Organization (WHO) guidance, Chile\u2019s top health official has claimed a patient recovered from Covid-19 has little chance of contracting the disease again for at least three months. The WHO maintains there is scant evidence for such claims. Chile is preparing to roll out some of the world\u2019s first \u201crelease certificates\u201d for recovered patients this week. Health officials say they are not \u201cimmunity cards\u201d but have previously suggested they will indicate some degree of resistance to the disease. The health minister, Jaime Ma\u00f1alich, said he and UN health agency officials have met and agreed there is no way to guarantee immunity. But he cited data from China and South Korea that point to shorter-term protection for those who survive the disease. The probability that a person becomes ill again, or that someone else becomes ill, becomes very remote. How long? A minimum of three months. Jordan has eased restrictions on movement aimed at containing the outbreak and allowed more businesses to reopen to help jump-start the cash-strapped economy, officials have said. As of Wednesday, residents of the capital, Amman, can drive private vehicles between 8am and 6pm, in the first such move since a nationwide curfew nearly 40 days ago that ordered the country\u2019s population of 10 million to stay at home. Public transport and taxi services will also now resume with passenger restrictions and compulsory wearing of face masks and gloves, said government spokesman Amjad Adailah. Amazon will extend the closure of its six warehouses in France to 5 May after a court rejected the US online retailer\u2019s appeal against a ruling that restricts what it can deliver during the crisis. The company said it continues to \u201cassess the best way to operate given the decision of the Court of Appeal [in Versailles]\u201d. Nigeria will begin a \u201cphased and gradual\u201d easing of more than four weeks of lockdown at the beginning of next week, its president Muhammadu Buhari has said. Lagos and Ogun states, and the federal capital territory of Abuja, entered lockdown to tame the spread of the virus on 30 March. Ireland\u2019s national public health emergency team will not recommend easing its lockdown next Tuesday unless progress on the spread and impact of the virus is made this week, the chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, has said. Some countries have announced such measures and Holohan raised hopes Ireland would join them next week when he said on 16 April the country had contained the first wave of the outbreak. However, he has said improvements in the number of new cases, in hospitalisations, and in admissions to intensive care units have slowed down. Ireland\u2019s caretaker government has adopted the advice of Holohan\u2019s team in full to date. I was saying that if the assessment was being made towards the end of last week, we wouldn\u2019t be recommending that we had arrived at a point where we would be lifting those restrictions. If anything, I\u2019m more firmly of that view given what we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re seeing a persistent admission rate to intensive care units, we\u2019d like to see that number come down. We\u2019re still reporting a significant number of cases and we still have a significant challenge in healthcare facilities ... We\u2019re still seeing improvement, but it\u2019s slowed down. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 957,875 cases and said the number of deaths has risen to 53,922. Over the weekend, the CDC updated its case count to 928,619 and said 52,459 people have died across the country as of 26 April, but that the numbers are preliminary and had not been confirmed by individual states. French researchers are preparing to launch a human trial to test their hypothesis that nicotine can help the body combat the infection, Reuters reports. The trial will involve groups of healthcare workers and patients wearing nicotine patches and other groups wearing placebo patches. Then they will be tested to see if there is a difference in how their bodies respond to the virus. The trial is a follow-up to a French study, published this month, of public health data which appeared to show that people who smoke are 80% less likely to catch Covid-19 than non-smokers of the same age and sex. There has been a surge of newly unemployed restaurant and pub workers forced to sleep on the streets of London because they can no longer afford to pay rent. Rough sleepers such as Martin, a recently-sacked chef from Poland, are finding life under lockdown increasingly difficult and dangerous. London has become so strange and sad. The only people who are out look like they are looking for drugs. There are a lot of crazy people with knives. South Korean officials emphasise they have detected no unusual movements in North Korea and caution against reports that Pyongyang\u2019s leader, Kim Jong Un, may be ill or is being isolated because of coronavirus concerns, Reuters reports. At a closed-door forum on Sunday, South Korea\u2019s unification minister, Kim Yeon-chul, who oversees North Korea engagement, said Seoul had the intelligence capabilities to say with confidence there were no indications of anything unusual. Rumours and speculation over the North Korean leader\u2019s health began after he did not appear in public at a key state holiday on 15 April. He has since remained out of sight. Experts have cautioned that Kim has disappeared from state media coverage before, and that gathering accurate information in North Korea is difficult. Reacting to the news from the UK that families of NHS staff who die during their coronavirus work will get payments worth \u00a360,000, the shadow health minister, Justin Madders, has said: It is welcome that the government has listened to workforce representatives and ensured that death-in-service benefits are available to everyone working in the NHS and social care sector. Now the government must finally get a grip over PPE supplies so that NHS and care staff aren\u2019t putting their lives on the line to do their job and protect the rest of us. The US House of Representatives foreign affairs committee has launched an investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s decision to block World Health Organization funding, giving the Department of State a week to provide relevant information. Writing to the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, the committee\u2019s chairman said he would support reform of the \u201cimperfect\u201d UN health agency, but cutting its funding \u201cwhile the world confronts the Covid-19 tragedy is not the answer\u201d. In the letter, the Democratic representative, Eliot Engel, asked the State Department to provide 11 sets of documents or other information related to the decision to withhold funding no later than 4 May. If it did not do so, Engel said the committee would consider all measures at its disposal. A spokesman declined to provide specifics. Engel has the authority as a committee chairman to issue subpoenas to federal agencies. The requested materials included a list of interagency meetings between 1 December and 14 April at which funding for the WHO was discussed, a list of legal authorities under which the administration will execute the suspension of funds, and documents related to the administration\u2019s investigation of the WHO. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump suspended US contributions to the WHO on 14 April, accusing it of being \u201cChina-centric\u201d and promoting China\u2019s \u201cdisinformation\u201d about the coronavirus outbreak, and saying his administration would launch a review of the organisation. WHO officials have denied the claims and China insists it has been transparent and open. The United States is the WHO\u2019s biggest donor. Trump\u2019s decision prompted immediate criticism from US allies abroad, and within the United States from health experts and Democrats. Some Democrats accused the Republican president of using the WHO and China as scapegoats to distract from what they view as Trump\u2019s mishandling of a pandemic that has killed nearly 55,000 Americans and cratered the economy. But Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans have largely backed the president, praising his handling of the health crisis and calling on WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, to resign. More than 3 million people around the world are now confirmed to have been infected with the coronavirus, according to a tally kept by researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The worst-affected country is by far the US, which \u2013 with 972,969 cases alone \u2013 counts for almost a third of the global total. Vaccines for more than 13 million people have been delayed because of the outbreak, the World Health Organization says. The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, says vaccination drives against polio, measles, cholera, HPV, yellow fever and meningitis are affected. UK hospital deaths rose by 360, according to Matt Hancock, the UK\u2019s health secretary, who said the total number of deaths in the country was now 21,902. The figure does not include deaths in other settings, which some estimates suggest will account for a significant proportion of the total. Italy reported 333 new deaths, a slightly accelerated increase compared to the previous 24 hours; up by 73. The number of people currently infected with the virus fell by 290 to 105,813. Italy has recorded 199,414 coronavirus cases to date. Mexico has managed \u201cto tame\u201d its coronavirus outbreak, the country\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, said, despite widespread suspicions that Covid-19 cases are being undercounted. Mexico reported its first Covid-19 case in late February and has now registered 1,351 deaths and 14,677 infections. WhatsApp claimed to have cut viral messages by 70% after introducing a limit on the number of people to whom users could forward messages. WhatsApp introduced the limit earlier this month amid claims that its service was contributing to the spread of misleading information about coronavirus. Many shops outside shopping malls are reopening in the Czech Republic as the government brings forward its five-stage lockdown exit plan. The UK government is understood to be closely studying the country\u2019s approach as it seeks a route out of its own lockdown. Switzerland also began to ease its lockdown, with dentists, hairdressers and massage salons are among the services once again receiving customers. Most shops, schools and food markets will follow suit from 11 May, followed by vocational schools and universities from 8 June. Afghanistan recorded its biggest one-day rise in cases, triggered by a continued surge of transmission in Kandahar, as the health ministry warns two critical weeks lie ahead. Click below to see more at-a-glance headlines: More than 3 million people around the world are now confirmed to have been infected with Covid-19 since it first emerged in Wuhan, China, at the end of last year, according to a tally kept by researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The worldwide death toll from the Covid-19 disease caused by the new virus recently passed 200,000. The worst-affected country is by far the US, which, with 972,969 cases alone, counts for almost a third of the global total, followed by Spain with 229,422, Italy with 199,414, and France with 162,220. However, with testing regimes differing widely around the world and questions raised about the efficacy of the tests themselves, the true number of cases is impossible to gauge. The Johns Hopkins tracker is based on official reports. Wearing face masks should not give people a false sense of security against the new coronavirus, one of Italy\u2019s top public health officials has warned. Silvio Brusaferro, director of the ISS public health institute, said face masks should be worn on the street in cases when it is hard to maintain a safe distance from others. But masks \u201cmust not give a false sense of security\u201d, Brusaferro told reporters. \u201cIt is an additional element, but personal hygiene and distancing are more important.\u201d The Mediterranean country is making the use of face masks mandatory on transport and in stores as it gradually rolls back lockdown measures starting next Monday. An aide to an influential king in Ivory Coast has said the monarch could order a procession of naked women to ward off coronavirus, AFP reports. Amon N\u2019Douffou V, the king of Sanwi, in the southeast of Ivory Coast, held a special exorcism ceremony last week seeking divine intervention to protect his 3 million subjects against the epidemic. With more than 1,000 cases of Covid-19 and 14 deaths, Ivory Coast government has asked traditional rulers, who have wide authority, to help enforcephysical distancing and other measures. Following last week\u2019s ceremony, Ben Kottia, the king\u2019s counsellor, said King Amon could take further measures to try counter the epidemic. In Africa, we live in two worlds \u2013 the visible and the invisible. Only kings have the power through this libation to demand the protection of the invisible world. The king can order women who hold this secret to perform the \u2018adjalou\u2019 - a procession through the village to protect the people. During adjalou, these women are naked and we confine men and children in their homes. The women erect barricades at the entrance of villages to prevent bad spirits from entering and claiming lives. The procession is kept secret until the previous day when the royal announcer goes through the village to say it will take place. Children are falling ill with a new and potentially fatal combination of symptoms apparently linked to Covid-19, including a sore stomach and heart problems, reports Denis Campbell, the Guardian\u2019s health policy correspondent. The children affected appear to have been struck by a form of toxic shock syndrome. Some have been left so seriously unwell that they have had to be treated in intensive care. At least one has undergone extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment, which is used when someone\u2019s life is at risk because they can no longer breathe for themselves. It is not known how many such cases have appeared, though it is thought to be a small number. But NHS bosses are so concerned that they have written to doctors alerting them to the existence of the syndrome and asked them to urgently refer any children who appear to have it to hospital. In a letter to GPs in north London, reported by the Health Service Journal, NHS bosses said: It has been reported that over the last three weeks there has been an apparent rise in the number of children of all ages presenting with a multi-system inflammatory state requiring intensive care across London and also in other regions of the UK. The cases have in common overlapping feature of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters consistent with severe Covid-19 in children. There is a growing concern that a Sars-CoV-2-related inflammatory syndrome is emerging in children in the UK, or that there may be another, as yet unidentified, infectious pathogen associated with these cases. Eighteen more people with Covid-19 have died in Ireland, bringing the total death toll to 1,102, the country\u2019s department of health reports. Ireland recorded 386 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Monday, bringing the total in the country to 19,648. Argentina has infuriated the airline industry by banning ticket sales for commercial flights until September, according to a report by Reuters. While the country\u2019s borders have been closed since March, the new decree goes further in preventing the sale and purchase of commercial flights to, from or within Argentina until 1 September. The spread of the coronavirus \u201cdoes not allow certainties\u201d for the end of social isolation measures, which would threaten commercial air transportation, the decree by the National Civil Aviation Administration said. It went on: It has been understood to be reasonable to set September 1, 2020 for the purpose of rescheduling regular operations or requesting authorisations for non-regular operations of passenger air transport subject to the effective lifting of restrictions imposed on commercial air transport and operating modalities. Part of the decree\u2019s aim is to prevent airlines from ticketing flights not approved by the government. \u201cThe problem was that airlines were selling tickets without having authorisation to travel to Argentine soil,\u201d a spokesman for President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez said. The decision prompted industry groups including ALTA, which lobbies on behalf of Latin American airlines, to warn that the decree represented an \u201cimminent and substantial risk\u201d to thousands of jobs in Argentina. It said in a statement: It is our responsibility to express the deep concern generated by the resolution in question, which was not shared or agreed with the industry and, furthermore, runs counter to the efforts of all the actors in the sector to propose and implement a plan for responsible and safe reactivation that re-establishes commercial activities and an essential service for the population. The presidential spokesman, however, said the decision resulted from a \u201cconsensus between the government and the airline sector\u201d. Six more people have died from the coronavirus in Serbia, bringing the country\u2019s total death toll to 162, Telegraf reports. The latest victims were three women and three men. Four of them were residents at the same care home, according to the Serbian news site. News of the latest deaths came as Serbia reported 233 more confirmed cases of Covid-19, bringing the total number of infections there so far to 8,275. Six weeks after Serbia declared a state of emergency in response to the pandemic, including special restrictions on the elderly, the UN Population Fund has helped launch a helpline for older people suffering from feelings of isolation. People aged over 65 in urban areas, and over 70 in smaller cities, are prohibited from engaging in habits like morning walks, coffee with neighbours or visits with relatives. Natasa Todorovic, of the Red Cross of Serbia, said: We know the psychological effects of isolation can have multiple negative effects, such as fear, nervousness, sadness and guilt. With so many stress factors that have arisen from the Covid-19 pandemic, such as fear of infection, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, stigma, financial challenges, having someone to talk to is very much needed. Here\u2019s more from the World Health Organization\u2019s coronavirus press briefing earlier, where Dr Mike Ryan, the WHO\u2019s emergencies expert, said that the US seemed to have a \u201cvery clearly laid-out\u201d, science-based federal plan for fighting its coronavirus epidemic \u2013 in spite of the bizarre outbursts of its president. \u201cThe federal government and the system of governors are working together to move America and its people through this very difficult situation,\u201d Reuters reported Ryan as saying, adding that the federal system linking 50 states made the situation \u201ccomplex\u201d. Ryan repeated an earlier WHO warning against easing restrictions too soon. Speaking specifically about US plans to ease confinement measures, he said: We believe that the over-arching federal plan seems to be very much based on science ... We hope that the US government and its people can move through this plan, work through day-to-day how to do that and find a successful solution that reduces the impact on people\u2019s lives and livelihoods. In parts of Germany, people caught in public without face masks face a \u20ac1,000 fine. In Madagascar they have another way of dealing with rule breakers: forcing them to sweep the streets. Face coverings have been made mandatory from today for everyone out in public in the Madagascan capital, Antananarivo, as well as in the cities of of Fianarantsoa and Toamasina, at the same time as other restrictions have begun to be loosened. Authorities warned that citizens leaving the house without face masks would face community service, AFP reports. The head of anti-coronavirus operations, Gen Elak Olivier Andriakaja, said on state television: Seventy percent of people on the street respected the rule \u2026 because they are scared of having to sweep pavements \u2026 Measures were taken before the sanctions fell into place to raise awareness and distribute mouth covers. I think that\u2019s enough and that sanctions must now be applied. About 500 people in Antananarivo and Fianarantsoa were penalised on Monday, said the deputy head of police, Christian Rakotobe. Antananarivo\u2019s commissioner, Hector Razafindrazaka, said 25 people were sentenced on the spot and forced to sweep the capital\u2019s dusty streets. Images of the embarrassed-looking offenders were widely circulated on social media. To date, the Indian Ocean island-nation has recorded 128 cases of Covid-19. No fatalities have been recorded so far and 75 patients have recovered. Deaths from the coronavirus in Italy rose by 333 on Monday, 73 more than on Sunday, bringing the death toll to 26,977, reports Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent. The number of people currently infected with the virus fell by 290 to 105,813. Italy has recorded 199,414 coronavirus cases to date, including the victims and 66,624 survivors. New rules came into force on Monday legally requiring most people in Germany to wear face masks on public transport, long-distance trains and in shops, reports Kate Connolly, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent. The so-called Maskenpflicht (mask duty) was introduced in 15 of the country\u2019s 16 states on Monday morning. The northern state of Schleswig-Holstein will on Wednesday be the last state to implement the legislation. Fines of between \u20ac25 and \u20ac10,000 can be imposed on those who fail to wear a mask, with rates differing widely across the country, and some states, such as Berlin and Brandenburg, insisting they would not levy fines at all, but would rely instead on people showing each other mutual respect by wearing them. Other states said they would allow a few days of grace for people to get used to the new rule. The heftiest fines will apply to shopkeepers whose staff are caught not wearing masks, and there are incremental fine systems in some states for repeat offenders. Authorities have been quick to insist the masks do not have to be medically approved. Scarfs or cloths over the nose or mouth are adequate. Tailors across the country, as well as bands of hobby sewers, have been busy making masks to meet high demand, while there are reports of elastic shortages. Some states, such as Saxony and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, have said they will provide masks to their citizens. Matt Hancock, the UK health secretary, said there had been 360 new coronavirus hospital deaths in the UK. That takes the total UK coronavirus hospital death toll to 21,092, he said. Singapore has confirmed 799 more coronavirus infections, its health ministry said on Monday, taking the city-state\u2019s tally of cases to 14,423. The health ministry also reported two more deaths, of male Singapore citizens aged 82 and 81, taking the total death toll to 14. Among the new cases, 764 are foreign workers living in dormitories in the city-state, which despite having acted early and aggressively to tackle the spread of the virus, now has among the highest number of infections in Asia. Turkey has detained 402 people in the past 42 days for allegedly sharing false and provocative social media postings concerning the coronavirus outbreak, officials said on Monday. A statement from Turkey\u2019s interior ministry said officials had inspected more than 6,000 social media accounts and that 402 people had been held, among a total of 855 account-holders sought by authorities for sharing posts deemed to be provocative. A ministry official told AP the detainees had allegedly attempted to cause panic over the coronavirus pandemic with posts that, among other things, accused the government of not doing enough to curb the outbreak or of lying about the numbers of deaths or infections. The official spoke on condition of anonymity, in line with government regulations. Turkey\u2019s latest coronavirus figures are yet to be published, but the country has reported a gradual decline in daily death tolls over the past week. Fourteen vaccination campaigns that would have covered more than 13 million people have been postponed because of the crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization has said. In his opening remarks to today\u2019s coronavirus press conference, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, said vaccination drives against polio, measles, cholera, human papillomavirus, yellow fever and meningitis had not gone ahead. \u201cWhen vaccination coverage goes down, more outbreaks will occur, including of life-threatening diseases like measles and polio,\u201d Ghebreyesus said. \u201cThe tragic reality is that children will die as a result.\u201d The World Health Organization\u2019s regular Covid-19 press conference is now beginning. You can watch it live in the player embedded at the top of the blog. Queues formed in front of garden centres in Switzerland on Monday, one of a number of different kinds of businesses allowed to reopen their doors as the Alpine country loosens its coronavirus lockdown. Dentists, hairdressers, massage parlours and beauty salons were also among the services once again receiving customers, after closing down in March to slow the spread of the new disease. Most shops, schools and food markets will follow suit from 11 May. In a third stage, vocational schools and universities are set to reopen from 8 June, provided there is no significant increase in Covid-19 cases. Only grocery stores, chemists and other \u201cessential\u201d businesses have been allowed to remain open during the lockdown. \u201cThe number of new cases is continuing to decline, which is certainly good news on the first day we are starting to relax the measures,\u201d Daniel Koch, the official leading Switzerland\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak, told reporters in Bern. On Monday, Switzerland reported 30 new deaths from coronavirus, taking the total death toll in the country to 1,640. The total number of confirmed cases reached 29,164, after 103 new infections were detected \u2013 far fewer than in late March, when Swiss authorities were reporting close to a thousand or more cases each day. Outside the Schillinger garden centre, in the town of Gland on Lake Geneva, Christiane Ansermet waited to pick up some seedlings. Asked whether she thought the country was ready to emerge from its lockdown, she told Reuters: I think it is about time. We have to live our lives, so I think it is important that we keep doing our activities and contact with people is so important, even in a queue like that. Sweden reported 286 new cases of coronavirus and 80 more deaths on Monday, as the world watches developments there to see if its light-touch coronavirus measures prove to be effective or a disaster. Unlike its neighbours, Sweden has allowed schools for under-16s, cafes, bars, restaurants and businesses to stay open while urging people and businesses to respect social distancing guidelines. In an interview with Jon Henley, the Guardian\u2019s European affairs correspondent, Sweden\u2019s foreign minister, Ann Linde, said it was too early to judge her country\u2019s light-touch approach to Covid-19. She said: There\u2019s been a lot of misunderstanding. We have pretty much the same goals as every other government \u2026 And as we have always said, we are perfectly ready to go with more binding regulations if the population does not follow. European ministers in charge of tourism have called for common action to help the sector weather the crisis resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, reports Jennifer Ranking, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent. Tourism represents 10% of the EU\u2019s economic output, but more in Italy, Spain, Croatia and Greece, which are facing a heavy blow from travel bans, grounded planes and closed borders. Gari Capelli, the minister of tourism in Croatia, who chaired the video conference, said the sector had \u201cexperienced an immense and unexpected decline in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic\u201d. In a statement released after the meeting, he called for \u201cthe creation of joint solutions to the crisis of the tourism sector\u201d as well as programmes and plans for combating similar threats in future. The minister did not spell out what he had in mind, while officials spoke of \u201ccommon rules\u201d and \u201cprotocols\u201d expected to be defined in a forthcoming policy paper by the European commission. Capelli also said he was pleased that EU leaders had agreed last week to create a European Recovery Fund, which will give aid to the hardest-hit countries and sectors. \u201cI believe that we are all aware that tourism definitely falls into the category of the most affected sectors in this crisis.\u201d The EU industry commissioner, Thierry Breton, who also took part in the video conference call, urged countries to make use of different EU funds to provide a lifeline to businesses. Unlike the vast majority of EU ministerial meetings, there was no press conference to allow journalists to question politicians on the substance of discussions. The UN World Tourism Organisation predicted a month ago that tourist arrivals could fall by 20-30% in 2020, leading to losses of up to $450bn (\u00a3362bn) for the industry. The downward trend in coronavirus deaths and new infections continues in the Netherlands, where 400 new confirmed cases and 43 new deaths were reported on Monday. That brings the total number of cases in the country to 38,245, with a death toll so far of 4,518, according to figures reported by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). Schools, businesses and some shops remain closed in the Netherlands, but some younger children are to be allowed back to school next month. Like Sweden, the Netherlands has made clear to the public that it is not seeking to try to eradicate Covid-19, but is pursuing an eventual goal of \u201cherd immunity\u201d. According to an in the coronavirus Q&amp;A section of the RIVM website: Most people infected with the coronavirus recover. According to WHO, people show antibodies in their blood for at least a month after recovery. This means that in the Netherlands immunity against corona is being built up. This is not a goal in itself, but a result of the fact that the virus is present in the Netherlands. One of the effects is that gradually more people become immune to the virus, which will eventually lead to herd immunity, as is the case for other viral infections. As we are dealing with a newly emerged virus, WHO correctly states that there is no certainty about the development of immunity against COVID-19, or about how long this immunity will last. More information about this will become available soon. The Netherlands will keep on adapting its policy, based on the latest findings. Politicians in Germany are locked in a row over how and when to relax restrictions, amid grave concern, expressed by Angela Merkel and leading scientific figures, that the country is in danger of gambling away the advantages it has gained so far in dampening the spread of the virus, writes Kate Connolly, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent. By Monday afternoon there were just over 158,000 confirmed infections and there have been 6047 deaths. As has been well publicised, Germany has done well on testing and tracing as well as on the number of its intensive care beds. Its death rate is much lower than other countries. But there are increasing references to the so-called \u2018prevention paradox\u2019 \u2013 by slowing down the virus\u2019s spread the impression many have is that the dangers have been exaggerated and isn\u2019t it therefore, about time the country got back to normal? The president of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble waded into the debate in a provocative way with his comments to Sunday newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, that Germany needed to better weigh up the social and economic costs with the desire to save lives and decisions should not be left just to virologists. \u201cThe massive economic, social, psychological and other effects need to be weighed up,\u201d he said. \u201cTo just bring everything to a halt for two years can also have horrific consequences.\u201d Sch\u00e4uble said he did not believe that the first clause in the German constitution \u201chuman dignity is inviolable\u201d meant preserving human lives at all costs. The clause anchored in the basic law \u201cdoes not exclude that we must die,\u201d he said. He stressed whilst the state should provide the best possible medical care for everyone, \u201cpeople will continue to die of coronavirus\u201d. He warned that the mood in the nation was in danger of tipping if the restrictions stayed in place for too long. \u201cIt will be harder, the longer it lasts,\u201d he said. Meanwhile experts are calling on the government to more than double the level of Germany\u2019s current testing levels before it considers loosening restrictions. Currently Germany has the capacity to carry out up to 818,000 tests every week, according to Helge Braun, head of Merkel\u2019s chancellery, but advisers have said that figure should rise to 2 million. \u201cIncreasing the test capacity enables a detailed picture of the pandemic\u2019s progress and helps form a basis for the evaluation of possible relaxation measures by the government,\u201d he said. While many countries have looked in admiration at Germany\u2019s ability to carry out large-scale tests, the constant question being asked in the country is: why is there not more testing? Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has claimed his country has managed \u201cto tame\u201d the coronavirus pandemic despite widespread suspicions that Covid cases are being undercounted in Latin America\u2019s second biggest economy. Mexico reported its first Covid case in late February and has now registered 1,351 deaths and 14,677 infections. Experts say they believe the country is still several weeks away from the peak of infections. But in a video message on Sunday L\u00f3pez Obrador, or Amlo as he is widely known, claimed: \u201cWe\u2019re doing well because we have managed to tame the epidemic\u201d. Amlo praised Mexico\u2019s 126 million citizens for helping slow the disease\u2019s advance by following social distancing guidelines \u201cto the letter\u201d. Health specialists questioned Amlo\u2019s claim Covid had been completely controlled. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we should be claiming victory,\u201d said Alejandro Mac\u00edas, a leading infectious diseases specialist. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the upward phase [of infections].\u201d Amlo has said he hopes Mexico can begin returning to normal from mid-May onwards, with schools possibly reopening at the start of June. But Mac\u00edas said he believed low testing meant only a \u201csmall fraction\u201d of cases had been identified and that it was not yet time to reopen. \u201cTo me these dates seem a little premature because we don\u2019t yet know what the intensity of this will be,\u201d he said. \u201cItaly, France and Spain started this problem well before Mexico.\u201d In a clear indication of concern over Covid\u2019s spread, there were reports over the weekend that authorities in Jalisco state were racing to complete a special 700-grave cemetery for coronavirus victims. Formula One plans to start the season in Austria on 5 July and stage between 15 and 18 grands prix this year with the opening races behind closed doors. The announcement came immediately after the French Grand Prix was cancelled and the news the British Grand Prix will be held without spectators if it goes ahead. The French GP on 28 June is the 10th race to fall to the coronavirus outbreak and its cancellation had been expected after Emmanuel Macron banned mass gatherings until July. F1 has been planning and discussing how and when the season may begin and Austria, where lockdown restrictions have been relaxed, was expected to host the first race. \u201cWe are now increasingly confident with the progress of our plans to begin our season,\u201d said Chase Carey, the chairman of the F1 group. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting a start to racing in Europe through July, August and beginning of September, with the first race taking place in Austria on 3-5 July.\u201d Read the full story here: Preparatory work has begun on restarting repairs to Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Fire consumed the 850-year-old building a year ago, and donations for its restoration poured in from around the world. Work has proven slow, however, with delays caused by toxic lead released by the fire, winter storms and then by the Covid-19 pandemic, which closed the site in March. Today the process of making the site fit for socially distant repairs has begun. This includes adapting showers and changing rooms for workers. Despite delays and the ongoing coronavirus crisis, the rector of the cathedral, Monsignor Patrick Chauvet, said work was still on target to hit the five-year deadline set by President Emmanuel Macron. Hi there, this is Paul MacInnes, sitting in for Damien as he breaks for lunch. My Twitter is essentially defunct but you can get me on paul.macinnes@theguardian.com if you want Many shops outside shopping malls are reopening in the Czech Republic after the government brought forward its five-stage lockdown exit plan, amid reports that the British government is closely watching the country\u2019s back-to-business strategy, writes Jon Henley, the Guardian\u2019s European affairs correspondent. Under increasing pressure to lift parts of the UK\u2019s lockdown and limit the damage to the economy, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is understood to be studying the Czech Republic\u2019s approach to lifting the tight restrictions it imposed earlier than most countries further west, which have helped it limit cases to 7,400, with just 221 deaths [with the latest four cases and one death reported today - DG]. Prague was one of the few governments to declare a state of emergency before the country had recorded its first coronavirus death. By 11 March it had closed all schools, limited public gatherings, banned all public events, sealed its borders and shuttered all non-essential stores. It also made face masks obligatory in public. Early this month it became the first European country to relax its restrictions, initially by allowing citizens to cycle, jog and walk in the countryside without wearing their masks, as long as they stayed 2 metres apart. Two remarkable aerial pictures show hundreds of people in Kenya observing social distancing guidelines while travelling on the Likoni crossing ferry. However, such obedience comes at a price. These were the scenes at Likoni late last month, as Kenyan police began enforcing just imposed lockdown measures \u2013 with violence. The number of daily confirmed infections of the coronavirus in Qatar has been accelerating over the past week. Most of those cases were among expatriate workers who had had contact with other confirmed cases, the state news agency QNA said, according to a report circulated by Reuters yesterday. It said some of the new cases had been recorded among workers outside of the capital\u2019s old industrial zone, which was isolated in mid-March after it emerged as a hotspot for the virus. Last week Qatar said it would gradually start to lift the lockdown there. South Africa is celebrating Freedom Day under lockdown. The social messaging service WhatsApp says it has cut the number of viral messages spreading across its worldwide network by 70% after introducing a limit on the number of people to whom users could forward messages. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, introduced the limit earlier this month amid claims that its service was contributing to the spread of misleading information about the coronavirus pandemic. It cut the number of chats to which a user could pass on a so-called \u201chighly forwarded message\u201d from five to one. On Monday, a WhatsApp spokesperson said: WhatsApp is committed to doing our part to tackle viral messages. We recently introduced a limit to sharing \u2018highly forwarded messages\u2019 to just one chat. Since putting into place this new limit, globally there has been a 70% reduction in the number of highly forwarded messages sent on WhatsApp. This change is helping keep WhatsApp a place for personal and private conversations. Three hundred thousand people could starve to death every day for three months if the crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic stops the World Food Programme from reaching them with critical supplies, its director has said. David Beasley said in an interview with the Associated Press he has also been telling leaders that maintaining supply chains is critical and there are many potential obstacles, including export restrictions, closed borders and ports, farms not producing and roads closed. He said he had been spending hours every day speaking with officials in donor countries to try to keep donations coming, but that he was afraid that severe economic problems cut lead to cuts in funding at the same time as a catastrophic global recession. Support for WFP comes from the US, the UK, Germany, the European Union, Japan and other prosperous nations, he said. If their economies deteriorate substantially, that impacts our money, it impacts the local economies in the developing nations in a variety of different ways. According to Beasley, a former governor of South Carolina, 821 million people go to bed hungry every night all over the world now, a further 135 million people are facing crisis levels of hunger or worse. He said: WFP is providing food to nearly 100 million people on any given day, including about 30 million people who literally depend on us to stay alive. And if those 30 million people cant be reached, our analysis shows that 300,000 people could starve to death every single day over a three-month period and that doesn\u2019t include increased starvation due to the new coronavirus.\u201d In a worst-case scenario, we could be looking at famine in about three dozen countries, and in 10 of them there are already more than 1 million people per country on the verge of starvation.\u201d Kenya has hailed its \u201ctremendous progress\u201d in recoveries from Covid-19, after eight patients with the disease were discharged from hospital - the same number of new carriers identified in the past 24 hours. The coronavirus pandemic is likely to be followed by even more deadly and destructive disease outbreaks unless their root cause \u2013 the rampant destruction of the natural world \u2013 is rapidly halted, the world\u2019s leading biodiversity experts have warned, writes Damian Carrington, the Guardian\u2019s environment editor. In an article, they write: There is a single species responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 us. Recent pandemics are a direct consequence of human activity, particularly our global financial and economic systems that prize economic growth at any cost. We have a small window of opportunity, in overcoming the challenges of the current crisis, to avoid sowing the seeds of future ones. Professors Josef Settele, Sandra D\u00edaz and Eduardo Brondizio led the most comprehensive planetary health check ever undertaken, which was published in 2019 by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). It concluded that human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth\u2019s natural life-support systems. In an article published on Monday, with Dr Peter Daszak, who is preparing the next IPBES assessment, they write: Rampant deforestation, uncontrolled expansion of agriculture, intensive farming, mining and infrastructure development, as well as the exploitation of wild species have created a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 for the spillover of diseases. Contrary to information in a graphic posted earlier on the blog, the Netherlands has put forward plans to begin an easing of its lockdown \u2013 and they are proving controversial. Primary schools and daycare centres are due to reopen in the country in early May, prime minister Mark Rutte announced last week, although class sizes may be cut to accommodate health guidelines, NLTimes reported. Controversy soon erupted, however, when a member of the Dutch outbreak management team suggested in a television appearance that the reopening of schools was part of a strategy to allow the virus to gradually spread through the population. Speaking on school reopening plans, Ann Vossen said last Tuesday that the Dutch government\u2019s aim was not to eradicate the epidemic, but to slow it down. She said: It\u2019s a common sentiment among the general public that we should \u2018put a stop to it now!\u2019 But that is not really the goal here. We just want to make sure it spreads in a gradual way, so to speak, while keeping the risk to public health the healthcare system as low as possible. But we do not want to halt it completely, because in that case we would have had to opt for a complete lockdown. Such \u201cherd immunity\u201d strategies have proven a difficult sell to populations, with the UK government having been forced to make a sharp U-turn after it initially said the outcome was part of its plan for dealing with the virus. They are counter to the advice from the World Health Organization, which has called for a \u201ctest, trace and quarantine\u201d strategy to keep outbreaks as controlled as possible until a vaccine is available. However, in Sweden, the government has had more support for a similar approach. The latest coronavirus statistics from the Netherlands and Sweden are due shortly and I will post them when they arrive. Hospitals in Belgium admitted the lowest number of Covid-19 patients since the start of the lockdown almost seven weeks ago, figures showed on Monday, a week before the country starts to ease restrictions, Reuters reports. The number of hospital admissions, a key number to monitor the disease\u2019s evolution, fell to 127 on Sunday, the lowest level since 18 March. Daily admissions peaked at over 600 at the end of March and have hovered at around 200 for the past week. The number of new confirmed Covid-19 cases also declined to a month low of 553, although health officials said the decline might be in part due to a weekend effect. The nation of 11.5 million people closed restaurants, cafes, gyms and schools from 14 March and then ordered that all non-food shops close from 18 March. The government outlined plans on Friday to allow a gradual easing of restrictions from 4 May, with a series of phases of further reopening during the course of the month. In Afghanistan, the health ministry has warned two critical weeks lie ahead as the war-torn country recorded its biggest one-day rise of new coronavirus cases, triggered by a continued surge of transmission in Kandahar. Over the past 24 hours, 172 new cases were confirmed, bringing to total number of infections to 1,703. Of the new cases, 27 were confirmed in the country\u2019s capital, Kabul, pushing the total number of infections 479 in what has become Afghanistan\u2019s worst affected area. A lockdown is being implemented in Kabul in a bid to contain spread of the virus. Afghanistan has also recorded its biggest one-day rise in casualties to Covid-19, as seven patients died overnight, taking the total number of deaths to 57. Herat, which had been worst affected area of the country for weeks, has recorded 33 new cases, bringing the total to 423. The region shares a border with Iran, the Middle East country worst affected by the Covid-19 outbreak, and thousands of Afghan migrants poured back from Iran in February and March. In Kandahar, transmissions continued to surge as 21 new cases confirmed. Speaking in Kabul on Monday, Wahidullah Mayar, a health ministry spokesman, said that the next two weeks would be \u201cvery critical\u201d and asked the nation to stay at home. But with streets crowded with people and vehicles, experts fear fighting the virus will be challenging. Meanwhile. the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Monday that more than 533 civilians, including 152 children, were killed in fighting in the first quarter of 2020. The UN said the figures highlighted \u201cthe urgent need for all parties to the conflict to do more to protect civilians from harm, especially in view of the looming threat posed to all Afghans by Covid-19\u201d. Deborah Lyons, the secretary general\u2019s special representative for Afghanistan and head of UNAMA, said: I call on all parties to seize the opportunity offered by the secretary-general\u2019s call for a global ceasefire to focus collective efforts on fighting a common enemy, the Covid-19 pandemic. To safeguard the lives of countless civilians in Afghanistan and to give the nation hope of a better future, it is imperative that violence is stopped with the establishment of a ceasefire and for peace negotiations to commence. Mayar, the health ministry spokesman, asked the Taliban to stop \u201ckilling brothers and instead fight against one enemy, which is coronavirus\u201d. But in a tweet on Thursday, the Taliban\u2019s spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, rejected ceasefire offers, citing ongoing disagreements over a potential peace process and a delayed prisoner exchange as reasons to keep fighting. A loophole in Ireland\u2019s lockdown laws means police cannot detain visitors from Northern Ireland, raising concern that some people may cross the border and defy physical distancing regulations, Rory Carroll reports from Dublin. Garda\u00ed have been ordered not to arrest anyone from Northern Ireland because they have no powers of enforcement over people who do not live in the republic, RTE reported. The disclosure prompted concern from politicians and residents in Donegal and other border counties that Northern Ireland residents chafing at the UK\u2019s continued lockdown may visit holiday homes and tour beauty spots in the republic. Residents in the republic are chafing at a ban on travelling more than 2km from home and would bristle at any sign of cross-border visitors taking advantage of the loophole. Sinn F\u00e9in said the loophole reinforced the need for an all-island response to the coronavirus pandemic. The party has also cited the UK\u2019s higher death rate as further reason for an all-Ireland approach. The Ulster Unionist party accused Sinn F\u00e9in of \u201cperverse\u201d political point-scoring. The Philippines on Monday reported 198 new coronavirus cases and 10 more deaths, brining the country\u2019s tally to 7,777 cases and 511 fatalities, Reuters reports. The Department of Health also said 70 individuals have recovered from the infection, bringing the total number of recoveries to 932.

In Spain, the number of overnight deaths stood at 331 as officials continue to push forward with tentative plans to loosen one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns. The country remains one of the world\u2019s hardest-hit, with 23,521 lives claimed by the virus. The total number of cases, as confirmed by PCR tests, rose to 209,465 from 207,634 the day before. In recent days, the data has offered a glimmer of hope; Monday marked the fourth day in which the number of overnight deaths has hovered below 400 after reaching a high of 950 deaths on 2 April. The number of deaths and new infections is clearly on the decline, said Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies. \u201cAnd obviously this gives us hope.\u201d As Spain\u2019s outbreak appears to ease, residents have begun to get a glimpse of what health officials have described as the country\u2019s \u201cnew normality\u201d. On Sunday, more than 6 million children were allowed outside for the first time in six weeks. The daily outings come with stringent rules: Children must be 13 years of age or younger, stay within one kilometre of their homes and be supervised by one adult. The outings are limited to one hour once a day. While accusations of parents and children flouting physical distancing rules circulated on social media, the country\u2019s health minister, Salvador Illa, said Sunday most families appeared to be following the restrictions. The government would continue to monitor the situation closely, he added, \u201cand take steps if necessary\u201d. The military \u2013 deployed at the height of the crisis to help with tasks such as disinfecting care homes and setting up field hospitals \u2013 has also started to retreat from Spanish streets, with the number of officers dropping from around 3,500 last week to just over 2,000, according to the defence ministry. The Spanish government has said it is eyeing allowing adults to exercise outdoors as of 2 May if infections continue to fall. The country\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, is expected to present more detailed plans on how it will cautiously ease out of the lockdown on Tuesday. The relaxing of the emergency measures comes as officials scramble to get a better picture of how far-reaching the virus has been in Spain. On Monday, scientists began carrying out antibody tests on more than 36,000 randomly selected households across the country in a study that is expected to continue for weeks. Confirmed cases worldwide approach 3 million Cases are nearing the 3 million mark, according to Johns Hopkins University, with 2,981,592 confirmed. At least 206,803 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic, though the true toll is likely to be much higher due to under-reporting and some countries not including deaths among those with underlying conditions in their tolls. European countries cautiously ease lockdowns France is due to announce plans to ease its strict lockdown measures in promised \u201cdeconfinement plan\u201d. Germany has urged states to \u201cgo carefully\u201d with the lifting of restrictions. Primary school children in Norway have gone back to school after the government declared it had controlled the outbreak. Spain announced 331 more deaths as it begins to loosen lockdown rules. Greece is preparing to lift restrictions on movements to the islands. European stock markets have rallied. Boris Johnson says the UK is beginning to turn the tide The prime minister said the UK is turning the tide on tackling coronavirus but is still facing a moment of \u201cmaximum risk\u201d and he will not be forced to end the lockdown prematurely. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street on Monday, his first day back after recovering from coronavirus, he urged the public and business to contain their impatience to lift the restrictions. Iran announces 96 more deaths A further 96 people have died of coronavirus in Iran taking its death toll to 5,806, the ministry of heath announced. But Iran plans to go ahead with reopening of mosques in areas where the virus has not struck. Russia has passed China in the number of new infections Russia has confirmed 6,198 new coronavirus cases over the past day, bringing the total number in the country to 87,147 in all regions, the anti-coronavirus crisis centre reported on Monday. This is more than the 84,500 confirmed cases in China. Meanwhile, China has denied it is spreading disinformation about the virus. New Zealand prepares to move out of its strict lockdown measures The government reported only one new confirmed case of Covid-19 and said it had eliminated the virus. At 11.59pm on Monday, New Zealand will lift its level-4 lockdown which has been in place for more than four weeks. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the nation had \u201cwon the battle\u201d against widespread community transmission. More US states to end lockdown as economy crumbles Colorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee will join other US states in the lifting of lockdown restrictions, as economists predict an unemployment rate of 16% or higher for the month of April. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said some regions of the state might qualify to open sooner \u201cwith certain precautions\u201d, such as upstate New York, as the daily death toll was markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday. A further 96 people have died of coronavirus in Iran, taking its death toll to 5,806 the ministry of heath announced. So far, 91,472 people in the country have been infected the ministry said. On Sunday, President Hassan Rouhani, said Iran plans to reopen mosques in parts of the country that have been consistently free of coronavirus (see earlier). China\u2019s foreign ministry has denied claims that Beijing is spreading disinformation about the coronavirus following a European Union report that said there was \u201csignificant evidence\u201d of covert Chinese operations on social media, Reuters reports. \u201cChina is opposed to the creation and spreading of disinformation by anyone or any organisation. China is a victim of disinformation, not an initiator,\u201d said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang at a regular press briefing on Monday. The report by the EU\u2019s foreign policy arm said state-backed governments including China and Russia were responsible for spreading disinfomration on the virus. Reuters earlier reported that senior Chinese officials pressured the EU to drop the criticisms from the report last week, stating that it would make Beijing \u201cvery angry\u201d. The report was published late last week after a delay and some information regarding China was changed. An EU spokeswoman declined to comment. China has fiercely defended its handling of the novel coronavirus amid calls from some countries to initiate an independent investigation into the virus and its source. The foreign ministry\u2019s Geng said there was no conclusive evidence that the virus originated in China, and warned that \u201cpolitical manoeuvring\u201d behind calls for an independent investigation would not be successful. He also hit back at Donald Trump\u2019s claims that China has been hiding the true extent of the virus. He suggested Trump was trying to shift blame for his own failings. Kings Day in the Netherlands, the Dutch national birthday party for their monarch, has been a muted affair under lockdown, AP reports. King Willem-Alexander was celebrating his 53rd birthday with his family at home in their palace in a forest on the edge of The Hague after a mass celebration in the southern city of Maastricht was cancelled due to coronavirus. In a nationally televised speech to the nation, he paid tribute to health care workers and others battling the virus and hoped for better times ahead. Flanked by his wife, Maxima, and their three daughters, Willem-Alexander said the annual holiday would be \u201cespecially unique because I hope it will be absolutely the last Kings Day at home in history\u201d. Prime minister Mark Rutte tweeted his congratulations to the king, adding that he is celebrating Kings Day at home like the rest of the Netherlands. The best present we can give him is to follow that example, he said. Kings Day is usually a nationwide celebration involving street parties and children selling second-hand toys in makeshift garage sales known as free markets throughout the country. But early on Monday, streets were largely deserted apart from queues of shoppers observing social distancing guidelines outside bakeries selling traditional Kings Day pastries decorated with orange frosting. The coronavirus pandemic is likely to be followed by even more deadly and destructive disease outbreaks unless their root cause \u2013 the rampant destruction of the natural world \u2013 is rapidly halted, the world\u2019s leading biodiversity experts have warned. \u201cThere is a single species responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 us,\u201d they said. \u201cRecent pandemics are a direct consequence of human activity, particularly our global financial and economic systems that prize economic growth at any cost. We have a small window of opportunity, in overcoming the challenges of the current crisis, to avoid sowing the seeds of future ones.\u201d Professors Josef Settele, Sandra D\u00edaz and Eduardo Brondizio led the most comprehensive planetary health check ever undertaken, which was published in 2019 by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). It concluded that human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth\u2019s natural life-support systems. Spain\u2019s heath ministry has announced a further 331 deaths from Covid-19, taking its total to 23,521. The daily figure is a slight rise on Sunday, when 288 new deaths were announced. The total number of diagnosed cases rose to 209,465 from 207,634 the day before. The actors Meryl Streep, Christine Baranski and Audra McDonald got into hangover character for a lockdown sign song of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s, The Ladies Who Lunch. It features all three of them looking reassuringly dishevelled, in dressing gowns and sipping various beverages. The full video is here: A shorter clip is here: A proposal by the mayor of the Belgian seaside resort of Ostend for locals to get priority beach passes this summer to ensure physical distancing has ignited claims of discrimination and a debate about access to the coastline. The Belgian government outlined a plan to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown last week, but with holidays abroad likely to remain impossible, burgemeester Bart Tommelein has received tentative backing from the government\u2019s top virologist for his plan of a system of passes to keep people on beaches safe this summer. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an ants\u2019 nest here,\u201d Tommelein said when he proposed the beach passes plan, or strandpas in the local Flemish dialect used in the north of Belgium. The mayor\u2019s sliding scale of priority, with tax-paying locals, second home owners and hotel guests given preference, has provoked criticism among the other nine coastal municipalities, and sparked a discussion about the right of all Belgians to access the country\u2019s sandy beaches. Russia now has more confirmed coronavirus cases than China, the news agency Tass reports. Russia has confirmed 6,198 new coronavirus cases over the past day, bringing the total number in the country to 87,147 in all regions, the anti-coronavirus crisis centre reported on Monday. China has recorded 84,500 confirmed cases so far. A further 50 coronavirus patients have died over the past day, bringing Russia\u2019s death toll to 794. In that TV address Boris Johnson said it would be too early to ease up the lockdown in the UK because a second peak would be disaster. He also said he wants to involve opposition parties as much as possible in future plans. Our UK live blog has all the details. The French government will present its schedule for bringing the country out of a strict lockdown to parliament on Tuesday afternoon. President Emmanuel Macron and the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, have been finalising details of the \u201cdeconfinement plan\u201d that will be announced in the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, the lower house of parliament, at 3pm local time followed by a debate and a vote. Opposition MPs are angry they will be give only hours to discuss the plan and insist they need at least 24 hours to consider it and respond. Ministers from each sector were asked to present concrete proposals of how to end the coronavirus lockdown in six areas: health policy, school reopenings, the return to work for adults, businesses, transport and cultural or religious gatherings. The government is also hoping to have a Covid-19 tracking application available by 11 May, which has also raised concerns among the opposition benches. The scientific committee that is advising the government is reported to have serious reservations about the president\u2019s announcement that schools will reopen progressively from 11 May, describing it in a statement as a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d. The committee has advised schools remain closed until September. It has advised that the wearing of face masks be mandatory in public places and sanitising hand gel available to everyone. The health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, has said the authorities will aim to carry out between 500,000 and 700,000 tests for Covid-19 among those showing symptoms of the virus, but insisted it was \u201cimpossible to test everyone\u201d. Suggestions that the lockdown will be ended by region and by age, with older people being required to remain at home, have been reportedly ruled out. The measures in the plan will remain in place until mid-July and will be re-examined if there is a second coronavirus wave. Here are the latest Covid-19 figures from France, that has been under one of the more draconian lockdown regimes since 17 March. Restaurants, cafes, hotels and all non-essential shops have been closed since midnight on 14 March. Note that unlike the UK, the total number of deaths includes those in care homes. Number of cases: 124,575 (+461) Number in hospital: 28,217 (+481 gross, -5 net) Number in i/c: 4,682 (+79 gross, -43) Deaths in hospital: 14,202 (+152) Deaths in care homes: 4,815 (+90) Total deaths: 22,856 (+242) Discharged home: 44,903 (+318) Germany\u2019s economy minister has urged the country\u2019s 16 federal states to go slowly in lifting coronavirus restrictions to avoid the outbreak spreading further and being forced to backtrack later, Reuters reports Under Germany\u2019s decentralised political system, the states have the power to implement and rescind the social distancing measures on which Berlin is relying to slow the virus\u2019s spread, and Chancellor Angela Merkel is resisting pressure from some to further ease restrictions. Germany has had around 150,000 diagnosed cases of coronavirus, according to official figures published on Monday, but has only had 5,750 deaths, a far lower proportion of fatalities than neighbouring Italy, Spain, France and Britain. \u201cAs a person who believes in fact-based decisions, I recommend to all of us to proceed very carefully in order not to be forced into eventually rescinding easing measures,\u201d Peter Altmaier told Deutschlandfunk radio on Monday. Markus Soeder, the premier of Bavaria, which has imposed some of the strictest social distancing measures, said his state was only taking small steps towards easing lockdown in order not to jeopardise early successes in fighting the disease. Soeder told BR radio that 80% of the retail sector are open again. \u201cIf it works out this week, we can think about a further easing.\u201d In the UK, Boris Johnson is expected to make a speech from Downing Street after returning to work following his recovery from coronavirus. Our UK live blog will have all the details: Singapore has confirmed 799 more coronavirus infections, its health ministry said on Monday, taking the country\u2019s tally of cases to 14,423. Most of the new cases are among migrant workers living in dormitories in the city-state, which has among the highest number of coronavirus infections in Asia. Singapore recorded 931 new coronavirus infections on Sunday, following a rise of 618 cases on Saturday. European stock markets are all higher in early trading, as more countries prepare to ease lockdown restrictions. Our business blog has more: This week, the Guardian\u2019s Age of Extinction site is looking at biodiversity in cities and urban areas around the world, shining a spotlight on the under-appreciated world of nature hidden among the highrises and busy roads. Around 55% of the world\u2019s population live in urban areas and that number is projected to rise to 68% by 2050. Nature\u2019s role in the wellbeing and happiness of billions of people will be more important than ever. While urbanisation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, many conservationists and town planners are trying to make built-up areas more nature-friendly. The role of green spaces in urban areas has even been formalised in a draft UN agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, often referred to as the Paris agreement for nature. The Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way. In this special series of reports we\u2019ll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future. Here\u2019s the first piece in the series: Primary schools reopen in Norway Children have begun returning to school in Norway, as primary schools reopen after the government claimed the coronavirus epidemic is under control, AFP reports. One week after nursery schools, pupils aged six to 10 started returning to their school desks after six weeks of remote learning from home. Classes were however reduced to a maximum of 15 students. Norway has progressively begun lifting restrictions imposed on 12 March to combat the spread of coronavirus. Hair salons and dermatologists were also authorised to resume business. Many measures remain in place, such as bans on sporting and cultural events, as well as physical distancing and hygiene recommendations. \u201cWe should not let down our guard, we have to work hard to keep the spread under control,\u201d prime minister Erna Solberg said on Friday. \u201cIf we\u2019re not careful, this could have serious consequences for others. In the worst of cases, we\u2019ll have to tighten restrictions again. We\u2019ll have to make sure to avoid that.\u201d Some parents however find the return to school premature, noting that several staff at nursery schools have tested positive for the virus since they went back last week. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me that it gets worse when the schools reopen,\u201d one user wrote on the Facebook page \u201cMy child should not be a guinea pig for Covid-19\u201d that has almost 30,000 members. By Sunday, Norway had reported 7,505 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus and 193 deaths, while the curve of hospitalised cases has dropped significantly in recent weeks. Here\u2019s a graphic showing which European countries have started to ease coronavirus lockdowns or proposing to do so: Greece is preparing to lift restrictions on movement to islands and other parts of the country in June, media reports suggested on Monday. In an address to the nation on Tuesday, the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, is expected to outline how measures enforced to curb coronavirus almost two months ago will be gradually eased. The lockdown will be reversed in stages and is likely to require at least two months to unfold with small shops, hairdressers, beauticians and barbers opening on 4 May and secondary school students returning to class on 11 May. Restaurants, tavernas and other eateries will follow but will only be permitted to function with outside tables. \u201cThe return to normality will likely happen in three stages, at the beginning of May, the end of May and mid June,\u201d said one insider. Government officials say it is essential that the economy is unlocked in a country that was only beginning to recover from a long and punishing debt crisis when the pandemic struck. The country\u2019s tourist-reliant economy is on course to contract by as much as 10% this year, the finance minister announced at the weekend. Greece enforced measures to combat the deadly disease \u201chard and early\u201d and has, as a result, fared better than most other EU member states with a death toll of 134 and 2,517 confirmed cases of the novel virus to date. The time gained has allowed the government to beef up the public health system \u2013 hit by successive budget cuts during the financial crisis - increasing the number of intensive care beds by 80% and employing an extra 3,200 medical staff. But Mitsotakis has already spoken of a possible second wave in the winter. With the war against the virus not yet over, aides say he will insist on the need for vigilance in the months ahead. Photojournalist Pablo Garc\u00eda Sacrist\u00e1n spent a day and night with Madrid\u2019s Summa crews, offering medical - and psychological \u2013 support to coronavirus patients. German companies including ThyssenKrupp, Salzgitter, Bayer, Covestro, E.ON, HeidelbergCement, Puma, Allianz and Deutsche Telekom have called for coronavirus-related state aid to be tied to climate action, Reuters reports. \u201cWe appeal to the federal government to closely link economic policy measures to overcome both the climate crisis and the coronavirus crisis,\u201d more than 60 companies said in letter to the Handelsblatt newspaper, ahead of the Petersberg climate dialogue starting on Monday. The companies are concerned that environmental issues will be put on the backburner during the Covid-19 pandemic. Car makers are already lobbying to prevent the announced tightening of emissions limits on cars, airlines for a waiver on jet fuel taxes, and the plastics industry for an appeal of the ban on some plastics products. \u201cThe pandemic highlights the vulnerability of our globalized economic system to threats that are not limited to regions or industries,\u201d the appeal says. \u201cClimate change is a comparable challenge.\u201d The German BDI industry association said it was sticking to the European goal of climate neutrality, or net zero greenhouse gas emissions, in 2050, but warned that governments, companies and households will in future have reduced scope for investments. \u201cThe EU\u2019s Green Deal must therefore become a Smart Deal, in which growth, employment and ambitious climate protection targets are linked as efficiently as possible via an intelligent investment and relief package,\u201d said BDI deputy managing director Holger Loesch. A team of more than 200 doctors from Cuba have arrived in South Africa to help it tackle coronavirus. They are among 1,200 healthcare workers sent to battle Covid-19 in 22 countries that have requested help from Cuba. This is Matthew Weaver picking up the global coronavirus live blog. Please send any developments that we might have missed from your part of the world to matthew.weaver@theguardian.com or tweet me @matthew_weaver . That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan. Today I leave you with a movie recommendation. Over to you, Matthew Weaver. Confirmed cases worldwide approach 3 million. Cases are nearing the 3 million mark, according to Johns Hopkins University, with 2,971,669 confirmed. At least 206,549 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic, though the true toll is likely to be much higher due to under-reporting and some countries not including deaths among those with underlying conditions in their tolls. New Zealand prepares to move out of its strict lockdown measures. The government reported only one new confirmed case of Covid-19 and said it had eliminated the virus. At 11.59pm on Monday, New Zealand will lift its level-4 lockdown which has been in place for more than four weeks. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the nation had \u201cwon the battle\u201d against widespread community transmission. More US states to end lockdown as economy crumbles. Colorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee will join other US states in the lifting of lockdown restrictions, as economists predict an unemployment rate of 16% or higher for the month of April. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said some regions of the state might qualify to open sooner \u201cwith certain precautions\u201d, such as upstate New York, as the daily death toll was markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday. The UK economy will take three years to recover from coronavirus. It will take the UK economy three years to fully recover from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a leading forecasting group. As the damage to jobs and growth unfolds, the EY Item Club said it would take until 2023 for the the economy to return to the level reached at the end of last year due to the depth of the crisis, Richard Partington reports. British PM returns to Downing Street. Boris Johnson returned to Downing Street on Sunday night for the first time since he was admitted to hospital with Covid-19 on 6 April. The UK reported its lowest daily rise in the death toll since the end of March. The number of deaths in UK hospitals from the coronavirus has risen to 20,732 \u2013 an increase of 413 in the last 24 hours Trump denies he will fire his health chief. US president Donald Trump, who for a second day skipped the White House press briefing, on Twitter denied reports that he planned to fire health and human services secretary Alex Azar. He said Azar was doing \u201can excellent job!\u201d. Trump also attacked the press, and was roundly mocked after tweeting about \u201cNoble\u201d prize for journalists, seeming to mean the Nobel prizes \u2013 which are not awarded in the field of journalism. Lebanon\u2019s roads blocked in protest at dire economy. Demonstrators blocked roads through Lebanon late on Sunday to protest against the deteriorating economic situation, despite a lockdown and curfew imposed because of the coronavirus.

Egypt asks IMF for coronavirus bailout loan. Egypt declared on Sunday that it had asked the International Monitory Fund (IMF) for financial assistance to deal with the economic fallout caused by the coronavirus. Neither Egypt nor the IMF specified the size of the one-year bailout loan. Thailand on Monday confirmed nine new coronavirus cases and one death, bringing the country\u2019s totals to 2,931 cases and 52 fatalities, Reuters reports. It is the first time since the outbreak started in January that there have been no new local transmissions reported in Bangkok, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the government\u2019s Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration. Of the new cases, three were linked to previous cases, two are arrivals from overseas that have been under state quarantined, and four others were reported from the southern province of Yala, where the authorities are aggressively testing the population due to high infection rates. The latest death was of a 64-year-old Thai woman. Since the outbreak escalated in January 2,609 patients have recovered and gone home. Wuhan discharges all coronavirus patients as Beijing takes steps to stop second wave The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus pandemic began, has discharged all of its coronavirus patients, as the nation reported only three new cases and no new deaths. According to the National Health Commission, as of Sunday the number of new coronavirus patients in Wuhan was at zero. \u201cThanks to the joint efforts of Wuhan and medical staff from around the country,\u201d said a spokesman for the commission, Mi Feng. Two of the three new cases on Sunday were imported infections, while the third was a locally transmitted case in the northeastern border province of Heilongjiang, which has seen an uptick in cases as Chinese nationals have rushed back home from Russia. China, which has recorded more than 82,000 cases and a total of 4,633 deaths, has begun to gradually reopen after months of paralysis. On Monday, almost 50,000 high school students in their third year, the most important for preparing for the national university entrance exam known as the gaokao, returned to class in Beijing. Other cities and provinces have announced various dates for reopening schools. At the same time, authorities are still worried about a second wave of infections: Monday briefing: Pressure\u2019s on as Johnson returns to No 10 Boris Johnson will resume control of Britain\u2019s faltering response to the coronavirus crisis today as pressure mounts on his government to spell out how it will begin to ease the lockdown and reopen schools and businesses. The prime minister last night returned to Downing Street where the question of how to lift restrictions is the most pressing matter in an overflowing in-tray, which also includes fixing the government\u2019s decision-making structure and dealing with the Brexit talks impasse. How to reach the target of 100,000 tests per day is also a key issue and ministers are considering ordering millions of antibody testing kits in the hope of establishing immunity levels across the country. Doctors working in the riskiest areas of the UK\u2019s hospitals with Covid-19 patients are finding it harder to get protective kit, despite ministerial pledges to solve the problem, research reveals. The Royal College of Physicians has condemned the apparently worsening availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) as \u201ctruly terrible\u201d and warned that frontline staff\u2019s lives are at risk as a result. Among doctors performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGP), in which patients with the disease release droplets from their mouth, 37% cannot always access a visor to wear while 31% have not been able to obtain a full-length surgical gown. Both are key elements of the full PPE NHS staff are advised to wear when participating in an AGP, such as a patient being intubated before being ventilated. A survey undertaken by the college, to which 2,129 hospital doctors responded last week, found medics are finding it harder generally access to any sort of PPE. Just over a quarter (27%) said they could not get the kit they needed to keep them safe while treating people with Covid-19, up from 22% who said the same when the RCP conducted the same survey at the start of April. Here\u2019s a look at some of this morning\u2019s front pages: Locked-down advertisers ask: is it too soon for jokes? Jim Waterson and Mark Sweney report for the Guardian: Advertisers are struggling to work out how to promote their products during an age of physical distancing, walking the tightrope between continuing to sell goods where possible, building their brands, and trying not to look insensitive. Already there are a few basic rules of thumb that are changing how advertising looks. Footage of people socialising outside the home is out, as it may look jarring to audiences in lockdown; adverts that resemble Zoom calls are in, but may already be a cliche; and everyone\u2019s trying to work out how to create new promotions without being allowed outside. Fijian military leader defends government\u2019s right to \u2018stifle\u2019 press during Covid crisis Kelvin Anthony reports for the Guardian: A Fijian military leader has said the government was justified in \u201cstifling criticism\u201d of its policies by the press during the Covid-19 outbreak, prompting warnings that Pacific leaders should not use the coronavirus crisis as an excuse to quell press freedom. The comments have been condemned by press freedom advocates as the \u201ckind of behaviour [that] is the prerogative of authoritative military dictatorships.\u201d In a Fiji Sun op-ed last week, Jone Kalouniwai, a brigadier-general in the Republic of Fiji Military Forces (RFMF), defended the view that Covid-19 is a good reason to take away the media\u2019s right to question policy decisions. \u2018It\u2019s catastrophic\u2019: Fiji\u2019s colossal tourism sector devastated by coronavirusRead more \u201c[I]n times of such national emergency, our leaders have good reasons to stifle criticism of their policies by curtailing freedom of speech and freedom of the press,\u201d wrote Kalouniwai, who added that the fight against Covid-19, was \u201clikely to end up violating the individual rights and rule of law that are at the heart of any liberal society.\u201d Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan.

Mexico has begun removing staff from Gulf of Mexico oil platforms to limit the spread of the coronavirus, leaving essential personnel on board, state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) said on Sunday. Pemex said in a statement that workers had started coming off the rigs as Mexico implements stricter measures to combat the coronavirus since entering the highest phase of a public health alert last Tuesday, Reuters reports. Some 259 rig workers disembarked on Sunday at the Gulf port city of Ciudad del Carmen, Pemex said in a statement. Of them, 76 worked for Pemex, while the rest were employed by firms working for the state oil firm, the company said. A source at Pemex, speaking on condition of anonymity, earlier said the oil platforms would be left with between half and a quarter of their normal personnel. Pemex has so far confirmed 248 cases of the coronavirus and 28 deaths. Five of the dead were current Pemex workers, 14 were retired employees, one an external employee and eight were relatives of workers. OPEC+ had pressed Mexico to make cuts of 400,000 barrels per day (bpd), but Lopez Obrador agreed only to 100,000 bpd in May and June and said the United States had pledged to make up most of the difference. The Pemex source told Reuters the personnel reductions on platforms would likely lead to a drop in oil output considerably more than the cuts Mexico had agreed to. Offshore areas in the Gulf produce around 1.4 million bpd of Mexico\u2019s total output of some 1.7 million bpd. Fried chicken and bento: New Zealanders dream of takeaways as lockdown prepares to lift On Tuesday, New Zealand\u2019s restaurants, cafes and takeaways will be back in business.

Demonstrators blocked roads through Lebanon late Sunday to protest the deteriorating economic situation, despite a lockdown and curfew imposed because of the coronavirus, according to the official news agency. Police quickly intervened to reopen the highways where the demonstrators burned tyres to block roads, the ANI national news agency said. Protesters have staged several daytime demonstrations recently, including a convoy of cars in the capital last week, despite the coronavirus lockdown and nighttime curfew. A nationwide protest movement erupted in October last year, with hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating against the ruling elite and the rampant graft critics say has brought the economy to its knees. Lebanon\u2019s worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war is now compounded by the coronavirus lockdown. Poverty has risen to 45% of the population, according to official estimates. Its economy is forecast to contract 12% in 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund. The Lebanese pound has also plummeted against the dollar, resulting in high inflation. New Zealand\u2019s director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, on Donald Trump\u2019s bleach comments: More from New Zealand now: New Zealand is preparing to move out of the strictest lockdown measures in the country\u2019s history as the government reported only one new confirmed case of Covid-19 and said it had eliminated the virus. At 11.59pm on Monday, New Zealand will lift its level-4 lockdown which has been in place for more than four weeks. During that time, almost all businesses have been closed, along with schools while the population has been asked to remain in their homes for all but supermarket visits and short walks. At a press conference on Monday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in level-3 there were new risks \u2013 namely people coming into more contact with others. Are female leaders more successful at managing the coronavirus crisis?Read more Level 3 will see retailers, restaurants and schools allowed to reopen on a smaller scale. Schools will reopen on Wednesday for children up to Year 10 who cannot study from home, or whose parents need to return to work. Workers will also be able to resume on-site work, provided they have a Covid-19 control plan in place, with appropriate health and safety and physical distancing measures. It is expected one million New Zealanders will return to work on Tuesday. French police have seized 140,000 face masks intended for the black market in a record haul since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, AFP reports. It is the largest seizure since the French government banned the resale of protective masks to prioritise their distribution to health workers in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. Two individuals were arrested while they were unloading boxes in Saint-Denis, just north of Paris, a police source said on Sunday. One of them said he was a business owner and had bought the masks, including 5,000 high protection FFP2 masks, in the Netherlands for a total of \u20ac80,000 (US$87,000). The masks were to be sold to construction workers for a large profit, according to police. In March, 32,500 masks from China were seized from a warehouse near Paris and 28,800 masks were discovered in a shop in a district of Chinese wholesalers, also in the Paris region. New Zealanders will be allowed to go fishing, surfing, hunting and hiking this week for the first time in more than a month as the country begins to ease its way out of a strict lockdown that successfully slowed the spread of the coronavirus, Reuters reports. Around 400,000 people will return to work after the country shifts its alert level down a notch at midnight on Monday, but shops and restaurants will remain closed as several social restrictions remain in place. New Zealand\u2019s 5 million residents were subjected to one of the strictest lockdowns in the world in response to the pandemic, with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern closing offices, schools, bars and restaurants, including take away and delivery services, on March 26. While Ardern has generally received public support, there has been growing criticism that similar results may have been achieved with less stringent lockdown measures, as in Australia. Getting the $200 billion trade and tourism dependent economy running again from a standing start will be a major challenge for Ardern as she faces national elections in September. Mexico has almost entirely cleared out government migrant centres over the past five weeks to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, returning most of the occupants to their countries of origin, official data showed on Sunday. In a statement, the National Migration Institute (INM) said that since 21 March, in order to comply with health and safety guidelines, it had been removing migrants from its 65 migrant facilities, which held 3,759 people last month. In the intervening weeks, Mexico has returned 3,653 migrants to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador by road and air, with the result that only 106 people remain in the centres, it said. Most of the migrants passing through Mexico to reach the U.S. border are from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. More than 80 Guatemalan migrants deported to their homeland from the United States have tested positive for the coronavirus. Podcast: Covid-19\u2019s continued spread into South America From his temporary home in Rio de Janerio, the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent, Tom Phillips, can hear the nightly protests against Brazilian president Jair Bolsorano\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, where cases are steadily rising. He discusses how Brazil and other South American countries are trying to deal with the pandemic: Japan\u2019s Osaka Prefecture said it will name and shame more pachinko parlour gambling outlets that are defying coronavirus lockdown requests after three out of six locations it identified on Friday subsequently closed, Reuters reports. \u201cA lot of places have closed down after we named the six last week. We are now conducting a survey of pachinko parlours and will announce the results accordingly,\u201d a spokesman for Osaka Prefecture said. The continued operation of some noisy gambling halls is a conspicuous reminder of the limits of Japanese government\u2019s ability to lock down cities with requests rather than orders backed up with fines. Japan declared a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other areas on April 7 that it later extended to the rest of the country. Pachinko parlours, where players sit back-to-back at long rows of machines with bouncing steel balls and garish lights, are a common sight in Japan and easy for health officials to identify. For the second time this month, Saturday Night Live made a surprise return to deliver a new episode filmed remotely. This time, virtual hosting duties fell to Brad Pitt, playing lead member of the White House coronavirus task force, Dr Anthony Fauci. The raspy voiced physician thanks \u201call the older women in America who have sent me supportive, inspiring and sometimes graphic emails\u201d, before clearing up a number of President Trump\u2019s false claims about coronavirus: Coronavirus is making Australia\u2019s drug crisis a whole lot worse In Australia, earlier this month, the Victorian state government issued new guidelines for dispensing methadone and buprenorphine during the Covid-19 crisis. Commonly used as replacement substances for opioid addiction, most users are required to travel daily to pharmacies to access their prescriptions. But the new guidelines mean that, with some restrictions, pharmacies are able to offer takeaway doses earlier in a patient\u2019s therapy. Other states are trying similar things. In New South Wales, addiction specialists are pushing for earlier access to longer-acting replacement therapies to reduce the need for patients to visit clinics. Across Australia, the Covid-19 crisis has prompted a seismic reckoning in addiction medicine. While people like George are managing to find a way through the crisis, experts are concerned that rising substance abuse fuelled by the virus, coupled with new restrictions on an already over-burdened drug and alcohol rehabilitation system, could see Australia staring down a crisis in addiction. More than a million Australians rushed to download an app designed to help medical workers and state governments trace close contacts of Covid-19 patients, Reuters reports, as Prime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s approval rating soared on his pandemic response. Australia has been one of the most successful countries in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, recording just 83 deaths and 6,700 cases, due to border closures, movement restrictions and a stay-at-home policy. It has lowered its infection rate to currently around 1% from 25% in March. Health Minister Greg Hunt said 1.13 million Australians downloaded the tracing app CovidSafe as of 6am (20.00 GMT) on Monday, nearly 4.5% of the country\u2019s population. The first one million came within five hours of launching the app, he added. When asked how many people need to download the app for it to be successful, Hunt said \u201cthere is no magic number.\u201d \u201cAs many as possible is our real goal,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is about assisting our disease experts find people who might have been exposed and we are well ahead of our best hopes and expectations already.\u201d Here\u2019s an explainer about how the app works \u2013 and the privacy concerns involved: The surge in downloads come as a Newspoll conducted for The Australian newspaper (paywalled) showed Morrison enjoyed the best approval rating for a leader since end-2008. The Bank of Japan is expected to expand monetary stimulus on Monday for the second straight month to ease corporate funding strains and finance huge government spending aimed at combating the deepening economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Such a move would put the BOJ in line with other major central banks that have unleashed unprecedented amounts of monetary support amid the health crisis. Sources have told Reuters the BOJ is likely to take further steps to ease funding strains for companies whose sales have collapsed, such as boosting purchases of corporate bonds and commercial debt. The central bank may also clarify its commitment to buy unlimited amounts of government bonds by scrapping loose guidance to buy them at an annual pace of \u00a580tn (US$744bn) per year, say sources familiar with its thinking. Removing the guidance will be largely symbolic, they say. The BOJ has only purchased less than \u00a520tn per year, as the bank\u2019s huge presence in the market allows it to control yields with fewer purchases. China has reported no new coronavirus deaths on 26 April \u2013 the same as the day before. It reported three new mainland cases, compared to 11 the previous day and 25 asymptomatic cases, compared to 30 the day before, and two new imported cases, compared to five the day before. Mainland China now has an accumulated total of 82,830 cases. It also recorded a total of 4,633 deaths as of the end of April 26, including one more death in Beijing in the tally that was previously unaccounted for. From China \u2013 social distancing but make it fashion: A look at cases in Panama and Mexico now: Confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in Panama reached 5,779 on Sunday, a rise of 241 from the previous day, and deaths climbed by six to 165, the health ministry said. Director of Epidemiology Lourdes Moreno announced the Central American country\u2019s latest data at a news conference. Mexico\u2019s cases, meanwhile, rose by 835 to 14,677. There were 46 more deaths, bringing the total to 1351, according to the health ministry. Iran plans to reopen mosques in parts of the country that have been consistently free of the coronavirus outbreak as restrictions on Iranians gradually ease, President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday. Iran is one of the Middle Eastern countries hit hardest by the pandemic. It will be divided up into white, yellow and red regions based on the number of infections and deaths, Rouhani said, according to the presidency\u2019s website. Activities in each region will be restricted accordingly, so an area that has been consistently free of infections or deaths will be labelled white and mosques could be reopened and Friday prayers resumed, Rouhani said. He said the label given to any region in the Islamic Republic could change and he did not specify when the colour-coding programme would come into force. Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi said in an interview with state TV on Sunday that 116 counties in the country could be considered white at the moment and 134 yellow. Iranians have returned to shops, bazaars and parks over the past week as the country eases coronavirus restrictions, with the daily increase in the death toll below 100 since April 14. The toll rose by 60 over the past 24 hours to 5,710, with 90,481 confirmed cases, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur told state TV on Sunday. It will take the UK economy three years to fully recover from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a leading forecasting group. As the damage for jobs and growth unfolds, the EY Item Club said it would take until 2023 for the the economy to return to the level reached at the end of last year due to the depth of the crisis. One month on from the imposition of lockdown measures across Britain, effectively bringing large swathes of the economy to a halt, the group warned that almost half of all consumer spending in 2020 \u2013 the major engine of UK growth over recent decades \u2013 is at risk of either being delayed or lost completely. The group of economists said GDP was set to collapse by 6.8% in 2020, before returning to positive growth of 4.5% in 2021 as businesses try to make up for lost time and consumers ramp up their spending again. The emirate of Dubai said on Sunday it has lifted its full lockdown on two commercial districts which have a large population of low-income migrant workers, after the United Arab Emirates eased nationwide coronavirus curfews over the weekend, Reuters reports. Dubai on Friday cut its emirate-wide 24-hour lockdown back to a 10.00pm to 6.00am curfew. It has now taken the same step in the Al Ras and Naif districts, which had been sealed off as part of efforts to contain the spread of the virus. The Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management took the decision since no new Covid-19 cases were recorded in the two areas in the last two days, the government media office said in a statement. It said more than 6,000 tests were conducted among Al Ras and Naif residents in less than a month. The UAE has reported more than 10,300 cases and 76 deaths resulting from the virus, the second-highest count among the six Gulf Arab countries after Saudi Arabia. It does not give breakdowns for each of the seven emirates that make up the country. Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, has cautioned that social distancing measures are likely to stay in place throughout the summer, as she sought to downplay the president\u2019s dangerous suggestion that injected disinfectant and ultraviolet light could play a role in the medical treatment of Covid-19. Birx made a number of appearances on the Sunday morning TV news shows, where she was asked about Trump\u2019s outlandish comments made at a White House briefing on Thursday, which prompted immediate backlash from medical experts and industrial manufacturers who cited the potentially fatal outcome of such a process. Trump has falsely claimed the comments were sarcastic. Appearing on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Birx was asked if she was bothered by the fallout from the president\u2019s remarks. \u201cIt bothers me that this is still in the news cycle, because I think we\u2019re missing the bigger pieces of what we need to be doing as an American people to continue to protect one another,\u201d Birx said. \u201cAs a scientist and a public health official and a researcher, sometimes I worry that we don\u2019t get the information to the American people that they need when we continue to bring up something that was from Thursday night.\u201d US President Donald Trump, who for a second day skipped the White House press briefing, took to Twitter to deny reports that he planned to fire Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar: Trump also attacked the press, and was roundly mocked after tweeting about \u201cNoble\u201d prize for journalists, seeming to mean the Nobel prizes \u2013 which aren\u2019t awarded in the field of journalism \u2013 or Pulitzers. Several 2019 Pulitzer winners interrogated his administration. \u201cWhen will all of the \u201creporters\u201d who have received Noble [sic] Prizes for their work on Russia, Russia, Russia, only to have been proven totally wrong (and, in fact, it was the other side who committed the crimes), be turning back their cherished \u201cNobles\u201d so that they can be given ....to the REAL REPORTERS &amp; JOURNALISTS who got it right.\u201d Trump later tweeted that he had meant \u201cNoble\u201d as in \u201chaving or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals,\u201d and that he was being sarcastic in the earlier tweet. He has also claimed sarcasm as the intention behind is comments about injecting disinfectant. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.

World Health Organisation clarifies statement about immunity following concern among scientists. The global health body was criticised for saying there was \u201ccurrently no evidence\u201d that people who recover from Covid-19 will have some immunity from reinfection. Russia could experience a new spike in cases if people flout lockdown measures during public holidays scheduled for early May, a top health official said on Sunday, after total reported infections in Russia topped 80,000. Chile is to push ahead with immunity passports and is planning to issue previously announced \u201crelease certificates\u201d for recovered Covid-19 patients \u2018\u201csoon\u201d, despite a World Health Organization warning that it is not clear whether people have immunity after becoming infected.
