      "bodyText": "A troubled super fund run by an offshoot of the Commonwealth Bank has had the highest proportion of withdrawals under Josh Frydenberg\u2019s coronavirus early access scheme, according to data compiled by Guardian Australia. Smaller superannuation funds appear to be hardest hit by applications for early release of super, the data suggests. The average amount people using the scheme have so far drawn out is about $8,000. You are allowed to draw a maximum of $10,000 before 30 June and another $10,000 after that. The Guardian has drawn together data about early releases so far applied for under the scheme, released this week by the prudential regulator, and data about the size and memberships of funds released last year to figure out which have taken the biggest hit. You can look up your fund using our interactive widget below. The data isn\u2019t perfect, because the fund size data dates from June 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic wiped about 30% from global share markets. How much of a hit any individual super fund has taken from the worldwide stock market rout depends on how it invested its assets, which varies from fund to fund. However, hospitality industry fund Hostplus, which on the Guardian\u2019s figures saw 1.4% of its assets redeemed under the scheme, said its withdrawals were about 1.5% so far \u2013 a very close match. Readers can also check to see what percentage of members have asked for early release. Leading the table for drawdowns was Commonwealth Essential Super, a $3.8bn fund that has lost about 5.4% of its value to coronavirus early withdrawals. Problems with the fund, which is closed to new members, were raised at the banking royal commission and it is the subject of a class action against the bank over the low rates paid to members who chose to invest in cash. The fund is managed by CBA division Colonial First State, which the bank is in the process of selling. A CFS spokeswoman said the average member balance in the fund was about $18,000. She said that across all the funds managed by CFS requests for early access have totalled about 65,000, or 7% of super customers, for a dollar value of about $473m, she said. \u201cColonial First State\u2019s investment approach has always favoured investing in assets that have a high level of liquidity,\u201d she said. \u201cThis approach has proven its value with the early release scheme.

      "bodyText": "International students and other temporary visa holders locked out of federal government support are relying on food banks and restaurants giving away free meals to survive during the coronavirus pandemic. Images of long lines outside emergency relief services have emerged in the international student hubs of Sydney and Melbourne, as well as smaller cities including Darwin. Australia has more than 560,000 international students, many of whom have supported themselves with part-time or casual jobs while studying. But as the economy has shut down and with the federal government declining to offer direct financial support to temporary visa holders, the queues forming outside food banks each day suggest that startling numbers are now struggling to feed themselves. National food relief charities say the increase in demand has been huge, driven by a surge in requests from temporary visa holders. Brianna Casey, the chief executive of FoodBank, said her organisation usually provided 815,000 meals a month across the country through its partner charities. It has experienced a 50% increase in demand during the pandemic. \u201cWe had a group of students present to one of our food banks on the weekend who hadn\u2019t eaten for a week,\u201d Casey said. \u201cWe are seeing right now across the country is an extreme impact on that cohort of university and college students. We are very, very concerned about their welfare at the moment.\u201d Pardeep, a nursing student from India who studies at the University of Wollongong, told Guardian Australia she had never expected to be relying on charities for food and groceries. \u201cIt\u2019s a really big surprise for me,\u201d she said. But after losing her income when her work dried up, she now receives meals and groceries from Turbans 4 Australia, a Sikh community group which is distributing 600 meals a day from its headquarters in Sydney\u2019s west. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t provide meals or anything, it would be very hard for us,\u201d Pardeep said. Turbans 4 Australia\u2019s president, Amar Singh, said 700 international students had contacted the group through an online form to ask for help with groceries and other expenses. \u201cMany are international students who have recently just landed in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are in a new country, no friends, no family. They were thinking, \u2018I\u2019ll blend into the society\u2019 \u2013 and now they are locked in the room that they\u2019ve got.\u201d On Thursday OzHarvest, with support from the City of Sydney council, handed out more than 450 hampers in the inner-city suburb of Redfern. OzHarvest\u2019s NSW state manager, Richard Watson, said there had been a \u201csteady stream of people throughout the day\u201d, mostly international students. In Darwin a group of international students have established Kindness Shake, which is now cooking up more than 200 meals a service, twice a week, for their colleagues and other visa holders. \u201cNot only are they fed, but also they can be given a kind and genuine smile from other international students,\u201d said an organiser, Ben Poveda-Alfonso, who is from Colombia. Cultural communities have also banded together to support students from their home countries. Every Friday Weeraphan Vibulphan has been at Boon Cafe in central Sydney helping distribute food to Thai students. About 20 Thai restaurants are now taking turns providing free meals to students, said Vibulphan, including the restaurant Chat Thai. \u201cWe try to help them with dry food, rice, sometimes we give away hot meals for them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all know each other, it\u2019s quite a small community.\u201d Vibulphan said students were notified via a Facebook page and the restaurants usually gave away 100 food boxes a day. \u201cIt\u2019s gone in 10 minutes,\u201d Vibulphan said of the demand. Other countries, including Britain, New Zealand and Canada, have offered international students some government support. In Australia they are locked out of the jobseeker and jobkeeper schemes but can access their superannuation and some states have offered some relief payments. Singh said Turbans 4 Australia had noticed a surge in the demand for assistance from international students after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, last month warned that those who could not afford to stay in Australia should go home. Pardeep said she understood it was \u201chard for the government to manage\u201d everything. \u201cBut if you look at it from the point of view of students, they have to pay something to us,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government has passed a $130bn support package with a new jobkeeper payment \u2013 a wage subsidy to keep Australians in work. So who exactly is eligible for this payment and how much will they receive? How much is the payment worth? The federal government will pay eligible employers $1,500 per fortnight for each eligible worker, about 70% of the national median wage. Jobkeeper is about $400 a fortnight more than the $1,100 jobseeker paymentwith the coronavirus supplement for those out of work. Who is eligible for jobkeeper? In order to receive a payment, both the employer and employee must meet eligibility criteria. Eligible employers are businesses (including companies, partnerships, trusts and sole traders), not-for-profits and charities: With a turnover of less than $1bn that have lost 30% or more of their revenue compared to a comparable period a year ago. With a turnover of $1bn or more and with at least a 50% reduction in revenue compared to a comparable period a year ago. For registered charities the threshold is a decline in turnover of 15% or more, under changes announced on 6 April. Charities are allowed to exclude government revenue from the turnover test. Universities are not entitled to the lower threshold applied to charities. On 24 April the government ruled that universities must count commonwealth grants funding towards their revenue, and on 30 April that they must count six months of revenue when calculating their projected downturn, rather than one month or three as for other institutions. Together these restrictions mean no university qualifies for jobkeeper. The big banks subject to the banking levy are not eligible. Public sector employers (and, by extension, their employees) are not eligible for jobkeeper - and on 3 April the national cabinet clarified that this also applies to local councils. Partnerships are eligible but can only claim on behalf of one partner and the employees of the business. On 24 April the government announced special purpose services entities would be subject to a modified turnover test, measuring the revenue decline of the related entities using the services of the employer entity. Eligible employees: Were employed by an eligible employer at 1 March 2020 Can be sole traders, full-time, part-time, or long-term casuals employed on a regular basis for longer than 12 months as at 1 March 2020. Are at least 16 years of age, but those aged 16 or 17 must be financially independent to qualify Are an Australian citizen, the holder of a permanent visa, a protected special category visa, a non-protected special category visa who has been residing continually in Australia for 10 years or more, or a New Zealander on a special category (subclass 444) visa. The government estimates that 6 million workers will receive this payment. Gig economy workers will be covered, as they are sole traders. On Tuesday 28 April Treasury officials said that 540,000 employers had formally registered for the jobkeeper wage subsidy scheme, covering an estimated 3.3m employees. What if I am on a temporary visa? Scott Morrison explained that New Zealanders on 444 visas would get the payment because \u201cthey are part of an ongoing economy in Australia\u201d. \u201cWe are about keeping them part of it economy because they are part of what happens on the other side,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra. The government has announced it will allow backpackers to extend their stay in Australia and most temporary visa holders to access superannuation payments early. Seasonal workers will be exempt from a rule that normally prevents them from staying with the same employer for more than six months. Any seasonal workers will have to self-isolate for 14 days before they start working in regional communities. How will it be paid? Eligible employers will have to pay $1,500 per fortnight per eligible employee from 30 March 2020, and will be reimbursed monthly in arrears starting from 1 May. Employers have until 8 May to make payments for April, but can join the scheme at any time. Jobkeeper is legislated to continue for up to six months. Eligible employees will receive from their employers a minimum of $1,500 per fortnight, before tax. Employers are able to top up the payment. Will I receive $1,500 even if I ordinarily earn less? If an employee ordinarily receives less than $1,500 in income per fortnight before tax, their employer must pay them, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight, before tax. It is therefore possible for a long-term casual or part-time worker to receive more than their ordinary pay. However, employers have gained new powers to change the ordinary hours, duties and location of work, meaning they may vary work to match the $1,500 payment. They cannot vary workers\u2019 ordinary rate of pay. What if I was stood down or sacked? If an employee has been stood down, their employer must pay their employee, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight, before tax. This means that employees of businesses that shut down due to various restrictions \u2013 such as cafes, restaurants, theatres, casino workers and the like \u2013 will continue to be paid even if they are not working. If an employee was employed on 1 March 2020, subsequently ceased employment with their employer, and then has been re-engaged by the same eligible employer, the employee will also receive, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight, before tax. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said this payment \u201cchanges the equation\u201d and he expects employers who were forced to lay off workers may now \u201cput them back on the books\u201d. When will it start being paid? The subsidy will be backdated to start on 30 March, with the first payments to be received by employers in the first week of May. In the meantime, employers must pay their employees $1,500 fortnightly and then claim the money from the first week of May. Jobkeeper operates with a one-in all-in principle, meaning that once an employer decides to participate it must pay jobkeeper to all eligible employees who complete nomination forms. What about superannuation? Employers must continue to pay the superannuation guarantee on regular wages but it is up to employer whether they pay superannuation on additional jobkeeper payments. For example, a worker who ordinarily receives $1,000 a fortnight plus superannuation will receive the $1,500 jobkeeper payment, with superannuation paid on the first $1,000 and the employer able to decide whether to pay it on the last $500. Can I get the jobkeeper and other payments? On 30 March, Scott Morrison said a person receiving the jobkeeper payment could not also receive the jobseeker payment (formerly Newstart). On 20 April, a spokesperson for the Department of Social Services clarified that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of people could not receive both payments because the $1,500 a fortnight jobkeeper payment \u201cexceeds the typical income limit for jobseeker which is $1,086.50\u201d. However, some people may qualify for both because jobkeeper counts as \u201cordinary income\u201d and there are categories of jobseeker recipients, such as single parents, with a higher income threshold. People who have already applied for jobseeker can withdraw and shift to jobkeeper payments if they are re-engaged by their employer. A person cannot be in receipt of jobkeeper payments from two or more employers. What about eligibility for jobseeker payments? Eligibility has been expanded. Previously, Australians out of work were not eligible for the jobseeker payment if their partner earned $48,000 or more. However that has been changed and now people will be eligible for job-seeker payments unless their partner earns $79,762 or more. Does this require legislation? Yes. Parliament reconvened on 8 April with a smaller than usual sitting in Canberra to pass the stimulus package. Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

      "bodyText": "The Australian government has launched Covidsafe, an app that traces every person running the app who has been in contact with someone else using the app in the previous three weeks, in a bid to automate coronavirus contact tracing and allow the easing of restrictions. Here\u2019s what we know about the app so far. How does the app work? After you download and install the app from the Australian Apple App store or Google Play store \u2013 which you can also access from the government\u2019s Covidsafe app page covidsafe.gov.au or aus.gov.au/app \u2013 you\u2019ll be asked to register your name (or pseudonym), age range, postcode and phone number. That registration information is stored encrypted on a government server, and then passed on to state and territory health authorities in the event that someone you\u2019ve been in contact with has tested positive. Using Bluetooth, the app records anyone you get close to who also has the app. The two apps exchange anonymised IDs, which cycle every two hours and are stored encrypted on phones and deleted after 21 days. If someone is infected with coronavirus, they then get a unique code from a health official via SMS to use in the app to consent to upload the list of anonymised IDs for the past 21 days of contact for contact tracing. It uses signal strength and other data then to work out who needs to be contacted. What personal data is collected? The name you choose to provide, your age range, your phone number, and your postcode, information about your encrypted user ID, information about testing positive for coronavirus, and then the contact IDs should you consent to that being uploaded. Bluetooth data is also uploaded to the server upon testing positive in order for the government to figure out, using signal strength, which contacts need to be notified. Who can access the data? The data, once you consent to it being uploaded from your app at the time you test positive, will be held by the federal government on an Amazon Web Services server in Australia. Morrison said that while the data will be held by the federal government, only state health authorities charged with contact tracing will be able to access it. He says federal agencies including Centrelink, Home Affairs and others will not be able to access the data. Health minister Greg Hunt has written a direction that sets out only health authorities or those maintaining the app can get access to the information. This will be backed up by legislation to be introduced into parliament in May. The government has said police will not be able to get the data, even with a warrant, and court orders will not be able to force the government to hand over the data \u2013 but this is not explicitly outlined in the draft legislation. The registration data will remain on the government server until the end of the pandemic, which will be declared over by the health minister, or until you request it to be deleted. Should I be worried Amazon is holding the data? Amazon Web Services, which is hosting the data in Australia, is one of the biggest cloud companies in the world. Given the millions of people expected to use the app and outages will make the app less effective, as well as the government\u2019s history with using AWS, it isn\u2019t surprising Amazon was chosen for the contract. The company has the highest data security certification for its Sydney data centre. The 2017 postal survey was supported by AWS, and the 2021 Census will be hosted by AWS. Chances are, some of your data \u2013 be it through your bank, your airline, through Netflix or any number of services \u2013 is already hosted by Amazon. The government will legislate to prevent data from the app being moved offshore, including for requests for data by the US government under laws such as the Patriot Act. The draft legislation makes it a crime to store the data outside Australia, or communicate the data to someone outside Australia. Can it trace my location? The app does not track location. The Google version of the app does seek permission for location information but that is due to permissions needed for bluetooth. Will it drain my battery? Not significantly, however the Apple version of the app will need to be open in order for the bluetooth functionality to work. That will drain the battery more, however, the government made a change to the Apple version of the app and you can now lock your phone screen as long as the app is open when you lock it. It is understood that the federal government will implement the functionality developed by Apple and Google in a few weeks that will eliminate this issue and allow iPhone users to have the app running in the background. Will it be mandatory? No. The prime minister has said consent would be key to the app, indicating it would not be mandatory, and people would share information through the app only if they consented to it. The draft legislation to support the app specifically makes it a crime punishable by five years in jail to force someone to download the app, and upload data from the app against their consent. It also makes it a crime to refuse service or entry or employment to people if they\u2019re not using the app. But Morrison muddied the waters somewhat when he would not entirely rule out making it mandatory. \u201cMy preference is not to do that, my preference is to give Australians the go of getting it right ... I don\u2019t want to be drawn on that [making it mandatory], I want to give Australians the opportunity to get it right,\u201d he told Triple M. \u201cThat is my objective, that is my Plan A and I really want Plan A to work.\u201d He later tweeted that the app would not be mandatory. The national cabinet said that the app could be a valuable tool \u201cif the numbers increase and the application is widely taken up\u201d. Health minister Greg Hunt said the government\u2019s target for uptake of the app is 40% of the population. Morrison said automatic contact tracing would be a key component in states and territories easing some restrictions on \u201chigh-value, low-risk economic activities\u201d after the next four weeks. He compared using the app to buying bonds during the war. \u201cIn the war, people bought war bonds to get in behind the national effort. What we\u2019re doing in fighting this fight is we\u2019ll be asking people to download an app which helps us trace the virus quickly and the more people who do that, the more we can get back to a more liveable set of arrangements.\u201d The state governments in NSW and Victoria have both indicated they will not make use of the app a condition for easing restrictions, and will not require a certain percentage of the population to be using the app before restrictions will be eased.

There is no Commonwealth access and it is stored in Australia and importantly it is deleted from your phone after 21 days.\u201d The government will have a repository of the names, phone numbers and postcodes of everyone who had downloaded the app, which could be a potential honeypot, but the key data of who you\u2019ve been in contact with stays on your phone and is frequently deleted. The government has published a privacy impact assessment on potential concerns with the app. The source code for the app has been released by the government, which can show how the app works in practice, but there are calls for the server source code (which will show what the government does with the data) to be released. You can delete the app from your phone at any time, and the government has said all the information held will be deleted from its servers at the end of the pandemic. This sunset clause is built into the legislation being introduced into parliament. The draft legislation sets out that the data will be deleted once Greg Hunt declares, via an instrument, that the pandemic is over. Will police be able to access the data? Attorney general Christian Porter told Guardian Australia regulations would be developed to ensure that police and other government agencies would not be able to access the data. \u201cLaw enforcement agencies will not be provided access to information collected via the app,\u201d he said. \u201cSpecific regulatory action will be taken to prevent such access for law enforcement agencies at both the Commonwealth and state/territory level. \u201cThe government has already made the decision not to make any information collected by the app available for other purposes, including law enforcement investigations.\u201d The draft legislation does not explicitly rule out access via warrant or court order, however access for purposes outside of contact tracing has been made a crime. Is the app even working yet? If you have the app running on your phone as per the guidelines, it is collecting the contact data and storing it on your phone. Health officials have yet to access the data because the federal government needs to get the states and territories to sign a memorandum of understanding to ensure they abide by the privacy rules around the use of the data for contact tracing. The training for use of the app started on 11 May, and health officials are expected to be able to access data from the app a few days after, in the event someone with the app tests positive and agrees to upload the data. What if I\u2019m using a non-Australian account? At this stage it seems the app is only available in Australian app stores, but the health department indicated it was looking at making the app available in other stores. What if I have an older phone? There are no plans to make it work on phones operating older software than iOS 10 and Android 6.0. How much did it cost? The total cost of the app for the government is $1.5m, including over $700,000 for Amazon to host the data.

These moves are Chinese Communist party shots across Australia\u2019s political bow. The message, pure and simple, is that Canberra should not use the assembly meeting to press for a transparent and independent inquiry into the origins of Covid-19. The assembly is the peak governing body of the World Health Organisation. Before the pandemic no one would have expected that this year\u2019s virtual and shortened two-day meeting would be the most significant geopolitical summit of 2020.

Aside from the obvious focus on the virus, these countries share the experience of dealing with a China that is sharpening its political rhetoric and is quick to resort to threats of economic retaliation if states do and say things that Beijing does not like. The Communist party\u2019s response to calls for Taiwan to attend the assembly as an observer is a case in point. Taiwan had previously attended the WHA between 2009 and 2016 as an observer but was excluded from the organisation after the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive party was elected in May 2016. As Beijing hardens its position on what it considers to be acceptable applications of the One China policy it is reacting badly to international judgments that Taiwan very effectively suppressed the spread of Covid-19 without resorting to the punitive measures we saw in Wuhan. This week China\u2019s ambassador to New Zealand sharply rebuked Wellington for backing a growing international call to make Taiwan an observer at the WHA meeting. The foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said New Zealand should \u201cimmediately stop making wrong statements on Taiwan, to avoid damaging our bilateral relationship\u201d. China\u2019s ever more strident and stringent demands for countries to publicly acquiesce to Beijing\u2019s political agenda is seemingly having the opposite reaction. It\u2019s uncertain how these issues will play out next week at the WHA because China has presented itself as so inflexibly opposed to an open and independent review and to Taiwan\u2019s observer membership that it is difficult to see what compromises might be developed.

For its own stability, the party cannot risk too many unhappy citizens. On trade, Beijing\u2019s bargaining position is not as strong as some assume. Taiwan\u2019s position is harder to reconcile, but one possible outcome is that countries will simply refuse to let Beijing go any further in predating the island\u2019s autonomy. In both cases these would amount to major political setbacks for Beijing, the largely self-imposed costs of the party\u2019s hardline diplomatic brinksmanship. \u2022 Peter Jennings is the executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and a former deputy secretary for strategy with the defence department",

      "body": "<p>An escalation of rhetoric between Donald Trump and <strong>China </strong>over the coronavirus pandemic has sparked concerns that a trade deal between the nations is in peril, as Chinese state media dismissed as \u201clunacy\u201d a suggestion by the US president that he could \u201ccut off relations\u201d with Beijing.</p> \n<p>The<strong> US</strong> president said he was very disappointed with China\u2019s failure to contain Covid-19 in an interview with Fox Business news. Trump said the pandemic had cast a pall over his January trade deal with Beijing and that he had no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey should have never let this happen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo I make a great trade deal and now I say this doesn\u2019t feel the same to me. The ink was barely dry and the plague came over. And it doesn\u2019t feel the same to me.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump has previously often said he has a good relationship with Xi, and has been reluctant to single him out personally for criticism over coronavirus. \u201cBut I just, right now I don\u2019t want to speak to him,\u201d Trump said.</p> \n<p>Asked what measures he intended to take against China, he said: \u201cThere are many things we could do \u2026 We could cut off the whole relationship.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cNow, if you did, what would happen? You\u2019d save $500bn,\u201d Trump said, referring to estimated US annual imports from China, which he has previously referred to as lost money.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c22a0f30-6442-429b-80cd-c2631ba54739\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mlgO6sd2ZK4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1188451.shtml\">The state-backed Global Times </a>responded with an editorial titled: \u201cTrump turns up election strategy nonsense with China \u2018cut-off\u2019 threat.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThe very idea should not come as a surprise for those who remember when Trump speculated if disinfectants could be used on humans \u2018by injection\u2019 to wipe out the novel coronavirus [Covid-19],\u201d it said.</p> \n<p>\u201cSuch lunacy is a clear byproduct, first and foremost, of the proverbial anxiety that the US has suffered from since China began its global ascension,\u201d it said on Friday. \u201cTrump seems insane right now or may have some psychological problems,\u201d another editorial wrote.</p> \n<p>The escalating row between the two countries came as <strong>China</strong> marked one month with no deaths from Covid-19 and just four newly confirmed cases in the 24 hours to Friday. Global cases have passed 4.438 million, with more than 302,000 deaths. The US ranked first in cases (1.47 million) and deaths (85,884), according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker.</p> \n<p>Analysts fear the increasingly heated rhetoric on both sides could endanger the US-China trade deal.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat we may be watching is the convergence of the more hawkish [US] national security stream with the domestic political stream that now sees more value in blowing up the trade deal than keeping it,\u201d said China-watcher, Bill Bishop, from Sinocism.</p> \n<p>Scott Kennedy from Washington\u2019s Centre for Strategic and International Studies think tank called Trump\u2019s remarks \u201cdangerous bravado\u201d.</p> \n<p>The growing war of words between China and the US came as<strong> Brazil </strong>passed the grim milestone of 200,000 infections, with just under 14,000 deaths. President Jair Bolsonaro urged business leaders to push for the lifting of lockdown orders in financial centre of Sao Paulo to help the economy. He has been widely criticised for his approach to the pandemic.</p> \n<p><strong>Mexico</strong> also reported a deteriorating situation, with 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.

      "bodyText": "An escalation of rhetoric between Donald Trump and China over the coronavirus pandemic has sparked concerns that a trade deal between the nations is in peril, as Chinese state media dismissed as \u201clunacy\u201d a suggestion by the US president that he could \u201ccut off relations\u201d with Beijing. The US president said he was very disappointed with China\u2019s failure to contain Covid-19 in an interview with Fox Business news. Trump said the pandemic had cast a pall over his January trade deal with Beijing and that he had no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment. \u201cThey should have never let this happen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo I make a great trade deal and now I say this doesn\u2019t feel the same to me. The ink was barely dry and the plague came over. And it doesn\u2019t feel the same to me.\u201d Trump has previously often said he has a good relationship with Xi, and has been reluctant to single him out personally for criticism over coronavirus. \u201cBut I just, right now I don\u2019t want to speak to him,\u201d Trump said. Asked what measures he intended to take against China, he said: \u201cThere are many things we could do \u2026 We could cut off the whole relationship.\u201d \u201cNow, if you did, what would happen? You\u2019d save $500bn,\u201d Trump said, referring to estimated US annual imports from China, which he has previously referred to as lost money. The state-backed Global Times responded with an editorial titled: \u201cTrump turns up election strategy nonsense with China \u2018cut-off\u2019 threat.\u201d \u201cThe very idea should not come as a surprise for those who remember when Trump speculated if disinfectants could be used on humans \u2018by injection\u2019 to wipe out the novel coronavirus [Covid-19],\u201d it said. \u201cSuch lunacy is a clear byproduct, first and foremost, of the proverbial anxiety that the US has suffered from since China began its global ascension,\u201d it said on Friday. \u201cTrump seems insane right now or may have some psychological problems,\u201d another editorial wrote. The escalating row between the two countries came as China marked one month with no deaths from Covid-19 and just four newly confirmed cases in the 24 hours to Friday. Global cases have passed 4.438 million, with more than 302,000 deaths. The US ranked first in cases (1.47 million) and deaths (85,884), according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. Analysts fear the increasingly heated rhetoric on both sides could endanger the US-China trade deal. \u201cWhat we may be watching is the convergence of the more hawkish [US] national security stream with the domestic political stream that now sees more value in blowing up the trade deal than keeping it,\u201d said China-watcher, Bill Bishop, from Sinocism. Scott Kennedy from Washington\u2019s Centre for Strategic and International Studies think tank called Trump\u2019s remarks \u201cdangerous bravado\u201d. The growing war of words between China and the US came as Brazil passed the grim milestone of 200,000 infections, with just under 14,000 deaths. President Jair Bolsonaro urged business leaders to push for the lifting of lockdown orders in financial centre of Sao Paulo to help the economy. He has been widely criticised for his approach to the pandemic. Mexico also reported a deteriorating situation, with 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began. It also confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths, bringing the total to just under 4,500. More than 42,595 people have been infected. In Russia, which currently has the second most infections worldwide with 252,245, authorities in Moscow said clinics would begin mass random testing of residents for coronavirus antibodies on Friday. There have been doubts over the official death toll from the virus of 2,305, after authorities ascribed the deaths of more than 60% of coronavirus patients in April to other causes. The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, on Russia\u2019s western edge, opened their borders to each other at the stroke of midnight on Friday, creating the first \u201ctravel bubble\u201d within the European Union in a bid to jump-start economies broken down by the coronavirus pandemic. Citizens and residents of the three generally sparsely populated countries will be free to travel within the region, though anyone entering from outside will need to self-isolate for 14 days. \u201cThe Baltic travel bubble is an opportunity for businesses to reopen, and a glimmer of hope for the people that life is getting back to normal,\u201d Lithuanian prime minister Saulius Skvernelis said in a statement. Other coronavirus developments include: Qatar has made wearing a face mask compulsory for anyone who steps outside their home, with violators facing jail time and fines of up to $55,000. Vietnam reported 24 new coronavirus infections on Friday, all of which were imported cases involving Vietnamese citizens returning from Russia who were placed under quarantine on arrival, the country\u2019s health ministry said. Coronavirus has reached one of the world\u2019s biggest refugee camps in Bangladesh. The US has voiced alarm at the targeting of religious minorities in India and Pakistan, warning against a search for internal scapegoats during the pandemic. Residents in Australia\u2019s most populous state of New South Wales experienced slightly relaxed Covid-19 restrictions, with outside gatherings of 10 people permitted, up from two. Bars, cafes and restaurants have reopened, but only 10 people can be inside at any one time, with strict distancing rules enforced. New Zealand residents have embraced newfound freedoms, including eating out, seeing friends, and a lot of haircuts, after restrictions were reduced.",

Queensland\u2019s health minister, Stephen Miles, said the rapid response team was working to identify staff and residents who had been in contact with the infected nurse. \u201cThey are rapidly testing a large number of people to identify whether anyone else has been affected,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThe centre is currently locked down and any staff in contact are in quarantine and have been tested.\u201d He said the last Rockhampton case of coronavirus was seven weeks ago, on 30 March, and the last active case was considered to be resolved on 1 May. Passengers and crew on flight QF537 from Brisbane to Sydney on Tuesday 12 May have been alerted to monitor for Covid-19 symptoms and contact health authorities if they became sick after an overseas traveller on the flight tested positive. The traveller had arrived in Brisbane and completed the mandatory 14-day quarantine period before boarding the flight, New South Wales Health said. The person developed symptoms afterwards and NSW Health said it was \u201clikely they were infectious on the flight to Sydney\u201d. The department said it was contact tracing all close contacts in NSW and on the flight to Sydney, and was working with other jurisdictions to identify any other close contacts. The state recorded eight new cases on Friday. The Rockhampton case was one of only two new Covid-19 cases recorded in Queensland overnight.",

By her estimate, she has cared for nearly three dozen Covid-19 patients since the pandemic began, and her close friend, a fellow nurse, has died from the virus. When she developed an upset stomach consistent with Covid-19 she lost her composure. She curled up in a ball, cried and hyperventilated. Later, Caldwell wrote down all her financial account information, put it in her lockbox and texted her 20-year-old daughter the code. \u201cIt\u2019s so random who is getting Covid and dying. There was a definite panic, a definite freak-out,\u201d Caldwell said, a member of the union National Nurses United. \u201cIt heightens my anxiety and paranoia \u2026 I didn\u2019t feel like I had any before.\u201d What Caldwell experienced is exactly the sort of stress that will test America\u2019s commitment to the mental health of the nurses and doctors, experts say \u2013 the very people healing the nation during the Covid-19 pandemic.

According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 302,452 people have now died as a result of the outbreak. The institution says it has counted 4,443,597 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.</p> <h2><strong>China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced</strong></h2> <p>China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus on Friday, all local cross-infections in the northeastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April.</p> <h2><strong>Trump threatens to cut China ties</strong></h2> <p>US President Donald Trump signalled a further deterioration of his relationship with China over coronavirus, saying he has no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment and going so far as to suggest he could cut ties with the world\u2019s second largest economy. Chinese state media has responded saying his comments are \u201clunacy\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself</strong></h2> <p>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">without wearing a mask himself</a>. Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</p> <h2><strong>Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases</strong></h2> <p>Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally.</p> <h2><strong>Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000</strong></h2> <p>The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday.The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to John Hopkins data.844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993.</p> <h2><strong>South Korea, China and Japan health ministers to hold video conference</strong></h2> <p>The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will get together by video conference on Friday to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the novel coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the East Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.</p> <h2><strong>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus</strong></h2> <p>Doctors in northern Italy,<strong> </strong>one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</p> <h2>Covid-19 reaches refugee camps in Bangladesh</h2> <p>A Rohingya man has become the first person to test positive for Covid-19 in the vast refugee camps in Bangladesh that is home to almost one million people.

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories from the UK and around the world.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s stockpile of personal protective equipment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/coronavirus-uk-privately-run-ppe-stockpile-chaos-movianto\">has been managed in chaotic fashion</a> by a private company and may have resulted in delays to the delivery of vital supplies to healthcare workers, according to an investigation by the Guardian and ITV News. Delivery drivers and well-placed sources say the operation run by US-owned Movianto was dogged by bad management and short staffing. \u201cNobody knew what they were doing,\u201d said one driver. Ministers\u2019 claims that a new antibody test will be a \u201cgame-changer\u201d in the fight against Covid-19 comes despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/14/covid-19-antibody-test-unlikely-to-be-widely-aviable-any-time-soon\">doubts that the test will be freely available in the NHS any time soon</a>.</p> \n<p>A teachers\u2019 union <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/14/teachers-can-legally-refuse-to-return-over-risk-to-health-union-warns\">has threatened to sue local authorities</a> if its members are forced to go back to work without the same protections given to frontline health staff. The NASUWT says it has \u201cfundamental concerns\u201d about the safety of reopening schools by the government\u2019s 1 June deadline. Union leaders are meeting the government\u2019s scientific advisers later today.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/global-report-trade-deal-fears-after-trump-threat-to-cut-china-ties-over-covid-19\">threatened to cut US ties with China</a> as his dispute with Beijing over the pandemic deepened. The US president told Fox News such a move could save the US \u201c$500bn\u201d. A senior US public health official turned whistleblower has warned Congress that the country must prepare for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/rick-bright-testimony-coronavirus-trump-ousted-whistleblower\">\u201cdarkest winter in modern history\u201d</a> because of federal government failures in tackling the pandemic.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Teachers threaten to sue over return to work Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories from the UK and around the world. The government\u2019s stockpile of personal protective equipment has been managed in chaotic fashion by a private company and may have resulted in delays to the delivery of vital supplies to healthcare workers, according to an investigation by the Guardian and ITV News. Delivery drivers and well-placed sources say the operation run by US-owned Movianto was dogged by bad management and short staffing. \u201cNobody knew what they were doing,\u201d said one driver. Ministers\u2019 claims that a new antibody test will be a \u201cgame-changer\u201d in the fight against Covid-19 comes despite doubts that the test will be freely available in the NHS any time soon. A teachers\u2019 union has threatened to sue local authorities if its members are forced to go back to work without the same protections given to frontline health staff. The NASUWT says it has \u201cfundamental concerns\u201d about the safety of reopening schools by the government\u2019s 1 June deadline. Union leaders are meeting the government\u2019s scientific advisers later today. Donald Trump has threatened to cut US ties with China as his dispute with Beijing over the pandemic deepened. The US president told Fox News such a move could save the US \u201c$500bn\u201d. A senior US public health official turned whistleblower has warned Congress that the country must prepare for the \u201cdarkest winter in modern history\u201d because of federal government failures in tackling the pandemic. Almost 250 million people could catch the virus in Africa, according to modelling by the World Health Organization, but there will be fewer severe cases and deaths than in the US and Europe because the continent has more young people and also less obesity. The virus has now killed more than 300,000 around the world and infected close to 4.5 million. You can follow all the day\u2019s developments at our live blog here, and you can catch up with overnight news at a glance. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Whitehall woe \u2013 An inquiry into the role played by civil servants in Brexit has found that officials were hung out to dry by Theresa May and Boris Johnson when they became targets for political attacks during negotiations with Brussels. An independent thinktank, the Institute for Government (IfG), has spent months interviewing officials involved in the talks and said Johnson put some in an \u201cimmensely difficult position\u201d when he threatened to break the law by leaving the EU without a deal. Many civil servants quit their jobs because of the intense pressure and long hours. * * * Hunters hunted \u2013 Birds of prey are being targeted by hunters who are taking advantage of what they think might be reduced surveillance during lockdown. The RSPB says it has been overrun with reports of killings in recent weeks, adding most incidents were on or close to sporting estates managed for game bird shooting. * * * Name game \u2013 An online dictionary explaining the origins of more than 45,000 British and Irish surnames is being opened up in the hope that it might help bring families separated by Covid-19 closer together. For the next week, people will be able to tap into the Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland for free and find out where their surnames \u2013 and thus perhaps their ancestors \u2013 came from. Coronavirus Extra The government\u2019s plan to roll out an app to help trace the spread of Covid-19 is causing headaches because the app\u2019s advisory board can\u2019t decide whether it has the authority to tell the government to ditch the controversial technology and switch to a decentralised model. And MPs are urging ministers to guarantee that all data captured by the app will be deleted when it is no longer needed. Carers are concerned that residnts in old people\u2019s homes are \u201cfading away\u201d in their rooms after being denied contact with friends and family for weeks. Figures released yesterday showed more than a quarter of NHS patients who died in hospitals in England after contracting coronavirus had diabetes. Polly Toynbee laments the government\u2019s latest idea to kickstart the economy \u2013 opening up the housing market as quickly as possible. Pubs in New South Wales are able to serve drinks for the first time in weeks after restrictions were lifted, but patrons are limited to 10 and must be dining too. The easing of lockdown rules in New Zealand has meant family reunions, eating out and lots of haircuts. Lockdown for Hollywood star Matt Damon has been a \u201cfairytale\u201d after he and his family became \u201ctrapped\u201d in an Irish village where he was making a film. Today in Focus podcast In the concluding part of our Blind Date takeover, two more couples meet remotely for a socially distanced evening of drinks and dinner. First up are Mally and Butho, who sit down to dinner, one in Glasgow, the other in Edinburgh. Later on amid a dramatic thunderstorm, Deej, who is in isolation in Kathmandu, Nepal, dials in to Naomi in east London. Lunchtime read: The simple joy of cinema As lockdown deprives us of the simple pleasure of going to the pictures, we\u2019ve asked actors, film-makers and critics to recall that once-familiar communal thrill \u2013 from Steve McQueen seeing The Magnificent Seven with his dad, to Tilda Swinton remembering a screening in a Kenyan village.

England\u2019s leading clubs have been warned that a fundamental change in attitude is needed to restore public trust in the wake of the Saracens salary cap affair. British racing will resume with an eight-race all-weather card at Newcastle on Monday 1 June if government restrictions to control the spread of coronavirus ease sufficiently.

      "body": "<p>Half of Spain has advanced to phase one of a four-phase plan to ease lockdown restrictions by July. Hoteliers can open their properties \u2013 though none of the common areas \u2013 and bars and restaurants can open a limited amount of outdoor seating. Although Madrid, M\u00e1laga, Granada, Barcelona and parts of Valencia are among the provinces and municipalities not yet cleared to advance.</p> <p>Tourism is Spain\u2019s third largest contributor to the economy, making up 12.3% of its GDP<strong>,</strong> and there is pressure to get hotels to reopen, despite the fact that until July no one will be allowed to travel between provinces. And until borders reopen, airlines start flying and the 14-day quarantine is lifted, there will be no foreign tourists.</p> <p>In the meantime, to ensure health security and help restore confidence, government health-and-safety guidelines have been drawn up for every sector of the tourism industry. For hotels, this means vigorous cleaning and disinfection multiple times a day by staff wearing PPE, as well as changes to the guest experience, such as a ban on buffets.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll change all hotel services to ensure minimum contact,\u201d said Manuel Vegas of the Spanish Association of Hotel Directors (AEDH). \u201cKitchens will be transformed to reduce handling and we\u2019ll be demanding maximum guarantees from service providers. It is a radical change.\u201d</p> <p>Many hotels are installing screens between tables in their dining rooms, and introducing staggered dining hours and room service deliveries by staff in masks and gloves. Rooms are more wipe-down, with coffee makers, extra bedding and decoration removed. The government protocol also suggests removing carpets and minibars. And when common areas such as pools and gyms can be reopened, strict social distancing and disinfecting regimes will be in place.</p> <p>Credit-card payment is being promoted in hotels and bars, and contactless technology is coming faster than anticipated. Until the lockdown, AEDH had been running a hotel digitalisation project, providing tools and expertise, said Vegas: \u201cPlanning apps to generate a welcome the moment you arrive at the hotel, to create a virtual key, for the lift to take you to the right floor without having to touch a button, to place orders in the restaurant and bar without contact with a waiter. We had been anticipating the crisis without knowing it.\u201d This innovation needs to continue he said, to free up more staff to act as hosts to meet and greet guests.</p> <p>Guests will be welcomed with a \u201csafe smile\u201d from receptionists (albeit from behind a screen) at Room Mate Hotels. \u201cAfter so much time in confinement, we need that warmth.

      "bodyText": "Half of Spain has advanced to phase one of a four-phase plan to ease lockdown restrictions by July. Hoteliers can open their properties \u2013 though none of the common areas \u2013 and bars and restaurants can open a limited amount of outdoor seating. Although Madrid, M\u00e1laga, Granada, Barcelona and parts of Valencia are among the provinces and municipalities not yet cleared to advance. Tourism is Spain\u2019s third largest contributor to the economy, making up 12.3% of its GDP, and there is pressure to get hotels to reopen, despite the fact that until July no one will be allowed to travel between provinces. And until borders reopen, airlines start flying and the 14-day quarantine is lifted, there will be no foreign tourists. In the meantime, to ensure health security and help restore confidence, government health-and-safety guidelines have been drawn up for every sector of the tourism industry. For hotels, this means vigorous cleaning and disinfection multiple times a day by staff wearing PPE, as well as changes to the guest experience, such as a ban on buffets. \u201cWe\u2019ll change all hotel services to ensure minimum contact,\u201d said Manuel Vegas of the Spanish Association of Hotel Directors (AEDH). \u201cKitchens will be transformed to reduce handling and we\u2019ll be demanding maximum guarantees from service providers. It is a radical change.\u201d Many hotels are installing screens between tables in their dining rooms, and introducing staggered dining hours and room service deliveries by staff in masks and gloves. Rooms are more wipe-down, with coffee makers, extra bedding and decoration removed. The government protocol also suggests removing carpets and minibars. And when common areas such as pools and gyms can be reopened, strict social distancing and disinfecting regimes will be in place. Credit-card payment is being promoted in hotels and bars, and contactless technology is coming faster than anticipated. Until the lockdown, AEDH had been running a hotel digitalisation project, providing tools and expertise, said Vegas: \u201cPlanning apps to generate a welcome the moment you arrive at the hotel, to create a virtual key, for the lift to take you to the right floor without having to touch a button, to place orders in the restaurant and bar without contact with a waiter. We had been anticipating the crisis without knowing it.\u201d This innovation needs to continue he said, to free up more staff to act as hosts to meet and greet guests. Guests will be welcomed with a \u201csafe smile\u201d from receptionists (albeit from behind a screen) at Room Mate Hotels. \u201cAfter so much time in confinement, we need that warmth. We are needy,\u201d said the group\u2019s founder, Kike Sarasola. Screens will be widespread - and the brand will ensure they look stylish. \u201cWe have designers competing to design the best screen and the public can vote on them,\u201d said Sarasola, adding that hotels will offset the strict rules in common areas with personalised touches in the bedrooms, making \u201cguests feel like kings\u201d with personalised notes and messages. Room Mate has gained extensive practice of working with safety protocols, having made 13 staffed hotels available free of charge to healthcare workers and the elderly from the start of the crisis. Whether guests will \u201cfeel like kings\u201d or feel a little uncomfortable in an environment of screens, masks and none of the usual interaction, is another question. \u201c[Who wants to] go to a hotel and not be allowed to enjoy the swimming pool or the common spaces?

The political journalist Michelle Grattan was the first woman to edit an Australian metropolitan daily newspaper when she took over the Canberra Times in 1993.",

Being a pregnant woman working in the music industry and not quite breaking through, yet having to meet financial needs, I have pressured myself to keep on working.

A few days before lockdown, I flew in from LA and did a show at XOYO, when my belly was so big I had to perform sitting down. It\u2019s beautiful, because one day my son will be able to watch that \u2013 but it took a toll on me.

If the issue is stoked by the government though little things like this can become huge.\u201d</p> <p>As Turkey braces for a second financial crisis in as many years and voters\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/coronavirus-leaves-turkeys-president-with-nobody-else-to-blame\">faith in the ruling</a> Justice and Development party (AKP) wanes, the government is capitalising on new ways to whip up populist support as well as stymie political opposition.</p> <p>While homosexuality is legal in Turkey, the LGBTQ community still faces huge stigma and is often the target of bigoted ire from conservative politicians and pundits. The furore over children\u2019s rainbow drawings, combined with dogwhistle remarks by the head of the religious affairs directorate during a Ramadan sermon that gay people \u201cspread disease\u201d, were met with concern by human rights and legal advocacy groups. The Izmir Bar Association said Ali Erba\u015f\u2019 comments could fuel hate crimes, while an Ankara-based human rights group filed a judicial complaint.</p> <p>Those actions in turn led to a veiled threat from president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan that any attack on the head of the <em>Diyanet</em>, or religious affairs directorate, was tantamount to an attack on the state. Retaliatory investigations into the bar associations in Ankara and Diyarbakir on the grounds of \u201cbelittling the religious values adopted by Turkish society\u201d followed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty sad that the natural beauty of a rainbow is automatically assumed to have a political agenda in Turkey,\u201d said activist Aydin\u00e7 Y\u00fcksel.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s pretty typical for the government to try and find a scapegoat for its problems.

      "bodyText": "Like many children across the world sent home from school, youngsters in Turkey were encouraged to draw pictures of rainbows and place them in windows to cheer up the country in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. Orders to teachers from some local education boards to stop because the rainbows were part of a \u201cplot\u201d to turn children gay were met with surprise. Instead of boosting morale, the lockdown rainbows have become yet another symbol of division, the latest cultural battleground in a country highly polarised along political and religious lines. \u201cUnfortunately this sort of anti-LGBTQ mentality is widespread even if ordinary people don\u2019t see a connection between children\u2019s drawings and gay rights,\u201d said Meral G\u00fclsen, a representative for teachers union E\u011fitim Sen. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if the orders have a bigger government backing. If the issue is stoked by the government though little things like this can become huge.\u201d As Turkey braces for a second financial crisis in as many years and voters\u2019 faith in the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) wanes, the government is capitalising on new ways to whip up populist support as well as stymie political opposition. While homosexuality is legal in Turkey, the LGBTQ community still faces huge stigma and is often the target of bigoted ire from conservative politicians and pundits. The furore over children\u2019s rainbow drawings, combined with dogwhistle remarks by the head of the religious affairs directorate during a Ramadan sermon that gay people \u201cspread disease\u201d, were met with concern by human rights and legal advocacy groups. The Izmir Bar Association said Ali Erba\u015f\u2019 comments could fuel hate crimes, while an Ankara-based human rights group filed a judicial complaint. Those actions in turn led to a veiled threat from president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan that any attack on the head of the Diyanet, or religious affairs directorate, was tantamount to an attack on the state. Retaliatory investigations into the bar associations in Ankara and Diyarbakir on the grounds of \u201cbelittling the religious values adopted by Turkish society\u201d followed. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sad that the natural beauty of a rainbow is automatically assumed to have a political agenda in Turkey,\u201d said activist Aydin\u00e7 Y\u00fcksel. \u201cBut it\u2019s pretty typical for the government to try and find a scapegoat for its problems. With coronavirus it was the Chinese first, and now seemingly out of the blue, it\u2019s us. It\u2019s all the more surprising because more and more people these days are realising that being LGBT and being religious are not mutually exclusive.\u201d Control over the flow of information and political narratives has been even more important than usual for Ankara during the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 400 people have been detained for allegedly sharing \u201cfalse and provocative\u201d social media posts over the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic, as well as several journalists. Externally, Turkey has embarked on a wave of coronavirus diplomacy, distributing aid to dozens of countries in an attempt to raise Ankara\u2019s standing \u2013 and in particular, repair frayed ties with the west at a time of economic need. At home, however, the presidency has dedicated time and energy to shutting down local efforts by opposition-controlled municipalities to tackle the fallout from the virus, anxious to deny opposition figures the opportunity to show leadership and competency. Donation campaigns, soup kitchens and attempts to distribute bread and masks across the country have been halted. The goverment has said such initiatives are an illegal attempt to undermine the state: Istanbul mayor Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu and Ankara mayor Mansur Yava\u015f are both facing criminal probes for collecting donations not authorised by the local governors\u2019 offices, and at least 900,000 lira (\u00a3105,000) in collected money has been been seized by the treasury.

At least one Turkish tradition revived for coronavirus has brought people together across the country\u2019s many social divides. Ask\u0131da fatura, which loosely translates as a \u201csuspended bill\u201d, is a centuries-old practice in which customers in bakeries pay for two loaves instead of one, meaning that someone in need can come in and eat in the future. New online ask\u0131da fatura systems have allowed people in Istanbul and Ankara to anonymously donate to help pay water, gas and travel bills, raising \u00a31.76m for around 57,000 struggling households in Istanbul alone since it was set up a week ago.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cThey say on a clear day you can see the Kremlin from here,\u201d quipped the dog walker who had paused momentarily as he crossed the moor back towards home. The friendly passerby was clearly exaggerating but the views from Holcombe Hill are certainly far reaching. Below, nearly 3 million people are spread out across the Manchester conurbation and beyond, with the tallest buildings clearly definable on the city\u2019s rapidly changing skyline. The hill, immediately overlooking the village of Holcombe and Ramsbottom town centre, is dominated by the 39 metre (128ft) Peel Monument, a grade II listed building opened in 1852 in tribute to the locally born Tory prime minister Sir Robert Peel. Despite being close to the Lancashire border, Holcombe Village, Holcombe Hill and the Peel Monument are all in Bury metropolitan borough, part of Greater Manchester, not Lancashire. The Peel Tower catching the last of the sunshine, Easter week. You might wonder about he significance of the red chair. It was simply that I took a shot on my first visit then it was in a different place the next six or so times I went. It seemed to have plenty of unseen adventures. The office chair in use in the sunshine, and after a night out perhaps. The office chair, cyclist passing by. I spoke to many of the passersby on the Hill, for whom it has been a sustained place of relaxation, exercise, or contemplation, especially in these times of lockdown due to the coronavirus. Geoffrey Jackson, whom I photographed with Margaret, his wife, told me: \u201cWe\u2019ve lived nearby for 58 years. We try and come up to the Tower frequently but, now we\u2019re in our 80s, not as often as we\u2019d like.\u201d \u201cWe have the richness of the countryside but the real richness of the area is the people. The difference here is that people speak to you. We haven\u2019t lost that necessity that people need people and this virus has highlighted that. It\u2019s important that we realise how important love is. Love isn\u2019t just something sentimental, it binds us together no matter who you are. There\u2019s plenty of that love here.\u201d A walker out on Holcombe Hill. The early evening sunlight illuminates a footpath fence on the gentle lower slopes of the hill. Cottongrass in the April sunshine. A winged visitor to the hill. A runner approaching the summit as he takes his permitted daily exercise. John Allerton, mountainer, said; \u201cI go up the hill every afternoon when we\u2019re at home.

Whether it be running or walking with Esther or out on my bike. Wind, rain or sun nothing quite reminds me of who I am than being out on the hill.\u201d Zippy, George, Bungle, Tom and Jerry, are five alpacas owned by Jane Unsworth who live on the slopes of the hill.

These successes are often put down to press bias, or our deference towards posh rulers, the power of Brexit, or a rapport with the English working class \u2013 a rapport that the left supposedly doesn\u2019t understand. In other words, his ascent and seemingly impregnable position since are explained in largely British terms.</p> <p>That\u2019s justifiable: everywhere in the world, a lot of politics is local. But another way of looking at the great balloon of his popularity \u2013 how it\u2019s kept inflated, and why attempts to puncture it so often fail \u2013 is to remember the leader he perhaps most resembles.</p> <p>In 2011, he told the Sunday Telegraph that <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/8901683/Boris-Johnson-Ive-a-healthy-dose-of-sheer-egomania.html\">Ronald Reagan</a> was his favourite politician. Like Johnson, Reagan was a telegenic celebrity who became a high-profile regional and then national politician; first as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorship_of_Ronald_Reagan\">governor of California</a> from 1967 to 1975, and then as <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/ronald-reagan/\">US president from 1981 to 1989</a>.</p> <p>As with Johnson, Reagan\u2019s periods in office were frequently marked by broken promises and scandals, by evasiveness and incompetence. Having <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-01-10-8902240061-story.html\">pledged to eliminate</a> the federal government\u2019s debt \u201cby 1983, if not earlier\u201d, he trebled it during his presidency. In the mid-80s, when some of his senior officials were found to have illegally aided rightwing rebels in Nicaragua, he professed ignorance.</p> <p>Like his counterpart, Reagan sometimes came across in public as vague, not in control of events, out of his depth. Many commentators, and even some close colleagues, thought he was lazy and often disengaged. Yet many Americans weren\u2019t bothered by his shortcomings. Exasperated critics called him the \u201cTeflon president\u201d \u2013 responsibility for anything bad rarely stuck to him. Johnson\u2019s enemies know the feeling.</p> <p>Reagan expressed a hazy but potent sense of optimism instead. \u201cUnfailingly he sent forth the message that people wanted to hear: better days were ahead,\u201d wrote the historian Haynes Johnson in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/20/books/books-of-the-times-recounting-the-lowlights-of-the-reagan-years.html\">Sleepwalking Through History: America in the Reagan Years</a>. Our prime minister does the same.</p> <p>And while Reagan smiled and chuckled for the cameras, out of sight the ideologues and hard men of his circle \u2013 the Dominic Cummings and Lynton Crosbys of their day \u2013 further militarised the American state and inserted coded racial messages into his election campaigns.

      "bodyText": "For a politician of such obvious limitations, Boris Johnson\u2019s success can be perplexing. He can\u2019t cope with hostile questions. He can\u2019t cope at prime minister\u2019s questions. He\u2019s no good on detail. His speeches ramble. His premiership and mayoralty have had many failures, from the garden bridge to the coronavirus, and few tangible achievements. His attempts to avoid scrutiny - such as hiding in a fridge during the election - often seem desperate. And yet he wins elections and has high personal ratings regardless. These successes are often put down to press bias, or our deference towards posh rulers, the power of Brexit, or a rapport with the English working class \u2013 a rapport that the left supposedly doesn\u2019t understand. In other words, his ascent and seemingly impregnable position since are explained in largely British terms. That\u2019s justifiable: everywhere in the world, a lot of politics is local. But another way of looking at the great balloon of his popularity \u2013 how it\u2019s kept inflated, and why attempts to puncture it so often fail \u2013 is to remember the leader he perhaps most resembles. In 2011, he told the Sunday Telegraph that Ronald Reagan was his favourite politician. Like Johnson, Reagan was a telegenic celebrity who became a high-profile regional and then national politician; first as governor of California from 1967 to 1975, and then as US president from 1981 to 1989. As with Johnson, Reagan\u2019s periods in office were frequently marked by broken promises and scandals, by evasiveness and incompetence. Having pledged to eliminate the federal government\u2019s debt \u201cby 1983, if not earlier\u201d, he trebled it during his presidency. In the mid-80s, when some of his senior officials were found to have illegally aided rightwing rebels in Nicaragua, he professed ignorance. Like his counterpart, Reagan sometimes came across in public as vague, not in control of events, out of his depth. Many commentators, and even some close colleagues, thought he was lazy and often disengaged. Yet many Americans weren\u2019t bothered by his shortcomings. Exasperated critics called him the \u201cTeflon president\u201d \u2013 responsibility for anything bad rarely stuck to him. Johnson\u2019s enemies know the feeling. Reagan expressed a hazy but potent sense of optimism instead. \u201cUnfailingly he sent forth the message that people wanted to hear: better days were ahead,\u201d wrote the historian Haynes Johnson in Sleepwalking Through History: America in the Reagan Years. Our prime minister does the same. And while Reagan smiled and chuckled for the cameras, out of sight the ideologues and hard men of his circle \u2013 the Dominic Cummings and Lynton Crosbys of their day \u2013 further militarised the American state and inserted coded racial messages into his election campaigns. A likeable premier, as Johnson remains to many Britons, is a great decoy for a government with confrontational aims. How can opponents trap such slippery leaders? When Reagan stood for re-election in 1984, the Democrats tried soberly pointing out his flaws and warning about their consequences. Their candidate, Walter Mondale, a lawyer by profession, accused Reagan of \u201cirresponsibility and deception\u201d in office, and said that taxes would have to rise as a consequence. He lost to Reagan in 49 of the 50 states. This may be a warning to Keir Starmer, even as he exposes Johnson\u2019s bluffing and recklessness with almost embarrassing ease in parliament. Sometimes, voters prefer irresponsible leaders to realistic ones \u2013 partly because voters can be political fantasists themselves. Previously a successful but hammy actor, as president Reagan maintained a persona that was so obviously mannered, delivering patriotic one-liners like a movie cowboy, that when he bent the truth many people weren\u2019t shocked or necessarily disapproving. Instead, they judged the quality of his act. The similarly cartoonish public Johnson often gets the same indulgent treatment, with his half-truths tolerated as just him \u201cbeing Boris\u201d. Boris isn\u2019t even his real first name. He does lack one of Reagan\u2019s advantages, though. In the 80s, with Silicon Valley burgeoning and the Soviet bloc in terminal decline, America\u2019s position in the world really was improving. The famous claim of Reagan\u2019s re-election campaign, that \u201cit\u2019s morning again in America\u201d, was a blend of truth and fantasy \u2013 which is often the most effective propaganda of all. But in today\u2019s Britain, it\u2019s much harder to promise, as Johnson did yet again this week, that under him the country \u201ccan be stronger and better than ever before\u201d. Divided by Brexit and devolution, struggling economically even before the lockdown, the UK is an increasingly risky place for politicians to be bullish about. There is a danger of them sounding deluded and absurd. Johnson\u2019s cheery nationalism may backfire in ways that Reagan\u2019s never did. We\u2019re not there yet.

      "body": "<p>The decision to force air passengers into quarantine when they arrive in the UK \u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense\u201d at this stage of the coronavirus pandemic, a senior government adviser has told the Guardian, piling pressure on ministers to explain the scientific basis for their border policies.</p> <p>Air passengers are facing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/11/heathrow-calls-for-urgent-plan-to-restart-more-flights\">mandatory quarantine on arrival</a> to avert a new wave of infections as lockdown measures are eased. Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/boris-johnson-coronavirus-lockdown-shops-schools-june-reopening\">told the nation on Sunday</a>: \u201cTo prevent reinfection from abroad, I am serving notice that it will soon be the time \u2013 with transmission significantly lower \u2013 to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air.\u201d</p> <p>The measures, set to be introduced at the end of the month, will reportedly see air passengers asked to provide an address where they will self-isolate for 14 days, with spot checks and fines for breaches - but will not apply to sea or rail arrivals.</p> <p>The source told the Guardian the plans would only reduce risk if the UK had lower rates of infection than the countries from which passengers were arriving, which is no longer the case for most nations in the European Union.</p> <p>Speaking anonymously, the government adviser said: \u201cThere was really no scientific advice to inform the latest announcement. It also doesn\u2019t really make sense for countries which have lower per capita current Covid case numbers than us; for example, most of the EU.</p> <p>\u201cThat sort of policy only reduces risk in the situation where we have very low case numbers and origin countries have much higher numbers.\u201d</p> <p>Britain\u2019s aviation and tourism industries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/11/heathrow-calls-for-urgent-plan-to-restart-more-flights\">warned</a> that the quarantine plan risks worsening the economic impact of Covid-19. A letter signed by the chief executives of easyJet, Heathrow and Gatwick voiced \u201ccollective and serious concern and frustration\u201d, adding: \u201cAn open-ended quarantine, with no set end date, will make an already critical situation for UK aviation, and all the businesses we support, even worse.\u201d</p> <p>There has been mounting scrutiny of UK border controls in the run-up to the crisis. It emerged that 18.1m people arrived in the UK by air between 1 January and 23 March and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/just-273-people-arriving-in-uk-in-run-up-to-lockdown-quarantined\">only 273 </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/just-273-people-arriving-in-uk-in-run-up-to-lockdown-quarantined\">were formally quarantined</a>.</p> <p>Until 13 March the government advised incoming passengers from specific hotspot countries, including Italy, Iran and parts of China, to self-isolate, but this was dropped \u2013 \u201cinexplicably\u201d, according to Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee.</p> <p>Since then, the government has relied on posters and leaflets to keep new arrivals informed. In April, with flight routes cut and a call to end all but essential travel, at least 95,000 people entered the UK.</p> <p>Asked if an enforced quarantine policy would have had more impact before the lockdown, the senior adviser said: \u201cEveryone was unaware of the extent to which the virus had been seeded into Spain and Italy until those outbreaks started resulting in large numbers of hospital cases. At which point Spain and Italy were added to the list of countries for which traveller surveillance was in force.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, we now know that a lot of infection was being seeded into London at about the same time as it was being seeded in Italy and Spain. It is also clear now that the border surveillance in place \u2013 looking for cases in travellers \u2013 missed most cases.</p> <p>\u201cCompulsory quarantine of all travellers might have had a greater impact, but it\u2019s not something we\u2019ve looked at in detail. But without doubt, introducing lockdown earlier would have had the biggest impact on total deaths.\u201d</p> <p>The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) discussed the forthcoming measures at a meeting on 7 May but the advice it issued is yet to be published. A spokesperson said it would be published in \u201ccoming weeks\u201d.</p> <p>Prof Gary McLean, a professor in molecular immunology at London Metropolitan University, backed the adviser\u2019s view. He said the plans for new border measures \u201cdon\u2019t make logical sense\u201d, adding: \u201cIn all reality they should\u2019ve done this two months ago, not now.\u201d</p> <p>McLean said the continued community transmission of Covid-19 in the UK, with new official figures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/148000-in-england-infected-with-coronavirus-in-last-two-weeks\">suggesting 10,000 new cases a day</a>, meant that imposing a quarantine on arrivals would be unlikely to make much difference to the trajectory of the epidemic.</p> <p>\u201cIf our internal community numbers were to drop down to very low by the end of this month it may be worthwhile, but while we\u2019re seeing community transmission here already I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to make any difference,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The decision to impose restrictions only on those arriving by air also makes no sense, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to stop someone from New York flying to Paris and taking the Eurostar to London,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe started [restrictions] late and we\u2019re finishing early.

      "bodyText": "The decision to force air passengers into quarantine when they arrive in the UK \u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense\u201d at this stage of the coronavirus pandemic, a senior government adviser has told the Guardian, piling pressure on ministers to explain the scientific basis for their border policies. Air passengers are facing mandatory quarantine on arrival to avert a new wave of infections as lockdown measures are eased. Boris Johnson told the nation on Sunday: \u201cTo prevent reinfection from abroad, I am serving notice that it will soon be the time \u2013 with transmission significantly lower \u2013 to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air.\u201d The measures, set to be introduced at the end of the month, will reportedly see air passengers asked to provide an address where they will self-isolate for 14 days, with spot checks and fines for breaches - but will not apply to sea or rail arrivals. The source told the Guardian the plans would only reduce risk if the UK had lower rates of infection than the countries from which passengers were arriving, which is no longer the case for most nations in the European Union. Speaking anonymously, the government adviser said: \u201cThere was really no scientific advice to inform the latest announcement. It also doesn\u2019t really make sense for countries which have lower per capita current Covid case numbers than us; for example, most of the EU. \u201cThat sort of policy only reduces risk in the situation where we have very low case numbers and origin countries have much higher numbers.\u201d Britain\u2019s aviation and tourism industries warned that the quarantine plan risks worsening the economic impact of Covid-19. A letter signed by the chief executives of easyJet, Heathrow and Gatwick voiced \u201ccollective and serious concern and frustration\u201d, adding: \u201cAn open-ended quarantine, with no set end date, will make an already critical situation for UK aviation, and all the businesses we support, even worse.\u201d There has been mounting scrutiny of UK border controls in the run-up to the crisis. It emerged that 18.1m people arrived in the UK by air between 1 January and 23 March and only 273 were formally quarantined. Until 13 March the government advised incoming passengers from specific hotspot countries, including Italy, Iran and parts of China, to self-isolate, but this was dropped \u2013 \u201cinexplicably\u201d, according to Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee. Since then, the government has relied on posters and leaflets to keep new arrivals informed. In April, with flight routes cut and a call to end all but essential travel, at least 95,000 people entered the UK. Asked if an enforced quarantine policy would have had more impact before the lockdown, the senior adviser said: \u201cEveryone was unaware of the extent to which the virus had been seeded into Spain and Italy until those outbreaks started resulting in large numbers of hospital cases. At which point Spain and Italy were added to the list of countries for which traveller surveillance was in force. \u201cHowever, we now know that a lot of infection was being seeded into London at about the same time as it was being seeded in Italy and Spain. It is also clear now that the border surveillance in place \u2013 looking for cases in travellers \u2013 missed most cases. \u201cCompulsory quarantine of all travellers might have had a greater impact, but it\u2019s not something we\u2019ve looked at in detail. But without doubt, introducing lockdown earlier would have had the biggest impact on total deaths.\u201d The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) discussed the forthcoming measures at a meeting on 7 May but the advice it issued is yet to be published. A spokesperson said it would be published in \u201ccoming weeks\u201d. Prof Gary McLean, a professor in molecular immunology at London Metropolitan University, backed the adviser\u2019s view. He said the plans for new border measures \u201cdon\u2019t make logical sense\u201d, adding: \u201cIn all reality they should\u2019ve done this two months ago, not now.\u201d McLean said the continued community transmission of Covid-19 in the UK, with new official figures suggesting 10,000 new cases a day, meant that imposing a quarantine on arrivals would be unlikely to make much difference to the trajectory of the epidemic. \u201cIf our internal community numbers were to drop down to very low by the end of this month it may be worthwhile, but while we\u2019re seeing community transmission here already I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to make any difference,\u201d he said. The decision to impose restrictions only on those arriving by air also makes no sense, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to stop someone from New York flying to Paris and taking the Eurostar to London,\u201d he said. \u201cWe started [restrictions] late and we\u2019re finishing early. It\u2019s really crazy. It\u2019s driven by political decisions and economic problems they want to fix. This bolt-on of 14-day quarantine for air travel is just bizarre.\u201d The government is yet to publish the scientific advice from Sage on controls at the border, despite repeated requests from MPs. At a commons select committee on Wednesday, John Aston, the Home Office chief scientific adviser, who attends meetings of Sage, repeatedly failed to provide an estimated proportion or number of people who had arrived in the UK with Covid-19. He said that a more \u201crobust\u201d assessment was the ratio of imported cases to domestic cases. This model, formulated by Sage, estimates 0.5% of all cases on any given day were imported from overseas. A government spokesperson said: \u201cAs the prime minister said, we will soon be introducing measures that will mean those arriving in the UK from overseas will be required to self-isolate to help to keep transmission levels low and prevent re-infection from abroad and a second wave of cases that overwhelms the NHS. \u201cWe have been clear that people should not travel abroad except for essential journeys, and the vast majority of people have complied with our approach which is, and has always been, driven by the latest scientific and medical advice. Passenger arrivals in the UK at the end of April were down by 99%.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 21 May 2020 to clarify that the 18.1m people who entered the UK between 1 January and 23 March were air passengers, and did not arrive by \u201cland, sea and air\u201d as an earlier version stated.",

      "bodyText": "As I write, it is week four \u2013 possibly five? \u2013 of the coronavirus-induced lockdown. I cannot measure out my life in coffee spoons, as I do not have one of those fancy espresso machines, but nevertheless there are the daily routines of tea and biscuits, stroking the cat, ignoring emails and then, finally, working. Usually after I have found and considered random things around the house: a lanyard that belongs to the past; a book I hated, stuffed under a piece of furniture. At some point in the day, I make my escape. I head towards space that is open and green; towards water, which knows nothing of the interruption to ordinary life. I live near a park with a small boating lake \u2013 more of a puddle with airs and graces and pedalos; a baseball pitch, which if it could talk would be in a faux-Boston drawl; a running track; and an outdoor gym, which is currently taped off. It\u2019s not a gym as such, more pieces of metal for men with equal-sized egos and biceps, but that\u2019s OK. I sort of miss them now. I enjoy the sportiness of this park. I often take a few minutes to watch the convivial backslaps of teammates. And no matter how old I get, I will never stop gatecrashing kids with footballs. Whether in the dusty streets of Havana or the alleys of northern towns, I will impose myself in a way that is utterly undignified. I long for the netless goal frames on a heath too far away to visit frequently, and I ache for its woods and swimming pond. I miss all the dogs. We are no longer allowed to pet dogs and I am not sure how to explain that, except to say that it instantly calls to mind the opening lines of Ford Madox Ford\u2019s novel The Good Soldier (\u201cThis is the saddest story I have ever heard\u201d). I can still indulge in that other great social pleasure of the parks, the smile and nod at benevolent strangers. It is odd that, because of what is happening in the world, small talk is now inescapably of very big things indeed. Much has been made of the drop in pollution. The decrease in noise and the increase in quiet. It is palpable. I can hear the flap of birds\u2019 wings. The fizz of bike chains. The crunch of gravel underfoot. Gone, though, is the chatter and scraping of chairs in cafes. The incongruity of parks is that they are where one can go simultaneously to have time alone and feel part of a community. That is a neat magic trick. Lockdown has focused the mind on the things we miss most, the things we cannot do and the places we cannot go. Sometimes\u2026 the grass really is greener.",

On 2 May the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/covid-19-deaths-twice-as-high-in-poorest-areas-in-england-and-wales\">front-page story</a> reported on Office for National Statistics (ONS) data that found people in the poorest parts of England and Wales were dying at twice the rate of those in the richest areas. It ran under the headline, \u201cUK\u2019s corona divide\u201d.</p> <p>Given space constraints on page one, \u201cUK\u201d located the story \u2013 this was not an international or other demographic divide \u2013 but a reader suggested that if the Guardian amplifies an article to UK level, it should \u201cget info from Scotland and Northern Ireland and complete the story\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cGet info\u201d can be easier asked than done. The data team is working tirelessly to gather and contextualise information from seven statistical authorities across the UK, which in the words of Caelainn Barr, the Guardian\u2019s data projects editor, release data at \u201cdifferent times, about different things and with changing parameters\u201d. Agencies understandably have their own priorities.</p> <p>The ONS is the \u201cstatistical institute of the UK\u201d, but when it comes to health and other topics where policy is devolved, these are produced by the relevant administrations. In the case of the 2 May story, equivalent data on death and deprivation was unfortunately not available.</p> <p>I will return to some of these themes in later columns. In the meantime, while reporting across the UK is often more complex than first seen, a lack of clarity or accuracy in coverage should not add to confusion and I am pleased that fresh internal guidance was circulated this week. Right now, this matters more than ever.</p> <p>\u2022 Elisabeth Ribbans is the Guardian\u2019s readers\u2019 editor.

Given space constraints on page one, \u201cUK\u201d located the story \u2013 this was not an international or other demographic divide \u2013 but a reader suggested that if the Guardian amplifies an article to UK level, it should \u201cget info from Scotland and Northern Ireland and complete the story\u201d. \u201cGet info\u201d can be easier asked than done. The data team is working tirelessly to gather and contextualise information from seven statistical authorities across the UK, which in the words of Caelainn Barr, the Guardian\u2019s data projects editor, release data at \u201cdifferent times, about different things and with changing parameters\u201d. Agencies understandably have their own priorities. The ONS is the \u201cstatistical institute of the UK\u201d, but when it comes to health and other topics where policy is devolved, these are produced by the relevant administrations. In the case of the 2 May story, equivalent data on death and deprivation was unfortunately not available. I will return to some of these themes in later columns. In the meantime, while reporting across the UK is often more complex than first seen, a lack of clarity or accuracy in coverage should not add to confusion and I am pleased that fresh internal guidance was circulated this week. Right now, this matters more than ever. \u2022 Elisabeth Ribbans is the Guardian\u2019s readers\u2019 editor. Contact her at guardian.readers@theguardian.com",

Longer term, the possibility of shipping them to Canada was discussed, an idea instantly vetoed by Winston Churchill who asserted: \u2018Hide them in caves and cellars, but not one picture shall leave this island.\u2019 The paintings instead found a safe home in the unused slate mines of Manod Quarry. Image: The Madonna and Child with Saint John the Baptist and Saint Nicholas of Bari (The Ansidei Madonna), 1505, Raphael (1483-1520), The National Gallery, London, 2:D - The concerts were a huge success, witnesses reporting that the musicians playing did not miss a beat even when a bomb detonated during a lunchtime concert at the other end of the building. Exhibitions of work by war artists and contemporary artists were held and by 1942 one painting a month was brought back to exhibit in London. Titian\u2019s Noli me Tangere was the first \u2018painting of the month\u2019. Image: Noli me Tangere, about 1514, Titian (c 1488-1576), The National Gallery, London, 3:B - 'To cast roses before swine\u2019 like the better-known phrase \u2018to throw [rose] pearls before swine\u2019 meant to waste a quality product or time on an unappreciative recipient. Jan Steen (1626\u20131679) warns of the effects of drunkenness; the birch with which Dutch criminals were beaten, and the beggar's crutch in the basket above her head signal her future (if the embers from her clay pipe don\u2019t set her alight first!). Image: The Effects of Intemperance, about 1663-5, Jan Steen (1625/1626-1679), The National Gallery, London, 4:B - The couple married about a year before this was painted in All Saints Church (pictured between the trees) and had their first child in 1851. The faint lines might indicate the tail of a pheasant, but would Mr Andrews with his hunting dog and rifle have invited the wrath of his wife by dropping a dead cock pheasant on her blue silk skirt? Image: Mr and Mrs Andrews, about 1750, Thomas Gainsborough (1727-1788) The National Gallery, London, 5:C - This image is of a transitional moment; an old Battle of Trafalgar warship being tugged to be broken up, appears with Turner\u2019s quote: \u2018Light is therefore colour\u2019 on new \u00a320 notes (released February 2020). Turner never sold this painting, despite offers. He left it to the nation for free, along with his entire catalogue of unowned works. Image: The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her Last Berth to be broken up, 1838, 1839, Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775-1851) The National Gallery, London, 6:A - Known as the Arnolfini Portrait, we don\u2019t know for certain which members of the family are shown. The artist\u2019s signature is below the mirror: Johannes de Eyck fuit hic. 1434 (\u2018Jan van Eyck was here\u2019). Are the men in the mirror Van Eyck himself and his servant, arriving on a visit? The dog, a symbol of marital fidelity, appears to have been one of the last parts painted. Image: Portrait of Giovanni (?) Arnolfini and his Wife, 1434, Jan van Eyck (c.1380/1390-1441) The National Gallery, London, 7:B - The ashcan school was formed at the beginning of the 20th century as American painters, principally in New York City and Philadelphia, began to develop a uniquely American point of view on the beauty, violence and speed of the modern world \u2013 and a new way to represent them. Image: Men of the Docks, 1912, George Bellows (1882\u20131925),The National Gallery, London , 8:D - Monet and his friend the painter Eug\u00e8ne Boudin spent their summer at Trouville, sometimes painting side-by-side in the open air. Grains of sand blown by the sea breeze on to the canvas became embedded in the wet paint, between the rungs of the grey chair, as Monet painted. A child\u2019s shoe hooked on the back of the chair may belong to their three-year-old son Jean who went with them.

As the death toll rises, Trump\u2019s claims to global leadership have became more far-fetched.

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that the US is \u201cleading the world\u201d with its response to the pandemic, but it does not seem to be going in any direction the world wants to follow. Across Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America, views of the US handling of the coronavirus crisis are uniformly negative and range from horror through derision to sympathy. Donald Trump\u2019s musings from the White House briefing room, particularly his thoughts on injecting disinfectant, have drawn the attention of the planet. \u201cOver more than two centuries, the United States has stirred a very wide range of feelings in the rest of the world: love and hatred, fear and hope, envy and contempt, awe and anger,\u201d the columnist Fintan O\u2019Toole wrote in the Irish Times. \u201cBut there is one emotion that has never been directed towards the US until now: pity.\u201d The US has emerged as a global hotspot for the pandemic, a giant petri dish for the Sars-CoV-2 virus. As the death toll rises, Trump\u2019s claims to global leadership have became more far-fetched. He told Republicans last week that he had had a round of phone calls with Angela Merkel, Shinzo Abe and other unnamed world leaders and insisted \u201cso many of them, almost all of them, I would say all of them\u201d believe the US is leading the way. None of the leaders he mentioned has said anything to suggest that was true. At each milestone of the crisis, European leaders have been taken aback by Trump\u2019s lack of consultation with them \u2013 when he suspended travel to the US from Europe on 12 March without warning Brussels, for example. A week later, politicians in Berlin accused Trump of an \u201cunfriendly act\u201d for offering \u201clarge sums of money\u201d to get a German company developing a vaccine to move its research wing to the US. The president\u2019s abrupt decision to cut funding to the World Health Organization last month also came as a shock. The EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, a former Spanish foreign minister, wrote on Twitter: \u201cThere is no reason justifying this move at a moment when their efforts are needed more than ever to help contain &amp; mitigate the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d A poll in France last week found Merkel to be far and away the most trusted world leader. Just 2% had confidence Trump was leading the world in the right direction. Only Boris Johnson and Xi Jinping inspired less faith. A survey this week by the British Foreign Policy Group found 28% of Britons trusted the US to act responsibly on the world stage, a drop of 13 percentage points since January, with the biggest drop in confidence coming among Conservative voters. Dacian Ciolo\u0219, a former prime minister of Romania who now leads the Renew Europe group in the European parliament, captured a general European view this week as the latest statistics on deaths in the US were reported. \u201cPost-truth communication techniques used by rightwing populism movements simply do not work to beat Covid-19,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cAnd we see that populism cost lives.\u201d Around the globe, the \u201cAmerica first\u201d response pursued by the Trump administration has alienated close allies. In Canada, it was the White House order in April to halt shipments of critical N95 protective masks to Canadian hospitals that was the breaking point. The Ontario premier, Doug Ford, who had previously spoken out in support of Trump on several occasions, said the decision was like letting a family member \u201cstarve\u201d during a crisis. \u201cWhen the cards are down, you see who your friends are,\u201d said Ford. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s been very clear over the last couple of days who our friends are.\u201d In countries known for chronic problems of governance, there has been a sense of wonder that the US appears to have joined their ranks. Esmir Milavi\u0107, an editor at Bosnia\u2019s N1 TV channel, told viewers this week: \u201cThe White House is in utter dysfunction and doesn\u2019t speak with one voice.\u201d Milavi\u0107 said: \u201cThe vice-president is wearing a mask, while the president doesn\u2019t; some staffers wear them, some don\u2019t. Everybody acts as they please. As time passes, White House begins to look more and more like the Balkans.\u201d After Trump\u2019s disinfectant comments, Beppe Severgnini, a columnist for Italy\u2019s Corriere della Sera, said in a TV interview: \u201cTrying to get into Donald Trump\u2019s head is more difficult than finding a vaccine for coronavirus.

It\u2019s like a Mel Brooks film.\u201d In several countries, the local health authorities have felt obliged to put out statements to counter \u201chealth advice\u201d coming from the White House, concerning the ingestion of disinfectant and taking hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug found to be ineffective against Covid-19 and potentially lethal. The Nigerian government put out a warning that there is no \u201chard evidence that chloroquine is effective in prevention or management of coronavirus infection\u201d after three people were hospitalised from overdosing on the drug in Lagos. It was not enough to prevent a fivefold increase in the price of the drug, which is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Trump\u2019s decision not to take part in a global effort to find a vaccine, and his abrupt severance of financial support to the WHO at the height of the pandemic, added outrage and prompted complaints that the US was surrendering its role of global leadership. \u201cIf there is any world leader who can be accused of handling the current crisis badly, it is Donald Trump, whose initial disdain for Covid-19 may have cost thousands of Americans their lives,\u201d an editorial in the conservative Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper said last month. The newspaper said Trump had only decided to take Covid seriously after finding himself \u201ccornered by the facts\u201d \u2013 and expressed shock at his decision to halt WHO funding. \u201cEven by the standards of his behaviour, the level of impudence is astonishing for the holder of an office that, until just a few years ago, was a considered reference in leadership for the democratic world,\u201d it said. Nowhere in the world is the US response to the pandemic more routinely castigated than in China. It is hardly surprising. Trump has consistently pointed to Chinese culpability in failing to contain the outbreak in its early stages, and the pandemic has become the central battleground for global leadership between the established superpower and the emerging challenger. There is a palpable sense of relief among Chinese state commentators that the US president\u2019s antics have diverted some of the anger that would otherwise have been aimed at Beijing. \u201cOnly by making Americans hate China can they make sure that the public might overlook the fact that Trump\u2019s team is stained with the blood of Americans,\u201d said an English-language Global Times editorial late last month.

      "bodyText": "For Nurudeen Olugbade taking photographs of life in Orile-Iganmu, Lagos state, during the pandemic is a way to affirm that the disruption it has wrought on the neglected town does matter. \u201cWe are not really seen. There\u2019s very little attention paid to us but the struggle out here is real,\u201d says Olugbade, 28, who has documented the crisis on his phone. In recent months the strict measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 have changed the character of the town. Ordinarily Orile, as it\u2019s usually known, is a vibrant town but footfall has waned on the streets lined with makeshift stores built out from weathered housing units. Many of the businesses that are allowed to trade as the lockdown slowly eases are open for fewer hours, to fewer customers. Informal work such as cleaning and making deliveries, usually serving more affluent parts of the city of Ikeja, have slowed. For the past two months a powdered milk factory in Orile that employs hundreds of people has been shut. An alarming rise in armed robberies, cult killings and gang warfare has unsettled those in communities that are struggling during the pandemic, roaming the area in search of work during the day, and too frightened to sleep at night. \u201cEverybody is on their guard,\u201d says Olugbade. \u201cFor a couple of weeks, a situation has been going on in the area. One million boys \u2013 they\u2019re an infamous gang that is terrorising places and looting. They haven\u2019t come yet but people are really afraid.\u201d Olugbade works for a small business delivering grilled chicken from Orile, mainly to middle-class customers on Lagos Island. Business quicklydried up under lockdown. \u201cMost customers aren\u2019t calling for food much because they don\u2019t want you bringing coronavirus to them. They\u2019re afraid of being infected but we\u2019re afraid of losing our work.\u201d Taking and editing pictures absorbs the hours between rare deliveries, he says. \u201cI just walk around capturing things. I\u2019ve been taking pictures seriously for about seven years, mostly on my phone, or when I\u2019ve borrowed a camera.\u201d For Olugbade, taking pictures during a pandemic is not too difficult. He wears a mask and maintains a distance. A phone is less provocative than a camera, he says. But not everyone he wants to take photos of permits him to do so. \u201cMost people find taking pictures intrusive and end up declining, which is understandable; not everyone wants to be documented,\u201d he says. Scattered among the trampled plastic in his slum are often the clear sachets used for drinking water, commonly called \u201cpure-water\u201d. He used shoelaces to turn some of these into face masks. For the photo series, one evening his neighbours\u2019 children wear the plastic masks that draw against the mouth when they breathe. The children stand against a wall, facing his smartphone squarely and holding up lined paper with two-line statements: \u201cNo face masks\u201d, \u201cno sanitiser\u201d, \u201cno food\u201d. \u201cI came up with the idea with a friend . Those are his children in the pictures,\u201d he says, adding that his intention was to highlight the inequalities exacerbated by the lockdown measures. \u201cThere\u2019s a rule that says you have to wear face masks but people feel they are not readily available here,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to speak to that because the government has failed people. They aren\u2019t making any provisions whatsoever.\u201d A face mask costs 100 naira ($0.26), which many people cannot afford during the lockdown. Sanitisers, gloves and soap have all become more expensive as demand has gone up. Those residents who can afford to mostly stay in their homes, following the government measures intended to inhibit the spread of the virus. For others, however, the measures are unfeasible, and the protections too expensive, fuelling apathy towards the outbreak. In Orile, constant exposure to dangerous environmental conditions also compounds the lack of urgency for many residents. \u201cThere are so many chemicals around, you inhale so many things in the environment. The pollution is bad,\u201d he says. \u201cThe borehole that we get water from is contaminated, it\u2019s surrounded by slums. So when you get the water you just put lime in it and use it. \u201cI think many people find it hard to really take this virus as being more serious than what they experience every day.\u201d Some people see the masks less as a a precaution against the virus and more of a licence to be able to leave the area without being stopped by police. \u201cSomeone close by sells them, but people try on different masks, handling them then buy it and wear it,\u201d he laughs. \u201cReally, I feel it\u2019s just a passport.\u201d Half of the 4,900 confirmed Covid-19 infections in Nigeria are in Lagos. The rate of new cases across the country is accelerating, doubling in the last 10 days. But his sense is that in the minds of many local people, the virus itself is less of a risk than its effects on daily life. \u201cPeople are not scared of coronavirus, the thing people are scared of is hunger.\u201d When lockdown measures were brought in, the Lagos state government announced that food packages would be distributed to the poorest areas. But such help has been limited and irregular, fuelling resentment. \u201cLast week a couple of people were going house to house to count people because the local government wanted to give provisions. Later there were rumours that they gave the food to a few people and split it among themselves. We didn\u2019t see any of the help they promised.\u201d The pandemic has been draining and left many people feeling more withdrawn, Olugbade explains. \u201cIt makes it harder to connect to people but even so there are so many stories to tell here.\u201d",

The letter comes at a tense moment in EU-UK relations, with both sides expected to report later on the latest round of talks, which conclude on Friday morning. One of the government\u2019s criticisms is the lack of official campaigns in EU member states to raise awareness about new requirements for UK nationals \u2013 a stipulation under the treaty. France and Spain, home to large numbers of UK migrant workers and retired people, are deemed not to have done anything proactive to raise awareness among British residents.

In Austria and Slovenia the government is concerned British nationals have only six or seven months to secure their rights, whereas EU nationals in the UK have 27 months. Other EU member states, such as Malta, Cyprus and Slovakia, are faulted for relying on face-to-face meetings with local officials, rather than offering people the option to secure their status online. Gove complains that some countries have still not provided detail on what their application processes will entail. The government is also concerned about limited attention to vulnerable UK citizens, with Gove stating that member states have not shared information about help for elderly, hard-to-reach or other vulnerable citizens, adding that \u201cin many cases there appears to be none\u201d. In contrast the government says the UK has given \u00a39m to help community organisations support vulnerable EU nationals, with a further \u00a38m due in 2020-21. It also reports \u00a33m earmarked to help support British nationals in the EU. Gove represents the government in the Joint Committee, an EU-UK group set up to monitor compliance and implement the Brexit withdrawal treaty, which came into force when the UK left the EU on 31 January. The letter is addressed to his opposite number, the European commission vice-president Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d. While EU governments are responsible for protecting citizens\u2019 rights, the government has called on the commission \u2013 the ultimate enforcer of EU law \u2013 to step in. The letter echoes some complaints made by European politicians over the treatment of EU nationals in the UK. The government revealed last month it had received 3.4m applications from people seeking to stay in the EU through the settled status scheme. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he had paid \u201cclose attention\u201d to Gove\u2019s letter. While he did not say whether he shared the British government\u2019s analysis of the problems facing British citizens, he promised the commission would be vigilant, adding that guidance had been published for national authorities to implement the citizens\u2019 rights part of the withdrawal agreement. \u201cWe will do the necessary dialogue with each of the member states concerned,\u201d he told reporters. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 May 2020. An earlier version stated that \u201cthe Czech Republic and Hungary have published information that is thought to be confusing or out-of-date\u201d. This has been amended to clarify that this is the UK government\u2019s assessment.",

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government has committed an extra $48m to mental health measures after states and territories met on Friday to consider the supports in place for Australians as Covid-19 lockdown restrictions ease around the country. Scott Morrison welcomed news that states and territories were \u201coverwhelmingly through step one\u201d of the three-stage easing of restrictions outlined on 8 May. From this weekend, cafes and restaurants will be open to 10 dine-in customers in most eastern states, except Victoria. Morrison singled out the Northern Territory \u2013 the first jurisdiction to reopen pubs and gyms \u2013 by noting the chief minister Michael Gunner \u201cwas able to pull the first brew\u201d on Friday. The national cabinet met on Friday to discuss new mental health measures, a three-stage process to restore elective surgery and a framework to lift travel restrictions in remote communities. After the meeting, the health minister, Greg Hunt, announced the mental health package, consisting of $29.5m of outreach for at-risk communities, $7.3m for collecting better data and $10.4m for an information campaign that \u201cit\u2019s okay not to be okay\u201d. Victoria has already committed $19.5m to mental health measures, with further packages expected from each state and territory. In New South Wales, treasury officials told the Covid-19 committee on Friday that the Berejiklian government will also announce a package to support international students and higher education next week, following similar measures in Victoria. Hunt revealed \u201cheartening\u201d early information from Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania that in the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic \u201cthere has been no known increase in suicide rates in those three states\u201d. Christine Morgan, the chief executive of the national mental health commission, said it was \u201cheartening to look at those figures and to say it hasn\u2019t got worse\u201d. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t get worse,\u201d she said, warning that further efforts to ensure people \u201cstay connected\u201d will be needed to guard against deteriorating mental health. Morrison noted the human biosecurity emergency enabling broad commonwealth powers to respond to Covid-19 has been extended to 17 September. Morrison was probed about whether coronavirus support measures including the jobkeeper wage subsidy, jobseeker unemployment benefit and free childcare will be extended. Morrison said the education minister, Dan Tehan, was conducting a review but warned free childcare was \u201cnot a sustainable model for how the childcare sector should work, and nor was it intended to be. And so at this point, no final decision has been made on those issues. \u201cBut the intention was always to return to the payment arrangements and subsidy arrangements that had been put in place prior to those things coming into effect.\u201d Morrison said that 1.6 million people were receiving jobseeker and the $1,500 fortnightly jobkeeper wage subsidy had now beaten estimates of reaching 6 million workers, with 6.1 million people receiving the payment. The government has stared down internal calls to end jobkeeper sooner than September, but Morrison did not rule out changing the rate of the wage subsidy, after Labor suggested trimming the payment for some workers in return for expanded eligibility. \u201cNow, we\u2019re only seven weeks now into a six-month program, and it is very premature, I think, to be making judgments about what possible changes might be made,\u201d Morrison said. Morrison played down US president Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that he could move the manufacture of parts for the F-35 joint strike fighter to the US, imperilling thousands of Australian jobs. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what occurs there as it rolls out,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cBut we have our contracts and arrangements in place for all of those matters.

Australia has been hit by China\u2019s plans to impose tariffs on barley imports and a ban on beef from four abattoirs. \u201cWhen it comes to our relationship with China, it is built on mutual benefit and we have a comprehensive strategic partnership which we\u2019ve formed,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cAnd within that partnership, there are issues that need to be addressed from time to time.\u201d",

It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/singapore-coronavirus-increase-revives-fears-of-post-lockdown-surge\">resurgence in infections</a>&nbsp;despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.</p>\n    <p>Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">cramped dormitory accommodation</a>&nbsp;used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.</p>\n    <p>Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are experts worried about?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.</p>\n    <p>The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.</p>\n    <p>In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The methods appear to vary in different locations and there has been confusion about the timeframe and requirements on who gets tested.</p> \n<p>Wuhan will conduct tests on everyone in the city, with the goal of getting a clear number of asymptomatic cases as businesses and schools reopen.

Here is what happened today: A Rockhampton aged care home was locked down after a nurse tested positive for Covid-19. Twenty-three residents and eight staff have since tested negative, but the centre has approximately 115 residents and 180 staff members in total. A staff member at another Victorian McDonald\u2019s has been diagnosed with Covid-19. The Craigieburn Road West store has been closed immediately. South Australia announced it has zero active Covid-19 cases for the first time since the pandemic began. The state has now gone eight consecutive days with no new infections. Western Australia also announced it has zero Covid-19 patients in hospital, after a patient in intensive care recovered from the virus. Seven people remain active cases in WA. NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge said the state government will announce help for international students and higher education next week. Prime minister Scott Morrison announced the resumption of elective surgery, and $48m of funding for a mental health response plan. The Tasmanian government flagged a deficit of $716m in 2019-20, and peak unemployment of 12%. The AFL\u2019s chief executive, Gillon McLachlan, announced the code will resume playing matches on Thursday 11 June. The National Rugby League announced the fixtures for the first two weeks of competition when it restarts on 28 May. Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, admitted on radio there was room for improvement in the state\u2019s handling of the outbreak at the Cedar Meats abattoir. The Australian school climate strike movement held a virtual rally via livestream. The deadline for expressions of interest in Virgin Australia has passed. While not all the bidders are out yet, it is confirmed that the parent company of IndiGo airlines is interested. ABC News have just played the entirety of my colleague Paul Karp\u2019s questioning of former sports minister Bridget McKenzie about the sports grants program. McKenzie said it was the responsibility of the public service to raise concerns over her authority to issue millions of dollars in grants. The former deputy Nationals leader was asked \u201cwhy weren\u2019t you a bit more inquisitive about whether you had any ability to make $140 million of sports grants?\u201d McKenzie replied: \u201cIt is the responsibility of the Australian public service to inform ministers around appropriate arrangements. \u201cIt was never raised with me that this was an issue. This went through cabinet. This was approved by ERC ... so if there was an issue, there are multiple steps through that process that that should have been raised.\u201d Queensland Health say 31 people have tested negative at the Rockhampton aged care home where a nurse earlier tested positive. 23 residents and eight staff members were urgently tested today at the North Rockhampton nursing centre, which is in lockdown. The home has approximately 115 residents and 180 staff. More people will be tested over the next 24 hours, the department said. The chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, said they had used rapid testing that gives results within an hour. \u201cWe are isolating and testing residents and staff, using our GeneXpert rapid testing equipment,\u201d she said. \u201cThat testing can return results within an hour but there\u2019s limited capacity in Queensland and Australia. These samples will be run through our normal PCR testing regime as a precautionary measure.\u201d The nurse is believed to have been infectious on 3 May, and 70 people have been identified as close contacts through contact tracing. Young said anyone in Rockhampton who had symptoms should get tested. \u201cIt is likely this person has been infectious for almost two weeks and has been in the community on several occasions,\u201d she said. And sorry, just a quick correction on an earlier post. WA does not have zero Covid-19 cases, it has zero cases in hospitals. There are still seven people with Covid-19 in the state. But it recorded no new cases today, and the last person in hospital is no longer testing positive, but remains in hospital. The previous post has been amended. The Liberal party has revealed its two preselection contenders for the Eden-Monaro byelection. Dr Fiona Kotvojs, who ran for the Liberal party in the seat last election, and Mark Schweikert, who is a local councillor, will run against each other to be the party\u2019s nominee for the upcoming byelection. Labor has already preselected its candidate, the Bega mayor, Kristy McBain. And here are the fuller figures from the SA health update that announced zero active cases for the first time. More great news, this time from WA. There are no longer any people in hospitals in the state with Covid-19, after a patient recovered overnight. They are still in hospital, but no longer Covid-positive. There remain 7 people in the state with Covid-19. The state reported no new cases today. In media news, the Australian newspaper has appointed its first female editor, Michelle Gunn. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has said domestic travel in NSW will \u201chappen soon\u201d while on radio station 2GB. She told host Ben Fordham: \u201cI don\u2019t think it is far away; it is a short time away, and we are making a plan to make it safe ... I\u2019m pretty confident it will happen soon.\u201d But: \u201cPeople are feeling anxious about the virus. And if their town has been virus-free they are worried that all these tourists are going to come in and that is going to change.\u201d South Australia has just announced it has zero active Covid-19 cases for the first time. The state has now gone eight consecutive days with no new infections. However, as the virus has an incubation period of 14 days, health authorities warned against complacency. Here\u2019s more on the new fixtures for the NRL\u2019s return. And Rugby Australia has announced its new chairman, Hamish McLennan, who is a former managing director of Network Ten. Another staff member at a Victorian McDonald\u2019s has been diagnosed with Covid-19. The person last worked at the Craigieburn Rd West McDonalds on 12 May, and was a relative of an employee from the Fawkner McDonald\u2019s. The store has been closed. Today was supposed to be another day of protest for the school climate strike movement. But physical distancing laws mean that mass gatherings are no longer allowed, delaying what organisers said would have been one of the biggest Australian school strikes yet. Today from 4pm (AEST) until 8pm, student organisers will hold their rally online through an interactive livestream. It includes a panel with scientist Tim Flannery, a panel with Michele O\u2019Neil (the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions) and a musical performance from Lisa Mitchell. NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge has just said there will be an announcement next week about support for international students and higher education funding. Shoebridge is the chair of a NSW parliamentary inquiry into the state\u2019s response to Covid-19. It\u2019s deadline day (or at least one of the many) for Virgin Australia. Any interested parties have to lodge preliminary, non-binding bids for the airline by 6pm. So far the Queensland government has revealed it will be bidding, but there are many other parties yet to reveal their intentions. Final offers don\u2019t have to be made until June. Shocking foodlines continue across Australia for international students who have lost jobs but cannot access jobkeeper, jobseeker, youth allowance or other support. The Tasmanian government\u2019s economic update has flagged a deficit of $716m in 2019-20, and a deficit of $1bn by mid-2021. Earlier, we brought you comments by the premier, Peter Gutwein, that the state would embark on an \u201caggressive construction program\u201d to stimulate its economy, and look at easing restrictions again after four weeks. He said the deficit was a \u201cbleak picture\u201d, but added that other states would do even worse. Before the pandemic the state had been forecast for a $10.8m surplus. It also forecast a peak unemployment rate in the state of 12%. In the national jobs figures for April released yesterday, Tasmania recorded the biggest rise of all the states and territories: from 4.9% to 6.2%. The ACT has just announced that it has recorded no new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours. But the territory\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Kerryn Coleman, warned against complacency. \u201cJust because restrictions have eased, it doesn\u2019t mean our responsibilities have,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a community, we must adjust to the new way of life where physical distancing and good hygiene is the best way to fight this virus. \u201cCanberrans will be able to start doing some of the things they love and enjoy, such as going to a playground or park, grabbing a bite to eat at a restaurant or cafe or getting back into non-contact community and social sport. \u201cHowever, in doing so Canberrans must continue to avoid large crowds, maintain physical distancing of 1.5 metres from others, practise good hand and respiratory hygiene and stay at home if unwell.\u201d And in non-virtual sports news, the NRL has unveiled the fixtures for the league\u2019s restart on 28 May. Brisbane will host Parramatta on the opening night, and the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the Sydney Roosters will play the very next day in what the league described as \u201ca blockbuster return\u201d. The league said this was \u201cdesigned to give fans as much drama and excitement as possible\u201d. Also, as the anti-vaccination controversy rumbles on, none of the teams with non-vaccinated players have been scheduled to play in Queensland in the opening two rounds. Gutwein is flagging a series of construction programs to stimulate the Tasmanian economy. \u201cThis week I\u2019ve tasked Treasury to do an immediate review of our $3.7bn infrastructure program and identify those projects that can be brought forward and commenced swiftly,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lay out the most aggressive construction program in Tasmania\u2019s history.\u201d That will include renewables and green energy. \u201cOur state\u2019s traditional strengths haven\u2019t gone away ... We will harness our renewable energy advantage [and] we will ensure that Tasmania remains the renewable energy powerhouse of this country.\u201d The Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, is speaking now. He says the Treasury report paints \u201ca bleak picture\u201d for the state. \u201cThere is no other way of explaining it,\u201d he says. But he notes that other states will be worse off. He says a further lifting of restrictions will be \u201clooked at\u201d in four weeks. \u201cThere are a number of well-advanced western democracies that have already lifted restrictions and are now being hit with their second wave. We need to ensure that we do everything that we can to ensure that that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d Popular tourist spots across South Australia are reopening today, AAP reports. The Cleland Wildlife park in the Adelaide Hills, the Mount Lofty botanic gardens, Adelaide Jail, Seal Bay on Kangaroo Island and the Naracoorte and Tantanoola caves in the south-east are all opening again after the state government eased restrictions. The state environment minister, David Speirs, said the sites would all have amended services to ensure restrictions on gatherings and social distancing could be maintained. \u201cEarlier this week we saw a huge response to our reopening of campgrounds in South Australia\u2019s national parks with nearly 900 people making bookings in the first 24 hours and I expect there will be the same enthusiasm to revisit our iconic tourism sites,\u201d he said. \u201cI urge everyone to visit these places responsibly to ensure we don\u2019t undo the good work that\u2019s been achieved in South Australia. \u201cSo please continue to follow all directives on social distancing, comply with relevant limits on gatherings, wash your hands and download the Covidsafe app.\u201d Hi everyone, it\u2019s Naaman Zhou here, and I\u2019ll be taking over the blog for the rest of the day. I\u2019d like the record to show that I later drew 1-1 with Michael McGowan in a subsequent game of Fifa, where I squandered many chances to win. And that\u2019s all from me, too. I\u2019m going to hand you over to my colleague Naaman Zhou, who I recently beat 4-0 in a game of Fifa. Thanks as always for reading. And that\u2019s all from the prime minister. Morrison is asked about the free childcare pledge, which is due to expire around the end of June. He says the education minister, Dan Tehan, is \u201ccurrently considering the program beyond its current expiry\u201d but says it is \u201cnot a sustainable model\u201d. As you\u2019ll recall, it was effectively suspending the normal payment arrangements and subsidy arrangements that have been in place, and moved to that different model for a period of time to give a certainty of income to those facilities, to enable them to operate, which combined with the jobkeeper payment, enabled them to do just that. But that is not a sustainable model for how the childcare sector should work, and nor was it intended to be. And so at this point no final decision has been made on those issues. But the intention was always to return to the payment arrangements and subsidy arrangements that had been put in place prior to those things coming into effect. Morrison is asked if he\u2019s concerned about misinformation circulating on the internet and social media, including from anti-vaxxer and conspiracy groups. First of all, I think Australians are very sensible, and I think they tend to discount those sorts of conspiracy theories when they see them. I know the chief medical officer has assisted in discouraging people from some of the most extreme of those. But they\u2019re, I think, pretty self-apparent. Morrison is also asked about recent actions by China, specifically around exports from Australia of beef and barley. He says the relationship with China is \u201cbuilt on mutual benefit\u201d. \u201cAs far as what the commonwealth government is doing, we\u2019re doing that through the channels that we have available. But I\u2019d stress again that what the Australian government is doing is completely unremarkable. We are standing our ground on our values and the things that we know are always important [and] we\u2019ll continue to do that in good faith, and we\u2019ll do that, though, always standing by the values and the positions that we have consistently held. One of the most important things about our approach to [the] relationship is we\u2019re always consistent. We\u2019re always consistent. We draw very clear lines about things that are very important to us, as does the Chinese government. Morrison is asked for the second time about comments from the US president, Donald Trump, on the supply chain for the F-35 fighter plane. Trump has threatened to end offshore manufacturing of parts for the Joint Strike Fighter, calling it \u201ccrazy\u201d to spread manufacturing of the plane across US allies. More than 50 Australian companies are involved in the F-35 supply chain, according to Lockheed Martin. Morrison: We have our contracts and arrangements in place as suppliers into the programs. We will continue to pursue those contracts as they have been set out. So I would caution against getting too far ahead of oneself when it comes to reading into the statements that have been made. Given the government has declined to expand the reach of the jobkeeper program, Morrison is asked whether the government will consider changing the rate of the payment. He says it\u2019s \u201cpremature\u201d to talk about changes but says \u201cthere will be some things to sort out\u201d. What we have done with jobkeeper so far is we\u2019ve dealt with anomalies or issues that have arisen. Let\u2019s not forget, as I reminded you the other day, that this is a $130bn program which has been able to connect with over six million Australians, and that has occurred in just over a month. That is an extraordinary pace of change for a program the likes of which the country has never seen before. And so, of course, there will be some things to sort out. But so far the things that have required sorting out have been relatively modest. And those changes have been able to be made. There\u2019s a review that will be undertaken; it is being undertaken by Treasury as we move into 30 June. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll identify other issues which will be addressed at that time. Morrison is asked whether his comments at the beginning of the press conferences about the powers of the banks being finite is a message to the states not to be too slow to reopen their economies. He says: I mean, it\u2019s just a simple statement, I think, of the obvious. And that is \u2013 while our banks, and indeed the federal government, has stepped up significantly in the packages of support that have been provided, the deferral and, indeed, the waiving in some cases of commitments, and also holding back on issues such as recovery operations and things of that nature, that is very welcome. \u201cBut, you know, our system is finite, essentially, when it comes to these things, and that\u2019s why it is so important that we restart our economy. And that\u2019s why I applaud those many small- and medium-sized enterprises who are doing just that today. And I know they have been looking forward to doing it. So we have to be very mindful as we go through this crisis that the clock is ticking when it comes to how far and how much can be done. Christine Morgan, who heads up the national mental health commission, says the plan will aim to help people struggling with substance use and substance abuse, including gambling. She says the plan \u201cmust, and we will, deal with the issues around violence: domestic, family, sexual violence\u201d. \u201cWe have included that in this plan,\u201d she says. \u201cIt belongs with us. And we are committed, absolutely committed, to being there for anybody who needs help. And we call it out, reach out, we are there for you.\u201d Hunt says there are three parts to the mental health plan. First is $7.3m investing in \u201cresearch and data into what\u2019s happening in real time\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had some information from Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania that is heartening, and more heartening than we\u2019d expected. For the first four months, there has been no known increase in suicide rates in those three states,\u201d he says. Second, $29.5m will be invested in outreach to vulnerable communities including the elderly, people from non-Engish-speaking backgrounds, Indigenous Australians and people with pre-existing mental health conditions. Third, $11.3m will go towards communication and outreach; $10.4m of that will be spent on a national campaign based around the slogan \u201cIt\u2019s OK not to be OK.\u201d The health minister, Greg Hunt, is now speaking about the release of a national mental health and wellbeing pandemic response plan. The stress of concerns about health, the loneliness of isolation, anxiety about a job, a small business\u2019s set of finances, the mortgage \u2013 all of these pressure which come with the pandemic have created specific mental health challenges. Everyone here will have seen or felt, in among their own families or friends or circles, the pressures that are in place right across Australia. So one of the most important things we can do is to provide mental health support. With only 50 Covid-19 patients in hospitals around Australia, Murphy says most states are eager to return to broader elective surgery. There is now pretty good room for further expansion, and clearly in those states that are having essentially no cases, they want to go fairly quickly back to full elective activity. Those states that still have some transmission are probably going to take it a bit more gently. But everybody is now heading towards full elective surgery, which is a really important thing. Murphy says quarantine periods for returning travellers will continue. I want to make it very clear that there is no amount of PCR testing or swab-testing that can obviate the need for quarantine. If you are a returned traveller from a risk area, and a quarantine requirement is in place, having a test done, a swab and a PCR done, just means whether you are positive on that day. It doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re not incubating the virus, and it doesn\u2019t mean that you can get out of quarantine earlier. So there\u2019s been a bit of misinformation around about that, but you can\u2019t test your way out of quarantine, unfortunately. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, is speaking now, and says there is still \u201ca small number of community-acquired cases in some jurisdictions\u201d. Just a reminder this virus is still there, at very low levels in the community, and I reiterate the prime minister\u2019s message: as people start to go back to some normal activities and open up, please, please be careful. Please practise all of those new ways of interacting that we\u2019ve talked about on so many occasions. He says he briefed national cabinet today on the paediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome, which is being seen in children overseas and particularly in the US. I was able to brief them on the fact that this is extremely rare and probably unlikely to be seen in Australia, given our very, very low number of infections in children. It\u2019s still not clear what the association with the virus is, for this condition, but it is extremely rare. Morrison announces the resumption of elective surgery across Australia. \u201cThe boom is going up on elective surgery all around the country,\u201d he says. \u201cThat will be done, of course, at the pace that states set. But that will be welcome, particularly to the private health industry, in particular, and the jobs that are supported throughout that sector.\u201d National cabinet also adopted a national mental health and wellbeing pandemic response plan, which will receive $48.1m in funding. \u201cIt was particularly encouraging to see that, with the advent of telehealth, we are now seeing the number of presentations and consultations occurring for mental health now back to levels that were being experienced pre-pandemic,\u201d he says. Morrison says there have has been $11.7bn in superannuation claims since the crisis began and says that is \u201cconsistent\u201d with the Treasury estimate. \u201cThis [is] not presenting liquidity issues. The head of Apra has advised us. And the industry estimates of what the claims would be have not been realised.\u201d Morrison said while markets were \u201cfragile\u201d, \u201cstability\u201d has returned and they remain \u201cvery functional\u201d. We noted that our banking system has stood up well, but we must be conscious that the shock ... absorbers that are in our system, whether it be the banking system or, indeed, in federal supports and other supports, they have limits. They are not endless. \u201cAnd it\u2019s essential that, as we move forward, that we continue to enable the credit to flow through our banking system, to support those businesses who are taking decisions to reopen, to rehire, and to move ahead.\u201d Morrison says about $220bn in loan deferrals have already been put in place by banking system \u2013 about two-thirds of that in mortgages, and one-third for small- and medium-sized enterprises. Scott Morrison begins with the usual preamble about the difficulties we all face. Says state leaders have met more in the past two months than the previous 10 years. But with restrictions easing after the release of the government\u2019s roadmap last week, now \u201cthe task is to really build that confidence and to get that momentum going, as we move to the next challenge, which is to reset the Australian economy for growth to support Australians and their livelihoods well into the future\u201d. He says today\u2019s national cabinet meeting was briefed by the head of the Treasury department, Philip Lowe, the head of the Reserve Bank, and Wayne Byres, the head of Apra. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is speaking now following the latest national cabinet. He says that in order to \u201cmaintain flexibility\u201d, the AFL will release fixture schedules in blocks of up to four to six weeks. The first block, including the first weekend of matches, will be released in the next 10 days. Games in the early part of the season \u201cwill be scheduled at AFL venues in states that have approved full-contact training and matches\u201d. All teams will be based out of their home states, except the four teams based out of Western Australia and South Australia. The West Coast Eagles and Fremantle will complete pre-season training in WA before relocating interstate ahead of their first scheduled match. But restrictions in South Australia will mean that Adelaide and Port Adelaide will relocate interstate before 25 May. All four teams will relocate to the Gold Coast, \u201ca move made possible with the support of Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk\u201d. McLachlan said: [This is] a significant step in getting footy back for everyone \u2013 our fans, our clubs, players, coaches, officials and staff, our broadcast and our corporate partners, and all who love the game. We know, as this situation continues to evolve, we have to remain agile and flexible to be able to adapt where necessary. We need to ensure we continue to prioritise the health and welfare of everyone. Importantly we must not place any burden on the public health system. We have developed our model as the best option for returning to play, and we\u2019ve done so following extensive consultation, including with the federal, state and territory governments and chief health officers. He thanked the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, and chief health officer, Brett Sutton, who he said he\u2019s been \u201cdriving mad\u201d with questions. The AFL\u2019s chief executive, Gillon McLachlan, has just announced the code will resume playing matches on Thursday, 11 June. \u201cFrom Monday all clubs will return to training and all AFL clubs will resume full contact training a week later on May 25,\u201d he said. All players and staff being tested before returning to their clubs. Queensland schools will reopen for all grades from 25 May but school formals are still off the table until the chief health officer gives her approval. AAP reports the state government has given a final green light for students in years 2 to 10 to head back to their classrooms. Kindy, prep, year 1 and years 11 and 12 went back this week. \u201cThis latest step is only possible given the low transmission rates that Queensland has experienced and thanks to the efforts of all Queenslanders,\u201d the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said on Friday. \u201cOur decision to adopt a sensible and deliberate approach with this phased return has proven to be the right one as we progressively move to relax the range of Covid-19 restrictions in place across the state.\u201d The education minister, Grace Grace, said this week has gone well. \u201cOur staged return to school has gone so smoothly with parents and carers heeding the advice around \u2018stop, drop and go\u2019 to ensure the health, wellbeing and safety of all.\u201d Contact sports have been cancelled but physical education classes will return. Live footage of people in Darwin being allowed to drink beer inside pubs. Personally, my desire to drink a beer inside a pub is doing battle with my deep anxiety at the thought of drinking a beer inside a pub. It\u2019s just passed midday in the Northern Territory, and pubs are now officially allowed to open. The NT\u2019s chief minister, Michael Gunner, is behind a bar pulling beers as we speak. Very top end areas. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will hold a press conference at 1pm. Year 12 students across NSW will start their HSC exams five days later than planned after a \u201cchallenging year\u201d amid the Covid-19 pandemic, AAP reports. On Friday the NSW education minister, Sarah Mitchell, told an upper house inquiry into the government\u2019s management of the pandemic that exam results would still be delivered within a similar timeframe to previous years despite the five-day delay. The decision to delay exams was a \u201csensible\u201d one. \u201cWhile we are starting five days later, students will still get results in a similar timeframe and will have exams in a similar timeframe,\u201d she said. The NSW education standards authority announced on Friday the HSC would start five days later than planned to give year 12 students extra face-to-face time in the classroom. Written exams will start with English on 20 October and oral language exams will begin on 15 August. Students will receive their HSC results on 18 December. The state education department secretary, Mark Scott, said the five-day delay will also ensure there\u2019s no impact on university offers. \u201c[Year 12 students] have had a difficult year; they\u2019ve had a challenging year,\u201d Scott said. \u201cTo push their exams and results later, there seemed to be a fairness question around that.\u201d Scott said NSW schools have also committed to prioritise engagement with year 12 students after face-to-face learning was disrupted in late March because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Face-to-face learning resumed across NSW schools on Monday with year 12 students returning on average three to four days a week while other students are attending school at least one day a week. With most states beginning to lift some Covid-19 restrictions, we\u2019ve put together this explainer on what you can and can\u2019t do wherever you live in Australia. One of the eight new cases of Covid-19 detected in New South Wales in the past 24 hours is an overseas traveller who recently flew from Brisbane to Sydney after completing their mandatory 14-day quarantine period, the state\u2019s health department said. Despite completing the quarantine in Brisbane, the person developed symptoms afterwards and NSW Health believes \u201cit is likely they were infectious on the flight to Sydney\u201d. The department is contact tracing all close contacts in NSW and on the flight to Sydney, and is working with other jurisdictions to identify any other close contacts. But it\u2019s also alerting all passengers and crew on flight QF537 from Brisbane to Sydney on Tuesday 12 May, arriving about 4.05pm to monitor for symptoms, and contact health authorities if they become sick. Look I know it\u2019s not strictly coronavirus-related but this video, put together by my colleagues Steph Harmon and Becca Leaver, of beloved children\u2019s author Andy Griffiths answering questions sent in by our younger readers is very good and fun and wholesome. Despite the state government repeatedly saying it had handled the Cedar Meats outbreak \u201cabsolutely perfectly\u201d, Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, admits there was room for improvement. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that it\u2019s been an explosive outbreak in terms of numbers,\u201d he said on Melbourne radio station 3AW on Thursday. \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t have waited for a third linked case for these settings.\u201d A Cedar Meats worker was diagnosed on 24 April. He listed his employer as a labour-hire company, Labour Solutions Australia, and the department did not contact Cedar Meats directly. Labour Solutions did call Cedar Meats that day, but the factory did not consider this an \u201cofficial notification\u201d. The next worker was diagnosed on 26 April after attending hospital for emergency surgery earlier in the week. Cedar Meats was contacted by the department the next day. On Wednesday 29 April the number of infected workers grew to four, and the department ordered all workers be tested and the factory wind down operations. Sutton said he would consider shutting an entire facility down after only two linked cases in the future. \u201cI think they\u2019re big calls when some of them will have 1,000-plus employees, but you need to reflect on what\u2019s happened here and what\u2019s happened overseas,\u201d he said. \u201cI recommended that it shut and go to absolutely skeleton staffing five minutes after I heard about the third linked case, so I think I\u2019ve acted as quickly as I possibly could.\u201d However, a spokeswoman for Cedar Meats admitted the factory did not go to a \u201cskeleton crew\u201d before it was shut. On Wednesday she confirmed to Guardian Australia that although workers were told they could stay home if they felt uncomfortable, no one was specifically asked not to come in. Amal Clooney, human rights barrister, has given evidence this morning to the joint standing committee on foreign affairs. Clooney, whose husband is apparently some actor bloke who is in no way relevant to her expertise as one of the world\u2019s leading experts on international law, had to endure a few technical gremlins with the live video feed from Los Angeles. The committee chairman, Kevin Andrews, did his best to get to the bottom of the issue. \u201cOur technicians here seem to think that maybe your microphone is muted\u201d he told Clooney. \u201cI\u2019m trying to read your lips but it sounds like you\u2019re saying that it isn\u2019t.\u201d Once that little problem was resolved, Clooney told the committee that Magnitsky laws \u2013 that allow for targeted sanctions against human rights abusers \u2013 could be a useful tool to curb abuses that occur under the cover of the coronavirus crisis. \u201cThe current health crisis has only served to exacerbate what was an existing human rights crisis,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cIt seems at times that there is so much bad news in the world that our moral nerve endings have been deadened. Meaning abuses will thrive and impunity will remain the norm.\u201d Sydney is back! Kind of ... With restrictions on gatherings in NSW easing from today, there was a flurry of activity around the city this morning. Victoria has recorded 21 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours. One new case is a household contact linked to the Cedar Meats outbreak, and two others are linked to a cluster at the McDonald\u2019s at Fawkner. AAP also reports that a staff member who worked in the Myer Highpoint doing online orders has been confirmed as infected with coronavirus. In a statement, Myer said the \u201chealth and wellbeing of our customers and team members is our absolute priority\u201d and once aware of the case it rolled out its Covid-19 protocols. The company has introduced enhanced hygiene and safety measures and will deep clean the store. Meanwhile, in Canberra ... A federal court judge has just made what he described as \u201cextraordinary\u201d orders allowing Virgin Australia\u2019s administrators to avoid personal liability for most of the debts the stricken airline runs up while in their hands. Only the issue of the liability of the administrators for overpayments under the jobkeeper scheme remains unresolved. The administrators and the Tax Office are locked in discussions and the matter will return to court next week. \u201cThese are quite extraordinarily wide orders but in the circumstances I think they are justified,\u201d judge John Middleton said. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be seen as a precedent that would apply in all circumstances in future administrations.\u201d This morning\u2019s orders come ahead of the deadline for non-binding bids for the airline, which are due today. Nineteen parties have expressed interest in buying the airline, but this is expected to whittle down substantially after bids close today. The AFL\u2019s chief executive, Gillon McLachlan, will announce the code\u2019s plans for its relaunch at 12.45pm today. McLachlan is expected to outline how and when the 17-round regular season will resume. The nurse had continued to work at the aged-care facility while unwell, Queensland chief health officer, Jeannette Young, says. She describes that as \u201cvery unfortunate\u201d. We are clarifying what exactly happened there. It\u2019s very, very concerning and all I can say is, to everyone out there, if you are sick with any symptoms, it doesn\u2019t matter how mild they are for this particular infection, even with mild symptoms, you can transmit this infection to other people \u2013 so if you have any symptoms, please just be ultra cautious. Isolate yourself at home and get tested. Young says there are 115 residents and 180 staff members at the aged-care home who will all be tested for Covid-19. The case has \u201ccome out of nowhere\u201d, she says. \u201cNow they have another case and they need to manage that case which is what they\u2019re doing and so that is a very important lesson for all of us across the state. We have not beaten the virus yet.\u201d I\u2019m asking every single person who lives in Rockhampton who has any symptoms at all to immediately go forward, go and see their own GP or go to one of the fever clinics and get tested. That is really important. We need to see whether there are any other cases that have occurred in Rockhampton as a result of this particular individual. Rockhampton has not had an active case for a number of weeks so this is brand new ... It\u2019s a very important lesson for all of us across the state of Queensland. We don\u2019t know where the next case will happen.\u201d The Queensland health minister, Steven Miles, is holding a press conference in Townsville and says an aged-care worker has tested positive for Covid-19 in Rockhampton. The person is a nurse at a state-run facility in north Rockhampton and the test was confirmed at about 8pm yesterday. The home has been put into lock down, and any staff who have been in contact with the nurse are in quarantine. It\u2019s the first confirmed case in Rockhampton since 30 March, and Miles says the result is \u201ccause for some concern\u201d. The health service along with the department of health, Queensland health, have responded very rapidly overnight. They have sent a rapid-response team from Brisbane; they are working to quarantine any staff and residents who may be contacts of that individual. They are rapidly testing a large number of people to identify whether any of those people have been affected. The centre is currently locked down [and] any staff in contact [with the nurse] are in quarantine and have been tested. The last confirmed case in Rockhampton was on the 30 March. So something like seven weeks since they last had a case; the last active case was considered recovered on 1 May. This just serves to underline that even after cities have long periods of time without active cases, things can turn very, very quickly. Victoria Police have fined eight people for breaching public health orders in the past 24 hours after a protest against the detainment of asylum seekers inside a Melbourne hotel. On Tuesday a group of protesters climbed to the roof of the Mantra hotel in Preston, and others barricaded themselves inside to demand the release of asylum seekers held in the property. The ABC is reporting today that former prime minister Julia Gillard has been appointed chair of the UK\u2019s Wellcome Trust, one of the world\u2019s largest investors in medical research and pandemics. It\u2019s one of the organisations investing heavily in finding a vaccine for Covid-19. In an interview with the ABC\u2019s political editor, Andrew Probyn, Gillard seemed to back the Morrison government\u2019s call for an independent inquiry into the origins of the virus. I think if we take a broad sweep here, Andrew, what we would say to ourselves is if a major health challenge for the world started anywhere, in any country on Earth, then it is good to have a process which enables us to learn every lesson so that we can keep humanity safer for the future. I think that message applies today, to current circumstances, and it will apply for as long as there are shared health challenges for us to combat. Asked directly whether she supported the calls for an inquiry, Gillard said: Well, I\u2019d want to put this in a slightly broader perspective. When I was in politics and international bodies would occasionally come to Australia and say something about what was happening here, there were mixed reactions in the Australian community and by politicians. Some people listened, some people said, \u2018Why on earth have they come from overseas to tell us something that\u2019s really our business? Why don\u2019t they go somewhere else where problems are worse than they are in Australia?\u2019 So I think, you know, we can all understand the emotional pull of nationalism. Having said that, I do think that as rational human beings we can also say to ourselves whether a problem originates in Sydney, in China, Canada, Portugal, Brazil, the United Kingdom, in any country on Earth, wherever a problem originates that\u2019s got a possibility of having a profound impact on human health around the planet, then, of course, it needs to be studied, it needs to be understood \u2013 not so that fingers can be pointed, but so lessons can be learned. Pubs can also reopen in the Northern Territory from today. Unlike NSW, there are fewer capacity restrictions. The local paper is being typically mellow about it. Insert eye-roll emoji. The Australian Medical Association wants national cabinet to expand access to elective surgery further when it meets later today. The peak body for Australian doctors has said it remains \u201cvery concerned\u201d about reduced access to non-coronavirus related healthcare, which is leading \u201cto worsened health outcomes for many people, including increased complications with existing conditions\u201d. Last month national cabinet agreed to a limited return to elective surgery, but the AMA president, Dr Tony Bartone, says there should now be a \u201csensible, gradual, and progressive increase in elective surgery, guided by the local situation and environment in each state and territory\u201d. Patients have been the big winners with improved quality of life, and doctors and other health professionals are back doing what they do best \u2013 saving lives and improving lives. The AMA believes that, on balance, it is now the right time to increase the numbers of elective surgery procedures where it is safe and appropriate. It is important that we maintain the necessary social distancing and restrictions in all jurisdictions, but it is vital that we get the health system operating at its potential within the guidelines. The health system must remain geared to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic and its after-effects, but we must also continue looking after the everyday health issues of the Australian people. Good morning. Lovely to be here. Here, in this case, being my living room where the ABC is competing with the noise from my housemate\u2019s morning work meeting. As we have already mentioned, pubs are officially allowed to reopen in New South Wales from today but with many, many caveats. My colleague Alyx Gorman explains: That\u2019s it for me for the moment but don\u2019t worry, the incredible Michael McGowan will be with you throughout the morning. Queensland\u2019s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, says the state has had two additional cases overnight. She says this of \u201csome concern\u201d: One is an old case. One is an active case in Rockhampton. And my advice at this stage is that Dr Young and the deputy premier will be speaking more about this case when they stand up later this morning. They are getting through some further advice. Victoria\u2019s treasurer, Tim Pallas, is fronting media now. He says if it weren\u2019t for the pandemic and bushfires, Victoria would have recorded a surplus: I\u2019d say with no trepidation that state would have returned a sixth straight surplus. We were projecting $618m surplus at the budget update. What the March quarterly financial update clearly states is except for the extraordinary event, the state was on track to achieve a surplus in 2019-20 in accordance with the forecast published in the 19-20 budget update. Let\u2019s be honest, let\u2019s be clear: we\u2019re operating in anything but a normal circumstances. These are unprecedented times. We have seen the impact play out, most notably going forward. Household finances face a serious impact because of the coronavirus shutdown, economists have warned, as the loss of earnings, falling house prices and job insecurity combine to reshape the economy in a way not experienced by Australians for decades. Martin Farrer has the full report: With the help of AAP, here is a breakdown of Australia\u2019s Covid-19 numbers to date. There have been 6,989 case; 688 are still active. The numbers being treated in hospital or ICU are: ACT - 0 SA - 1 WA - 1 NT - 2 Qld - 7 Tas - 8 Vic - 9 NSW - 23 The national death toll is 98, and nearly 5.7m of an estimated 16m people have registered for the federal government\u2019s coronavirus tracing app, CovidSafe, since 26 April. Today is the first day of cafes and restaurants reopening in NSW. But as my colleague Alyx Gorman notes, the health order confirming this has not yet been published. Without the health order, restaurants and cafes \u2013 which have been advised they can serve up to 10 patrons at a time on-premises as long as they follow social distancing guidelines \u2013 will not have the authority to trade. If you are enjoying a morning brew at your local cafe, please tweet me your photos @MatildaBoseley. Gladys Berejilklian has emphasised personal responsibility as NSW eases its lockdown restrictions: I know some may even have already started enjoying the new freedoms that come with easing restrictions today, but that also comes with personal responsibility \u2013 and I can\u2019t stress that enough. Easing restrictions have failed in so many places around the world and I don\u2019t want that to happen in NSW. I want people to have personal responsibility for the way we respond. Let\u2019s do our part in keeping everybody safe so that we can keep moving forward, so that we never go backwards. That is really critical. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejilklian, says eight new cases Covid-19 cases were identified in the past day. Five were from known sources, including four from hotel quarantine. The remaining three may be from community transmission, from the hotspot local government areas Waverley and Penrith. She said: We are asking people in those communities to come forward and get tested but the fact that 12,200 people came forward and got tested is outstanding. After weeks of scrutiny over the handling of the Cedar Meats Covid-19 outbreak, which has now spread to at least 90 people, Victoria\u2019s chief health officer has admitted authorities could have done better, and the plant should have been shut down sooner. \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t have waited for a third linked case,\u201d Brett Sutton told 3AW radio on Thursday. \u201cMaybe for these settings, we should shut an entire place down \u2013 not just the boning room where it all started, but an entire facility.\u201d The state government and Cedar Meats\u2019 management have defended their handling of the outbreak, including the decision to allow staff to work for several days after workers tested positive, AAP reports. The Cedar Meats outbreak is the state\u2019s biggest Covid-19 cluster and is the subject of a WorkSafe investigation as three new infections were linked to the abattoir on Thursday. The first case linked to the meatworks was confirmed on 2 April but it wasn\u2019t considered a risk site because the worker said they hadn\u2019t been at work for weeks. Cedar Meats was shut down on 29 April after two more cases surfaced on 24 and 25 April. It plans to partially reopen on Monday. The independent MP Zali Steggall is on ABC radio now. In the past week she has criticised the prime minister\u2019s Covid-19 commission. I haven\u2019t got an issue with having a commission per se, but we need a commission that has proper guidelines proper transparency and proper accountability. I don\u2019t have an issue with us having a commission \u2013 I think it\u2019s an important body that can advise \u2013 but it must be done transparently and it must be done with accountability ... We\u2019ve seen the chairman on numerous occasions talk about a gas-fuelled recovery. Now in light of his background, and in light of the conflicts ... I think that is a very fossil fuel-heavy focus. There\u2019s been no renewable energy specialist on the committee. Previously the commission\u2019s chairman, Nev Power, a former chief executive of the mining company Fortescue Metals, has argued that the cheap supply of energy to business would be critical to Australia\u2019s recovery from the economic shock. There is a push for Australia to emerge from lockdown a greener country. Research by the Reserve Bank showing renewable energy investment fell sharply last year is fuelling calls for federal and state governments to back changes to help the industry rebound and drive a post-pandemic recovery. Guardian Australia\u2019s environment editor, Adam Morton, walks you through all the important points in his report below: Former prime minister Julia Gillard will take on a new role as chair of the UK medical investor giant Wellcome Trust. The charity is investing in a range of research on Covid-19, including efforts to develop a vaccine. In an interview with ABC, Gillard backed calls for an independent inquiry into the pandemic: If a major health challenge for the world started anywhere, in any country on Earth, then it is good to have a process which enables us to learn every lesson so that we can keep humanity safer for the future ... It needs to be studied, it needs to be understood. Not so that fingers can be pointed, but lessons can be learned. Gillard will continue her role as chair of Beyond Blue. Hello, Matilda Boseley here, bringing you today\u2019s news and updates on Covid-19. The national cabinet will meet this morning and mental health is top of the agenda, according to AAP, which reports that the group of state and federal leaders will consider a new mental health pandemic plan to boost support services. Leaders will also receive an economic update from the heads of Treasury, the Reserve Bank and the superannuation sector watchdog. Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor, Katharine Murphy, reported the grim unemployment figures released yesterday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics: almost 600,000 Australians lost their jobs between March and April, unemployment rose to 6.2%, the underemployment rate increased by 4.9 points to 13.7% and the underutilisation rate increased by 5.9 points to 19.9%. Scott Morrison said the figures were \u201cterribly shocking, although not totally unexpected\u201d. We\u2019ll bring you the press conference live and keep you up-to-date on news from around the country. Let\u2019s get started.",

It was all about Henry VII, who ruthlessly sought new ways to pay for a heavily indebted state (sound familiar, Rishi Sunak?). Actually I wasn\u2019t listening to the detail so much as to the teacher himself \u2013 patient, amusing, bringing everyone into the game, even the naughty ones who were almost certainly painting their nails or watching silly videos of Matt Lucas pretending to be Boris Johnson. The teacher was supremely assured for someone pretty new to this remote teaching lark. And then it struck me: these are the other key workers we need to celebrate. Millions of people like this around the world, trying despite the technology, the times, the TikToks, to keep our children learning, with some degree of structure, rhythm and normality to these strange days. So let\u2019s garland our teachers in the following way: get in touch and let us know which teacher made a difference in your life and how. A maths guru who demystified calculus? An English teacher who encouraged you to write? Even a physics teacher who taught you that as long as the Earth goes around the sun you would never properly understand physics? Or someone more contemporary who is able to keep your eight-year-old sitting still for the time it takes to make a cup of tea? In return, I hereby bestow upon you the Upside treats of the week, COMPLETE with reading times (back by popular request). \u2022 the Upside in conversation with Mo Gawdat. One hour video \u2022 the real Lord of the Flies, where six shipwrecked lads pulled together. Five-minute read \u2022 why are people helping each other so much? Ten-minute long read \u2022 the world\u2019s top 10 architecture projects. Three-minute virtual tour \u2022 the Nintendo game that\u2019s become the smash hit of lockdown. Three-minute read \u2022 the ingenious medical app that ISN\u2019T all about Covid-19. 90-second read \u2022 lockdown on the family farm. Three-minute read \u2022 pop auction to raise funds for charities during the coronavirus outbreak. One-minute waltz \u2022 the antibody test \u2013 a game changer? Two-minute explainer \u2022 forgotten stories of football \u2013 a glorious new Guardian podcast. 15 minutes weekly Lucky numbers As Britain edged out of lockdown this week, Niamh McIntyre dug into risk factors and found that working-age Britons are far less likely to die of the virus than pensioners. Discouraging if you are over 65, yes, but more reassuring if you are contemplating going back to work. And there were zero new Covid-19 cases in New Zealand for three days in a row. Taiwan has gone seven days in a row without an imported case. Denmark is sure there won\u2019t be a second wave. China today marked one month without a Covid-19 death. Meanwhile, crime has fallen off a cliff in the UK\u2026 What we liked There were a slew of pieces this week about various European countries moving beyond coal. This Fast Company piece summed the picture up well, while this New York Times article reported that the US will generate more electricity from renewable sources than from coal in 2020. We quite like this piece about an Olympic fencer turned delivery driver, if only for the headline\u2026 And we were grateful to Giselle Green for singling out our work in her piece this week for journalism.co.uk What we heard We love hearing your theories, lockdown lessons, crazy utopian ideas and blinding answers to life, the universe and everything, so keep them coming. Alastair Whitson continued our theme of lockdown learnings: Live in the moment. Enjoy the natural world. Don\u2019t be in a rush. Take the time to talk to strangers. Walk, don\u2019t drive. Shop local. Buy less, give more. And, don\u2019t put up with the bullshit any more. The system is twisted and rotten, so let\u2019s smash it, and rebuild it better!

      "body": "<p>Pandemics hand power to the people. Leadership is necessary, for an optimal outcome, but essentially it\u2019s up to us what happens next. It\u2019s in times like these that grassroots political movements can come into their own \u2013 if they know how to adapt to the circumstances.</p> <p>A few days ago, a potted basil plant appeared in the main square in Bologna, one of the Italian cities that has been so hard hit in the coronavirus crisis. There was a crumpled cardboard sign attached, with two hashtags daubed on it in felt-tip pen: #6000SARDINE and #FOTOSINTESI.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Soon they were raising funds, organising flu relief centres, and distributing medicines, milk and blankets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The reference to Sardines would have been meaningful to local people. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/14/sardines-pack-piazza-in-rome-for-protest-against-matteo-salvini\">The grassroots Sardines movement</a> came into existence late last year, in Bologna, to protest at Italy\u2019s swing to the right and in particular the politics of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/matteo-salvini\">Matteo Salvini</a>. It took its name from the fact that so many people attended its rallies they were squeezed together like sardines in a shoal. Such behaviour having become inappropriate thanks to Covid-19, the Sardines have adapted.</p> <p>If curiosity prompted you to search for the hashtags, you would discover that over 48 hours this coming weekend, the Sardines are organising an online sale of 6,000 begonias and aromatic herbs. You pay \u20ac5 a pot, and Sardines volunteers on bikes deliver them to your home (assuming you live in Bologna). In a city with a love of open-air cinema and neighbourhood theatre, the goal is to raise \u20ac30,000 (\u00a327,000) for local culture which has suffered terribly during this pandemic. Organisers are calling it a \u201csymbolic flash mob\u201d.</p> <p>Real sardines also adapt to survive, of course, and according to one eye-catching <a href=\"http://www.wildoceanfilm.com/sardinerun.html\">description</a>, form \u201cmetamorphosing silver baitballs at the surface, twisting and dividing to avoid the ocean predators\u201d. But if historical precedents are anything to go by, the Sardines of Bologna may be doing more than just surviving. Such gestures, in a time of crisis, can have a powerful mobilising effect.</p> <p>In 1918, the colonial authorities in India put out a call for help because their woefully underpowered healthcare provision for the local population was about to be overwhelmed by a tidal wave of flu. The people who answered the call, and stepped into the breach, were usually members of organisations that had close connections to the independence movement. Because they were also active in social reform, these organisations were well placed to motivate dozens of local caste and community groups. Soon they were raising funds, organising influenza relief centres, and distributing medicines, milk and blankets to devastated communities \u2013 often making deliveries on bikes.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mahatma-gandhi\">Mahatma Gandhi</a> was emerging as the head of the national independence movement at that time, but he still lacked grassroots support. Earlier in the year, he had organised a couple of peaceful campaigns \u2013 or satyagraha \u2013 among the workers and peasants of Gujarat, to protest at low pay and what they perceived as unjust taxes. He had been able to persuade thousands of people to come out, not hundreds of thousands. Then Gandhi fell ill with flu, and it\u2019s likely he developed pneumonia because he remained out of action for months that autumn.</p> <p>While he languished in his ashram in Gujarat, his followers in the same state went to the aid of the workers and peasants. Usually their efforts did not extend beyond the towns, but in one Gujarati district, Surat, the relief extended right out to the most remote villages and to some of the most marginalised groups in Indian society. It was organised by two young brothers, Kalyanji and Kunvarji Mehta, and a likeminded man who would eventually become their friend, Dayalji Desai. These three had given up good government jobs in the previous decade and set up their own ashrams where they educated young people about the fight for home rule and the need to reform the caste system. They now mobilised their students to provide a district-wide relief operation.</p> <p>That operation is estimated to have reached at least 10,000 people \u2013 Hindus, Muslims, Christians, tribesmen and untouchables alike \u2013 and people in big cities such as Ahmedabad and Mumbai read about the young men\u2019s exploits in the papers and admired them. Gandhi soon heard about them too, and he drew the young men into his circle as he slowly recovered and resumed his political activities. Anti-British feeling was stoked in early 1919, first by the Rowlatt Act \u2013 which extended martial law into peacetime in India \u2013 and then by the shocking Jallianwala Bagh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/12/britain-amritsar-massacre-centenary-1919-india\">massacre</a>, at which an estimated 1,000 protesters died after British troops fired into the unarmed crowd.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/28/italy-progressives-sardines-salvini-election-far-right\">Italy\u2019s progressives had lost hope. The Sardines movement is starting to restore it | Jamie Mackay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1920, the Mehta brothers travelled with Gandhi in a train from Mumbai to Kolkata, where he was due to attend a special session of the Indian National Congress party. At that meeting he promised self-rule within a year if Congress backed his call for nationwide satyagraha. By then the Mehtas were being hailed as miracle workers for their ongoing social work among deprived groups. Hearing Gandhi\u2019s call, Kunvarji Mehta returned to Gujarat, mobilised his network and delivered five towns to the cause.</p> <p>The next year, half a million workers came out on strike in India. It would take another few decades of bitter struggle before Gandhi could deliver on his promise, but 1918 was a crucial turning point \u2013 the moment, according to the historian AJP Taylor, when Indians turned definitively against British rule. Thereafter, Gandhi was recognised as the undisputed head of the independence movement and he had popular support.</p> <p>The lesson may be that when the stakes are high the reward is great \u2013 as local hubs of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/virus-neighbours-covid-19\">community support</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/mutual-aid-coronavirus-pandemic-rebecca-solnit\">mutual aid groups</a> around the world are discovering. And that loyal local followings can make a difference on the national and international stage, eventually. So watch out for grassroots movements in times of pestilence, they could be the start of something significant \u2013 even if they call themselves \u201csymbolic\u201d, and even if they start with a humble pot plant parked in a city square.</p> <p>\u2022 Laura Spinney is a science journalist and author</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pandemics hand power to the people. Leadership is necessary, for an optimal outcome, but essentially it\u2019s up to us what happens next. It\u2019s in times like these that grassroots political movements can come into their own \u2013 if they know how to adapt to the circumstances. A few days ago, a potted basil plant appeared in the main square in Bologna, one of the Italian cities that has been so hard hit in the coronavirus crisis. There was a crumpled cardboard sign attached, with two hashtags daubed on it in felt-tip pen: #6000SARDINE and #FOTOSINTESI. The reference to Sardines would have been meaningful to local people. The grassroots Sardines movement came into existence late last year, in Bologna, to protest at Italy\u2019s swing to the right and in particular the politics of Matteo Salvini. It took its name from the fact that so many people attended its rallies they were squeezed together like sardines in a shoal. Such behaviour having become inappropriate thanks to Covid-19, the Sardines have adapted. If curiosity prompted you to search for the hashtags, you would discover that over 48 hours this coming weekend, the Sardines are organising an online sale of 6,000 begonias and aromatic herbs. You pay \u20ac5 a pot, and Sardines volunteers on bikes deliver them to your home (assuming you live in Bologna). In a city with a love of open-air cinema and neighbourhood theatre, the goal is to raise \u20ac30,000 (\u00a327,000) for local culture which has suffered terribly during this pandemic. Organisers are calling it a \u201csymbolic flash mob\u201d. Real sardines also adapt to survive, of course, and according to one eye-catching description, form \u201cmetamorphosing silver baitballs at the surface, twisting and dividing to avoid the ocean predators\u201d. But if historical precedents are anything to go by, the Sardines of Bologna may be doing more than just surviving. Such gestures, in a time of crisis, can have a powerful mobilising effect. In 1918, the colonial authorities in India put out a call for help because their woefully underpowered healthcare provision for the local population was about to be overwhelmed by a tidal wave of flu. The people who answered the call, and stepped into the breach, were usually members of organisations that had close connections to the independence movement. Because they were also active in social reform, these organisations were well placed to motivate dozens of local caste and community groups. Soon they were raising funds, organising influenza relief centres, and distributing medicines, milk and blankets to devastated communities \u2013 often making deliveries on bikes. Mahatma Gandhi was emerging as the head of the national independence movement at that time, but he still lacked grassroots support. Earlier in the year, he had organised a couple of peaceful campaigns \u2013 or satyagraha \u2013 among the workers and peasants of Gujarat, to protest at low pay and what they perceived as unjust taxes. He had been able to persuade thousands of people to come out, not hundreds of thousands. Then Gandhi fell ill with flu, and it\u2019s likely he developed pneumonia because he remained out of action for months that autumn. While he languished in his ashram in Gujarat, his followers in the same state went to the aid of the workers and peasants. Usually their efforts did not extend beyond the towns, but in one Gujarati district, Surat, the relief extended right out to the most remote villages and to some of the most marginalised groups in Indian society. It was organised by two young brothers, Kalyanji and Kunvarji Mehta, and a likeminded man who would eventually become their friend, Dayalji Desai. These three had given up good government jobs in the previous decade and set up their own ashrams where they educated young people about the fight for home rule and the need to reform the caste system. They now mobilised their students to provide a district-wide relief operation. That operation is estimated to have reached at least 10,000 people \u2013 Hindus, Muslims, Christians, tribesmen and untouchables alike \u2013 and people in big cities such as Ahmedabad and Mumbai read about the young men\u2019s exploits in the papers and admired them. Gandhi soon heard about them too, and he drew the young men into his circle as he slowly recovered and resumed his political activities. Anti-British feeling was stoked in early 1919, first by the Rowlatt Act \u2013 which extended martial law into peacetime in India \u2013 and then by the shocking Jallianwala Bagh massacre, at which an estimated 1,000 protesters died after British troops fired into the unarmed crowd. In 1920, the Mehta brothers travelled with Gandhi in a train from Mumbai to Kolkata, where he was due to attend a special session of the Indian National Congress party. At that meeting he promised self-rule within a year if Congress backed his call for nationwide satyagraha. By then the Mehtas were being hailed as miracle workers for their ongoing social work among deprived groups. Hearing Gandhi\u2019s call, Kunvarji Mehta returned to Gujarat, mobilised his network and delivered five towns to the cause. The next year, half a million workers came out on strike in India. It would take another few decades of bitter struggle before Gandhi could deliver on his promise, but 1918 was a crucial turning point \u2013 the moment, according to the historian AJP Taylor, when Indians turned definitively against British rule. Thereafter, Gandhi was recognised as the undisputed head of the independence movement and he had popular support. The lesson may be that when the stakes are high the reward is great \u2013 as local hubs of community support and mutual aid groups around the world are discovering. And that loyal local followings can make a difference on the national and international stage, eventually. So watch out for grassroots movements in times of pestilence, they could be the start of something significant \u2013 even if they call themselves \u201csymbolic\u201d, and even if they start with a humble pot plant parked in a city square. \u2022 Laura Spinney is a science journalist and author",

As a symbol of US leadership amid the coronavirus crisis, the images are almost too on the nose: Donald Trump and his chief of staff were the only people not wearing face masks during a tour of a medical equipment distribution facility in Pennsylvania on Thursday. And if the president isn\u2019t much of a role model for Americans, then the US isn\u2019t much of a role model for the rest of the world, either. Trump claimed last week that he had called multiple world leaders, and that \u201call of them\u201d had told him they believed the US was leading the way. But as the Guardian\u2019s correspondents report from four continents, other countries are agog at Trump\u2019s outlandish behaviour and at his administration\u2019s flailing response to the pandemic. Trump is blaming China \u2026 In an interview with Fox Business on Thursday, Trump suggested he could scrap the recent US-China trade deal and \u201ccut off the whole relationship\u201d, a move Chinese state media described as \u201clunacy\u201d. \u2026 and he\u2019s blaming Joe Biden. With unemployment climbing and the stock market in a slump, the Trump 2020 campaign has little to brag about, so it has pivoted to a simple new strategy, reports Lauren Gambino: attack Joe Biden. The Covid-19 whistleblower says the US faces a dark winter The federal government\u2019s failures in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic could leave the US facing its \u201cdarkest winter in modern history\u201d, according to a health official who was ousted from his job overseeing vaccine research for the Trump administration. Rick Bright told a congressional committee on Thursday that the \u201cwindow is closing to address this pandemic\u201d in the US, and that \u201cthe virus is still spreading everywhere\u201d, even as many states reopen. Bright wrote in a recent whistleblower complaint that he had been removed from his role last month after resisting pressure from above to roll out unproven and potentially harmful drugs as coronavirus treatments, including two antimalarials touted by Trump. Dozens more children have fallen ill in the US from a rare but potentially lethal inflammatory syndrome thought to be linked to Covid-19. National parks are reopening, raising fears of fresh coronavirus outbreaks, particularly in rural US towns close to popular parks. Health workers could suffer PTSD due to the pandemic, experts say \u2013 one of many mental health consequences likely to linger on long after the worst effects of the disease have passed.

According to research, the channel mentioned Michael Flynn, the FBI and Barack Obama far more often than coronavirus in the past week, as it enthusiastically covers the spurious \u201cObamagate\u201d scandal.

Yet research also suggested the continent would face far fewer deaths than the US and Europe, thanks to its young population and relatively low rates of obesity. In Nigeria, lockdown measures have compounded existing problems, says the photographer Nurudeen Olugbade. In Kenya, farmers face another equally devastating crisis: the country\u2019s worst invasion of locusts for 70 years. In other news\u2026 Richard Burr has stepped down as chair of the Senate intelligence committee after investigators seized his phone, amid allegations that the North Carolina Republican used inside information from private coronavirus briefings to dump his shares before the market plunged. The former police officer charged with the murder of Ahmaud Arbery lost his power of arrest after failing to complete sufficient basic law enforcement training \u2013 including courses on firearms and the use of force \u2013 for years.

      "body": "<p>Who on earth is right? We cannot all be right.</p> <p>One country has all but dropped off the Covid-19 radar: Sweden. Just two months ago, it held hands with Britain in rejecting total lockdown and trusting \u201csocial distancing\u201d. Then on 23 March, Boris Johnson did a U-turn, leaving Sweden and, to a lesser extent, Germany, on its own. Since then the divergence has become radical and political. Sweden\u2019s centre-left government, darling of Bernie Sanders and world liberalism, is <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2020/03/all-eyes-on-the-swedish-coronavirus-experiment/?=refinnar\">suddenly lauded</a> by the libertarian right. </p> <p>Like millions, I have become an armchair epidemiologist. The reason is instinctive. I am being ordered daily by my prime minister to live in fear of my life. I have come to exist in a miasma of R-rates, antigen tests, infection fatality ratios and \u201cexcess deaths\u201d. Now, as Europe and the world emerge blearily to survey the wreckage of lockdown, the question is still left hanging. Was Sweden right?</p> <p>The one table that glares at us daily is the international league table of deaths per million. Even if the aggregates are unreliable, there is a crude reality to a body count. Yet the only conclusion to be drawn from the figures is that the league table is no help to policy.</p> <p>There is no correlation between fatalities and lockdown stringency. The most stringent lockdowns \u2013 as in China, Italy, Spain, New Zealand and Britain \u2013 have yielded both high and low deaths per million. Hi-tech has apparently \u201cworked\u201d in South Korea, but so has no-tech in Sweden. Sweden\u2019s 319 deaths per million is far ahead of locked-down Norway\u2019s 40 and Denmark\u2019s 91, but it\u2019s well behind locked-down UK\u2019s 465 and Spain\u2019s 569.</p> <p>Sweden\u2019s light-touch policy is led by two scientists, Johan Giesecke and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 <a href=\"https://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/dnipsos-stort-fortroende-for-anders-tegnell/\">Anders Tegnell</a>. The latter currently leads Stockholm\u2019s strategy with daily matter-of-fact media appearances and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-why-people-are-happy-with-no-lockdown-coronavirus-plan-2020-5?r=US&amp;IR=T\">73</a><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-why-people-are-happy-with-no-lockdown-coronavirus-plan-2020-5?r=US&amp;IR=T\">% popular support</a>. Unlike in politicised Britain, ministers do not regularly appear.</p> <p>Tegnell has been <a href=\"https://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/dnipsos-stort-fortroende-for-anders-tegnell/\">emphatic throughout</a>. A degree of social distancing and avoiding crowds is enough. As for lockdown, \u201cNothing to do with [it] has a scientific basis.\u201d </p> <p>To <a href=\"https://unherd.com/thepost/coming-up-epidemiologist-prof-johan-giesecke-shares-lessons-from-sweden/?tl_inbound=1&amp;tl_groups%5B0%5D=18743&amp;tl_period_type=3\">Giesecke</a>, a mild-mannered veteran World Health Organization virologist, Covid-19 is \u201ca tsunami sweeping the world\u201d, but he notes that it threatens older, sick people above all. He admits that Sweden\u2019s higher-than-average death rate shows it made mistakes. \u201cAt first we failed to shield the old and vulnerable.\u201d Its economy has suffered from a collapse in exports, but it has kept itself open and at work, and has not seen the surge in <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/covid-deaths/\">\u201call-causes excess deaths\u201d</a> of the UK and other high-lockdown states. This surge seems to be increasing due to a partial collapse in other areas of critical health care.</p> <p>Where I find Sweden\u2019s policy more of a gamble is in its faith in developing a <a href=\"https://www.svd.se/tegnell-flockimmunitet-inte-huvudtaktiken\">\u201ccollective immunity\u201d</a> that will protect it from future outbreaks. Giesecke talks of half of all Swedes probably infected in some degree, and tests suggest that a quarter of people in Stockholm have the virus and will probably \u2013 but by no means certainly \u2013 be protected against any resurgence. This compares with just 2% of people in Oslo. That divergence in vulnerability can only be tested in the event of a second spike.</p> <p>More to the point, there is no evidence of mass immunity having developed anywhere else. In Germany another lockdown sceptic, the <a href=\"https://unherd.com/thepost/german-virologist-finds-covid-fatality-rate-of-0-24-0-36/?tl_inbound=1&amp;tl_groups%5B0%5D=18743&amp;tl_period_type=3\">virologist Hendrik Streek</a>, thinks countries could be approaching one third immunity, which could be hopeful. But as policy, the idea is unnerving to many. Such was the fear generated by \u201cherd immunity\u201d in Britain in March that the phrase itself has become barely mentionable.<br></p> <p>Yet according to Tegnell, whatever we think, \u201cthere is no other escape\u201d but to find ways of living with this virus. There is no sign of a vaccine on the immediate horizon. We cannot ruin the world economy indefinitely. Better to concentrate on protecting our health services against it, should it return.</p> <p>The half-Swedish commentator Freddie Sayer has been closely monitoring this debate from the UK. He makes the point that with each passing week the rest of Europe moves steadily closer to <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2020/05/britain-might-end-up-following-the-swedes-lead/\">imitating Sweden</a>. It is doing so because modern economies \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-24/swedens-capital-nears-herd-immunity-relaxed-coronavirus-strategy/12177514\">their peoples</a> \u2013 just cannot live with such crushing abnormality as they have seen these past two months.</p> <p>Britain now faces a challenge.

      "bodyText": "Who on earth is right? We cannot all be right. One country has all but dropped off the Covid-19 radar: Sweden. Just two months ago, it held hands with Britain in rejecting total lockdown and trusting \u201csocial distancing\u201d. Then on 23 March, Boris Johnson did a U-turn, leaving Sweden and, to a lesser extent, Germany, on its own. Since then the divergence has become radical and political. Sweden\u2019s centre-left government, darling of Bernie Sanders and world liberalism, is suddenly lauded by the libertarian right. Like millions, I have become an armchair epidemiologist. The reason is instinctive. I am being ordered daily by my prime minister to live in fear of my life. I have come to exist in a miasma of R-rates, antigen tests, infection fatality ratios and \u201cexcess deaths\u201d. Now, as Europe and the world emerge blearily to survey the wreckage of lockdown, the question is still left hanging. Was Sweden right? The one table that glares at us daily is the international league table of deaths per million. Even if the aggregates are unreliable, there is a crude reality to a body count. Yet the only conclusion to be drawn from the figures is that the league table is no help to policy. There is no correlation between fatalities and lockdown stringency. The most stringent lockdowns \u2013 as in China, Italy, Spain, New Zealand and Britain \u2013 have yielded both high and low deaths per million. Hi-tech has apparently \u201cworked\u201d in South Korea, but so has no-tech in Sweden. Sweden\u2019s 319 deaths per million is far ahead of locked-down Norway\u2019s 40 and Denmark\u2019s 91, but it\u2019s well behind locked-down UK\u2019s 465 and Spain\u2019s 569. Sweden\u2019s light-touch policy is led by two scientists, Johan Giesecke and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Anders Tegnell. The latter currently leads Stockholm\u2019s strategy with daily matter-of-fact media appearances and 73% popular support. Unlike in politicised Britain, ministers do not regularly appear. Tegnell has been emphatic throughout. A degree of social distancing and avoiding crowds is enough. As for lockdown, \u201cNothing to do with [it] has a scientific basis.\u201d To Giesecke, a mild-mannered veteran World Health Organization virologist, Covid-19 is \u201ca tsunami sweeping the world\u201d, but he notes that it threatens older, sick people above all. He admits that Sweden\u2019s higher-than-average death rate shows it made mistakes. \u201cAt first we failed to shield the old and vulnerable.\u201d Its economy has suffered from a collapse in exports, but it has kept itself open and at work, and has not seen the surge in \u201call-causes excess deaths\u201d of the UK and other high-lockdown states. This surge seems to be increasing due to a partial collapse in other areas of critical health care. Where I find Sweden\u2019s policy more of a gamble is in its faith in developing a \u201ccollective immunity\u201d that will protect it from future outbreaks. Giesecke talks of half of all Swedes probably infected in some degree, and tests suggest that a quarter of people in Stockholm have the virus and will probably \u2013 but by no means certainly \u2013 be protected against any resurgence. This compares with just 2% of people in Oslo. That divergence in vulnerability can only be tested in the event of a second spike. More to the point, there is no evidence of mass immunity having developed anywhere else. In Germany another lockdown sceptic, the virologist Hendrik Streek, thinks countries could be approaching one third immunity, which could be hopeful. But as policy, the idea is unnerving to many. Such was the fear generated by \u201cherd immunity\u201d in Britain in March that the phrase itself has become barely mentionable. Yet according to Tegnell, whatever we think, \u201cthere is no other escape\u201d but to find ways of living with this virus. There is no sign of a vaccine on the immediate horizon. We cannot ruin the world economy indefinitely. Better to concentrate on protecting our health services against it, should it return. The half-Swedish commentator Freddie Sayer has been closely monitoring this debate from the UK. He makes the point that with each passing week the rest of Europe moves steadily closer to imitating Sweden. It is doing so because modern economies \u2013 and their peoples \u2013 just cannot live with such crushing abnormality as they have seen these past two months. Britain now faces a challenge. I believe early criticism of Boris Johnson was unfair. He had a respectable case for proceeding on an evidence-based approach, had he only concentrated his attention on the high-risk health and care sectors. In his U-turn he opted for the politics of fear. He now has workers terrified of working, and parents terrified of school. He has frightened his economy into inertia. I share the view of scientists such as Cambridge\u2019s David Spiegelhalter and Oxford\u2019s Carl Heneghan that this virus is unprecedented in its infectiousness, but that it will pass. The chief variant will prove to be how governments reacted, and the toll they took on the rest of their healthcare and the wider economy. Sweden gambled in its response, but so did the rest of the world. South Africa\u2019s lockdown threatens it with economic and political catastrophe. The UN warns that the world could lose four years of growth at a cost of $8.5 trillion. Famine and further disease will be rife. That was surely the greater gamble. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

This approach was on vivid display in a Trump campaign statement to the Guardian. \u201cThis election will be about the contrast between President Trump\u2019s proven record and Joe Biden\u2018s decades of failure,\u201d Sarah Matthews, the campaign\u2019s deputy press secretary, said. \u201cFrom his job-killing Green New Deal to his support for TPP and Nafta to his repeated denials that China is a threat to American jobs, Biden\u2019s record proves he won\u2019t fight for America\u2019s interests.\u201d Several campaign communications experts said the pandemic had left Trump with few options but to attack his Democratic opponent in any way possible, including repeatedly mocking Biden as \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d to question his mental acuity. \u201cThey can\u2019t run on the economy, and despite all their efforts to blame everyone else, they can\u2019t run on their handling of the pandemic,\u201d said the longtime Democratic strategist Bob Shrum. \u201cRight now, I think that their only message is to go after Biden. \u2026 They\u2019re just throwing up everything against the wall and hoping something sticks.\u201d Trump and his allies appear to be taking a localized approach, criticizing Biden on everything from trade to China relations to climate policy depending on which battleground state is the focus. As the president visited Pennsylvania on Thursday, the Republican National Committee went after Biden over the Green New Deal, whose framework the Democratic candidate has endorsed. The president\u2019s campaign was also eager to pounce on Biden\u2019s verbal slip during a March primary debate when he appeared to endorse a ban on all fracking, a comment that the former vice-president\u2019s team was forced to quickly clarify. Local strategists say the president attacking Biden over fracking could prove effective in Pennsylvania, which Trump won by less than one point in 2016, because the state economy is propped up by fossil fuels. \u201cHillary Clinton lost in 2016 largely because she was unpopular, but if there was a single issue that worked against her in Pennsylvania, it was her war on fossil fuels,\u201d said Charlie Gerow, a veteran Republican strategist based in Harrisburg, the state capital. But several recent polls show Trump losing ground in key battleground states that were critical to his 2016 victory, including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Four years ago, Hillary Clinton\u2019s primary losses to Bernie Sanders in Michigan and Wisconsin were \u201ca sign of things to come\u201d, said Ben Tulchin, a pollster for Sanders\u2019 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns. \u201cThey exposed weaknesses that her campaign never really addressed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Biden doesn\u2019t have those same kind of vulnerabilities.\u201d In 2020, Biden dominated Sanders in the primaries in Michigan and Wisconsin. Though Pennsylvania hasn\u2019t held its primary yet, it is the state where Biden has headquartered his campaign and where he was born, factors that could hinder a localized attack strategy from the president and his allies. Other presidential campaign alumni added that Trump\u2019s localized attacks would only prove successful if he could find a centralized message uniting all the various pieces of criticism. \u201cThe attacks the president\u2019s team are making to try to chip away at [Biden\u2019s] advantages in those critical states [are] absolutely smart, absolutely make sense, but they need to be part of an overall structure,\u201d said Michael Steel, who served as a senior adviser on Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Steel suggested the Trump campaign\u2019s criticism of China might fuel the \u201clikeliest effective attack\u201d against Biden, as the president tries to blame Beijing for the spread of coronavirus. The Trump campaign released a new ad last week featuring some of Biden\u2019s past comments on China to depict the former vice-president as too cozy with Beijing. The pro-Trump America First Action Pac has also launched a $10m ad buy in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as part of its \u201cBeijing Biden\u201d ad campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s been very successful at identifying an enemy and so that\u2019s his formula,\u201d Paul Maslin, a longtime Democratic pollster based in Wisconsin, said of the attack ads. \u201cAnd right now, what other choice does he have?\u201d But despite the president\u2019s efforts to deflect blame, Maslin predicted the November election would ultimately come down to voters\u2019 opinion on Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic. \u201cIn a time of unbelievable national angst and worry, of economic dislocation and with concerns about health and everything that this virus has become, if he can\u2019t win back voters on his own merit, then all the rest of it is going to be mostly irrelevant,\u201d Maslin said.",

However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected.

      "bodyText": "Churches may introduce ticket-only services when they reopen this summer to ensure congregations observe physical distancing. A ticket system is one option being considered by Anglican churches and other places of worship when they are permitted to unlock their doors under step three of the government\u2019s recovery strategy, to be implemented on 4 July at the earliest. Other issues being considered include whether singing \u2013 which may help spread virus particles \u2013 should be banned, and whether worshippers can safely receive holy communion, especially if wearing face masks is encouraged. Churches are expected to ensure congregants sit apart by taping off pews or removing chairs. The suspension of the \u201csign of the peace\u201d, when congregants shake hands with one other, is likely to continue. Some Anglican churches may hold back-to-back Sunday services with limited congregations in order to maximise the numbers that can attend while continuing to stream services online. A government taskforce on how places of worship and other religious buildings can reopen safely was due to meet for the first time on Friday. Although the numbers of people engaging with online services and prayer during lockdown have been higher than religious leaders expected, most major faiths are based on people congregating to worship. Many religious leaders are disappointed that places of worship have not been given higher priority by the government. They point out that non-essential retail businesses will be allowed to open under step two, scheduled for early June, and ask why, if people can shop for scented candles or a new sofa, they can\u2019t pray in a church, mosque or synagogue. Catholic bishops criticised the government\u2019s classification of places of worship in the same category as hospitality and leisure facilities such as cinemas. \u201cThe timing and the manner of the opening of churches touches profound sensitivities and spiritual needs. The government\u2019s document and statements fail to recognise this,\u201d they said in a statement this week. They have proposed private prayer in churches be allowed \u201cas a first safe step towards their use for public worship\u201d. In a loosening of restrictions ahead of step three, the Church of England this week said clergy could begin streaming and recording services from their churches. The move came almost two months after the archbishop of Canterbury issued guidance that buildings should be locked. Then Justin Welby said it was vital that the church \u201cset an example\u201d in following the government\u2019s dictum to stay at home. But many protested at the prohibition, including more than 800 clergy and churchgoers, who signed a letter to the Times earlier this month calling on bishops to change their policy. On Monday, Stephen Cottrell, who will succeed John Sentamu as archbishop of York next month, wrote in the Telegraph: \u201cFrom this week, clergy will again be streaming services from their churches.\u201d But, he warned, even when churches reopen for worship, \u201cit won\u2019t be business as usual\u201d. The Rev Will Pearson-Gee, the rector of Buckingham parish church, has been defying C of E guidance by entering his church to record services for streaming for the past two or three weeks. \u201cMy church is a massive Grade I-listed building with proper technology, and it\u2019s far easier to record a service in it than in my home,\u201d he said. \u201cI was recording in my living room but it was really stressful with three kids trying to do school work and piano practice, the dog barking, my wife, my mother-in-law who happened to be staying when the lockdown came, and my phone running out of storage. I thought, I don\u2019t care \u2013 I\u2019m going back into church. \u201cWhat bugged me was the diktat that came down [from bishops]. The church is far more concerned about health and safety than spirituality.\u201d The church was \u201clike a dear old friend\u201d to many parishioners, he said. \u201cI\u2019m aware that it is just a building, but it\u2019s a very beautiful building at the heart of this community. It has stood here for centuries and is a metaphor for survival and longevity.\u201d Churches in the UK with small congregations may not find physical distancing too much of a challenge when they reopen, but mosques, temples and synagogues are regularly packed with worshippers. On Fridays, men pray shoulder to shoulder in mosques, sometimes spreading beyond prayer halls to corridors, staircases and outdoors. The Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board (MINAB) has issued \u201cstrong advice\u201d that mosques and Islamic centres should remain closed on Eid al-Fitr, the festival that follows the holy month of Ramadan, which ends next Saturday. \u201cPlaces of worship including our mosques are potentially at high risk of spreading coronavirus due to people coming together \u2026 MINAB urges the Muslim community should celebrate Eid at home with family by following the social distancing measures,\u201d its statement said. Synagogues would not fully reopen for \u201ca long time\u201d, the chief rabbi warned this week. Writing in the Jewish Chronicle, he said: \u201cOur greatest strength as a community has become our greatest weakness \u2026 In our shuls [synagogues], we pray and sing in close proximity to one another. We greet friends and family, we schmooze and chat with people of all ages and health backgrounds. We learn together and, of course, we eat together \u2026 Tragically, everything we know and love about shul facilitates the spread of Covid-19.\u201d Synagogues could \u201cquickly become a hub for the virus to reappear. We must proceed with extreme caution.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>Many people I know are using lockdown creatively either to develop existing talents or to discover new ones. I appear to be the exception, unless you count working out how to do a Zoom call and worrying even more than usual as lifelong learning. The only skill I can vaguely claim to have acquired is how to cut the dog\u2019s hair. Badly. A week ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/17/herbert-hound-has-adjusted-new-normal-wish-i-could-say-same-digested-week\">Herbert Hound</a> was in a miserable state as his fur hadn\u2019t been cut since Christmas, apart the odd trim with scissors around his eyes so he could see out. So I went on Amazon to investigate buying a pair of dog hair clippers, only to find that they are identical to the ones I use to shave my own head \u2013 excess hair is one of the few things not to have presented a problem for me so far \u2013 except the dog ones had a nice picture of a dog paw on the handle. So my wife and I got out my own clippers and took Herbie out into the garden. It wasn\u2019t a total success. We started with me trying to keep the dog still and with Jill giving him a number 8 cut. Which appeared to make little difference, despite the large amount of fur that had collected on the patio. So we gradually worked our way down through the attachments before ending on a rather uneven number 3 cut \u2013 with the exception of the areas around the genitals which we felt required rather greater expertise than we possessed. Herbie has looked on us disapprovingly ever since, as if he believes we have made him the embarrassment of Tooting Bec common. He now doesn\u2019t even bother to come into our bedroom before saying goodnight to us and clearly can\u2019t wait for the time when we\u2019re out the house more. Annoyingly, the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/22/pets-at-home-under-fire-coronavirus-key-worker-school-childcare\">dog grooming</a> salon rang us this morning to say they had just opened. Herbie is now booked in for early July.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>We\u2019ve heard a lot about coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/ministers-accused-of-changing-covid-19-test-tally-to-hit-100000-goal\">tests that don\u2019t really count as tests</a>. The same people getting tested three times and the tests that were included in the daily figures merely on the grounds that someone had put them in the post. But we\u2019ve heard little of testing as surreal performance art. So meet my friend Kevin who, early on in the coronavirus pandemic, signed up to C-19, a research app that asks participants to report their symptoms online. On 30 April \u2013 possibly owing to Kevin saying his voice was a little huskier than usual, but more likely because of the government\u2019s desperation to meet its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/ministers-under-fire-as-covid-19-testing-drops-back-below-100000-daily-target\">100,000 daily target</a> by the end of the month \u2013 he was told he was eligible for a test and was invited to go to a centre in Cambridge the next day. There he was greeted by some soldiers in full camo suits who passed him a swab attached to the end of a long pole through his car window. Once he had done the necessary, he went home having been told he would receive the results within two days. The two days passed with no news, so Kevin emailed to find out what was going on. He was told the new estimate was five days. The five days passed with no news, so he contacted them again to be informed that the five days meant five working days and he should hang on a bit longer. Still nothing. When he emailed again on the Thursday, he was told to call a number, select option 1, and he would get his results. He phoned only to find there was no option 1, only an answerphone message saying the office was closed until the following Tuesday at 11am. After waiting out the weekend and still getting no joy when the phone line was open, he was sent an email offering him another test at Stansted airport. So Kevin now finds himself in a Kafkaesque situation in which he could have died before receiving the results of his early diagnosis test and faces the choice of going into self-isolation for a further two weeks if he takes up the offer of a second test. Luckily neither Kevin nor any other members of his family is a key worker as he could have been needlessly off work for a month. And the government wonders why so many people are sceptical about its testing numbers.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3da4033b58eebe11c2e9aa7f28afe00bafa0b4bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3da4033b58eebe11c2e9aa7f28afe00bafa0b4bf/0_334_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A rat on the pavement in Downing St\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Classic Dom to leave a sinking ship.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s suggestion that parliament should totally ignore government advice on social-distancing and meet as normal when it returns after the May recess has understandably been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/jacob-rees-mogg-tells-mps-to-set-example-and-return-to-commons-coronavirus\">met with derision by most MPs</a>. But his desire to fill the Tory benches almost certainly has less to do with his interpretation of health guidelines than with a desire to protect the prime minister. Because without the presence of fellow cabinet ministers to help him out and 300 or so Conservative MPs to kill themselves laughing at his rubbish jokes, Boris Johnson has been hopelessly exposed at prime minister\u2019s questions by the courtroom atmosphere in which Keir Starmer flourishes. The Labour leader will have had tougher days defending shoplifters as a junior barrister than questioning the prime minister about his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. It turns out that years of entitlement, bluster, lies and winging it aren\u2019t such great preparation for serious interrogation on the most serious health crisis for 100 years. In short, Boris is having a nightmare at the moment \u2013 his Sunday night address to the nation was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/boris-johnson-coronavirus-lockdown-shops-schools-june-reopening\">TV car crash</a> \u2013 and he and the Tory party know it. Matt Hancock is another minister who looks under the cosh. I\u2019m well aware of all his faults but I can\u2019t help feeling a bit sorry for him as he is clearly being lined up to take most of the blame for things that weren\u2019t entirely his fault. Matt now looks haunted: his Tigger-like enthusiasm is now a distant memory and he\u2019s even taken to getting stroppy with Louise Minchin on BBC Breakfast. He looks like a man on the edge of a nervous breakdown. The only cabinet minister who appears to be enjoying the crisis is Rishi Sunak who is lavished with praise for delivering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/13/treasury-tax-hikes-pay-freezes-covid-19-costs-budget-deficit-spending\">a new bailout budget once or twice a week</a>. Better still, no one thinks to ask how on earth he is going to pay for his spending commitments. Which is just as well as right now he doesn\u2019t have a clue.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>I am trying to Stay Alert, but the government\u2019s new physical distancing guidelines \u2013 brief summary \u201cGo to work but don\u2019t go to work\u201d \u2013 have left me feeling somewhat confused. I have no idea when I am going to see my daughter in Minneapolis again \u2013 we were due to go to the US in August \u2013 though it seems that my wife and I could arrange to see our son in a public space in Brighton, providing that only one of us was to see him at a time. So we\u2019re thinking of driving down this weekend so that my wife can him for an hour while I wait in the car. Then when she returns to the car, she can stay behind while I see Robbie for an hour. Another solution is for Robbie and his girlfriend, who are living together, to both go to an open space so that I can see Robbie and my wife can see Laila. Then we could leave for five minutes before returning so that Jill can see Robbie and I can see Laila. Right now, though, the easiest way to see him would be for him to get a job as an estate agent, as apparently they have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/13/opening-of-english-housing-market-catches-estate-agents-on-hop-coronavirus\">carte blanche to go anywhere</a>, and for us to put our house on the market. Not that I\u2019ve any intention of moving anywhere: we\u2019ve lived in the same house for 25 years and I\u2019d be more than happy to stay another 25 and besides London now has the lowest virus reproduction rate (0.4) of anywhere in the country. But we could theoretically put the house up for sale so that Robbie could come round to measure up and then just refuse to allow any viewers. The other possibility is that Robbie could become our cleaner. The downside is that he\u2019s only ever been known to make any place more untidy than he found it.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>As the days have long since elided into one another \u2013 apparently it\u2019s Friday, two new trends have begun to emerge. Fear of missing out (Fomo) has become a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/bye-bye-fomo-now-the-party-is-being-zoomed-to-my-laptop\">thing of the past</a>, as there is nothing to fear missing out on. Unless you don\u2019t have a Netflix subscription. Replacing Fomo are two competing behavioural traits: Fear of going out (Fogo) and Joy of missing out (Jomo). Being naturally cautious and highly anxious, I\u2019d put myself in the Fogo camp. I just don\u2019t feel as safe, even in my own neighbourhood, as I used to. Apart from two trips to the local supermarket each week \u2013 face mask, check; hand sanitiser, check \u2013 the only times I go out in the day are either to walk the dog or to cycle up and down the same hill on my wife\u2019s boneshaker. And as I\u2019m counting down the days till my exercise bike arrives \u2013 Amazon promises 1 June \u2013 I\u2019ll soon be able to cross that last activity off my list and watch Grant Shapps take the Downing Street 5pm press conference. There will be something quite zen about us both putting in a lot of effort to go nowhere. It\u2019s come as a surprise to me but the closest I\u2019ve come to Jomo is not having to schlep all the way up to White Hart Lane to watch Spurs put in another lacklustre performance. At the start of lockdown, I couldn\u2019t imagine life without football \u2013 even during periods of depression, it\u2019s always been a fixed point in my week, not to mention a timely reminder of how little control I have over the world \u2013 but within a comparatively short period I\u2019ve experienced little sense of loss. On occasions even a sense of relief. I just don\u2019t understand those who are rewatching the whole of Euro 96 on ITV catch up. Guys, you know it ends badly with England losing to Germany on penalties in the semi-final. It has occurred to me though, that, I am beginning to experience Fomo on my season ticket part refund as it\u2019s clear the Premier league season will at best be only completed in empty stadiums. Every other organisation from whom I had bought event tickets has been in contact either to make refund arrangements. From Spurs I have heard nothing.</p> <p><strong>Digested Week: </strong>Stay Alert!</p>",

      "bodyText": "Monday Many people I know are using lockdown creatively either to develop existing talents or to discover new ones. I appear to be the exception, unless you count working out how to do a Zoom call and worrying even more than usual as lifelong learning. The only skill I can vaguely claim to have acquired is how to cut the dog\u2019s hair. Badly. A week ago, Herbert Hound was in a miserable state as his fur hadn\u2019t been cut since Christmas, apart the odd trim with scissors around his eyes so he could see out. So I went on Amazon to investigate buying a pair of dog hair clippers, only to find that they are identical to the ones I use to shave my own head \u2013 excess hair is one of the few things not to have presented a problem for me so far \u2013 except the dog ones had a nice picture of a dog paw on the handle. So my wife and I got out my own clippers and took Herbie out into the garden. It wasn\u2019t a total success. We started with me trying to keep the dog still and with Jill giving him a number 8 cut. Which appeared to make little difference, despite the large amount of fur that had collected on the patio. So we gradually worked our way down through the attachments before ending on a rather uneven number 3 cut \u2013 with the exception of the areas around the genitals which we felt required rather greater expertise than we possessed. Herbie has looked on us disapprovingly ever since, as if he believes we have made him the embarrassment of Tooting Bec common. He now doesn\u2019t even bother to come into our bedroom before saying goodnight to us and clearly can\u2019t wait for the time when we\u2019re out the house more. Annoyingly, the new dog grooming salon rang us this morning to say they had just opened. Herbie is now booked in for early July. Tuesday We\u2019ve heard a lot about coronavirus tests that don\u2019t really count as tests. The same people getting tested three times and the tests that were included in the daily figures merely on the grounds that someone had put them in the post. But we\u2019ve heard little of testing as surreal performance art. So meet my friend Kevin who, early on in the coronavirus pandemic, signed up to C-19, a research app that asks participants to report their symptoms online. On 30 April \u2013 possibly owing to Kevin saying his voice was a little huskier than usual, but more likely because of the government\u2019s desperation to meet its 100,000 daily target by the end of the month \u2013 he was told he was eligible for a test and was invited to go to a centre in Cambridge the next day. There he was greeted by some soldiers in full camo suits who passed him a swab attached to the end of a long pole through his car window.

After waiting out the weekend and still getting no joy when the phone line was open, he was sent an email offering him another test at Stansted airport. So Kevin now finds himself in a Kafkaesque situation in which he could have died before receiving the results of his early diagnosis test and faces the choice of going into self-isolation for a further two weeks if he takes up the offer of a second test. Luckily neither Kevin nor any other members of his family is a key worker as he could have been needlessly off work for a month. And the government wonders why so many people are sceptical about its testing numbers. Wednesday Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s suggestion that parliament should totally ignore government advice on social-distancing and meet as normal when it returns after the May recess has understandably been met with derision by most MPs. But his desire to fill the Tory benches almost certainly has less to do with his interpretation of health guidelines than with a desire to protect the prime minister. Because without the presence of fellow cabinet ministers to help him out and 300 or so Conservative MPs to kill themselves laughing at his rubbish jokes, Boris Johnson has been hopelessly exposed at prime minister\u2019s questions by the courtroom atmosphere in which Keir Starmer flourishes. The Labour leader will have had tougher days defending shoplifters as a junior barrister than questioning the prime minister about his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. It turns out that years of entitlement, bluster, lies and winging it aren\u2019t such great preparation for serious interrogation on the most serious health crisis for 100 years. In short, Boris is having a nightmare at the moment \u2013 his Sunday night address to the nation was a TV car crash \u2013 and he and the Tory party know it.

Matt now looks haunted: his Tigger-like enthusiasm is now a distant memory and he\u2019s even taken to getting stroppy with Louise Minchin on BBC Breakfast. He looks like a man on the edge of a nervous breakdown. The only cabinet minister who appears to be enjoying the crisis is Rishi Sunak who is lavished with praise for delivering a new bailout budget once or twice a week. Better still, no one thinks to ask how on earth he is going to pay for his spending commitments. Which is just as well as right now he doesn\u2019t have a clue. Thursday I am trying to Stay Alert, but the government\u2019s new physical distancing guidelines \u2013 brief summary \u201cGo to work but don\u2019t go to work\u201d \u2013 have left me feeling somewhat confused.

We are taking care of our teams, securing as many employment opportunities as possible and we are ready to power up the business as soon as Covid-19 restrictions permit.\u201d</p> <p>William Hill said it was encouraged by plans for the return of football, which accounts for about half of its online UK sports business, with the German Bundesliga playing behind closed doors from this weekend.

      "bodyText": "William Hill has said its revenues more than halved during the coronavirus lockdown, as the betting company prepares for a staged reopening of its shops. The bookmaker reported a 57% fall in revenues in the seven weeks to 28 April. It said online betting revenues were also down by a fifth during the same period, adding that each month its betting shops were closed cost the company up to \u00a315m. William Hill said it was preparing to \u201cpower up\u201d its UK and US businesses quickly, as live sport events resumed and physical distancing plans allowed it to reopen betting shops. It is planning a staged opening for its UK chain of 2,000 shops in the second half of the year. The company said it had factored in a total impact on profits of up to \u00a3110m for three months of shop closures. Ulrik Bengtsson, its chief executive, said: \u201cWe remain focused on player safety employing ever more customer protection. We are taking care of our teams, securing as many employment opportunities as possible and we are ready to power up the business as soon as Covid-19 restrictions permit.\u201d William Hill said it was encouraged by plans for the return of football, which accounts for about half of its online UK sports business, with the German Bundesliga playing behind closed doors from this weekend. Horse racing, which accounts for about a third of William Hill\u2019s online UK sports business, has resumed in France and is expected to restart in the UK next month. The company said on Friday it had agreed a waiver on covenant tests for its debt this year and had agreed more relaxed terms for 2021 as well. William Hill has already suspended dividend payments, cut marketing spend, cancelled pay rises and bonuses this year and furloughed staff. \u201cWe conclude the period in a strong financial position with significant headroom,\u201d the company said. William Hill said it had increased the volume of responsible gambling messages sent to customers sixfold, and had not targeted vulnerable customers during the lockdown. In April, the UK\u2019s biggest betting and gaming companies agreed to cease advertising on TV and radio until at least 5 June. However, companies continued to use other channels such as direct marketing, which includes ads on social media, as well as emails and text messages.",

We are in secure hands. But as soon as Jordan becomes a corona-free country, we will look around and see most industries are okay \u2013 but not tourism. Petra will die without direct support or loan packages.\u201d</p> <p>To entice people back, tourism authorities are developing plans to market Petra as a safe destination in a post-Covid world. \u201cWe rely on outdoor tourism, which means that people are not stuck in closed areas,\u201d Farajat says. \u201cWe will regulate the flow of tourists so that no large numbers are in close proximity.\u201d</p> <p>He expects a few thousand foreigners to return this year, perhaps followed by a few hundred thousand next year.

Without external aid, the fund could run dry within months. The rest of the country\u2019s workforce, including tens of thousands of migrant workers, have no safety net at all, and are totally exposed to the vagaries and predations of the market. \u201cThis is the everything we\u2019ve made in the past two months,\u201d Muadth gestures at the handful of bills in the cash register, at a convenience store a few metres from Petra\u2019s gates. The Yemeni, in sandals and a corduroy suit jacket, arrived in the tourist hub a year ago. Even in bad months, he says, he could send about 200 dinars home to his family in Sana\u2019a. \u201cNow, nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cMy younger brother sells water and the family lives off that.\u201d His debts include to a pastry shop owner who sponsored his working visa a year ago. The pair had a falling out, and the man refuses to give back his passport unless Muadth can pay him for the cost of his working permit, he says. \u201cI called him yesterday and said, listen, I\u2019m not earning any money. He told me: deal with it. Sort something out.\u201d The Jordanian government is trying to cushion the impact on the tourist industry by waiving some fees, postponing utility bills and offering loans to hotel owners and other stakeholders. Those measures might work in situations where tourist numbers have simply fallen, says Hasanaat, but when they are zero for months on end, more is needed. \u201cWe are indebted to our government for the lockdown,\u201d he says. \u201cThey controlled [the virus]. We are in secure hands. But as soon as Jordan becomes a corona-free country, we will look around and see most industries are okay \u2013 but not tourism. Petra will die without direct support or loan packages.\u201d To entice people back, tourism authorities are developing plans to market Petra as a safe destination in a post-Covid world. \u201cWe rely on outdoor tourism, which means that people are not stuck in closed areas,\u201d Farajat says. \u201cWe will regulate the flow of tourists so that no large numbers are in close proximity.\u201d He expects a few thousand foreigners to return this year, perhaps followed by a few hundred thousand next year. It will take several years, in the best case, to return to the heights of 2019, he says. A few days after Jordan closed its borders, Hasanaat went to Petra alone. \u201cI just wanted to see it,\u201d he said. \u201cI just had this feeling \u2013 that I wanted to see it without tourists.\u201d It was still dark as he strolled through the city, and he watched the sun come up in front of the treasury\u2019s towering facade. \u201cI stayed in front of it for two or three hours,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a very sad feeling, walking alone. I\u2019m used to seeing it with crowds. Now it\u2019s full of ghosts.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Magnus Carlsen has announced a new $1m series of major online events in which he will compete, lasting all summer with a final in August. The Carlsen Tour effectively replaces the over-the-board Grand Tour organised from St Louis in the US, which was halted by coronavirus. The Carlsen series could even open up the possibility, if coronavirus continues for a long time, of moving the world championship match itself to an internet setting.</p> <p>The first Carlsen Tour event has already happened. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/may/04/fast-and-furious-carlsen-and-nakamura-transform-chess-into-an-adrenaline-sport\" title=\"\">Carlsen Invitational</a>, where the No 1 defeated the US champion, Hikaru Nakamura, in a tense final, was watched by an online audience calculated at 114,000.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/08/chess-vishy-anand-ambushes-russias-world-no-4-to-win-in-five-minutes\">Chess: Vishy Anand ambushes Russia's world No 4 to win in five minutes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The next tournament, from 19 May to 3 June, is the Lindores Abbey Challenge, a version of the over-the-board rapidplay in Scotland last summer. Carlsen\u2019s opponents will include Nakamura, China\u2019s world No 3, Ding Liren, and the prodigy Alireza Firouzja.</p> <p>That competition starts on Tuesday but before then the Norwegian will be in action again, this time in a blitz tournament, the Fide Steinitz Memorial, to commemorate the first world champion\u2019s birth date.</p> <p>The choice may seem tenuous, for chess clocks came into general use only in the mid-1880s, and there is no record of Steinitz ever playing blitz. Games are <a href=\"https://chess24.com/en/watch/live-tournaments/fide-online-steinitz-memorial-2020\" title=\"\">live on chess24</a>, starting at 5.30pm on Friday when Carlsen meets the eight-time Russian champion Peter Svidler.</p> <p>Carlsen and/or Carlsen events will be on your internet screen for at least 60 days from now until August. It should be a great feast of free entertainment and grandmaster commentary for chess fans, but the sheer quantity of games in a short period sparks the question whether at some stage viewer fatigue will creep in. The over-the-board Grand Tour promoted by Rex Sinquefield and Garry Kasparov from St Louis ran for five years from 2015 to 2019, though with longer intervals between tournaments, and interest seemed to wane towards the end.</p> <p>If that ennui occurs at some stage to the Carlsen Tour at a time when there is still no visible prospect of over-the-board chess resuming in a significant way, then pressure may develop to play the second half of the abandoned candidates tournament and even the world championship match itself as internet competitions. That would be a radical plan and would be fiercely resisted by traditionalists, but normal over-the-board chess, with opponents seated opposite each other for an extended period, may yet come to be viewed as an enduring health risk.</p> <p>China narrowly edged out the US in the online Nations Cup final last weekend, halving the final match 2-2 but winning the trophy because of their superior performance in the previous rounds.</p> <p>The powerhouses for the winning teams were China\u2019s Yu Yangyi, who totalled 7.5/10, and America\u2019s world No 2, Fabiano Caruana, who did even better with an unbeaten 7.5/9. Both scored with attacks against the king in direct encounters with their rivals. <br>It was interesting that Caruana, confronted with the solid Petroff 2 Nf3 Nf6, chose the well worn attacking system with a knight exchange at c3 and castling long which sometimes peters out to a draw but <a href=\"https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1995087\" title=\"\">sparked a crushing assault</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.chessbomb.com/arena/2020-fide-chess-com-online-nations-cup/11-Superfinal-Yu_Yangyi-So_Wesley\" title=\"\">Yu</a><a href=\"https://www.chessbomb.com/arena/2020-fide-chess-com-online-nations-cup/11-Superfinal-Yu_Yangyi-So_Wesley\" title=\"\">\u2019s win over Wesley So</a> effectively decided the final match, and was of high quality as he stopped Black\u2019s queen\u2019s side army getting out of the box then sacrificed three pieces for his mating attack.</p> <p>The final rounds also featured two impressive victories by Firouzja, who had struggled against the big names at the Carlsen Invitational.

      "bodyText": "Magnus Carlsen has announced a new $1m series of major online events in which he will compete, lasting all summer with a final in August. The Carlsen Tour effectively replaces the over-the-board Grand Tour organised from St Louis in the US, which was halted by coronavirus. The Carlsen series could even open up the possibility, if coronavirus continues for a long time, of moving the world championship match itself to an internet setting. The first Carlsen Tour event has already happened. The Carlsen Invitational, where the No 1 defeated the US champion, Hikaru Nakamura, in a tense final, was watched by an online audience calculated at 114,000. The next tournament, from 19 May to 3 June, is the Lindores Abbey Challenge, a version of the over-the-board rapidplay in Scotland last summer. Carlsen\u2019s opponents will include Nakamura, China\u2019s world No 3, Ding Liren, and the prodigy Alireza Firouzja. That competition starts on Tuesday but before then the Norwegian will be in action again, this time in a blitz tournament, the Fide Steinitz Memorial, to commemorate the first world champion\u2019s birth date. The choice may seem tenuous, for chess clocks came into general use only in the mid-1880s, and there is no record of Steinitz ever playing blitz. Games are live on chess24, starting at 5.30pm on Friday when Carlsen meets the eight-time Russian champion Peter Svidler. Carlsen and/or Carlsen events will be on your internet screen for at least 60 days from now until August. It should be a great feast of free entertainment and grandmaster commentary for chess fans, but the sheer quantity of games in a short period sparks the question whether at some stage viewer fatigue will creep in. The over-the-board Grand Tour promoted by Rex Sinquefield and Garry Kasparov from St Louis ran for five years from 2015 to 2019, though with longer intervals between tournaments, and interest seemed to wane towards the end. If that ennui occurs at some stage to the Carlsen Tour at a time when there is still no visible prospect of over-the-board chess resuming in a significant way, then pressure may develop to play the second half of the abandoned candidates tournament and even the world championship match itself as internet competitions. That would be a radical plan and would be fiercely resisted by traditionalists, but normal over-the-board chess, with opponents seated opposite each other for an extended period, may yet come to be viewed as an enduring health risk. China narrowly edged out the US in the online Nations Cup final last weekend, halving the final match 2-2 but winning the trophy because of their superior performance in the previous rounds. The powerhouses for the winning teams were China\u2019s Yu Yangyi, who totalled 7.5/10, and America\u2019s world No 2, Fabiano Caruana, who did even better with an unbeaten 7.5/9. Both scored with attacks against the king in direct encounters with their rivals. It was interesting that Caruana, confronted with the solid Petroff 2 Nf3 Nf6, chose the well worn attacking system with a knight exchange at c3 and castling long which sometimes peters out to a draw but sparked a crushing assault. Yu\u2019s win over Wesley So effectively decided the final match, and was of high quality as he stopped Black\u2019s queen\u2019s side army getting out of the box then sacrificed three pieces for his mating attack. The final rounds also featured two impressive victories by Firouzja, who had struggled against the big names at the Carlsen Invitational. The 16-year-old won in fine style against Levon Aronian and Sergey Karjakin at a much slower time rate than the blitz where he is so deadly. Firouzja\u2019s choice of the Vienna 2 Nc3 and its follow-up against Aronian showed that he was ready to take on the bizarrely named Frankenstein-Dracula variation with all its obscure complexity. His surprised opponent dodged the bullet by 5...Be7 (instead of Nc6) giving White a small edge without risk which Firouzja converted. Firouzja\u2019s all-court attack against Karjakin, the 2016 world title challenger, makes a powerful impression, helped by the loser\u2019s odd choice of h1 for his queen. Possibly the most significant Nations Cup game for its potential future influence was Hou Yifan\u2019s win over Aleksandra Goryachkina in the China v Russia match. Hou is the all-time women\u2019s No 2 after the retired Judit Polgar, and despite taking two years off for academic studies as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford she showed that she is still close to her peak strength. Goryachkina is 21, five years younger than her opponent, and the flagbearer for a new generation following her crushing win in the women\u2019s Candidates, so this was a pairing of unusual significance. Hou got in first with her opening prep after 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 Nc3 Bb4 (Winawer French) 4 Qd3!? She had used the queen move in a 2015 game, and the database prefers 4...Ne7 rather than dxe4 and chasing the white queen to h4. Goryachkina\u2019s decisive error was 18...Nb4? instead of Nf6, as Black\u2019s resulting weak b4 pawn soon fell leading to a lost rook endgame. 3671: 1...Ra3+! 2 Kb4 Ra7! when if 3 Rxd2 Rxe7 or 3 Bf8 Rd7! with a winning ending.",

Contract tracers initially identify those in the infected person\u2019s household, where the risk of being infected with TB is highest.

But it\u2019s also much more difficult to identify a person A with Covid-19. They may have shown no symptoms, or may have already recovered before person B develops symptoms. So it\u2019s crucial to identify as many of the Cs as possible, before they go on to pass the infection to others. When contact tracers have identified potential Cs, these people are asked to isolate until they get tested, and stay at home until they test negative.</p> <p>Isolating one single case can prevent a whole chain of future transmissions. This is why tracing, isolating and testing people for coronavirus is essential for reducing the R rate across a population. Although it\u2019s impossible to find all cases, the more cases that are contact-traced, the more the R is driven down.</p> <p>The number of asymptomatic coronavirus cases means that a contact-tracing app is an important part of breaking the transmission chain. In countries such as South Korea, these apps, used together with traditional tracing methods, have been crucial for controlling the virus.

This additional feature allows public health authorities to identify potential hotspots of transmission earlier than they would otherwise, targeting measures quickly and efficiently at the places where these are most needed. Of course, some have raised privacy concerns about apps that use geolocation data (the <a href=\"https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/\">NHSX </a>app <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/bluetooth-contact-tracing-apps\">uses Bluetooth to inform other app users</a>, and doesn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/nhs-covid-19-app-health-status-future\">currently capture geolocation data</a>). Many would consider South Korea\u2019s contact-tracing approach, which uses CCTV and credit card data alongside geolocation information, an invasion of privacy. But as we saw in the <a href=\"https://time.com/5834991/south-korea-coronavirus-nightclubs/\">recent nightclub outbreak</a>, where South Korean authorities were able to contact everyone present in the building, this level of detail allows public health authorities to quickly identify potential cases.</p> <p>The UK government has announced that it will deploy 18,000 contact tracers, 3,000 of whom will be health professionals.

      "body": "<p>Had everything gone to plan, Kalie Shorr would have just wrapped her first UK tour. Instead, the 25-year-old country songwriter is stuck in Nashville, diagnosed with coronavirus and fighting trolls who accused her of faking it for publicity. It\u2019s the longest she\u2019s spent at home since music became her full-time gig seven years ago. She has been writing songs with her two housemates but, otherwise, lockdown has been an exercise in getting comfortable with her own company. \u201cI am very extroverted and thrive on chaos,\u201d she says with a guilty laugh.</p> <p>Shorr is no stranger to it. Her 2019 debut album, Open Book, documents the worst year of her life: her older sister\u2019s fatal heroin overdose; a cheating boyfriend; an eating disorder relapse. \u201cI\u2019ve never been worse, thanks for asking,\u201d Shorr sings on the album\u2019s opening line. \u201cIs it making you nervous, all this honesty?\u201d Her poignant bleakness and acid wit (the latter honed at stand-up nights between gigs) did spook the famously conservative country industry. \u201cThey\u2019re terrified to take a chance on something they don\u2019t understand,\u201d says Shorr. So she self-released the album, a gloves-off evolution of Taylor Swift\u2019s Nashville years. It made the New York Times\u2019 best albums of 2019. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2020/mar/25/the-guide-staying-in-sign-up-for-our-home-entertainment-tips\">The Guide: Staying In  \u2013 sign up for our home entertainment tips</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shorr is more strategic and resourceful than that chaotic exterior.

      "bodyText": "Had everything gone to plan, Kalie Shorr would have just wrapped her first UK tour. Instead, the 25-year-old country songwriter is stuck in Nashville, diagnosed with coronavirus and fighting trolls who accused her of faking it for publicity. It\u2019s the longest she\u2019s spent at home since music became her full-time gig seven years ago. She has been writing songs with her two housemates but, otherwise, lockdown has been an exercise in getting comfortable with her own company. \u201cI am very extroverted and thrive on chaos,\u201d she says with a guilty laugh. Shorr is no stranger to it. Her 2019 debut album, Open Book, documents the worst year of her life: her older sister\u2019s fatal heroin overdose; a cheating boyfriend; an eating disorder relapse. \u201cI\u2019ve never been worse, thanks for asking,\u201d Shorr sings on the album\u2019s opening line. \u201cIs it making you nervous, all this honesty?\u201d Her poignant bleakness and acid wit (the latter honed at stand-up nights between gigs) did spook the famously conservative country industry. \u201cThey\u2019re terrified to take a chance on something they don\u2019t understand,\u201d says Shorr. So she self-released the album, a gloves-off evolution of Taylor Swift\u2019s Nashville years. It made the New York Times\u2019 best albums of 2019. Shorr is more strategic and resourceful than that chaotic exterior. Age 11, she told her dad she wanted to sign a publishing deal one day: \u201cHe was like, you wanna write a book?\u201d The pre-teen Shorr avidly read CD liner notes, researching the songwriters whose names appeared alongside those of the Dixie Chicks and Faith Hill. \u201cFrom there I fell down a songwriting rabbit hole.\u201d Shorr grew up \u201chonestly, just poor\u201d in Maine, shuttling between her divorced parents.

      "body": "<p>Almost 5m British households have signed up to streaming services since the coronavirus lockdown began, as the nation turns to Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ to alleviate the impact of the restrictions.</p> <p>There have been an estimated 4.6m new signups to subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) offerings since much of normal British life ground to a halt in late March, according to research.</p> <p>The lockdown has provided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/09/disney-netflix-rival-doubles-subscriptions-in-virus-lockdown\">the perfect launch conditions for Disney+</a>, which debuted in the UK on 24 March, a day after Boris Johnson ordered the nation to stay at home.</p> <p>Disney+, which launched with titles including the $100m (\u00a382m) live-action Star Wars series The Mandalorian, is estimated to have attracted 1.6 million subscribers in the UK in its first month. The research found that 85% of the Disney+ subscribers say they will keep using the service after the health crisis is over.</p> <p>\u201cWith a further 13% of people who have not yet tried Disney+ expressing an interest in trying it, the device could be well past 2 million subscribers in the near future,\u201d says the report by Oliver and Ohlbaum Associates.</p> <p>The survey found that a quarter of people were more willing to consider subscribing to a streaming service during lockdown than before the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThe appetite for fresh entertainment during lockdown when content from traditional channels has been exhausted, along with increased demand for TV content at all times of the day, is contributing to consumers re-evaluating SVOD services,\u201d the report\u2019s authors conclude.</p> <p>Streaming services are also attractive in their low cost and flexibility.

      "bodyText": "Almost 5m British households have signed up to streaming services since the coronavirus lockdown began, as the nation turns to Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ to alleviate the impact of the restrictions. There have been an estimated 4.6m new signups to subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) offerings since much of normal British life ground to a halt in late March, according to research. The lockdown has provided the perfect launch conditions for Disney+, which debuted in the UK on 24 March, a day after Boris Johnson ordered the nation to stay at home. Disney+, which launched with titles including the $100m (\u00a382m) live-action Star Wars series The Mandalorian, is estimated to have attracted 1.6 million subscribers in the UK in its first month. The research found that 85% of the Disney+ subscribers say they will keep using the service after the health crisis is over. \u201cWith a further 13% of people who have not yet tried Disney+ expressing an interest in trying it, the device could be well past 2 million subscribers in the near future,\u201d says the report by Oliver and Ohlbaum Associates. The survey found that a quarter of people were more willing to consider subscribing to a streaming service during lockdown than before the crisis. \u201cThe appetite for fresh entertainment during lockdown when content from traditional channels has been exhausted, along with increased demand for TV content at all times of the day, is contributing to consumers re-evaluating SVOD services,\u201d the report\u2019s authors conclude. Streaming services are also attractive in their low cost and flexibility. Subscribers get a one-month free trial and can cancel at any time, unlike most pay-TV packages with longer lock-in periods and much higher costs. \u201cThey provide a potentially cheaper option to traditional pay-TV, something consumers are likely to become increasingly attuned to in the medium to long term,\u201d the reports says. In the UK, Netflix is the market leader with 12.4m subscribers, according to the most recent figures from TV measurement body Barb. Amazon\u2019s Prime Video ranks second with just over 7 million subscribers. Netflix\u2019s first-quarter new global subscriber numbers were more than double its forecast at 15.8 million thanks to the global lockdown. Disney+ has attracted 50 million subscribers worldwide in six months, although many have it free for a year due to distribution deals with telecoms and TV partners. Nevertheless, it took Netflix seven years to reach the same milestone after moving from DVD rental by post to streaming in 2007.

Education unions have reacted angrily to the plan, which would see reception and years 1 and 6 return first, calling it \u201creckless\u201d, and warning that schools have not been given enough time to prepare. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, wrote in the Daily Mail that teachers should be ready to \u201cdo their duty\u201d and cooperate with the government\u2019s plan.

      "bodyText": "State contracts worth over \u00a31bn have been awarded to private companies dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, without offering other firms the chance to bid for the work, the Guardian can reveal. In what amounts to a Covid-19 bonanza for some firms, ministers have suspended the standard rules to enable contracts to be issued \u201cwith extreme urgency\u201d. Under the fast-track rules, private firms have been handed direct contracts to administer Covid-19 tests, provide food parcels and personal protective equipment (PPE), and to run an operations room alongside civil servants. Among the firms benefiting from taxpayer-funded contracts under the emergency powers are the accountants Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst &amp; Young. Laws designed to ensure transparency and value for money in the way public funds are spent usually require government and other state bodies to advertise any new contract over a certain value, and invite several bidders to compete. However, in March, ministers told Whitehall departments, the NHS, local councils and other agencies that if they needed to act fast because of the public health risks posed by the pandemic, they could lawfully sign deals with private firms \u201cwithout competing or advertising the requirement\u201d. Official data analysed by the Guardian shows state bodies have awarded at least 177 contracts worth \u00a31.1bn to commercial firms in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Of those, 115 contracts \u2013 with a total value of just over \u00a31bn \u2013 were awarded under the fast-track rules bypassing competitive tenders. They include two contracts worth more than \u00a3200m, both awarded by Whitehall departments. Daniel Bruce, the chief executive of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International UK, warned the government should not use the crisis like a \u201cblank cheque to get rid of controls around transparency and accountability\u201d. \u201cThe alarming number of contracts seemingly awarded without any competition risks setting a dangerous precedent which may harm the public interest and reduce confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen lucrative deals are awarded with no competitive tender and away from public scrutiny, taxpayer money could easily be wasted on overpriced equipment or substandard services.\u201d The largest contract, worth up to \u00a3234m, was handed by the Department for Education to a French-owned firm, Edenred, to feed more than a million pupils eligible for free school meals. Edenred has since been accused of \u201cwoeful\u201d preparation which caused children to go hungry and humiliated parents. Edenred said the scheme was now largely working well after it was asked to create and launch it within 10 days. The firm added it was \u201caccountable for every penny spent on the scheme and any suggestion that the contract is \u2018lucrative\u2019, being run without due checks and controls is entirely false\u201d. Other big contracts have been awarded without competitive tenders to foreign multinationals, such as the US\u2013owned Brake Brothers and the South African-run BFS Group, both of which have been given contracts worth a combined \u00a3208m by the environment department to deliver food boxes to vulnerable people. Earlier this week, the Guardian revealed that Randox, a healthcare firm which employs the Conservative MP Owen Paterson as a paid consultant, had been given a \u00a3133m contract by the health department to produce Covid-19 testing kits. Randox has declined to say whether Paterson, whom it pays \u00a3100,000 a year, was involved in securing the contract when it was awarded without other firms bidding. For some companies, the new business looks set to transform their fortunes. In Derry, a company that normally makes window blinds is being paid \u00a348m to make face shields for the health service in Northern Ireland. In order to produce 30m pieces of protective equipment, Bloc Blinds has formed a partnership with the Finnish packaging giant Huhtamaki, recruited hundreds of extra workers, repurposed its existing factory and turned a sports centre into a second workshop. Northern Ireland has spent more than \u00a3160m buying protective equipment for health and social care staff. A spokesperson for the Department of Health in Belfast said prices had been \u201cbenchmarked against other prices being offered in the marketplace\u201d. A Hertfordshire firm, Computacenter, has a \u00a360m contract for the education department to provide laptops to teachers and disadvantaged children during the lockdown. The education department has said there was not enough time to advertise and sift through competitive bids. The health department awarded a deal valued at \u00a38m to Amazon, which is helping deliver home test kits through the post. However, a spokesman for the US retail giant said it had waived any fee and was covering the costs itself. Smaller contracts have been given to private firms tasked with building mortuaries, developing the NHS contact-tracing app and housing the homeless. A cruise ship firm, Noble Caledonia, was paid \u00a31.5m to bring 118 people back from Antarctica without having to go through the Falkland Islands. In Northern Ireland, Ernst &amp; Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers were hired without competition to help set up an operations room within the Executive Office to manage the response to the pandemic. The firms declined to comment. The UK government also spent nearly \u00a320m snapping up stocks of HIV drugs and malaria drugs when it was considered they might be useful in the fight against the coronavirus. The Guardian\u2019s research was based on public databases in the UK and the EU, and aided by information gathered by the research organisation Tussell, which said it had noticed a surge in work awarded without competition in recent weeks. \u201cSince the start of the Covid crisis we\u2019ve seen a spike in non-competed direct awards as public bodies rush to purchase the products and services they urgently need,\u201d said Gus Tugendhat, its founder. The contracts reviewed by the Guardian and Tussell may only constitute a portion of those awarded without a competitive tender for Covid-19 work. The government is declining to release a full list, despite guidelines which state any contract awarded using emergency powers should be published within 30 days. Contracts not yet published include some of the key elements of the government\u2019s pandemic response. Management consultants at Deloitte, the outsourcing firms G4S, Sodexo, Serco and Mitie, Boots the chemists, and the tech companies Palantir and Faculty have been running test centres and creating a Covid-19 data store since March. Deloitte declined to reveal the terms of its contract, which involves advice on purchasing PPE and logistical work around a network of 50 drive-in testing centres. A spokesperson for Boots said it was only being reimbursed for costs and this \u201chas not been in any way a commercial activity\u201d. Sodexo said its contract was signed in March. Normally public bodies can take months to award contracts. To speed up contracting, the government has invoked a clause in the Public Contract Regulations 2015. Responding on behalf of all ministries, a spokesperson for the department of health said it had \u201cdrawn on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners to support our NHS and social care sector. This is completely in line with procurement regulations for exceptional circumstances, where being able to procure at speed has been critical in the national response to Covid-19.\u201d The spokesperson added: \u201cWe have been clear from the outset that public authorities must achieve value for taxpayers and use good commercial judgment, and publication of contract information is being carried out as quickly as possible in line with government transparency guidelines.\u201d",

Judged by this&nbsp;yardstick, the UK was last in recession in 2008-09, when there were&nbsp;six consecutive quarters of negative growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Some economists believe this definition of recession is flawed, since an economy would not be in recession if it contracted by 5% in the first quarter, expanded by 0.1% in each of the following two quarters and then contracted again by 5% in the fourth quarter.

      "body": "<p>The first bond I formed with a hairdresser was when I was 14. After a few weeks of selling sweets in school and peering through barber-shop windows, I found Neil. I liked his outfit and The Style Council was playing through the speakers. I almost fell asleep while he shampooed my hair. We chatted amiably. It all felt nice and calming, even empowering. Neil almost seemed like a mentor.<strong> </strong> He cut my hair once a month from then until I went to university, and the hairdresser\u2019s became a place I would visit to guarantee a boost to my mood.</p> <p>Now in lockdown, I\u2019ve embraced the shapeless mass of hair on my head. What I\u2019ve realised is I don\u2019t actually miss getting my hair cut \u2013 I just miss the experience of being at the hairdresser\u2019s.</p> <p>Over my life I\u2019ve only had three regular hairdressers \u2013 one for each place I\u2019ve lived. My second was at university where after half a dozen one-cut stands, I found Rik. He wasn\u2019t much like Neil, who\u2019d crack jokes and tell me about mod culture and fashion; he was tame and philosophical. Style wasn\u2019t ever mentioned \u2013 he was a barber, not a salon stylist. As the appointments hit double figures, he asked why I always looked half asleep in the chair. I began to open up to him a little about my fatigue, having suffered with a mix of anxiety, insomnia and depression throughout university. For another two years, we both spoke openly about our problems (without oversharing they\u2019re hairdressers not therapists).

      "bodyText": "The first bond I formed with a hairdresser was when I was 14. After a few weeks of selling sweets in school and peering through barber-shop windows, I found Neil. I liked his outfit and The Style Council was playing through the speakers. I almost fell asleep while he shampooed my hair. We chatted amiably. It all felt nice and calming, even empowering. Neil almost seemed like a mentor. He cut my hair once a month from then until I went to university, and the hairdresser\u2019s became a place I would visit to guarantee a boost to my mood. Now in lockdown, I\u2019ve embraced the shapeless mass of hair on my head. What I\u2019ve realised is I don\u2019t actually miss getting my hair cut \u2013 I just miss the experience of being at the hairdresser\u2019s. Over my life I\u2019ve only had three regular hairdressers \u2013 one for each place I\u2019ve lived. My second was at university where after half a dozen one-cut stands, I found Rik. He wasn\u2019t much like Neil, who\u2019d crack jokes and tell me about mod culture and fashion; he was tame and philosophical. Style wasn\u2019t ever mentioned \u2013 he was a barber, not a salon stylist. As the appointments hit double figures, he asked why I always looked half asleep in the chair. I began to open up to him a little about my fatigue, having suffered with a mix of anxiety, insomnia and depression throughout university. For another two years, we both spoke openly about our problems (without oversharing they\u2019re hairdressers not therapists). When I graduated, leaving him was one of the hardest goodbyes I made. Next, I moved to London and found a salon I liked the look of, bouncing between whoever was free, feeling almost satisfied each time. One day a new person called Mikey was available. I checked his Instagram (essential research) and liked his grid and his fashion sense. I booked in for the same day.

I also miss the precise dexterity of a stylist with their comb, the crisp snip of a well-oiled scissor, the smooth metallic buzz of a barber\u2019s clippers.

      "bodyText": "Transport for London is to raise the congestion charge by 30%, temporarily stop free travel for children and charge over-60s to travel at peak times after securing a \u00a31.6bn bailout from the government. TfL was forced to turn to the government after reporting a 90% fall in income as journeys on public transport in London have dried up during the nationwide lockdown. The capital\u2019s congestion charge of \u00a311.50 will be reimposed from Monday, as will the separate \u00a312.50 charge imposed on older and dirtier vehicles entering central London. They had been lifted during lockdown. The congestion charge will then rise to \u00a315 from 22 June, with enforcement extended from weekdays to the whole week and for longer hours.

A spokesman for the Mayor of London said that the government and Khan agreed that the charge should be reviewed, but that it was the mayor\u2019s decision to increase it. The mayor urged Londoners to work from home and spend more of their leisure time in their local areas. Although using public transport should be a last resort, Khan added, journeys should not be replaced by cars \u201cbecause our roads would immediately become unusably blocked and toxic air pollution would soar\u201d. He said two key Thames crossings \u2013 Waterloo and London bridges \u2013 may be restricted to people walking, cycling and buses only. Some streets will also be designated for walkers and cyclists only. Deliveries may have to be made overnight. TfL said it was facing a \u00a33bn finance gap this year owing to fare revenue lost during the coronavirus pandemic, suggesting it may still need more cash from the government as the agreed bail out will only keep the organisation going until October. TfL said a financial forecast, assuming the prioritisation of essential services and activities, predicted a \u00a31.9bn funding gap in the six months to the end of October that would widen to \u00a33bn in the full-year to the end of March 2021.

On Thursday, the transport minister, Grant Shapps, said passengers would eventually need to pay higher fares to help finance TfL. He said the government did not want a situation whereby people outside London were \u201cunfairly carrying the burden, by which I mean, sadly, fares do end having to rise with inflation\u201d. During negotiations Khan had warned that he might have to cut tube and bus services unless the government stepped in with a grant, after the capital\u2019s transport authority burned through \u00a31bn of its cash buffers. Last month, bus companies in England received a \u00a3400m bailout to ensure that services needed by frontline workers such as NHS staff can keep running. As part of the rescue deal, the government will provide \u00a3167m over three months, as well as guaranteeing to honour a further \u00a3200m of planned investments that would otherwise have been at risk.

A professor of infectious diseases, Garner was discussing the new coronavirus with David Nabarro, the UK\u2019s special envoy on the pandemic.

      "bodyText": "Ten million people in the UK risk being locked out of the Covid-19 contact-tracing app because of a \u201cdigital divide\u201d, putting potential constraints on their ability to access work and safeguard their health, a parliamentary committee has heard. Almost 2m households in the UK do not have any internet access, Helen Milner, the chief executive of Good Things Foundation, a digital inclusion charity, told the culture, media and sport committee. A further 7 million people \u201chave used the net, but have very basic skills, like not knowing how to open an app\u201d. Those people risk being shut out of attempts to build a smartphone-based contact-tracing app, unless the government urgently funds way to bridge the gap with digital training and support, said Liz Williams, the chief executive of FutureDotNow, which is running a campaign to get devices to the country\u2019s most vulnerable. Milner said many of those lacking digital skills were also more vulnerable for other reasons. \u201cSixty-four per cent of the people who have never used the internet are over 65,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just older people: of the 7 million who have used the net but have very, very basic skills \u2013 like not knowing how to open an app \u2013 63% of them are under 65.\u201d Many of those younger people were members of other vulnerable groups dealing with disparities in educational achievement, disabilities, and including non-native English speakers and refugees, Milner said. Missing out on the contact-tracing app had the potential to exacerbate those problems, Williams warned. \u201cMy concern is it has the potential to add to social divides and employment outcomes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be easy to imagine a scenario where employers require it to access work.\u201d Refurbished devices, one of the more effective ways of closing the divide, also had less success because older devices may not run the contact-tracing app, Williams said. \u201cIt underlines why it is so important to have a 100% digitally included nation,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have got over 8,000 people on a waiting list and our inbox is jam-packed with other organisations asking for help. \u201cIf we had the resources, we could get to 10,000 people in a matter of days, and 100,000 people relatively quickly.\u201d The NHS Covid-19 contact-tracing app data ethics board, which advises the government on the various issues surrounding the app, has similar concerns, warning that the app \u201cshould not give exclusive access to services or freedoms\u201d. \u201cIf the app becomes a tool for accessing currently restricted services or freedoms, such as permission to return to work, to use public transport, or to enjoy other freedoms, this would drastically alter the value proposition of the app and potentially introduce new levels of inequity which would need to be identified and addressed,\u201d Jonathan Montgomery, the chair of the board, wrote in a letter to Matt Hancock on 24 April, which was released on Wednesday.",

The more people you see, the greater the chance of (spreading) the coronavirus.\u201d The RIVM also has advice for those in a relationship with someone infected by coronavirus or in quarantine with suspected symptoms of the disease. \u201cDon\u2019t have sex with your partner if they have been isolated because of (suspected) coronavirus infection,\u201d the RIVM says. \u201cSex with yourself or with others at a distance is possible (think of telling erotic stories, masturbating together).\u201d In the UK, the government warned at the start of its lockdown that couples who do not cohabit must either not meet at all, or else rapidly move in together. Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, told reporters that dating couples \u201cshould test the strength of their relationship and decide whether one wishes to be permanently resident in another household\u201d. The Dutch institute\u2019s change of mind on the fate of singletons follows the expression of immense frustration in some quarters at the rules for single people. In an opinion piece written in the Het Parool newspaper, Linda Duits, a journalist specialising in gender issues, squarely criticised the RIVM, arguing that sex was a human right. \u201cProximity and physical contact are not a luxury, they are basic needs,\u201d Duits wrote. \u201cIf we have learned anything from the Aids epidemic, it is that not having sex is not an option.\u201d The Dutch government has been easing its lockdown in recent weeks. Hairdressers, nail salons and beauty parlours started work again on Monday and restaurants, bars and cinemas are due to reopen on 1 June. The measures come after evidence the spread of the coronavirus in the Netherlands has been controlled, although a further 35 people were hospitalised in the last 24 hours with 53 deaths and another 200 tested positive for the virus, bringing the total to 43,681.",

The revision to Q4 means that the economy entered a technical recession at the start of the year, and this <em>before</em> the incoming collapse in Q2 activity. </p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Q2 will be orders of magnitudes worse, though we suspect the German economy will continue to \u201coutperform\u201d its EZ peers. In addition, employment was hardly affected by the Covid-19 epidemic in Q1, <em>rising</em> by 0.3% year-over-year in Q1. This is consistent with the fact that the labour market is a lagging indicator.</p> <p>But it also reflects the fact that the jump in the use of the short-time work scheme, <em>Kurzarbeit</em>, means that workers remain employed, even if they are, strictly speaking, furloughed. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jack Allen-Reynolds</strong>, senior Europe economist at <strong>Capital Economics</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The release] confirms that the government\u2019s less stringent virus containment measures mean that the economy is not faring as badly as the other major euro-zone countries. That said, the crisis is still taking a heavy toll. <br></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For comparison, the declines in GDP in France and Italy were much deeper, at 5.8% and 4.7% respectively. This will have been partly because strict social distancing measures were not introduced in Germany until 22nd March, compared to 10th March in Italy for example. But the lockdown was also less stringent, which allowed the construction sector, for example, to record an expansion of 1.8% m/m in March. That compares to a 40.2% m/m drop in construction in France.</p> <p>Further ahead, we have pencilled in a much bigger decline in German GDP in Q2 of about 10% q/q.

      "bodyText": "Almost anyone in any country around the world could tell you that economies are in recession: the question is, how deep? For Germany the technical marker of recession - two consecutive quarters of declining growth - came earlier than expected, with the news that the fourth quarter of 2019 saw output fall, before the steep decline seen in the first three months of 2020 and the deeper losses expected in the current quarter. However, while steep, Germany\u2019s downturn has so far been less severe than France and Italy, and only slightly worse than the UK\u2019s (subject to the big revisions that are likely because of the difficulties of collecting data). Overall the eurozone economy shrank by 3.8% in the quarter. Here are some of the other important business and economics developments from throughout the day: US retail sales fell in April at the fastest rate ever seen as lockdowns prevented consumers from spending. Brexit news is here again: the latest round of negotiations ended with no progress and fighting talk from the EU and the UK, with time running out on agreeing a trade deal or transition extension to avert an abrupt move to World Trade Organisation trade terms at the end of the year. The number of companies or countries at risk of having their credit ratings cut to junk from investment grade has been pushed to a record high of 111 by the coronavirus pandemic, according to research by S&amp;P global ratings research. Royal Mail shares jumped 8% after the postal service announced the shock departure of boss Rico Back. Royal Mail will pay \u00a350,000 towards unexplained legal fees for his departure. Transport for London is to raise the congestion charge by 30%, temporarily stop free travel for children and charge over-60s to travel at peak times as part of a deal to secure a \u00a31.6bn bailout from the government.

The carrier, which is still looking for a bailout after announcing 3,000 job cuts, has had interest from a dozen private investors, according to a source cited by Reuters. The airline is also reportedly looking to defer orders for six Airbus A350 aircraft and 14 A330 Neo planes. Wall Street stocks have dropped at the opening bell. Here are the opening moves: S&amp;P 500 DOWN 27.40 POINTS, OR 0.96%, AT 2,825.10 DOW JONES DOWN 210.67 POINTS, OR 0.89%, AT 23,414.67 NASDAQ DOWN 102.53 POINTS, OR 1.15%, AT 8,841.19 More bad (if expected) news on the US economy: industrial output fell 11.2% in April compared to March. That was a slightly smaller fall than expected by economists, but still a marked hit to a large part of the US economy. Manufacturing output fell by 13.7% as car production slumped from 7.18m units in March to only 180,000 in April. Some updates on the embattled aviation sector. First up, Ethiopian Airlines, whose Boeing 737 Max crashed fatally in March 2019, expects compensation talks with the US manufacturer to finish by the end of June. The crash was the second in the space of a few months, and triggered the worldwide grounding of the 737 Max after a sensor fault was identified. Reuters reported that Ethiopian Airlines boss Tewolde Gebremariam said the airline is asking Boeing to compensate it for the accident\u2019s \u201cimpact on the brand\u201d. He also said: We have invited Boeing to discuss compensation. It\u2019s compensation for the grounded Max... there is also compensation for delayed delivery of the Max that was supposed to come and loss of revenue. By the end of June, which is the end of our fiscal year, we should have something... meaning compensation. The 737 Max grounding was then of course followed by an almost global freeze on passenger flights, putting airlines all over the world at risk of collapse. Germany\u2019s Lufthansa is looking for state aid for its various airlines in their home countries, including Belgium\u2019s Brussels Airlines. The Belgian government said on Friday it had told Lufthansa it could only invest in its Belgian subsidiary Brussels Airlines if certain conditions were met, according to a joint statement with Lufthansa. That included the prospect of the business returning to profitability. US stock market futures have taken a tumble ahead of the opening bell on Wall Street today - and they were not helped by the worse than expected US retail sales. The S&amp;P 500, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq are all set for declines of about 1%. Economists had expected a 12% decline in US retail sales, so a huge fall was priced in. However, the fact that it was so far off estimates shows the extent of the turmoil in the US economy. The data also show a big redistribution of spending underlying the overall decline. Retail trade sales were down 17.8% on last year, with clothing shops down 89.3% - a wipeout. Yet non-store retailers - including online giants such as Amazon - were up 21.6% from last year. US retail sales plunged by 16.4% in April compared to March as lockdown restrictions bit, according to the US Census Bureau - the fastest rate on record. Barnier is still talking. Via Reuters, he has said that an agreement is still possible but that the EU is ready for \u201cno deal\u201d and will be stepping up preparations. Before the pandemic a no-deal end to the Brexit transition period was seen as one of the biggest risks to their prospects by many British businesses. It would mean that trade between the UK and the EU would default to World Trade Organisation terms - which could mean an overnight imposition of tariffs on all manner of goods and complex disruptions to services. However, in the light of the coronavirus pandemic, some analysts are speculating that it would be difficult to identify precisely the effect of WTO trade, making it more politically palatable. Sterling has fallen by 0.6% today against the US dollar, hitting its lowest level since 27 March, with traders blaming the Brexit impasse. One pound bought you $1.2155 at its lowest. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has added his tuppence, following his counterpart, and it\u2019s fiery stuff: We will not bargain away our values for the benefit of the British economy. Here are the key points from him so far: The trade talks were disappointing, after the UK refused to engage on discussing a level playing field [promises to uphold common standards on the environment, health and workers\u2019 rights so UK businesses don\u2019t get an unfair advantage]. There will be no deal without this agreement. The UK will have to be more realistic if it wants a deal. The UK cannot pick and choose the best aspects of the EU without meeting obligations that members must meet. The next round of negotiations must bring new dynamism to avoid a stalemate. Remember, the UK officially has until the end of June to either ask for an extension of the Brexit transition or else decide to end the transition period without a trade deal in December (or agree some kind of fudge). Some of the earlier enthusiasm among European investors has tailed off, with market gains diminishing. Some indices are now in the red: FTSE 100: +0.6% at 5,775 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.7% at 10,412 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 4,267 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.1% at 16,846 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.7% at 6,502 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 328 US futures are down, indicating a drop of roughly 1% for the Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq when Wall Street opens. A revival of fears over the US-China trade wars adds to concerns about the impact of the coronavirus crisis. Brexit.. remember that? Round 3 of negotiations with the EU have ended with \u201cvery little progress\u201d towards an agreement according to David Frost, the UK\u2019s chief negotiator. According to Reuters, he said the major obstacle proved to be the EU\u2019s insistence on including a set of novel and unbalanced proposals on the so-called \u201clevel playing field\u201d. Frost said \u201cwe very much need a change in approach for the next round of talks beginning on 1 June.\u201d The UK intends to make public all the UK draft legal texts next week so that the EU\u2019s member states and \u201cinterested observers\u201d can see the UK\u2019s approach. The eurozone economy will shrink by 8.1% this year, before bouncing back with 6.5% growth in 2021, according to forecasts from economists at HSBC. They expect policymakers at the European Central Bank, led by Christine Lagarde, to extend its emergency Covid-19 package by \u20ac500bn at their 4 June meeting. In March, the ECB announced a \u20ac750bn asset purchase programme (known as PEPP), targeting both public- and private-sector assets. Simon Wells, chief European economist at HSBC, says: In the face of ballooning public finance deficits and the ever-present threat of market pressure on fiscally-weaker countries, the ECB remains the main game in town for preventing debt crises that could threaten the stability of the euro. At the ECB\u2019s recent purchase rate, it will have exhausted the \u20ac750bn PEPP by end-September. Significant PEPP expansion could help allay market concerns for now, even if it isn\u2019t a lasting solution. Although we now expect a slower rebound [in eurozone growth in 2021], it is still very swift by historical standards. This reflects the unusual composition of the recession. Typically, household spending holds up relative to investment through a slump as firms slash capex. This time, we expect a double-digit drop in consumption and a sharp spike in savings. But as lockdowns are eased, consumer spending could rise rapidly - provided the furloughing measures, fiscal cushions and central bank lending schemes work. Investors have welcomed the news that Rico Back is no longer running Royal Mail, with shares up 8% this morning at 175p. The company said he was leaving immediately, less than two years after being appointed chief executive, as it announced a \u00a322m drop in revenues in April, mainly due to a sharp drop in letter volumes which were down by a third. Russ Mould, AJ Bell\u2019s investment director, gives his take on the news: The middle of a global crisis feels like an odd time to part ways with a CEO, particularly one who has been in post for as short a time as Royal Mail\u2019s Rico Back. With his P45 delivered, Back is being given more time to enjoy the Swiss penthouse from which he has reportedly been running the company. The best hint at the reasons behind his departure is the company\u2019s statement that interim executive chair Keith Williams will lead discussions on \u2018an accelerated pace of change across the business\u2019. Royal Mail\u2019s board will need to move fast to appoint a successor given the big challenges facing the business and the market will want to hear more as promised when full year results are posted on 25 June. The bonus to be paid to frontline staff and withdrawal of incentives for the executive team may go some way to mending fences with a disgruntled workforce. Read our full story here: Other UK companies at risk of falling into S&amp;P\u2019s \u201cfallen angel\u201d category (when a debt issuer\u2019s rating is cut to junk from investment grade) this year include: Next British Airways ITV Ashtead Kingfisher Virgin Money Commenting on the trend globally, S&amp;P said: The financials sector led the additions to the potential fallen angels list [for 2020], highlighting the challenges the sector is facing. However, we see the highest downgrade potential in the lodging and leisure and auto sectors, which have the greatest number of potential fallen angels that have ratings on CreditWatch negative. In other news, the number of companies or countries at risk of having their credit ratings cut to junk from investment grade has been pushed to a record high of 111 by the coronavirus pandemic, according to research by S&amp;P global ratings research. The number of so-called \u2018fallen angels\u2019 has so far this year reached 24, with more than $300bn in rated debt, S&amp;P estimates. The 111 potential fallen angels have another $444 billion of bonds, suggesting the amount is likely to spiral further. Sudeep Kesh, head of S&amp;P global credit markets research explains the significance: Potential fallen angels are significant because the loss of investment-grade ratings typically carries both higher capital costs and sometimes the need to revise contracts with bondholders to protect investors - further adding to capital costs - or worse, could lead to the sale of the bonds in favour of more creditworthy companies. Companies that have fallen into this category already this year include financial institutions, utilities, and one each in aerospace and defence, consumer products, media and entertainment, metals and mining, property, and transport. Of the 24 companies to have reached \u201cfallen angel\u201d status so far this year, higher street retailer Marks &amp; Spencer is the only one from the UK. Others include France\u2019s Renault, and several in the US including Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ford, Delta Air Lines, Macy\u2019s and Kraft Heinz. Unlike Germany, the eurozone as a whole is not yet in recession. The good news ends there. It is the steepest quarterly downturn since before the euro was created, and since comparable data was first collected in 1995, according to Eurostat, the European commission\u2019s statistics office. It was a 3.3% decline across the whole EU, which also includes countries such as Sweden and Finland, which were not as badly hit - potentially because of less severe lockdowns. The UK\u2019s GDP dropped by 2% in the quarter, less than countries that locked down earlier such as Italy and France, which suffered quarterly GDP declines of 4.7% and 5.8% respectively. Eruzone GDP fell by 3.8% quarter-on-quarter in the euro zone in the first quarter of 2020, according to a flash estimate from the EU\u2019s statistics agency released on Friday. Germany is in recession, and worse is coming, said Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics: The German economy has been tip-toeing on the edge of recession since the beginning of 2019, but it can hide no longer. The revision to Q4 means that the economy entered a technical recession at the start of the year, and this before the incoming collapse in Q2 activity. Q2 will be orders of magnitudes worse, though we suspect the German economy will continue to \u201coutperform\u201d its EZ peers. In addition, employment was hardly affected by the Covid-19 epidemic in Q1, rising by 0.3% year-over-year in Q1. This is consistent with the fact that the labour market is a lagging indicator. But it also reflects the fact that the jump in the use of the short-time work scheme, Kurzarbeit, means that workers remain employed, even if they are, strictly speaking, furloughed. Jack Allen-Reynolds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics, said: [The release] confirms that the government\u2019s less stringent virus containment measures mean that the economy is not faring as badly as the other major euro-zone countries. That said, the crisis is still taking a heavy toll. For comparison, the declines in GDP in France and Italy were much deeper, at 5.8% and 4.7% respectively. This will have been partly because strict social distancing measures were not introduced in Germany until 22nd March, compared to 10th March in Italy for example. But the lockdown was also less stringent, which allowed the construction sector, for example, to record an expansion of 1.8% m/m in March. That compares to a 40.2% m/m drop in construction in France. Further ahead, we have pencilled in a much bigger decline in German GDP in Q2 of about 10% q/q. The lockdown is being eased in May and June, but only gradually, and Germany\u2019s recovery will be constrained by the problems elsewhere in Europe. German GDP in the first quarter was 2.3% lower than the same quarter in 2019, also the biggest annual drop since the financial crisis. It was a 7.9% year-on-year drop then, which is widely expected to be beaten in the second quarter. Household spending fell sharply, investment in machinery fell, but government spending held up, following patterns elsewhere. Exports and imports both fell, reflecting the global decrease in international trade. However, the data have not moved the euro very much: it is up by less than 0.1% against the US dollar at $1.0813. The German economy had already flirted with recession over the past few years, with the manufacturing industry in particular seeing declining output. However, the coronavirus pandemic has tipped it over the edge, with two consecutive quarters of falling GDP - the technical definition for a recession. The German federal statistics office has revised down its reading for the fourth quarter of 2019 to -0.1% - which means the German economy is already in recession. The report from Germany\u2019s federal statistics office shows how brutal the hit was: only in the second quarter of 2009 has growth been lower for the country since unification. And the office warned that it was only really in March that the coronavirus pandemic hit, meaning there is likely much worse to come in the second quarter: The corona pandemic hits the German economy hard. Although the spread of the coronavirus did not have a major effect on the economic performance in January and February, the impact of the pandemic is serious for the 1st quarter of 2020. [...] That was the largest decrease since the global financial and economic crisis of 2008/2009 and the second largest decrease since German unification. A larger quarter-on-quarter decline was recorded only for the 1st quarter of 2009 (-4.7%). Germany\u2019s economic output shrank by 2.2% in the first three months of the year, according to the German statistics agency, the largest quarterly decrease since the financial crisis. More details shortly. Royal Mail chief executive Rico Back has stepped down with immediate effect, it announced on Friday morning. Back will receive salary and benefits until 15 August, plus another \u00a3480,000, representing nine months\u2019 pay in lieu of notice. He also received \u00a350,000 towards \u201clegal fees incurred in connection with his departure\u201d. Royal Mail did not give a reason for him leaving. Keith Williams becomes interim executive chair of Royal Mail Group and Stuart Simpson becomes interim chief executive of Royal Mail (UKPIL), its main parcels and letters business. No bonuses will be paid to executive directors for 2019-20, and \u00a325m has been set aside for cash awards for frontline staff \u201cin recognition of their role during Covid-19\u201d. Revenues were down by \u00a322m year-on-year in April, Royal Mail said, with letter volumes down by 33%. High levels of absence during the pandemic have contributed to \u00a340m in new UK costs. Back\u2019s resignation comes after a tumultuous time at Royal Mail, with fraught and sometimes furious negotiations with unions over strike action and struggles in its core business - before the coronavirus pandemic hit. Back also faced stinging criticism for his pay packet, with nearly three-quarters of investors refusing to support the remuneration package handed to him in 2018. The postal service handed Back an annual deal worth up to \u00a32.7m if he hit bonus targets, on top of a \u00a36m \u201cgolden hello\u201d for leaving the company\u2019s European subsidiary. Oil prices have risen as investors look for tentative signs of emerging demand for fuel. Brent crude futures prices, the international benchmark, have risen by 3.4% today to a high of $32.44 per barrel. After the astonishing market moves of last month - that briefly saw US crude futures prices fall far below zero - a 3.4% gain barely seems noteworthy. But the rebound in oil prices does tell us that traders are starting to see green shoots of economic recovery - the same story that appears to be helping stock markets. While still low by historic standards (indeed, low by the standards of January - see chart), it nevertheless represents a doubling of prices from Brent\u2019s fall to below $16 per barrel during last month\u2019s turmoil. Reuters reports: Data released on Friday showed China\u2019s daily crude oil use rebounded in April as refineries ramped up operations. The market mood remains less than euphoric, though, with the coronavirus pandemic far from over and new clusters emerging in some countries where lockdowns have been eased. \u201cMarket forces have aligned producers around the world to support fundamentals, and demand is increasingly showing signs of having troughed,\u201d Barclays analyst Amarpreet Singh said in a note. \u201cHowever, the sheer size and speed of the disruption and associated inventory overhang will take time to get fully absorbed, in our view,\u201d he said. Betting giant William Hill has put out an update on its results in the year to 28 April, highlighting the massive fall off in revenues as lockdown hit. The bookmaker\u2019s revenues slumped 57% year-on-year after 11 March, with sports betting down 83% in its retail branches. However, it only fell by 56% online as gamblers turned to more esoteric interests in search of entertainment: \u201ctable tennis and emerging market football\u201d. Online gaming revenues also increased during the period. You can read more on the unusual gambling patterns during lockdown here, including an increase among regular gamblers: The company said it has delayed recruitment, cancelled salary increases and all bonus payments and incentive schemes for 2020, furloughed employees and used government support schemes, including business rates relief. It has also suspended its dividend, cancelled spending plans and cut marketing costs. But it has access to \u00a3700m in ready cash or equivalents - with the monthly cash outflow limited to only \u00a315m (even if costs will rise as the UK\u2019s furlough scheme tapers away). The FTSE 100 has gained 1.4% in the opening minutes of trading, while the FTSE 250 is up 1.3%. Across Europe stocks are also looking positive, with France\u2019s Cac 40 up 1% and Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.8%. The Dax in Germany has posted a 1.6% gain - let\u2019s see if that holds. And all this a few hours after the US president raised the possibility of cutting off relations with China completely... Transport for London has this morning said that it is facing a \u00a33bn hole in its finances this year due to the impact of the coronavirus, meaning further help government help may be necessary for the authority. TfL, which on Thursday agreed a \u00a31.6bn bailout from the government to keep the business running until October, has seen a 90% fall in income as journeys on London\u2019s buses and underground have dried up during the nationwide lockdown. TfL said that a financial forecast, assuming the prioritisation of essential services and activities, will see a \u00a31.9bn funding gap in its first half year to the end of October. For the full year to the end of March 2021 that gap is forecast to be \u00a33bn. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics, and financial markets. We know it\u2019s bad, but just how bad? That is the question facing economists and markets this morning as they await German and Eurozone GDP data as well as the prospect of worsening US-Chinese relations. German GDP data expected at 9am BST (unusually) will fill in the final piece of the puzzle for just how badly the eurozone was hit in the first three months of the year. Reuters\u2019 poll of economists shows an average expectation of a 2.2% decline in first-quarter German GDP. And remember, although China was hit hardest in the first quarter, there is much worse to come for Europe in the April-to-June period. Here\u2019s what has happened so far among rich economies (up to Wednesday): Adding to the uncertainty is concern over the trading relationship between the US and China. In an interview published last night President Donald Trump suggested that cutting ties with China would be an option and said that the Chinese failure to contain the disease had affected the trade deal between the two countries. Here are quotes from the Reuters report on the Fox Business Network interview: \u201cThey should have never let this happen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo I make a great trade deal and now I say this doesn\u2019t feel the same to me. The ink was barely dry and the plague came over. And it doesn\u2019t feel the same to me.\u201d Trump also suggested his relationship with Xi had deteriorated. \u201cBut I just \u2013 right now I don\u2019t want to speak to him,\u201d Trump said in the interview, which was taped on Wednesday. [...] \u201cThere are many things we could do. We could do things. We could cut off the whole relationship,\u201d he replied. Yet at the same time the easing of lockdowns around the world (despite the absence of a coronavirus vaccine) has given hopes for the future, giving a mild boost to stock markets in Asia and Europe on Friday morning.

      "bodyText": "Care workers have been warned by a trade union not to use a government app meant to help them during the coronavirus pandemic because it allows their managers to identify staff who have complained about pay, testing and personal protective equipment. Matt Hancock launched a mobile app last week for 1.5 million people in the adult social care workforce which was supposed to distribute policy updates and infection control advice through smartphones. The Care Workforce app promised to help \u201ccare workers get access to guidance, learning resources, discounts and other support all in one place\u201d. But the GMB union has advised members to avoid using the app because it has a webchat function which is insecure, and it gives managers access to what are presumed to be private messages. Documents seen by the Guardian include a claim by one named care worker that an employer had failed to pay the minimum wage. \u201cWas paid yesterday and noticed my wages didn\u2019t go up to the minimum wage on April 1st, I think it\u2019s a disgrace, we\u2019re all working so hard and risking ourselves and our families\u2019 lives coming in contact with the virus and now I\u2019m being underpaid!\u201d Another complained of a lack of PPE, saying it was \u201cwrong that you only get \u00a395 for sick pay when you get infected\u201d. And a third, who was identifiable by their name, said: \u201cIt is ridiculous that staff have to sort out testing ourselves. Our employers should sort it out.\u201d Rehana Azam, GMB\u2019s national secretary, said the app had already exposed many care workers to the possibility of sanctions and urged them not to use it. \u201cExposing users\u2019 personal details on this app in this way is grossly incompetent at best \u2013 but we say it\u2019s a downright betrayal of key workers whichever way you look at it,\u201d she said. \u201cHealth and care workers are terrified of speaking out about the dangerous lack of PPE in case they get reprimanded or sacked by their employer for raising the issue. \u201cNow the government launches an app that slaps their private data all over the place for anyone to see. Bosses can quite easily use it to spy on workers, see what they\u2019re saying and potentially sanction them.\u201d Azam said Hancock was to blame for the \u201cdisaster\u201d. At the app\u2019s launch in March, the health and social care secretary called on all care workers to download the app. \u201cWe have launched a new app specifically for care workers to make sure they have the most up-to-date guidance to keep them safe, connected with their colleagues across the country, which also allows them to access discounts like their NHS counterparts. \u201cIt\u2019s available to download right now, and I would urge everyone in social care to do so,\u201d he said. To register, workers must provide their name, email and region and the postcode of their employer. Optional additional information includes the name of a worker\u2019s employer. According to the union, the app\u2019s webchat function can be searched and discloses personal information about carers. On registering, users are sent an email directly projecting web chat comments by other users, which may be sensitive or revealing, including information about whether carers have been tested for Covid-19. The government said the Care Workforce app was developed by NHSX but it was built on a system operated by Hive Learning Limited, a private firm. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cNo personal data from the Care Workforce app can be or will be used for the distribution of marketing information from private organisations. \u201cA chat function is not available on the app, but a commenting function is included to allow the workforce to network and provide peer support. This is not an anonymous function, and comments are accessible to all users who register to the app as members of the adult social care workforce.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "British theatres are in a state of \u201chigh jeopardy\u201d and some will go bust unless the government comes up with a specific package of help, leading figures in the industry have told the Guardian. Theatres are expected to be among the final organisations to open after the lockdown and, with warnings of physical distancing continuing at least until the end of the year, many fear they will not be able to properly operate until 2021. A shiver went through the sector when Southampton\u2019s Nuffield theatre this month went into administration because of the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus. There will be more Southamptons without more help, regional artistic directors have said. Tom Morris, artistic director at Bristol Old Vic, said: \u201cIf you just look at the numbers, the threat is very vivid. Every theatre has faced a complete cliff edge in terms of its income.\u201d Like other theatres, it is only hanging on because of the government\u2019s furlough scheme. For the \u201cterrifying period\u201d in between that ending and being able to open up properly, the sector needs specific government support, Morris said. \u201cWe do not want to destroy British theatre by accident.\u201d Morris, whose Bristol production of Touching the Void opened in the West End last year, said regional theatre was a vital talent pipeline for the UK\u2019s world-leading creative sector. James Brining, the artistic director of Leeds Playhouse, said theatre was facing an existential threat. \u201cThere is so much uncertainty and that\u2019s our biggest issue \u2013 how do you plan and what will the consequences of different scenarios be?\u201d All theatres are busily modelling scenarios of allowing fewer people into buildings and having physically distanced audiences. The composer Andrew Lloyd Webber has reportedly warned that theatres cannot reopen with physical distancing measures in place in a letter to the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden. Adam Penford, the artistic director of Nottingham Playhouse, said his team had produced 25 different seating plans, none of which made any economic sense. That echoes comments by producer Cameron Mackintosh, who has predicted West End and Broadway theatre will not reopen until next year. \u201cThe truth is until social distancing doesn\u2019t exist any more, we can\u2019t even plan to reopen.\u201d Penford questioned whether audiences would even want to sit in an auditorium with so many empty seats. \u201cIs it the true experience of live theatre?

      "body": "<p>Does anyone know if Boris Johnson knows stuff about classics? Ancient world, that sort of thing? It\u2019s so difficult to tell with a man who wears his learning as lightly as the prime minister does. But we must ask after a distressing \u2013 and distressingly well-sourced \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ed7a217-1462-4fba-9329-880dc76a3793\">report in the Financial Times</a> suggesting that the reason senior Tories want all MPs to return to sitting in parliament like, yesterday, is because they feel their man does better when he\u2019s backed up at the dispatch box by the only set of cheerleaders in the world you wouldn\u2019t want to have sex with (I\u2019m very slightly paraphrasing their comments). Poor prime minister. I believe the same thing happened in the Athenian agora to Socrates, who came across as a stuttering haystack unless he was supported by serried ranks of inadequates screaming \u201cno, YOU are!\u201d at his debating opponents.</p> <p>Anyway, given that Johnson is our Churchill \u2013 the insurance dog version \u2013 perhaps it was inevitable that he would need a few nodding dogs on the frontbench next to him. All governments seek to disguise their own shortcomings, which is also why this one refuses to countenance a Brexit extension despite the vast economic shock of the coronavirus. Far from taking pause, the Conservatives are embracing the timing with the sweaty gratitude of a guy who knows that the unfortunate fire at a storage unit facility will take care of the corpse he\u2019s been storing there.</p> <p>For now, Johnson\u2019s chief danger zone seems to be his weekly encounters with Labour leader Keir Starmer at prime minister\u2019s questions. Like me, you probably don\u2019t watch this show on the regular, but I was stuck with it this Wednesday, having exhausted almost all other forms of TV content during the lockdown. First impressions \u2013 and no spoilers please, if you\u2019re ahead of me on the boxset \u2013 is that the House of Commons now has all the atmosphere of the Emirates, but in a good way. It leaves those at the dispatch box with nowhere to hide, which will reflexively discomfit a prime minister who has never entered a bedroom without first checking if there\u2019s a wardrobe.</p> <p>That said, it\u2019s only right to include the opposing view from the senior No 10 adviser whose judgment was \u201cKeir Starmer is the one who was rattled.\u201d There is, of course, no objective reality, so by all means feel free to get behind this version, where forensic answerer Johnson made light work of the former director of public prosecutions. It does, however, seem more likely that the opposite version is believed by some, given that not one but three Conservative MPs on Thursday shared a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/14/labour-urges-tory-mps-to-admit-keir-starmer-video-was-doctored\">far-right video </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/14/labour-urges-tory-mps-to-admit-keir-starmer-video-was-doctored\">that used fakery to attempt</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/14/labour-urges-tory-mps-to-admit-keir-starmer-video-was-doctored\"> to discredit Starmer</a>.

      "bodyText": "Does anyone know if Boris Johnson knows stuff about classics? Ancient world, that sort of thing? It\u2019s so difficult to tell with a man who wears his learning as lightly as the prime minister does. But we must ask after a distressing \u2013 and distressingly well-sourced \u2013 report in the Financial Times suggesting that the reason senior Tories want all MPs to return to sitting in parliament like, yesterday, is because they feel their man does better when he\u2019s backed up at the dispatch box by the only set of cheerleaders in the world you wouldn\u2019t want to have sex with (I\u2019m very slightly paraphrasing their comments). Poor prime minister. I believe the same thing happened in the Athenian agora to Socrates, who came across as a stuttering haystack unless he was supported by serried ranks of inadequates screaming \u201cno, YOU are!\u201d at his debating opponents. Anyway, given that Johnson is our Churchill \u2013 the insurance dog version \u2013 perhaps it was inevitable that he would need a few nodding dogs on the frontbench next to him. All governments seek to disguise their own shortcomings, which is also why this one refuses to countenance a Brexit extension despite the vast economic shock of the coronavirus. Far from taking pause, the Conservatives are embracing the timing with the sweaty gratitude of a guy who knows that the unfortunate fire at a storage unit facility will take care of the corpse he\u2019s been storing there. For now, Johnson\u2019s chief danger zone seems to be his weekly encounters with Labour leader Keir Starmer at prime minister\u2019s questions. Like me, you probably don\u2019t watch this show on the regular, but I was stuck with it this Wednesday, having exhausted almost all other forms of TV content during the lockdown. First impressions \u2013 and no spoilers please, if you\u2019re ahead of me on the boxset \u2013 is that the House of Commons now has all the atmosphere of the Emirates, but in a good way. It leaves those at the dispatch box with nowhere to hide, which will reflexively discomfit a prime minister who has never entered a bedroom without first checking if there\u2019s a wardrobe. That said, it\u2019s only right to include the opposing view from the senior No 10 adviser whose judgment was \u201cKeir Starmer is the one who was rattled.\u201d There is, of course, no objective reality, so by all means feel free to get behind this version, where forensic answerer Johnson made light work of the former director of public prosecutions. It does, however, seem more likely that the opposite version is believed by some, given that not one but three Conservative MPs on Thursday shared a far-right video that used fakery to attempt to discredit Starmer. Well done, Nadine Dorries, Lucy Allan, and Maria Caulfield, who eventually deleted their tweets but were in all cases too small and wet to apologise. As health minister, Nadine won\u2019t have a lot on at the moment, so who can blame her for passing the time sharing far-right content on the old Twitter website? But I\u2019d urge her to use it to look into the possibility of simply no-platforming Starmer if she is upset by the things he\u2019s saying. As for Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s idea that parliament should \u201cset an example\u201d to the nation by returning to work before the test, trace and isolate infrastructure has been set up \u2026 it\u2019s one way of looking at it. A lot of people say they now watch all TV dramas and have moments where they catch themselves thinking that the characters aren\u2019t socially distancing. I\u2019m not quite there yet.

      "body": "<h2>THE BUNDESLIGA IS BACK, BABY</h2> \n<p>The first of Europe\u2019s major leagues to restart after being shut down by the Covid-19 crisis more than two months ago, Germany\u2019s top-flight footballers are ready to take their first tentative steps back into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/may/15/from-the-revierderby-to-kai-havertz-a-guide-to-the-bundesliga-return\">something vaguely resembling normality</a> this weekend. To give you an idea of just how far ahead of Blighty our Teutonic cousins are when it comes to emerging slowly from lockdown, it\u2019s worth noting that citizens of Berlin are currently able to visit their local barber shop to get a short back and sides before adjourning to their local cafe for a flat white. The Fiver, meanwhile, has barely left the crawlspace it calls home for eight weeks and recently found a nest of mice residing in the involuntary bouffant we\u2019re cautiously optimistic will win us first prize in tonight\u2019s inaugural neighbourhood Art Garfunkel lookalike competition on Zoom.</p> \n<p>International interest in the Bundesliga will be unprecedented, so much so that English football hipsters who have pretended to like it for years might even be found tuning in out of curiosity. The powers that be in the Premier League will certainly be watching carefully, nervous in the knowledge that if their ruthlessly efficient German counterparts prove incapable of running elite behind-closed-doors football matches without too many hitches or threats to player safety, the chances of a comparatively disorganised English rabble doing so could scarcely be more slim.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/may/15/from-the-revierderby-to-kai-havertz-a-guide-to-the-bundesliga-return\">From the Revierderby to Kai Havertz: a guide to the Bundesliga return | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>While the 20 Premier League clubs have been busily squabbling over their different interests in a series of largely unproductive conference calls, the Bundesliga\u2019s guinea pigs have been busily training for the past month, pausing occasionally to be tested for Covid-19. Crowds will be absent and group goal celebrations will be verb\u00f6ten, while strict hygiene remains a priority. Indeed, spare a thought for Heiko Herrlich who will be forced to sit out his first match in charge of Augsburg, who face Wolfsburg, after breaking strict quarantine rules to go on an emergency toothpaste run to the nearest supermarket. \u201cEven though I followed all hygiene measures both when I left the hotel and otherwise, I cannot undo this,\u201d he sighed. \u201cIn this situation I did not live up to my role model function towards my team and the public. I will therefore be consistent and stand by my mistake. Because of this mistake I will not lead training and I will not coach the team in the match on Saturday.\u201d</p> \n<p>There remains plenty to play for at both ends of the German top flight and The Fiver is unlikely to be alone among football-starved fans settling down to watch Borussia Dortmund take on Schalke in Saturday afternoon\u2019s Revierderby. A win for Dortmund, who The Fiver used to like before they became too mainstream, will reduce Bayern Munich\u2019s lead to a point before their first game back on Sunday. Despite being away from home and almost certainly ring rusty, the champions are white-hot favourites to see off Union Berlin, the current hipsters\u2019 club of choice, who the world\u2019s most tea-timely email has been supporting since 11.15am this morning. Like The Fiver, they might be poor but they are $exy.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>\u201cWe are shocked that there are obviously third parties who are willing to break into our club premises with criminal energy in order to carry out industrial espionage.

      "bodyText": "THE BUNDESLIGA IS BACK, BABY The first of Europe\u2019s major leagues to restart after being shut down by the Covid-19 crisis more than two months ago, Germany\u2019s top-flight footballers are ready to take their first tentative steps back into something vaguely resembling normality this weekend. To give you an idea of just how far ahead of Blighty our Teutonic cousins are when it comes to emerging slowly from lockdown, it\u2019s worth noting that citizens of Berlin are currently able to visit their local barber shop to get a short back and sides before adjourning to their local cafe for a flat white. The Fiver, meanwhile, has barely left the crawlspace it calls home for eight weeks and recently found a nest of mice residing in the involuntary bouffant we\u2019re cautiously optimistic will win us first prize in tonight\u2019s inaugural neighbourhood Art Garfunkel lookalike competition on Zoom. International interest in the Bundesliga will be unprecedented, so much so that English football hipsters who have pretended to like it for years might even be found tuning in out of curiosity. The powers that be in the Premier League will certainly be watching carefully, nervous in the knowledge that if their ruthlessly efficient German counterparts prove incapable of running elite behind-closed-doors football matches without too many hitches or threats to player safety, the chances of a comparatively disorganised English rabble doing so could scarcely be more slim. While the 20 Premier League clubs have been busily squabbling over their different interests in a series of largely unproductive conference calls, the Bundesliga\u2019s guinea pigs have been busily training for the past month, pausing occasionally to be tested for Covid-19. Crowds will be absent and group goal celebrations will be verb\u00f6ten, while strict hygiene remains a priority. Indeed, spare a thought for Heiko Herrlich who will be forced to sit out his first match in charge of Augsburg, who face Wolfsburg, after breaking strict quarantine rules to go on an emergency toothpaste run to the nearest supermarket. \u201cEven though I followed all hygiene measures both when I left the hotel and otherwise, I cannot undo this,\u201d he sighed. \u201cIn this situation I did not live up to my role model function towards my team and the public. I will therefore be consistent and stand by my mistake. Because of this mistake I will not lead training and I will not coach the team in the match on Saturday.\u201d There remains plenty to play for at both ends of the German top flight and The Fiver is unlikely to be alone among football-starved fans settling down to watch Borussia Dortmund take on Schalke in Saturday afternoon\u2019s Revierderby. A win for Dortmund, who The Fiver used to like before they became too mainstream, will reduce Bayern Munich\u2019s lead to a point before their first game back on Sunday. Despite being away from home and almost certainly ring rusty, the champions are white-hot favourites to see off Union Berlin, the current hipsters\u2019 club of choice, who the world\u2019s most tea-timely email has been supporting since 11.15am this morning. Like The Fiver, they might be poor but they are $exy. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWe are shocked that there are obviously third parties who are willing to break into our club premises with criminal energy in order to carry out industrial espionage. The perpetrators were filmed and are now being investigated\u201d \u2013 Lask suit Andreas Protil doubles down after the club were accused by 11 of their Austrian Bundesliga rivals of holding training sessions \u2013 caught on film \u2013 that break coronavirus rules. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Here\u2019s the latest Football Weekly Extra podcast and our new Forgotten Stories of Football audio read too. FIVER LETTERS \u201cI\u2019m honestly not worried that football might not return too soon. But I am rather concerned that Soulmates is ending. And so, just for these last few weeks, can we please have the ads back? Even if none of the featured ladies would ever find me remotely interesting or attractive\u201d \u2013 Tony Crawford [here you go \u2013 Fiver Ed]. \u201cSo, with the return of the Bundesliga this weekend (and to a lesser extent, the K-League and Faroe Islands \u2018Premier\u2019 League last weekend), the STOP FOOTBALL campaign has juddered to a halt. Overdue, ineffective, inadvertently hilarious at times, grimly unfunny at others and ultimately a failure \u2026 pretty much on-brand for a Fiver-backed initiative, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d \u2013 Derek McGee. \u201cRe: random football matches in films (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters). Not a film, I know, but in the 1979 series of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, John Standing\u2019s character Sam Collins has an Ipswich v Arsenal match on while lazing around in his capacity of night duty officer. Paul Mariner is mentioned by the great Barry Davies as being his \u2018man of the match\u2019\u201d \u2013 Tony Kitson. \u201cWith no other football on, are we really going to have to pretend to care about the Bundesliga? The last time I watched German football, the double Ballon d\u2019Or star striker of title winners HSV Hamburg thought this was a good idea. Top 40 in the UK and Top 10 in Germany, by the way\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Sarah Rodgers [thanks for your mail even if we couldn\u2019t publish it \u2013 Fiver Prude Ed]. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS League Two clubs have agreed to end the current season, paving the way for Crewe, Swindon and Plymouth to be promoted.

      "body": "<p>Nearly two months after lockdown began, coming out of it was always going to be a difficult message to sell. It might have been easier if the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, had been a little happier about Downing Street\u2019s plan to announce an easing of the stay-at-home restrictions away from parliament on Sunday night.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson had claimed it was because restrictions had to be altered for the Monday. But in truth the goal was to secure as large a TV audience as possible \u2013 although keeping the Speaker onboard meant vital explanatory documents had to be held back until the Commons was sitting on Monday.</p> \n<p>In the gap, fateful confusion was sown. Traditional media management required trailing the prime minister\u2019s anticipated easing to the Sunday newspapers, and boldly Downing Street decided to brief its most reliable weekend paper, the Sunday Telegraph, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Telegraph/status/1259225012525039618?s=20\">with the revised slogan, </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Telegraph/status/1259225012525039618?s=20\">\u201cstay alert\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>That morning, though, there was little to back it up. How on earth was it possible to stay alert against a virus? Was it really time to drop the clearly understandable \u201cstay at home\u201d message, even though there were still around 400 people reported as dying every weekday? With little else to do, people rapidly shared their own versions online. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dylan_patel/status/1259382422048854016?s=20\">\u201cBe Vague, Cover Our Backs, Shirk Responsibility\u201d</a> said one of the many memes circulating.</p> \n<p>So the slogan \u2013 and the ensuing bafflement \u2013 became the story.

      "bodyText": "Nearly two months after lockdown began, coming out of it was always going to be a difficult message to sell. It might have been easier if the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, had been a little happier about Downing Street\u2019s plan to announce an easing of the stay-at-home restrictions away from parliament on Sunday night. Boris Johnson had claimed it was because restrictions had to be altered for the Monday. But in truth the goal was to secure as large a TV audience as possible \u2013 although keeping the Speaker onboard meant vital explanatory documents had to be held back until the Commons was sitting on Monday. In the gap, fateful confusion was sown. Traditional media management required trailing the prime minister\u2019s anticipated easing to the Sunday newspapers, and boldly Downing Street decided to brief its most reliable weekend paper, the Sunday Telegraph, with the revised slogan, \u201cstay alert\u201d. That morning, though, there was little to back it up. How on earth was it possible to stay alert against a virus? Was it really time to drop the clearly understandable \u201cstay at home\u201d message, even though there were still around 400 people reported as dying every weekday? With little else to do, people rapidly shared their own versions online. \u201cBe Vague, Cover Our Backs, Shirk Responsibility\u201d said one of the many memes circulating. So the slogan \u2013 and the ensuing bafflement \u2013 became the story. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweeted out the Telegraph front page saying it was \u201cthe first I\u2019ve seen of the PM\u2019s new slogan\u201d. Welsh and Northern Irish administrations, responsible for their own health policies, followed suit \u2013 and a day later Labour-run Wales briefly suggested it would be policing its own border with England. Bewilderingly suddenly, the integrity of the United Kingdom appeared in question. Johnson\u2019s presidential address came at 7pm and an extraordinary audience of 27.7 million people tuned in to see a tired-looking and unapologetic prime minister read from his prepared script. \u201cNo, this is not the time simply to end the lockdown,\u201d Johnson said, while a series of coloured graphics swirled, suggesting that primary schools could reopen in early June and perhaps even bars and restaurants from the start of July. The prime minister may have only just survived his own brush with the disease, but the 13-minute broadcast was not a moment for reflection. No apologies of the sort offered up last month by France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, who had admitted his government was \u201cnot prepared enough\u201d. Nor the informal honesty of Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, who gave a simple explanation of the significance of the R reproduction number. The British public\u2019s scepticism rapidly turned to satire. Little more than an hour later, the comedian Matt Lucas spoke for a baffled nation, mimicking the voice of the prime minister. \u201cSo we are saying don\u2019t go to work, go to work, don\u2019t take public transport, go to work, don\u2019t go to work.\u201d Johnson\u2019s statement was no longer a political announcement; it had become a cultural event. Conversations buzzed in chat groups: who was really being \u201cactively encouraged\u201d to go into work and what would the situation be on public transport? And \u2013 in a nation starved of social interaction \u2013 would it be possible to meet a line of friends, all 2 metres distant from one another, or both parents in a park? Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, sought to explain the next morning. People could meet both parents outside as long as they stayed 2 metres apart.

Brandishing official advice that was valid until 13 March, Starmer coolly accused the government of having \u201cseeded\u201d the epidemic in care homes by transferring in Covid-19 patients from hospitals. Johnson vainly tried to deny the advice existed. Then Downing Street claimed, wrongly, that Starmer was misquoting. The Daily Telegraph sketch writer Michael Deacon wrote that Johnson had been taken apart \u201clike a Duplo train set\u201d \u2013 and the sight of an effective, organised opposition attack left Tory MPs spooked.

On 15 May the company launched a <a href=\"https://coolcamping.com/coronavirus/coronavirus-booking-guarantee\">coronavirus booking guarantee</a>, allowing customers to book with a 20% deposit, pay the balance 10 days before the holiday and move the booking date for up to 18 months in the event of continued or renewed restrictions.</p> <p>While 4 July is the earliest possible reopening date, this will apply only if the government\u2019s tests have been met regarding the NHS, death rates, infection rates, testing and PPE, and if it is confident that easing measures will not contribute to a second peak. This could mean that campsites in some regions of England may be open before others, while the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland may adjust restrictions at different times. In Wales, holiday accommodation is due to remain closed until 26 September, but this guidance is being reviewed every 21 days.</p> <p>Listings on the Cool Camping website now also include proposed social distancing measures. All sites will increase cleaning and many will reduce site capacity to allow more space between pitches. Chapelfield Camping in the New Forest, for example, is opening a second meadow in order spread out the tents. Some sites will be adding more toilets and showers, while others, such as Ettie\u2019s Field in Leicestershire, will introduce time slots for using the showers.

      "bodyText": "Campsites in England are preparing to reopen in July, with social distancing measures in place and reduced capacity. Under the government\u2019s Plan to Rebuild (pdf), published on 11 May, accommodation providers may be able to reopen from 4 July, subject to certain conditions. Bookings with Cool Camping, a website and guidebook representing 600 UK campsites and glamping sites, have increased fivefold since Boris Johnson\u2019s speech on 10 May announcing the plan, although they remain lower than usual. On 15 May the company launched a coronavirus booking guarantee, allowing customers to book with a 20% deposit, pay the balance 10 days before the holiday and move the booking date for up to 18 months in the event of continued or renewed restrictions. While 4 July is the earliest possible reopening date, this will apply only if the government\u2019s tests have been met regarding the NHS, death rates, infection rates, testing and PPE, and if it is confident that easing measures will not contribute to a second peak. This could mean that campsites in some regions of England may be open before others, while the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland may adjust restrictions at different times. In Wales, holiday accommodation is due to remain closed until 26 September, but this guidance is being reviewed every 21 days. Listings on the Cool Camping website now also include proposed social distancing measures. All sites will increase cleaning and many will reduce site capacity to allow more space between pitches. Chapelfield Camping in the New Forest, for example, is opening a second meadow in order spread out the tents. Some sites will be adding more toilets and showers, while others, such as Ettie\u2019s Field in Leicestershire, will introduce time slots for using the showers.

The credit rating agency S&amp;P has stripped 24 companies of investment grade status so far in 2020 as the Covid-19 crisis bites, meaning they are now regarded as only speculative punts rather than high-grade investments. The agency now considers a record 111 companies to be at risk of suffering the same fate, including British Airways, the fashion chain Next, Virgin Money and ITV. Credit ratings are an assessment of how likely a company is to be able to repay its debts, providing bond investors with signals about whether to lend to them, and how much they should charge to do so. Investment grade bonds are considered a decent prospect and carry a rating ranging from BBB- at the lower end of S&amp;P\u2019s scale all the way up to AAA for gold-plated companies considered to pose zero risk at all for lenders. Anything below that, from BB+ down to D \u2013 for firms that are in default on their loans, is considered a speculative or junk bond. Bond investors are at greater risk of not getting their money back from such loans, so charge higher interest rates, making it more expensive for companies with a junk debt rating to borrow. Marks &amp; Spencer is one of the fallen angels likely to face higher borrowing costs after S&amp;P cut its bonds to junk status on 26 March, leaving the retailer with a credit rating of BB+ on $2bn (\u00a31.65bn) of debt. At the time, the agency said it expected the coronavirus pandemic to result in significantly lower sales for M&amp;S\u2019s clothing and home divisions, which it did not believe could be fully offset by food and online sales. It also warned that the retailer\u2019s rating could be cut further if the effect of the pandemic lingers on. Other fallen angels from around the world include the carmakers Ford and Renault, Royal Caribbean Cruises and the US airline Delta. S&amp;P said the amount of debt owed by these firms had reached $300bn, the highest level since 2015 when the figure hit $1tn due to the travails of two giant state oil and gas firms, Russia\u2019s Gazprom and Petrobras of Brazil. A slew of UK firms have also been added to S&amp;P\u2019s list of companies at risk of a downgrade that would see them join the ranks of the fallen angels. They include British Airways, which has said it could cut 12,000 jobs as part of a major restructuring effort aimed at saving costs, as airlines wrestle with the huge financial ramifications of a prolonged drop-off in air travel. S&amp;P also named ITV among its list of potential fallen angels, amid a slump in advertising revenues during lockdown. Other UK firms to feature on the list of at-risk companies are the engineer GKN, Virgin Money, the B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher and the industrial equipment rental firm Ashtead. Financial institutions make up the majority of these firms globally, followed by leisure and hotels, with the oil and gas sector third on the list.",

      "body": "<p>Ever since Boris Johnson announced that he wanted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-lockdown-what-has-boris-johnson-announced\">England\u2019s schools to reopen</a> at the start of June \u2013 just over two weeks away \u2013 the government has been on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/14/teachers-can-legally-refuse-to-return-over-risk-to-health-union-warns\">collision course with teachers</a>. In deciding to bring back reception and year 1 children first, aged just four to six years, he has chosen the group of pupils who will find social distancing most difficult.</p> <p>Of course, after seven weeks of lockdown, it\u2019s understandable that Britain needs a roadmap to easing the restrictions, and schools are key in allowing parents to return to the workplace. At some point, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/15/when-will-schools-reopen-uk-children-safe-coronavirus\">classes will have to reopen</a>. But what I\u2019ve found baffling is that, given the messages we\u2019ve been hearing from the government since 23 March about staying home and saving lives, it has somehow become unpatriotic for teachers to question the speed and safety of the return to class. It\u2019s important to try and keep fit and healthy during lockdown, but why should \u201cteacher shaming\u201d be the new stay-at-home sport?</p> <p>In the House of Commons this week, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, accused concerned teachers of \u201c<a href=\"https://schoolsweek.co.uk/coronavirus-8-things-we-learned-from-gavin-williamson-on-plans-to-reopen-schools/\">scaremongering</a>\u201d, saying: \u201cMaking people fear is really unfair and not a welcome pressure that is to be placed on families, children and teachers alike.\u201d</p> <p>My old English teacher Mary Bousted, now the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, seems to be a prime target. She\u2019s a wonderful person and got me through my O-level years ago, but yesterday she was accused of \u201cworking against the interests of children\u201d and today of being a \u201cCorbynite lover of communist Cuba\u201d in the Daily Mail. Also in the Mail, and in language perhaps reminiscent of his time as defence secretary, Williamson urged teachers to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8321225/Time-class-Row-teachers-unions-explodes.html\">do their duty</a>\u201d. So it is perhaps worth considering what public duty looks like in a time of enormous crisis and mortal risk.</p> <p>I supported the lockdown and the blood-curdling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/mps-to-review-coronavirus-emergency-laws-every-six-months\">emergency legislation</a> that followed it. I swallowed more authoritarian measures than I could ever have imagined in the fight against an invisible \u2013 but very real and deadly \u2013 enemy. I even tried to bite my tongue at the lack of preparedness for and early handling of the pandemic. I didn\u2019t want to dent ministerial morale if it would do more harm than good.</p> <p>But as the death toll rises, we are still waiting for a comprehensive testing and tracing strategy and proper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/coronavirus-uk-privately-run-ppe-stockpile-chaos-movianto\">personal protective equipment</a> for all our frontline health and social care workers (let alone for those in transport, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/dancing-with-the-devil-safety-concerns-rife-among-people-forced-back-to-work\">construction</a> and other sectors now being told to work). Rightwing libertarians balk at the policing of social distancing in parks and beauty spots, but seem to care little about the lack of health and safety enforcement in unsafe places of work.

      "bodyText": "Ever since Boris Johnson announced that he wanted England\u2019s schools to reopen at the start of June \u2013 just over two weeks away \u2013 the government has been on a collision course with teachers. In deciding to bring back reception and year 1 children first, aged just four to six years, he has chosen the group of pupils who will find social distancing most difficult. Of course, after seven weeks of lockdown, it\u2019s understandable that Britain needs a roadmap to easing the restrictions, and schools are key in allowing parents to return to the workplace. At some point, classes will have to reopen. But what I\u2019ve found baffling is that, given the messages we\u2019ve been hearing from the government since 23 March about staying home and saving lives, it has somehow become unpatriotic for teachers to question the speed and safety of the return to class. It\u2019s important to try and keep fit and healthy during lockdown, but why should \u201cteacher shaming\u201d be the new stay-at-home sport? In the House of Commons this week, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, accused concerned teachers of \u201cscaremongering\u201d, saying: \u201cMaking people fear is really unfair and not a welcome pressure that is to be placed on families, children and teachers alike.\u201d My old English teacher Mary Bousted, now the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, seems to be a prime target. She\u2019s a wonderful person and got me through my O-level years ago, but yesterday she was accused of \u201cworking against the interests of children\u201d and today of being a \u201cCorbynite lover of communist Cuba\u201d in the Daily Mail. Also in the Mail, and in language perhaps reminiscent of his time as defence secretary, Williamson urged teachers to \u201cdo their duty\u201d. So it is perhaps worth considering what public duty looks like in a time of enormous crisis and mortal risk. I supported the lockdown and the blood-curdling emergency legislation that followed it. I swallowed more authoritarian measures than I could ever have imagined in the fight against an invisible \u2013 but very real and deadly \u2013 enemy. I even tried to bite my tongue at the lack of preparedness for and early handling of the pandemic. I didn\u2019t want to dent ministerial morale if it would do more harm than good. But as the death toll rises, we are still waiting for a comprehensive testing and tracing strategy and proper personal protective equipment for all our frontline health and social care workers (let alone for those in transport, construction and other sectors now being told to work). Rightwing libertarians balk at the policing of social distancing in parks and beauty spots, but seem to care little about the lack of health and safety enforcement in unsafe places of work. For a sense of perspective, only 70,000 UK civilians perished during the whole of the second world war. No need to \u201cscaremonger\u201d. Every day\u2019s numbers speak for themselves. So what does public duty look like for those making life-and-death decisions in government, for teachers\u2019 representatives and for every concerned citizen? It surely means trying to learn from evidence, experience and even past mistakes. It means asking pertinent questions before putting more people in harm\u2019s way and creating new \u201cfrontlines\u201d of infection. Right now, Britain doesn\u2019t have the ability to even monitor the spread of the virus, let alone keep it under control. What is the scientific basis for assuming that children don\u2019t spread coronavirus? How can social distancing really be made to work with small children in particular? We don\u2019t need intemperate attacks on those who ask questions or speak inconvenient truth to power. Some say that if doctors are putting themselves at risk, why shouldn\u2019t teachers?

Senior political analyst Brit Hume led the charge, suggesting fatalities in New York City \u2013 the worst-hit area in the country \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brithume/status/1245465723591364616\">were \u201cinflated\u201d</a> because the city did not \u201cdistinguish between those who die with the disease and those who die from it\u201d. Hume retweeted a chart showing that many people who died had pre-existing conditions.</p> <p>Hume repeated the claim on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show. He appeared to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/04/fox-news-hosts-coronavirus-death-toll-inflated\">convince Carlson</a>, who suggested \u201cthere may be reasons that people seek an inaccurate death count\u201d and added: \u201cWhen journalists work with numbers, there sometimes is an agenda, unfortunately.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is said to be questioning whether the death toll is lower than officially stated. He has stopped short of saying so in public, but in April he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johncardillo/status/1254481206936326145\">retweeted a man who mused of Democrats</a>: \u201cDo you really think these lunatics wouldn\u2019t inflate the mortality rates by underreporting the infection rates in an attempt to steal the election?\u201d</p> <p>Trump has consistently under-predicted how many people will die from the virus. In February he said there <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/trump-coronavirus-cases-will-go-down-to-zero-ultimately.html\">would soon be \u201cclose to zero\u201d</a> cases. <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/coronavirus-in-us-deaths-cases/6139672/\">On 20 April</a>, he suggested \u201c50 to 60,000\u201d could die. The US passed that figure nine days later. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-coronavirus&amp;variant=show&amp;region=TOP_BANNER&amp;context=storylines_menu\">More than 85,000 have now died</a>.</p> <p>In fact, epidemiologists including Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top public health expert, say <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/28/us/coronavirus-death-toll-total.html\">more people have died</a> from coronavirus than has been reported.</p> <p>But it\u2019s a struggle to find similar perspectives in the rightwing media upon which many Americans rely.</p> <p>At the start of May, the Fox News host Laura Ingraham criticized the addition of presumptive coronavirus deaths to the official tolls. \u201cAhh, retrospectively adding deaths to the Covid count,\u201d she said. \u201cNo issues there, I\u2019m sure. No issues with accuracy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d043807c241ea087f2d3b756249c760c10d903f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d043807c241ea087f2d3b756249c760c10d903f8/0_52_3063_1838/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Ingraham has questioned the accuracy of the official coronavirus death toll.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Ingraham has questioned the accuracy of the official coronavirus death toll.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark J Terrill/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than 3,000 deaths were <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2020/04/14/new-york-city-coronavirus-death-toll-jumps-by-3-700-after-uncounted-fatalities-are-added-1275931\">added to the record</a> in New York City in April, as the official figures had not included people who died at home or those <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/new-york-citys-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-sharply-after-officials-start-including-presumptive-cases\">who exhibited symptoms of the coronavirus</a> but were not tested for it. Testing kits were particularly difficult to come by in March and early April.</p> <p>The list of people pushing the death toll non-scandal reads like a who\u2019s who of conspiracy theorists.

      "bodyText": "As Donald Trump agitates for the US to reopen, the American right appears to have found a novel way to deal with the rising coronavirus death toll: deny it altogether. Top Trump officials, huddled in the White House, itself the subject of a coronavirus outbreak, have according to reports begun questioning the number of deaths \u2013 and the president is among the skeptics. It\u2019s a handy thought process for an administration desperate to send Americans back to work even as deaths from the virus rise each day, with marked surges in some traditionally Republican states. Trump is said to be coming round to the idea, pushed in the rightwing media for weeks, that hospitals, coroners and medical professionals across the US have been mislabelling deaths. As far back as early April, Fox News personalities were casting doubt on the number of people who had succumbed to Covid-19. Senior political analyst Brit Hume led the charge, suggesting fatalities in New York City \u2013 the worst-hit area in the country \u2013 were \u201cinflated\u201d because the city did not \u201cdistinguish between those who die with the disease and those who die from it\u201d. Hume retweeted a chart showing that many people who died had pre-existing conditions. Hume repeated the claim on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show. He appeared to convince Carlson, who suggested \u201cthere may be reasons that people seek an inaccurate death count\u201d and added: \u201cWhen journalists work with numbers, there sometimes is an agenda, unfortunately.\u201d Trump is said to be questioning whether the death toll is lower than officially stated. He has stopped short of saying so in public, but in April he retweeted a man who mused of Democrats: \u201cDo you really think these lunatics wouldn\u2019t inflate the mortality rates by underreporting the infection rates in an attempt to steal the election?\u201d Trump has consistently under-predicted how many people will die from the virus. In February he said there would soon be \u201cclose to zero\u201d cases. On 20 April, he suggested \u201c50 to 60,000\u201d could die. The US passed that figure nine days later. More than 85,000 have now died. In fact, epidemiologists including Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top public health expert, say more people have died from coronavirus than has been reported. But it\u2019s a struggle to find similar perspectives in the rightwing media upon which many Americans rely. At the start of May, the Fox News host Laura Ingraham criticized the addition of presumptive coronavirus deaths to the official tolls. \u201cAhh, retrospectively adding deaths to the Covid count,\u201d she said. \u201cNo issues there, I\u2019m sure. No issues with accuracy.\u201d More than 3,000 deaths were added to the record in New York City in April, as the official figures had not included people who died at home or those who exhibited symptoms of the coronavirus but were not tested for it. Testing kits were particularly difficult to come by in March and early April. The list of people pushing the death toll non-scandal reads like a who\u2019s who of conspiracy theorists. Alex Jones, the InfoWars host, is a keen proponent of the concept, as are Diamond and Silk, Trump sycophants recently axed by Fox Nation. One common claim is that hospitals receive more money from Medicare if they are treating a patient with the coronavirus compared with other illnesses, and so are inflating their numbers. Scott Jensen, a Minnesota state senator and family physician, began hawking this theory in early April, leading to an appearance on Ingraham\u2019s show. \u201cRight now Medicare has determined that if you have a Covid-19 admission to the hospital, you\u2019ll get paid $13,000,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cIf that Covid-19 patient goes on a ventilator, you get $39,000, three times as much. Nobody can tell me after 35 years in the world of medicine that sometimes those kinds of things [don\u2019t] impact on what we do.\u201d Jensen appeared to be accusing hospitals of fraud \u2013 something he later denied \u2013 but the idea stuck. Factcheckers have found no evidence to support Jensen\u2019s claims \u2013 in fact, some hospital revenues are expected to be down, due to the cancellation of elective procedures \u2013 but the idea of labeling illnesses as coronavirus for cash became a talking point on rightwing Facebook groups and beyond. Worryingly, the disinformation push seems to be working. An Axios-Ipsos poll found that the death toll has become a political issue, 40% of Republicans believing fewer Americans are dying from coronavirus than the official toll says. A separate study, published at the end of April, revealed the stark consequences of prominent figures underplaying the impact of Covid-19. A group of researchers tracked the spread of coronavirus among viewers of Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show, after Hannity spent weeks downplaying the threat. \u201cGreater exposure to Hannity,\u201d the researchers wrote, \u201cleads to a greater number of Covid-19 cases and deaths.\u201d",

(It\u2019s unproven and could have lethal side-effects). On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/rick-bright-testimony-coronavirus-trump-ousted-whistleblower\">Bright warned Congress</a> about reopening too early, and recalled the dark moment when he realized America was in \u201cdeep shit\u201d after a supplier told him they had run out of masks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Colbert\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wie-JIZW-Ew\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cYes, thanks to poor planning, America is in deep shit,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cOr, as Trump puts it, \u2018promises made, promises kept\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Bright\u2019s testimony echoed that of Dr Anthony Fauci, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/12/coronavirus-us-live-fauci-testify-danger-reopening-early-trump-tweets-cuomo-latest-news-updates\">who warned Congress earlier this week</a> that Americans should be cautious in reopening schools and other businesses to avoid another crippling outbreak. Nevertheless, Trump told Fox Business Network on Thursday morning that \u201cwe have to get the schools open, we have to get our country open now.

      "bodyText": "A midwife and a mental health nurse from the same hospital trust have died after contracting coronavirus. Safaa Alam, 29, and Lillian Mudzivare, 42, both worked at Birmingham women\u2019s and children\u2019s NHS trust. Alam, whose father Mushtaq Afsar also died two weeks ago, was described as an \u201camazing midwife\u201d. Her \u201cskills and expertise helped to bring hundreds of new lives into the world\u201d, said the trust\u2019s chief executive, Sarah-Jane Marsh. In a statement, her husband Shazad said: \u201cSaf was my beautiful and full of life wife.\u201d He added they were childhood sweethearts, who grew up together, and their years together had been filled with \u201clove, fun and adventure\u201d. A Go Fund Me appeal in memory of father and daughter has been set up. A bereavement notice on the Janaza Announcement Facebook page said Afsar died 14 days ago. \u201cSadly, his daughter Safaa, age 29, who is a midwife has also sadly passed away due to Covid-19\u201d. Mudzivare, who lived with her husband, Moses, and their daughters in Birmingham, was a \u201cmuch-loved member of our Forward Thinking Birmingham team whose bubbly, vibrant and bright approach touched the lives of everyone who knew her,\u201d said Marsh. Staff paid tribute to her commitment to mental health and young people. In a statement, her family described her a \u201csuch a beautiful mother, wife and friend\u201d and a \u201cvery proud nurse always caring for those who needed her help\u201d. Four members of the trust\u2019s staff have now died with Covid-19. A care home director and her retired radiologist husband died with coronavirus in the same hospital 10 days apart. Dr James Oniah, 79, and his wife Mary (Nyirongo) Oniah, 61, who worked as a regional director for the Maria Mallaband Care Group (MMCG), lived in Ilford, east London, and died in the King George hospital in Redbridge. He was a director of the Onitsha Progressive Foundation, a charity for elderly diaspora from Onitsha, Nigeria. His wife trained in Zambia before coming to London to work as a midwife. A Go Fund Me appeal page set up by the Zambians Together initiative said: \u201cIt is believed Mary contracted coronavirus in her line of duty as a regional director in care homes and sadly her husband James, a former doctor [radiologist] also contracted the disease. \u201cThey ended their fight for their lives against Covid-19 at King George\u2019s hospital in London 10 days apart, leaving behind children and a wider network of family and friends who all considered them their mum and dad.\u201d MMCG, which runs care homes across the UK, said: \u201cMary was a valued colleague and friend to many people in our company, she will be sorely missed. Our heartfelt sympathies go out to her family at this difficult time.\u201d Tributes have also been paid to Andy Collier, 53, described as a \u201cselfless\u201d nurse practitioner at Hollins Park hospital in Warrington. The former rugby player, who died after testing positive for coronavirus, ran The First and Last pub in Leigh, with his wife, Carol. He had previously played for Wigan and Leigh Centurions rugby league sides. He was also a union representative for Unite and played golf at Leigh golf club. His ward manager, Rob Kelly, said: \u201cHe was very down-to-earth, fair and selfless.\u201d He had been admitted to the Royal Albert Infirmary in Wigan after becoming seriously ill on 31 March. The chief executive at North West Boroughs Healthcare, Simon Barber, said: \u201cIt is clear he was a very dedicated and compassionate man. All our thoughts are with Andy\u2019s family at this time and we offer them our sincere condolences.\u201d Healthcare assistant Jun Terre, 52, who worked at Stoke Mandeville hospital died on 14 May, having tested positive for Covid-19. He was described as a \u201ca gracious, quiet and kind gentleman with a smile that would light up a room\u201d, by Neil Macdonald, Buckinghamshire healthcare NHS trust\u2019s chief executive. His wife also works at the trust. The Labour MP for Slough, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, paid tribute to his uncle, taxi driver Satnam Singh Dhesi, 63, who died at Slough\u2019s Wexham Park hospital, from Covid-19. He posted on Twitter: \u201cMy uncle, a fun-loving guy who never spoke ill of anyone, sadly contracted Covid and even a ventilator couldn\u2019t save him. Tragically I could only see his funeral via Zoom.\u201d Dhesi was a keen footballer and a regular helper and supporter at the Singh Sabha Football Academy in Slough, which had been co-founded by his son Harpreet. In April, the MP posted he had lost his grandmother to coronavirus.",

      "body": "<p>Under the cover of coronavirus, all kinds of wickedness are happening. Where you and I see a global health crisis, the world\u2019s leading authoritarians, fearmongers and populist strongmen have spotted an opportunity \u2013 and they are seizing it.</p> <p>Of course, neither left nor right has a monopoly on the truism that one should never let a good crisis go to waste. Plenty of progressives share that conviction, firm that the pandemic offers a rare chance to reset the way we organise our unequal societies, our clogged cities, our warped relationship to the natural world. But there are others \u2013 and they tend to be in power \u2013 who see this opening very differently. For them, the virus suddenly makes possible action that in normal times would exact a heavy cost. Now they can strike while the world looks the other way.</p> <p>For some, Covid-19 itself is the weapon of choice. Witness the emerging evidence that Bashar al-Assad in Damascus and Xi Jinping in Beijing are allowing the disease to wreak havoc among those groups whom the rulers have deemed to be unpersons, their lives unworthy of basic protection. Assad is deliberately leaving Syrians in opposition-held areas more vulnerable to the pandemic, according to <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/cross-border-aid-covid-19-and-us-decisions-syria\">Will Todman</a> of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. As he puts it: \u201cCovid-19 has provided Assad a new opportunity to instrumentalize suffering.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, China continues to hold 1 million Uighur Muslims in internment camps, where they contend now not only with inhuman conditions but also a coronavirus outbreak. Those camps are cramped, lack adequate sanitation and have poor medical facilities: the virus couldn\u2019t ask for a better breeding ground. What\u2019s more, Uighur Muslims are <a href=\"https://uighurtimes.com/index.php/in-a-dangerous-move-china-forces-30000-uighur-workers-to-return-to-work-in-hotan/\">reportedly being forced to work as labourers</a>, filling in for non-Muslims who are allowed to stay home and protect themselves. That, according to one observer, \u201c<a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/humanrights/2020/04/23/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-uighur-muslims-an-ignored-crisis/\">is reflective</a> of how the [People\u2019s] Republic of China views [Uighur Muslims] as nothing but disposable commodities\u201d.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the pandemic has allowed would-be dictators an excuse to seize yet more power. Enter Viktor Orb\u00e1n of Hungary, whose response to coronavirus was immediate: he persuaded his pliant parliament to grant him the right to rule by decree. Orb\u00e1n said he needed emergency powers to fight the dreaded disease, but there is no time limit on them; they will remain his even once the threat has passed. They include the power to jail those who \u201cspread false information\u201d. Naturally, that\u2019s already led to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/hungary-viktor-orban-coronavirus-laws-prompt-new-showdown-with-brussels\">crackdown on individuals </a>guilty of nothing more than posting criticism of the government on Facebook. Orb\u00e1n has long sought to rule Hungary as an autocrat, but the pandemic gave him his chance, allowing him to brand anyone standing in his way as unwilling to help the leader fight a mortal threat.</p> <p>Xi has not missed that same trick, using coronavirus to intensify his imposition of China\u2019s Orwellian \u201csocial credit\u201d system, whereby citizens are tracked, monitored and rated for their compliance. Now that system can include health and, thanks to the virus, much of the public ambivalence that previously existed towards it is likely to melt away. After all, runs the logic, good citizens are surely obliged to give up even more of their autonomy if it helps save lives.</p> <p>For many of the world\u2019s strongmen, though, coronavirus doesn\u2019t even need to be an excuse. Its chief value is the global distraction it has created, allowing unprincipled rulers to make mischief when natural critics at home and abroad are preoccupied with the urgent business of life and death.</p> <p>Donald Trump gets plenty of criticism for his botched handling of the virus, but while everyone is staring at the mayhem he\u2019s creating with one hand, the other is free to commit acts of vandalism that go all but undetected. This week the Guardian reported how the pandemic has not slowed the Trump administration\u2019s steady and deliberate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/trump-environmental-blitzkrieg-coronavirus\">erosion of environmental protections</a>. During the lockdown, Trump has eased fuel-efficiency standards for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/31/trump-epa-obama-clean-car-rules-climate-change\">new cars</a>, frozen rules for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/14/trump-epa-soot-pollution-clean-air-standards\">soot air pollution</a>, continued to lease public property to oil and gas companies, and advanced a proposal on mercury pollution from power plants that could make that easier too. Oh, and he\u2019s also <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/climate-desk-trumps-epa-halts-environmental-law-enorcement-during-coronavirus-pandemic\">relaxed</a> reporting rules for polluters.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s Brazilian mini-me, Jair Bolsonaro, has outstripped his mentor. Not content with mere changes to the rulebook, he\u2019s pushed aside the expert environmental agencies and sent in the military to \u201cprotect\u201d the Amazon rainforest. I say \u201cprotect\u201d because, as <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/deforestation-amazon-has-soared-under-cover-coronavirus-n1204451\">NBC News reported this week</a>, satellite imagery shows \u201cdeforestation of the Amazon has soared under cover of the coronavirus\u201d. Destruction in April was up by 64% from the same month a year ago. The images reveal an area of land equivalent to 448 football fields, stripped bare of trees \u2013 this in the place that serves as the lungs of the earth. If the world were not consumed with fighting coronavirus, there would have been an outcry. Instead, and in our distraction, those trees have fallen without making a sound.</p> <p>Another Trump admirer, India\u2019s Narendra Modi, has seen the same opportunity identified by his fellow ultra-nationalists. Indian police have been using the lockdown to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/34ad9282-74d7-4a85-a629-a9655339c366\">crack down on Muslim citizens</a> and their leaders \u201cindiscriminately\u201d, according to activists. Those arrested or detained struggle to get access to a lawyer, given the restrictions on movement. Modi calculates that majority opinion will back him, as rightist Hindu politicians brand the virus a \u201cMuslim disease\u201d and pro-Modi TV stations declare the nation to be facing a \u201ccorona jihad\u201d.</p> <p>In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 who can claim to have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/09/donald-trump-twin-benjamin-netanyahu-israel-white-house\">Trumpist before Trump</a> \u2013 has been handed a political lifeline by the virus, luring part of the main opposition party into a government of national unity that will keep him in power and, he hopes, out of the dock on corruption charges. His new coalition is committed to a programme that would see Israel annex major parts of the West Bank, permanently absorbing into itself territory that should belong to a future Palestinian state, with the process starting in early July. Now, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-there-will-be-lots-of-annexation-talk-from-netanyahu-but-no-action-1.8826440\">the smart money suggests we should be cautious</a>: that it suits Netanyahu to promise/threaten annexation more than it does for him to actually do it. Even so, in normal times the mere prospect of such an indefensible move would represent an epochal shift, high on the global diplomatic agenda. In these abnormal times, it barely makes the news.</p> <p>Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, argues that many of the global bad guys are, in fact, \u201cdemonstrating their weakness rather than strength\u201d \u2013 that they are all too aware that if they fail to keep their citizens alive, their authority will be shot. He notes Vladimir Putin\u2019s forced postponement of the referendum that would have kept him in power in Russia at least until 2036. When that vote eventually comes, says Niblett, Putin will go into it diminished by his failure to smother the virus.</p> <p>Still, for now, the pandemic has been a boon to the world\u2019s authoritarians, tyrants and bigots. It has given them what they crave most: fear and the cover of darkness.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Naturally, that\u2019s already led to a crackdown on individuals guilty of nothing more than posting criticism of the government on Facebook. Orb\u00e1n has long sought to rule Hungary as an autocrat, but the pandemic gave him his chance, allowing him to brand anyone standing in his way as unwilling to help the leader fight a mortal threat. Xi has not missed that same trick, using coronavirus to intensify his imposition of China\u2019s Orwellian \u201csocial credit\u201d system, whereby citizens are tracked, monitored and rated for their compliance. Now that system can include health and, thanks to the virus, much of the public ambivalence that previously existed towards it is likely to melt away. After all, runs the logic, good citizens are surely obliged to give up even more of their autonomy if it helps save lives. For many of the world\u2019s strongmen, though, coronavirus doesn\u2019t even need to be an excuse. Its chief value is the global distraction it has created, allowing unprincipled rulers to make mischief when natural critics at home and abroad are preoccupied with the urgent business of life and death. Donald Trump gets plenty of criticism for his botched handling of the virus, but while everyone is staring at the mayhem he\u2019s creating with one hand, the other is free to commit acts of vandalism that go all but undetected. This week the Guardian reported how the pandemic has not slowed the Trump administration\u2019s steady and deliberate erosion of environmental protections. During the lockdown, Trump has eased fuel-efficiency standards for new cars, frozen rules for soot air pollution, continued to lease public property to oil and gas companies, and advanced a proposal on mercury pollution from power plants that could make that easier too. Oh, and he\u2019s also relaxed reporting rules for polluters. Trump\u2019s Brazilian mini-me, Jair Bolsonaro, has outstripped his mentor. Not content with mere changes to the rulebook, he\u2019s pushed aside the expert environmental agencies and sent in the military to \u201cprotect\u201d the Amazon rainforest. I say \u201cprotect\u201d because, as NBC News reported this week, satellite imagery shows \u201cdeforestation of the Amazon has soared under cover of the coronavirus\u201d. Destruction in April was up by 64% from the same month a year ago. The images reveal an area of land equivalent to 448 football fields, stripped bare of trees \u2013 this in the place that serves as the lungs of the earth. If the world were not consumed with fighting coronavirus, there would have been an outcry. Instead, and in our distraction, those trees have fallen without making a sound. Another Trump admirer, India\u2019s Narendra Modi, has seen the same opportunity identified by his fellow ultra-nationalists. Indian police have been using the lockdown to crack down on Muslim citizens and their leaders \u201cindiscriminately\u201d, according to activists. Those arrested or detained struggle to get access to a lawyer, given the restrictions on movement. Modi calculates that majority opinion will back him, as rightist Hindu politicians brand the virus a \u201cMuslim disease\u201d and pro-Modi TV stations declare the nation to be facing a \u201ccorona jihad\u201d. In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 who can claim to have been Trumpist before Trump \u2013 has been handed a political lifeline by the virus, luring part of the main opposition party into a government of national unity that will keep him in power and, he hopes, out of the dock on corruption charges. His new coalition is committed to a programme that would see Israel annex major parts of the West Bank, permanently absorbing into itself territory that should belong to a future Palestinian state, with the process starting in early July. Now, the smart money suggests we should be cautious: that it suits Netanyahu to promise/threaten annexation more than it does for him to actually do it. Even so, in normal times the mere prospect of such an indefensible move would represent an epochal shift, high on the global diplomatic agenda. In these abnormal times, it barely makes the news. Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, argues that many of the global bad guys are, in fact, \u201cdemonstrating their weakness rather than strength\u201d \u2013 that they are all too aware that if they fail to keep their citizens alive, their authority will be shot. He notes Vladimir Putin\u2019s forced postponement of the referendum that would have kept him in power in Russia at least until 2036. When that vote eventually comes, says Niblett, Putin will go into it diminished by his failure to smother the virus. Still, for now, the pandemic has been a boon to the world\u2019s authoritarians, tyrants and bigots. It has given them what they crave most: fear and the cover of darkness. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",

His popular predecessor, Luiz Mandetta, was fired by he country\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro,on 16 April following disagreements over social isolation measures, which Bolsonaro has dismissed as unnecessary. News of Teich\u2019s resignation was greeted with dismay by doctors fighting the virus. Albert Ko, a professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Medicine blamed \u201cthe lack of leadership and poor governance\u201d. \u201cTo lose two health ministers will really have a dramatic impact on the country\u2019s ability to contest the epidemic,\u201d said Ko, who has extensive experience working in Brazil. In a short televised statement to reporters on Friday afternoon, Teich did not explain his reasons for leaving \u2013 nor did he answer any questions. \u201cLife is made of choices and today I chose to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to be at the front of a ministry like this at such a difficult period.\u201d On taking office, Teich initially appeared to follow Bolsonaro\u2019s line, arguing that bolstering Brazil\u2019s economy was as important as controlling the pandemic\u2019s growing death toll. But in recent weeks Teich had increasingly disagreed with Bolsonaro over social isolation and the use of the malaria drug chloroquine to treat coronavirus. The Brazilian president has enthusiastically backed using the drug, despite a string of medical studies showing that it has no positive effect on people suffering Covid-19, and can possibly cause other health complications. On Thursday Bolsonaro announced that he wanted to change the protocol regulating the use of chloroquine that Mandetta had introduced. Teich was publicly embarrassed on Monday when he discovered during a press conference that the president had issued a decree that classified gyms, beauty salons and barbers as essential services. \u201cThis was not our role, it was the president\u2019s decision,\u201d he said, looking flummoxed. After Teich stood down, his predecessor, Mandetta, tweeted: \u201cLet\u2019s pray.\u201d In an interview for the Estado de S Paulo newspaper, Mandetta described Teich\u2019s short tenure as \u201ca lost month, thrown in the garbage bin\u201d. Brazil reported 844 new deaths in 24 hours on Thursday night, taking the total to 13,993 and it now has 202,918 cases, making it the world\u2019s sixth most affected country, according to Johns Hopkins University figures.",

      "bodyText": "More than 43 million people in west Africa are likely to be in urgent need of food assistance in the coming months \u2013 double the initial estimates \u2013 as the Covid-19 outbreak accelerates, the World Food Programme has said. Food insecurity could also double this year to affect 265 million people across the continent; west Africa, where the outbreak of the virus is most severe, is of increasing concern. The region faces the three-pronged threat of surging jihadi attacks across the Sahel and Lake Chad area, climate change harming vital food supply chains, and now the pandemic. The WFP had estimated a 70% rise in food insecurity to 21 million people in west Africa this year before the outbreak, but now anticipates a further 22 million becoming reliant on food aid by August, unless major steps are taken. \u201cEven before Covid we had a number of shocks which were affecting people,\u201d said Dr Chris Nikoi, the WFP\u2019s regional director for west and central Africa. \u201cFood flows were already not optimal because of conflict across west Africa,\u201d he said. Covid has exacerbated existing crises, presenting an immense challenge to food insecurity. With schools closed in most African countries due to containment measures, the World Health Organization also estimates that 65 million children are now having to do without a previously provided nutritious meal at school. Across the continent there have been more than 75,000 confirmed infections and 2,563 deaths. According to the WHO, cases in Africa have not been as high as in other parts of the world, in part due to early and aggressive measures adopted by African countries to stem the spread. Yet infections have risen more sharply in the past week, and are already a significant challenge to health systems. The challenges are increasingly acute in a number of countries. After hundreds of deaths were linked to Covid-19 in the northern Nigerian state of Kano, similar reports proliferated elsewhere in the country, and health authorities are investigating outbreaks in seven other states. A combination of the deaths and low levels of testing has cast doubt on the capacity of health authorities to detect cases across the country. In Guinea-Bissau, a rise to 900 from 54 confirmed cases two weeks ago has left health services in the tiny west African country under strain, according to M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. \u201cIn a small country like Guinea-Bissau \u2026 this dramatic increase shows that the virus continues to spread in communities and faster than we thought,\u201d said Monica Negrete, MSF\u2019s head of mission in the country. Unprecedented conflict in west Africa\u2019s Sahel and the north-east of Nigeria has displaced millions in recent months, adding to the challenge of containing the virus in those countries. About 4.5 million people are displaced in the Sahelian region covering Mali, Niger, Mauritiana, Chad and Burkina Faso. Of these, 838,000 have fled violence in the last year alone in Burkina Faso. Some 1.8 million people are displaced in north-east Nigeria. Measures to prevent the spread of the virus among displaced populations have been swiftly adopted, yet aid organisations say those measures have also increased hunger, as distributing support has become a greater challenge. African countries quickly adopted a range of aggressive measures that helped mitigate the spread of the virus. Lockdowns and travels bans were imposed when cases were few, yet many countries across Africa have begun relaxing lockdown measures while cases continue to accelerate. The economic pressures \u2013 particularly on the millions working in informal economies, earning daily wages \u2013 have diminished the capacity for governments to lock down cities without rapidly impoverishing large populations. \u201cGovernments are having to put in place certain measures, lockdowns, restricted movements etc, which are making an already bad situation in some areas, in some contexts, worse,\u201d Nikoi said. A competitive global market for test kits, favouring higher prices and bulk purchases, significantly disadvantaged many African countries, the ACDC has said. Yet the level of testing is gradually improving. About 1.2 million tests have now been administered, tripling in the last month, according to ADCD\u2019s director, Dr John Nkengasong, \u201cWe still have an issue of access to tests but the issue is going in the right direction,\u201d he said. The ACDC and WHO are supporting Senegal, Morocco, Kenya and South Africa in creating locally made diagnostic tests, which are expected to be validated in the next few weeks.",

      "body": "<p>A global pandemic calls for a global comic response. That\u2019s the rationale behind <a href=\"https://www.mickperrin.com/tours/comedywithoutborders/\">Comedy Without Borders</a>, last night\u2019s international comedy bill assembled by producers Mick Perrin Worldwide to raise money for the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. The promise was \u201chilarious takes on the world as it turns upside down\u201d, delivered by quarantined standups from Iceland, Australia, India and beyond. OK, so we mustn\u2019t compare the death rate country by country, if our government is to be believed. But at least we can compare the jokes.</p> <p>Comedy Without Borders hung together best when it gave us the chance to do so. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/02/anuvab-pal-interview-the-empire-soho-theatre-india-identity-british-raj\">Anuvab Pal</a> explained how India has kept its Covid-19 stats low by simply refusing to test for the virus. Russia\u2019s Igor Meerson addressed the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/online/Russia-unleashed-500-lions/\">spectacular fake news</a> that Vladimir Putin released 500 lions on to Moscow\u2019s streets to keep the population homebound. London-based Italian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/08/never-mind-the-backstop-camden-comedy-club-brexit-standups\">Luca Cupani</a> pined for the pre-lockdown era (\u201cmost of all I miss \u2026 money\u201d) and boasted of Italy\u2019s macabre status as European champions of coronavirus. To which the obvious response was: not any more, mate \u2013 Covid\u2019s coming home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a7526be8901dc41d98ecd482283d57743b4aea0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a7526be8901dc41d98ecd482283d57743b4aea0/0_0_5304_7870/674.jpg\" alt=\"Trump card \u2026 Schalk Bezuidenhoet.\" width=\"674\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump card \u2026 Schalk Bezuidenhoet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ross Garrett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His set was evidently recorded some time before broadcast; none of the contributors \u2013 a little disappointingly \u2013 performed live. The exception was South African MC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/03/schalk-bezuidenhout-funniest-things\">Schalk Bezuidenhout</a>, the show\u2019s trump card. As many a recent livestream has proven, it\u2019s not easy performing comedy to a webcam and silence. Bezuidenhout brought energy and a healthy sense of absurdity to the task, gleefully exposing elephants in the room, segueing skilfully, keeping things brisk. But there could be no interplay with his guests\u2019 prerecorded routines, which were pitched less to a live audience than to the ether. Pal didn\u2019t make eye contact even with his webcam, delivering his set to a place slightly above my left shoulder.</p> <p>Though we got neither liveness, nor (with the above exceptions) many hot takes on coronavirus, Comedy Without Borders remained an entertaining portmanteau. While nine-tenths of the acts were straight standups, their styles varied so dramatically as to make the show feel like variety. We got Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.brodisnook.co.uk/\">Brodi Snook</a> (the sole female act) peddling cynical sex-and-relationship comedy. Sam Morrison of the US delivered a concentrated hit of bitchy with his five minutes on gay conversion therapy and fancying older men. Lugubrious Dave Hill \u2013 also American \u2013 pitched in, apropos of nothing, with his list of tortuous \u201cpick-up lines that only work in London\u201d.</p> <p>And it was fun, as ever, to see comedians wrestle with \u2013 and find ways to flout \u2013 the limitations of their new medium. Snook\u2019s set ended with a simple visual joke, breaking out of her webcam\u2019s frame. Pal foregrounded the discomfort of performing to nobody. (\u201cThere is a fine line between standup comedy and madness \u2013 and that line is an audience.\u201d) And Cupani ended his set with a slightly adjusted version of the standard sign-off: \u201cGuys you\u2019ve been lovely \u2013 so quiet \u2026\u201d</p> <p>The gig ended with guest star \u2013 and committed globalist \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/10/eddie-izzard-trying-to-get-mother-back-victoria-and-abdul\">Eddie Izzard</a>, whose performance <em>was</em> live but wasn\u2019t comedy. As at the Edinburgh fringe last year, I found myself wondering: why is Eddie Izzard rendering great chunks of Dickens\u2019 Great Expectations at me?

      "bodyText": "A global pandemic calls for a global comic response. That\u2019s the rationale behind Comedy Without Borders, last night\u2019s international comedy bill assembled by producers Mick Perrin Worldwide to raise money for the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. The promise was \u201chilarious takes on the world as it turns upside down\u201d, delivered by quarantined standups from Iceland, Australia, India and beyond. OK, so we mustn\u2019t compare the death rate country by country, if our government is to be believed. But at least we can compare the jokes. Comedy Without Borders hung together best when it gave us the chance to do so. Anuvab Pal explained how India has kept its Covid-19 stats low by simply refusing to test for the virus. Russia\u2019s Igor Meerson addressed the spectacular fake news that Vladimir Putin released 500 lions on to Moscow\u2019s streets to keep the population homebound. London-based Italian Luca Cupani pined for the pre-lockdown era (\u201cmost of all I miss \u2026 money\u201d) and boasted of Italy\u2019s macabre status as European champions of coronavirus. To which the obvious response was: not any more, mate \u2013 Covid\u2019s coming home. His set was evidently recorded some time before broadcast; none of the contributors \u2013 a little disappointingly \u2013 performed live. The exception was South African MC Schalk Bezuidenhout, the show\u2019s trump card. As many a recent livestream has proven, it\u2019s not easy performing comedy to a webcam and silence. Bezuidenhout brought energy and a healthy sense of absurdity to the task, gleefully exposing elephants in the room, segueing skilfully, keeping things brisk. But there could be no interplay with his guests\u2019 prerecorded routines, which were pitched less to a live audience than to the ether. Pal didn\u2019t make eye contact even with his webcam, delivering his set to a place slightly above my left shoulder. Though we got neither liveness, nor (with the above exceptions) many hot takes on coronavirus, Comedy Without Borders remained an entertaining portmanteau. While nine-tenths of the acts were straight standups, their styles varied so dramatically as to make the show feel like variety. We got Australia\u2019s Brodi Snook (the sole female act) peddling cynical sex-and-relationship comedy. Sam Morrison of the US delivered a concentrated hit of bitchy with his five minutes on gay conversion therapy and fancying older men. Lugubrious Dave Hill \u2013 also American \u2013 pitched in, apropos of nothing, with his list of tortuous \u201cpick-up lines that only work in London\u201d. And it was fun, as ever, to see comedians wrestle with \u2013 and find ways to flout \u2013 the limitations of their new medium. Snook\u2019s set ended with a simple visual joke, breaking out of her webcam\u2019s frame. Pal foregrounded the discomfort of performing to nobody. (\u201cThere is a fine line between standup comedy and madness \u2013 and that line is an audience.\u201d) And Cupani ended his set with a slightly adjusted version of the standard sign-off: \u201cGuys you\u2019ve been lovely \u2013 so quiet \u2026\u201d The gig ended with guest star \u2013 and committed globalist \u2013 Eddie Izzard, whose performance was live but wasn\u2019t comedy. As at the Edinburgh fringe last year, I found myself wondering: why is Eddie Izzard rendering great chunks of Dickens\u2019 Great Expectations at me? Other viewers clearly felt the same: \u201cOu est le singe?\u201d one commenter asked, nostalgic for Izzard\u2019s actual standup. \u201cDans l\u2019arbre,\u201d another duly replied. But if his Dickens recital felt incongruous, he certainly performs it with passion and flair. And his backchat with Bezuidenhout pepped up the closing stages of this largely successful, globe-straddling standup bill. \u2022 Comedy Without Borders is available on YouTube.",

There\u2019s a sort of diplomacy that you need to have, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s showing that, especially in these times.\u201d The world No 1, who faced intense backlash after playing a round of golf with Trump shortly after he was inaugurated in 2017, admitted the president was \u201ccharismatic\u201d and had an \u201cX factor\u201d but said he wouldn\u2019t play with him again if asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019d want to play with me again after what I just said, but I wouldn\u2019t [play with him again],\u201d said McIlroy, who resides in the Florida town of Palm Beach not far from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort. \u201cI felt I would have been making more of a statement if I had turned it down. It was a round of golf and nothing more.\u201d The Northern Irishman is teaming with Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff to raise money for coronavirus charities with Sunday\u2019s TaylorMade Driving Relief \u2013 a two-team skins challenge over 18 holes \u2013 at Seminole Golf Club in Juno Beach. McIlroy will team up with Johnson against Fowler and Wolff, with up to $3m (\u00a32.38m) going to the American Nurses Foundation and CDC Foundation. All four will follow strict physical-distancing measures and comprehensive testing will be used to protect players, TV staff and others at the course.",

Downing Street was determined to include target dates in Monday\u2019s 60-page Plan to Rebuild, although it admitted some measures may have to be delayed if the science recommends it. Ministers believe that businesses and public services \u2013 including schools \u2013 will only take the necessary measures to move to the next phase if they have concrete dates to work towards. Insiders cite Matt Hancock\u2019s 100,000-a-day testing target as an example. Nevertheless, the 1 June date for expanding the number of children being taught in classrooms and cared for by nurseries and childminders was one of the few clear announcements in Johnson\u2019s Sunday broadcast to the nation. Teaching unions responded with anger, complaining about a lack of detailed guidance on the measures they will be expected to put into place, and insisting that the science on the risks to children and teachers be published. To some extent, the row, which came in the same week as Keir Starmer painfully interrogated what he claimed was Johnson\u2019s failure to protect elderly care home residents at prime minister\u2019s questions, is a sign of the return of politics amid the coronavirus pandemic. After a ceasefire of several weeks, while the virus peaked and the prime minister was hospitalised, critics of the government\u2019s handling of the crisis have felt increasingly able to make themselves heard. The shadow education secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, has backed the unions\u2019 concerns, saying the government should agree to ensure that safety standards are met before more children are invited back through the gates. Now the government is starting to hit back.

On Friday, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, wrote of the need for teachers to \u201cdo their duty\u201d. Relations with unions appear to have been less smoothly managed over this issue than other aspects of the lockdown-easing plan. In recent weeks, unions and business groups once regarded by the Vote Leave veterans in No 10 as \u201cremoaner\u201d dinosaurs have found themselves sitting round the table, helping to thrash out the details of the unprecedented economic rescue, and more recently the \u201cCovid-secure\u201d rules for safe working. Williamson has repeatedly insisted that he has consulted unions - but they have complained of a lack of detailed discussions of the kind that took place across industrial sectors. Yet while they are determined to press for the 1 June date, ministers also know they need anxious parents to feel ready to send their children back into the classroom. Friday\u2019s meeting between union leaders and the government\u2019s scientific advisers, which took place without Williamson, saw the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, promise to publish more evidence. It was a sign that ministers realise, after successfully terrifying the nation with their \u201cStay Home, Save Lives\u201d message, they now need to be in the business of reassurance.

In his address on Sunday, Boris Johnson said: \u201cWe have the R below 1, between 0.5 and 0.9 \u2013 but potentially only just below 1.\u201d The slight increase and narrowing in range is not linked to lockdown relaxations this week as the estimate is based largely on hospital admissions and deaths data, which reflect the levels of transmission two to three weeks ago. A likely explanation is that while overall levels of infection have fallen, hospital and care home settings are making a relatively bigger contribution to the overall estimate of R.

The figure suggests that, while the lockdown has been effective at bringing down case numbers, R is still close to 1, meaning that it would not be possible to ease restrictions significantly without new measures to contain outbreaks, such as extensive testing and tracing. It comes as data showed that while London was a hotspot of infection at the start of the epidemic, attention is now shifting to the north of England, where transmission rates of Covid-19 appear to be falling far less steeply. Some epidemiological models suggest transmission rates in the capital are now half those seen in the north-east and Yorkshire, raising the question of whether all areas will be safe to emerge from lockdown at the same time. There is growing unease among civic leaders in the north of England at plans to ease lockdown rules, with one council leader branding it as \u201cfrankly, madness\u201d. The leader of Gateshead council, Martin Gannon, said on Friday that the advice to the public to \u201cstay at home\u201d would continue.

Johnson has generally been against \u201cnanny state\u201d interventions in the public\u2019s daily lives, an instinct some critics blamed for the government\u2019s reluctance to take draconian lockdown measures in the early stages of the coronavirus crisis. The government has not so far enacted plans set out in a green paper on preventive health in the final days of Theresa May\u2019s premiership, which included consulting on a ban on junk food advertising before 9pm. Early research has suggested that obesity may be a significant factor in determining the severity of Covid-19 cases. Johnson\u2019s spokesman said the government was examining the importance of this and other criteria. \u201cIt is critical to understand how factors such as ethnicity, deprivation, age, gender and obesity could be disproportionately impacting how people are affected by coronavirus,\u201d he said. \u201cPublic Health England launched a review into the factors affecting health outcomes from coronavirus, to include ethnicity, gender and obesity, and this will be published by the end of May,\u201d he added. The outcome could help the government tailor its advice to different groups during the coming months as the search for a vaccine continues. Several officials have said Johnson is entirely serious about the plan to improve public health, and is particularly focused on pushing through plans to get more people walking and cycling. One issue with this has been to ensure local authorities take the necessary action, but if central government provides financial support to regional transport systems, as has happened with Transport for London, the hope is that pressure can be exerted for rapid progress. As well as improving public health, the government is keen to ensure that as many people as possible who are returning to work as the lockdown eases avoid public transport.

In the other cases, people were sometimes charged under a law from a different country in the United Kingdom, such as people in England being charged under a Welsh law.</p> <p>Emergency legislation rushed in by government included regulations limiting movement and how and where people associated with each other.</p> <p>Another legal change, the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/7/contents/enacted\">Coronavirus Act</a>, allowed people suspected of being infected with the virus to be forcibly taken for testing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/what-are-your-new-rights-during-englands-lockdown\">What are your new rights during England's lockdown?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The CPS said every single one of the 44 charges brought under that act was wrong, because there was no evidence someone was infected.</p> <p>Thirty-one of the charges under the act were withdrawn and 13, where people were wrongly convicted, were returned to court for some other charge.</p> <p>Of those charged under the regulations stopping more than two people meeting and restricting movement, 12 out of 187 were wrongly charged. Seven cases were dropped on the day, and five convictions were later set aside.</p> <p>McGill said some errors were caused by officers in England applying the Welsh rules, which are tougher, and vice versa.</p> <p>Police and prosecutors say they have caught the errors and have corrected them.</p> <p>McGill said: \u201cThere\u2019s an expectation that we should get things right, and where we don\u2019t we should apologise, be open and transparent about what\u2019s gone wrong, and be open and transparent about what we are doing to try and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p> <p>Some of those wrongly charged were charged with other offences such as assaults on emergency workers, theft and burglary.</p> <p>Police had faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/30/uk-police-guidelines-coronavirus-lockdown-enforcement-powers-following-criticism-lord-sumption\">claims of overzealousness</a> and some officers confusing what was in the law with statements made by politicians.</p> <p>The human rights lawyer Kirsty Brimelow QC said: \u201cThe results are a shocking reflection of poor leadership and guidance by police chief constables, some of whom very publicly encouraged over-zealous policing by misstating the law.</p> <p>\u201cIn turn, the chief constables acted on the messages from politicians rather than focusing on making the law clear to the police on the street.\u201d</p> <p>Martin Hewitt, the chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, said the errors were \u201cinevitable\u201d given the laws were rushed and not subject to the usual checks and time to brief officers.</p> <p>Hewitt said: \u201cWe apologise for the mistakes \u2026 It is right that any errors have been quickly identified and are being corrected through the CPS\u2019s review process, and are also prevented by the additional safeguards now in place. Officers have received additional guidance on the correct use of legislation.\u201d</p> <p>Cases where the Coronavirus Act was wrongly appliedincluded someone who had driven from London to Leicester for a party.

      "bodyText": "Police and prosecutors got the emergency laws on coronavirus wrong dozens of times, leading to scores of people being wrongly charged and convicted, it has emerged. Police and the Crown Prosecution Service apologised for the errors and said the rushed nature of the laws and the pressure caused by the pandemic were to blame. Gregor McGill, the director of legal services at the CPS, said 175 people out of 231 had been charged correctly. In the other cases, people were sometimes charged under a law from a different country in the United Kingdom, such as people in England being charged under a Welsh law. Emergency legislation rushed in by government included regulations limiting movement and how and where people associated with each other. Another legal change, the Coronavirus Act, allowed people suspected of being infected with the virus to be forcibly taken for testing. The CPS said every single one of the 44 charges brought under that act was wrong, because there was no evidence someone was infected. Thirty-one of the charges under the act were withdrawn and 13, where people were wrongly convicted, were returned to court for some other charge. Of those charged under the regulations stopping more than two people meeting and restricting movement, 12 out of 187 were wrongly charged. Seven cases were dropped on the day, and five convictions were later set aside. McGill said some errors were caused by officers in England applying the Welsh rules, which are tougher, and vice versa. Police and prosecutors say they have caught the errors and have corrected them. McGill said: \u201cThere\u2019s an expectation that we should get things right, and where we don\u2019t we should apologise, be open and transparent about what\u2019s gone wrong, and be open and transparent about what we are doing to try and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Some of those wrongly charged were charged with other offences such as assaults on emergency workers, theft and burglary. Police had faced claims of overzealousness and some officers confusing what was in the law with statements made by politicians. The human rights lawyer Kirsty Brimelow QC said: \u201cThe results are a shocking reflection of poor leadership and guidance by police chief constables, some of whom very publicly encouraged over-zealous policing by misstating the law. \u201cIn turn, the chief constables acted on the messages from politicians rather than focusing on making the law clear to the police on the street.\u201d Martin Hewitt, the chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, said the errors were \u201cinevitable\u201d given the laws were rushed and not subject to the usual checks and time to brief officers. Hewitt said: \u201cWe apologise for the mistakes \u2026 It is right that any errors have been quickly identified and are being corrected through the CPS\u2019s review process, and are also prevented by the additional safeguards now in place. Officers have received additional guidance on the correct use of legislation.\u201d Cases where the Coronavirus Act was wrongly appliedincluded someone who had driven from London to Leicester for a party. Others included drinking in a park and people who refused to go home. It was not clear that these people were infected. The CPS said it will not put in fresh safeguards for any prosecution related to the coronavirus. This week the rules on movement and association were loosened in England, but not in the rest of the UK. As some police chiefs privately said the new rules were impossible to enforce, Hewitt insisted police still had a role in ensuring large groups do not gather or visit other people\u2019s house. Hewitt warned of more people going out this weekend amid good weather at beauty spots and beaches, with lockdown rules now eased in England. He said: \u201cNot just parks, but all big open spaces, undoubtedly are going to be much busier this weekend.\u201d Hewitt said most people would behave responsibly: \u201cNone of us want to get into a situation where the virus infection spreads more, and that we have to go into tighter lockdown measures.\u201d The total number of fines issued since 27 March when lockdown rules became law reached 13,445 in England by 11 May, with 799 in Wales. Most were for ignoring restrictions on movement. The last fortnight showed fewer fines being issued than previous two-week periods.",

      "body": "<p>Working humans are so much more than \u201cresources\u201d. This is one of the central lessons of the current crisis. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/04/care-workers-could-be-redeployed-to-uk-coronavirus-hotspots\">Caring</a> for the sick; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/people-are-so-thankful-how-delivery-drivers-became-the-new-emergency-service\">delivering food</a>, medication and other essentials; clearing away our waste; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/uk-coronavirus-frontline-key-workers-police-drivers-postal\">stocking the shelves</a> and running the registers in our grocery stores \u2013 the people who have kept life going through the Covid-19 pandemic are living proof that work cannot be reduced to a mere commodity. Human health and the care of the most vulnerable cannot be governed by market forces alone. If we leave these things solely to the market, we run the risk of exacerbating inequalities to the point of forfeiting the very lives of the least advantaged. </p> <p>How to avoid this unacceptable situation? By involving employees in decisions relating to their lives and futures in the workplace \u2013 by democratising firms. By decommodifying work \u2013 by collectively guaranteeing useful employment to all. As we face the monstrous risk of pandemic and environmental collapse, making these strategic changes would allow us to ensure the dignity of all citizens while marshalling the collective strength and effort we need to preserve our life together on this planet.</p> <p>Every morning, men and women, especially members of racialised communities, migrants and informal economy workers, rise to serve those among us who are able to remain under quarantine. They keep watch through the night. The dignity of their jobs needs no other explanation than that eloquently simple term \u201cessential worker\u201d. That term also reveals a key fact that capitalism has always sought to render invisible with another term, \u201chuman resource\u201d. Human beings are <em>not</em> one resource among many. Without labor investors, there would be no production, no services, no businesses at all.</p> <p>Every morning, quarantined men and women rise in their homes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/12/working-from-home-history-coronavirus-uk-lockdown\">fulfil from afar </a>the missions of the organisations for which they work. They work into the night. To those who believe that employees cannot be trusted to do their jobs without supervision, that workers require surveillance and external discipline, these men and women are proving the contrary. They are demonstrating, day and night, that workers are not one type of stakeholder among many: they hold the keys to their employers\u2019 success. They are the core constituency of the firm, but are, nonetheless, mostly excluded from participating in the government of their workplaces \u2013 a right monopolised by capital investors.</p> <p>To the question of how firms and how society as a whole might recognise the contributions of their employees in times of crisis, democracy is the answer. Certainly, we must close the yawning chasm of income inequality and raise the income floor \u2013 but that alone is not enough. After the two world wars, women\u2019s undeniable contribution to society helped win them the right to vote. By the same token, it is time to enfranchise workers.</p> <p>Representation of labour investors in the workplace has existed in Europe since the close of the second world war, through institutions known as <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=707&amp;langId=en&amp;intPageId=211\">works </a><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=707&amp;langId=en&amp;intPageId=211\">councils</a>. Yet these representative bodies have a weak voice at best in the government of firms, and are subordinate to the choices of the executive management teams appointed by shareholders. They have been unable to stop or even slow the relentless momentum of self-serving capital accumulation, ever more powerful in its destruction of our environment. These bodies should now be granted similar rights to those exercised by boards. To do so, firm governments (that is, top management) could be required to obtain double majority approval, from chambers representing workers as well as shareholders. </p> <p>In Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, different forms of codetermination (<em>Mitbestimmung</em>) put in place progressively after the second world war were a crucial step toward giving a voice to workers \u2013 but they are still insufficient to create actual citizenship in firms. Even in the United States, where worker organising and union rights have been considerably suppressed, there is now a growing call to give labour investors the right to elect representatives with a supermajority within boards. Issues such as the choice of a CEO, setting major strategies and profit distribution are too important to be left to shareholders alone. A personal investment of labour; that is, of one\u2019s mind and body, one\u2019s health \u2013 one\u2019s very life \u2013 ought to come with the collective right to validate or veto these decisions.</p> <p>This crisis also shows that work must not be treated as a commodity, that market mechanisms alone cannot be left in charge of the choices that affect our communities most deeply. For years now, jobs and supplies in the health sector have been subject to the guiding principle of profitability; today, the pandemic is revealing the extent to which this principle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/26/us-insurance-companies-coronavirus-hospitals\">has led us astray</a>. Certain strategic and collective needs must simply be made immune to such considerations. The rising body count across the globe is a terrible reminder that some things must never be treated as commodities. Those who continue arguing to the contrary are imperilling us with their dangerous ideology. Profitability is an intolerable yardstick when it comes to our health and our life on this planet.</p> <p>Decommodifying work means preserving certain sectors from the laws of the so-called free market; it also means ensuring that all people have access to work and the dignity it brings. One way to do this is with the creation of a job guarantee. Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reminds us that everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment. A job guarantee would not only offer each person access to work that allows them to live with dignity, it would also provide a crucial boost to our collective capability to meet the many pressing social and environmental challenges we currently face. Guaranteed employment would allow governments, working through local communities, to provide dignified work while contributing to the immense effort of fighting environmental collapse. Across the globe, as unemployment skyrockets, job guarantee programs can play a crucial role in assuring the social, economic, and environmental stability of our democratic societies. </p> <p>The European Union must include such a project in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/what-is-the-european-green-deal-and-will-it-really-cost-1tn\">green deal</a>. A review of the mission of the European Central Bank so that it could finance this program, which is necessary to our survival, would give it a legitimate place in the life of each and every citizen of the EU. A countercyclical solution to the explosive unemployment on the way, this program will prove a key contribution to the EU\u2019s prosperity.</p> <p> We should not react now with the same innocence as in 2008, when we responded to the economic crisis with an unconditional bailout that swelled public debt while demanding nothing in return. If our governments step in to save businesses in the current crisis, then businesses must step in as well, and meet the general basic conditions of democracy. In the name of the democratic societies they serve, and which constitute them, in the name of their responsibility to ensure our survival on this planet, our governments must make their aid to firms conditional on certain changes to their behaviours. In addition to hewing to strict environmental standards, firms must be required to fulfil certain conditions of democratic internal government. A successful transition from environmental destruction to environmental recovery and regeneration will be best led by democratically governed firms, in which the voices of those who invest their labor carry the same weight as those who invest their capital when it comes to strategic decisions. </p> <p>We have had more than enough time to see what happens when labor, the planet, and capital gains are placed in the balance under the current system: labor and the planet always lose. Thanks to <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es102641n\">research from the University of Cambridge</a>, we know that \u201cachievable design changes\u201d could reduce global energy consumption by 73%. But those changes are labor intensive, and require choices that are often costlier over the short term. So long as firms are run in ways that seek to maximise profit for their capital investors alone, and in a world where energy is cheap, why make these changes? Despite the challenges of this transition, certain socially minded or co-operatively run businesses \u2013 pursuing hybrid goals that take financial, social and environmental considerations into account, and developing democratic internal governments \u2013 have already shown the potential of such positive impact.</p> <p>Let us fool ourselves no longer: left to their own devices, most capital investors will not care for the dignity of labour investors, nor will they lead the fight against environmental catastrophe. Another option is available. Democratise firms; decommodify work; stop treating human beings as resources so that we can focus together on sustaining life on this planet.</p> <p>\u2022 Isabelle Ferreras (University of Louvain/FNRS-Harvard LWP), Julie Battilana (Harvard University), Dominique M\u00e9da (University of Paris Dauphine PLS), Julia Cag\u00e9 (Sciences Po-Paris), Lisa Herzog (University of Groningen), Sara Lafuente Hernandez (University of Brussels-ETUI), H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Landemore (Yale University), Pavlina Tcherneva (Bard College-Levy Institute), Miranda Richmont Mouillot, Israr Qureshi (Autralian National University), Clare Wright (La Trobe University), Isabelle Martin (University of Montr\u00e9al), Neera Chandhoke (Delhi University), Lukas Clark-Memler (University of Oxford), Alberto Alemanno (HEC Paris-NYU Law), Elizabeth Anderson (University of Michigan), Philippe Ask\u00e9nazy (CNRS-Paris School of Economics), Aur\u00e9lien Barrau (CNRS et Universit\u00e9 Grenoble-Alpes), Adelle Blackett (McGill University), Neil Brenner (Harvard University), Craig Calhoun (Arizona State University), Ha-Joon Chang (University of Cambridge), Erica Chenoweth (Harvard University), Joshua Cohen (Apple University, Berkeley, Boston Review), Christophe Dejours (CNAM), Olivier De Schutter (UCLouvain, UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights), Nancy Fraser (The New School for Social Research, NYC), Archon Fung (Harvard University), Javati Ghosh (Jawaharlal Nehru University), Stephen Gliessman (UC Santa Cruz), Hans R.

      "bodyText": "Working humans are so much more than \u201cresources\u201d. This is one of the central lessons of the current crisis. Caring for the sick; delivering food, medication and other essentials; clearing away our waste; stocking the shelves and running the registers in our grocery stores \u2013 the people who have kept life going through the Covid-19 pandemic are living proof that work cannot be reduced to a mere commodity. Human health and the care of the most vulnerable cannot be governed by market forces alone. If we leave these things solely to the market, we run the risk of exacerbating inequalities to the point of forfeiting the very lives of the least advantaged. How to avoid this unacceptable situation? By involving employees in decisions relating to their lives and futures in the workplace \u2013 by democratising firms. By decommodifying work \u2013 by collectively guaranteeing useful employment to all. As we face the monstrous risk of pandemic and environmental collapse, making these strategic changes would allow us to ensure the dignity of all citizens while marshalling the collective strength and effort we need to preserve our life together on this planet. Every morning, men and women, especially members of racialised communities, migrants and informal economy workers, rise to serve those among us who are able to remain under quarantine. They keep watch through the night. The dignity of their jobs needs no other explanation than that eloquently simple term \u201cessential worker\u201d. That term also reveals a key fact that capitalism has always sought to render invisible with another term, \u201chuman resource\u201d. Human beings are not one resource among many. Without labor investors, there would be no production, no services, no businesses at all. Every morning, quarantined men and women rise in their homes to fulfil from afar the missions of the organisations for which they work. They work into the night. To those who believe that employees cannot be trusted to do their jobs without supervision, that workers require surveillance and external discipline, these men and women are proving the contrary. They are demonstrating, day and night, that workers are not one type of stakeholder among many: they hold the keys to their employers\u2019 success. They are the core constituency of the firm, but are, nonetheless, mostly excluded from participating in the government of their workplaces \u2013 a right monopolised by capital investors. To the question of how firms and how society as a whole might recognise the contributions of their employees in times of crisis, democracy is the answer. Certainly, we must close the yawning chasm of income inequality and raise the income floor \u2013 but that alone is not enough. After the two world wars, women\u2019s undeniable contribution to society helped win them the right to vote. By the same token, it is time to enfranchise workers. Representation of labour investors in the workplace has existed in Europe since the close of the second world war, through institutions known as works councils. Yet these representative bodies have a weak voice at best in the government of firms, and are subordinate to the choices of the executive management teams appointed by shareholders. They have been unable to stop or even slow the relentless momentum of self-serving capital accumulation, ever more powerful in its destruction of our environment. These bodies should now be granted similar rights to those exercised by boards. To do so, firm governments (that is, top management) could be required to obtain double majority approval, from chambers representing workers as well as shareholders. In Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, different forms of codetermination (Mitbestimmung) put in place progressively after the second world war were a crucial step toward giving a voice to workers \u2013 but they are still insufficient to create actual citizenship in firms. Even in the United States, where worker organising and union rights have been considerably suppressed, there is now a growing call to give labour investors the right to elect representatives with a supermajority within boards. Issues such as the choice of a CEO, setting major strategies and profit distribution are too important to be left to shareholders alone. A personal investment of labour; that is, of one\u2019s mind and body, one\u2019s health \u2013 one\u2019s very life \u2013 ought to come with the collective right to validate or veto these decisions. This crisis also shows that work must not be treated as a commodity, that market mechanisms alone cannot be left in charge of the choices that affect our communities most deeply. For years now, jobs and supplies in the health sector have been subject to the guiding principle of profitability; today, the pandemic is revealing the extent to which this principle has led us astray. Certain strategic and collective needs must simply be made immune to such considerations. The rising body count across the globe is a terrible reminder that some things must never be treated as commodities. Those who continue arguing to the contrary are imperilling us with their dangerous ideology. Profitability is an intolerable yardstick when it comes to our health and our life on this planet. Decommodifying work means preserving certain sectors from the laws of the so-called free market; it also means ensuring that all people have access to work and the dignity it brings. One way to do this is with the creation of a job guarantee. Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reminds us that everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment. A job guarantee would not only offer each person access to work that allows them to live with dignity, it would also provide a crucial boost to our collective capability to meet the many pressing social and environmental challenges we currently face. Guaranteed employment would allow governments, working through local communities, to provide dignified work while contributing to the immense effort of fighting environmental collapse. Across the globe, as unemployment skyrockets, job guarantee programs can play a crucial role in assuring the social, economic, and environmental stability of our democratic societies. The European Union must include such a project in its green deal. A review of the mission of the European Central Bank so that it could finance this program, which is necessary to our survival, would give it a legitimate place in the life of each and every citizen of the EU. A countercyclical solution to the explosive unemployment on the way, this program will prove a key contribution to the EU\u2019s prosperity. We should not react now with the same innocence as in 2008, when we responded to the economic crisis with an unconditional bailout that swelled public debt while demanding nothing in return. If our governments step in to save businesses in the current crisis, then businesses must step in as well, and meet the general basic conditions of democracy. In the name of the democratic societies they serve, and which constitute them, in the name of their responsibility to ensure our survival on this planet, our governments must make their aid to firms conditional on certain changes to their behaviours. In addition to hewing to strict environmental standards, firms must be required to fulfil certain conditions of democratic internal government. A successful transition from environmental destruction to environmental recovery and regeneration will be best led by democratically governed firms, in which the voices of those who invest their labor carry the same weight as those who invest their capital when it comes to strategic decisions. We have had more than enough time to see what happens when labor, the planet, and capital gains are placed in the balance under the current system: labor and the planet always lose. Thanks to research from the University of Cambridge, we know that \u201cachievable design changes\u201d could reduce global energy consumption by 73%. But those changes are labor intensive, and require choices that are often costlier over the short term. So long as firms are run in ways that seek to maximise profit for their capital investors alone, and in a world where energy is cheap, why make these changes? Despite the challenges of this transition, certain socially minded or co-operatively run businesses \u2013 pursuing hybrid goals that take financial, social and environmental considerations into account, and developing democratic internal governments \u2013 have already shown the potential of such positive impact. Let us fool ourselves no longer: left to their own devices, most capital investors will not care for the dignity of labour investors, nor will they lead the fight against environmental catastrophe. Another option is available. Democratise firms; decommodify work; stop treating human beings as resources so that we can focus together on sustaining life on this planet. \u2022 Isabelle Ferreras (University of Louvain/FNRS-Harvard LWP), Julie Battilana (Harvard University), Dominique M\u00e9da (University of Paris Dauphine PLS), Julia Cag\u00e9 (Sciences Po-Paris), Lisa Herzog (University of Groningen), Sara Lafuente Hernandez (University of Brussels-ETUI), H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Landemore (Yale University), Pavlina Tcherneva (Bard College-Levy Institute), Miranda Richmont Mouillot, Israr Qureshi (Autralian National University), Clare Wright (La Trobe University), Isabelle Martin (University of Montr\u00e9al), Neera Chandhoke (Delhi University), Lukas Clark-Memler (University of Oxford), Alberto Alemanno (HEC Paris-NYU Law), Elizabeth Anderson (University of Michigan), Philippe Ask\u00e9nazy (CNRS-Paris School of Economics), Aur\u00e9lien Barrau (CNRS et Universit\u00e9 Grenoble-Alpes), Adelle Blackett (McGill University), Neil Brenner (Harvard University), Craig Calhoun (Arizona State University), Ha-Joon Chang (University of Cambridge), Erica Chenoweth (Harvard University), Joshua Cohen (Apple University, Berkeley, Boston Review), Christophe Dejours (CNAM), Olivier De Schutter (UCLouvain, UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights), Nancy Fraser (The New School for Social Research, NYC), Archon Fung (Harvard University), Javati Ghosh (Jawaharlal Nehru University), Stephen Gliessman (UC Santa Cruz), Hans R.

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Europe could see second wave of winter infections, WHO warns European countries face a deadly second wave of infections in the winter, the World Health Organization\u2019s top official in Europe says. Dr Hans Kluge, the director for the WHO European region, warned countries beginning to ease their lockdown restrictions that now is \u201ctime for preparation, not celebration\u201d. Dr Kluge told the Telegraph countries should use the current period to build capacity in hospitals and strengthen public health systems. Denmark reports zero deaths for first time since March Denmark reports zero deaths on Friday \u2013 the first time it has seen none in a 24-hour period since 13 March. The country\u2019s total number of confirmed cases rises by 78 to 10,791, while the number of hospitalisations falls by 10 to 137. The death toll remains unchanged at 537. Italian death and infection rates fall Italy reports 242 more fatalities, down by 20 on the number seen in the previous 24 hours. That brings its death toll to 31,610 as it prepares to ease lockdown restrictions. New infections rise by 789, which is about 200 fewer than the previous 24 hours, according to the civil protection authority. Restaurants, bars, hairdressers and beauty salons are due to reopen on Monday, while the ban on inter-regional travel might be lifted from 3 June. Spain hails large-scale antibody study The Spanish government hails a large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight efforts to end the pandemic, but warns that any premature or irresponsible relaxation of restrictions could have \u201cenormous consequences\u201d given that only 5% of Spaniards have had the disease. The country\u2019s Socialist-led coalition government is under growing pressure from political opponents to end the two-month state of emergency that underpins one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe. Second Brazilian health minister resigns after less than a month Brazil\u2019s health minister, Nelson Teich, has handed in his resignation after less than a month on the job, his office says. Brazil has now surpassed Germany and France in terms of infections and had more than 200,000 confirmed cases as of Thursday. All charges under UK epidemic laws brought incorrectly Dozens of people in the UK were wrongly charged by police under new coronavirus laws, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) says. All 44 charges brought under the Coronavirus Act since it was introduced on 27 March were incorrect. And 12 charges under the Health Protection Regulations 2020, which give powers to break up gatherings and fine people breaching restriction of movement rules, were also wrong. British lockdown plan questioned as reproduction rate dangerously high Transmission rates remain close to the levels that could cause the epidemic in the UK to start to grow again, according to the government\u2019s latest estimates, raising questions about the extent to which restrictions can be safely eased in the coming weeks. The latest official estimate places the national R value \u2013 the rate at which people are passing on infections to others \u2013 at between 0.7 and 1. An R value greater than 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases.",

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus pandemic has halted production of Brazil\u2019s steamy telenovela soap operas \u2013 but one small-screen blockbuster is on everyone\u2019s lips. A two-hour video of a heated and expletive-ridden cabinet meeting chaired by President Jair Bolsonaro last month has become the subject of an extraordinary political arm-wrestle, exposing the intrigues and eccentricities at the centre of Brazilian power. \u201cThis meeting is the perfect portrait of the Bolsonaro administration,\u201d said Bruno Boghossian, a columnist for the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper in Brazil\u2019s political capital, Bras\u00edlia. \u201cConspiracy theories, ideological issues, made-up battles, and culture wars \u2013 all right there at the heart of government.\u201d The video of the supposedly private plenum on 22 April was unexpectedly thrust into the public domain by the resignation of Bolsonaro\u2019s justice minister, Sergio Moro, two days later. Moro says the images contain key evidence supporting his allegation that Bolsonaro tried to meddle in federal police business and must be released as part of a supreme court investigation into those claims. The footage was privately screened for investigators this week but has yet to be made public. Even before its release, however, the video is casting a profoundly embarrassing, and potentially compromising light on Bolsonaro and the far-right administration he has led since January 2019. A partial transcript \u2013 produced by the attorney general\u2019s office on Thursday \u2013 and a succession of excruciating leaks offer a tantalising glimpse of the world of paranoia, radicalism and curse words around the leader of the world\u2019s fourth-largest democracy. \u201cI\u2019m not going to wait for [the federal police] to fuck my family and friends just for shits and giggles,\u201d Bolsonaro fumes at one point, according to the official account, apparently in reference to police inquiries involving his politician sons. Elsewhere Bolsonaro allegedly brands S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s governor a \u201cshit\u201d, calls Rio\u2019s governor \u201cmanure\u201d and seems to recognize the chaos engulfing his government, as it faces economic meltdown and a public health crisis that has claimed more than 14,000 Brazilian lives. On Friday, Bolsonaro\u2019s government suffered a further blow when his health minsiter resigned less than a month after taking the job. \u201cThe ship is sinking,\u201d Bolsonaro is quoted as saying by the Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo during the assembly at the presidential palace. Bolsonaro is not the only person compromised by the footage. Reports suggest his intelligence chief, Gen Augusto Heleno, lambasted the Communist party leaders of Brazil\u2019s most important trade partner, China, during the encounter. The foreign minister, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, also reportedly attacked Beijing, accusing it of responsibility for the spread of what he calls the \u201ccommunavirus\u201d. (One report this week suggested China\u2019s ambassador to Brazil had unfollowed Ara\u00fajo on Twitter because of the alleged comments.) On Wednesday Heleno tweeted that releasing footage containing \u201cconfidential and even secret matters\u201d was \u201can unpatriotic act, almost an attack on national security\u201d. Another cameo reportedly comes from the education minister, Abraham Weintraub. The magazine Veja has reported that during the assembly Weintraub calls for the imprisonment of Brazil\u2019s supreme court judges and calls his country\u2019s capital a \u201ccancer\u201d and \u201ccrap\u201d. Another outlet, UOL, claimed Weintraub admitted \u201chating\u201d the expression \u201cindigenous peoples\u201d. \u201cMy remarks are republican and polite,\u201d Weintraub said on Twitter this week, adding that he was not in the habit of using blue language. Bolsonaro\u2019s economy minister, Paulo Guedes, apparently is. On Friday he was reported to have told the meeting the government needed to hurry up and sell \u201cthe fucking Bank of Brazil\u201d. The outbursts \u2013 coupled with Bolsonaro\u2019s potentially incriminating remarks about wanting to change the head of Brazil\u2019s federal police \u2013 explain the legal battle currently raging to prevent the video seeing the light of day. Bolsonaro\u2019s foes, who now include Moro, are demanding its immediate release. But on Thursday the attorney general, Augusto Aras, warned broadcasting the video could provoke \u201cpublic instability\u201d and spark a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d targeting members of Bolsonaro\u2019s administration. Boghossian said the government\u2019s reluctance to release the footage was unsurprising. The images showed a president who was \u201ccornered and surrounded\u201d and a country that was directionless and hostage to \u201cideological mumbo jumbo\u201d. One supreme court justice was this week reported to have branded the meeting the \u201creuni\u00e3o de insanos\u201d \u2013 an assembly of the insane. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty apt description,\u201d Boghossian said.",

      "bodyText": "Beijing has stepped up the pressure on European states to reject Taiwan\u2019s call to be represented at next week\u2019s assembly of the World Health Organization, arguing that its presence can only be justified if it accepts that it is part of China. The World Health Assembly is being held virtually on Monday, and Taiwan\u2019s attendance \u2013 as well as a possible international inquiry into the start of the pandemic \u2013 are likely to be the two big political flashpoints between China and the west. Chinese diplomats have been contacting governments across Europe to limit the diplomatic support for Taiwan\u2019s attendance, targeting northern and eastern European states. Maintaining collective EU unity on China is proving difficult. But in a letter to the Guardian, the former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former president of Poland Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski and the former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt argue that Taiwan should be permitted to attend because of its pioneering response to the pandemic, which has drawn on the lessons of the 2003 Sars outbreak. \u201cIt is regretful that geopolitics has prevented Taiwan from fully accessing the forums and services of the World Health Organization \u2013 not least as the WHO could have benefited from its expertise,\u201d the authors argue. Taiwan had observer status at the WHO for seven years until 2016, when it was blocked by China, as it has been every year since. Beijing believes Taiwan is deploying the WHO issue as a route to recognition internationally. Donald Trump \u2013 locked into a multifaceted dispute with China \u2013 is already withholding US funds from the WHO, which he describes as \u201cChina-centric.\u201d He has led the calls for Taiwan to be admitted to the UN body, and support is also coming from Australia, the UK, Japan, Canada, Germany and New Zealand. China is also concerned it may be losing the support of India on the issue. Rasmussen argues next week\u2019s assembly could prove a turning point in the fight against coronavirus, saying the pandemic has underlined the importance of robust multilateral coordination. In the letter, Rasmussen claims Taiwan\u2019s success in controlling the virus shows the country has lessons to teach the rest of the world, adding its attendance \u201cwill have no wider implications than to ensure that 23 million people with something to offer are not excluded from exchanging best practices\u201d. Taiwan\u2019s health minister, Chen Shih-chung, said on Friday his country could not accept China\u2019s conditions for its participation. \u201cWe have no way to accept something that does not exist,\u201d Chen replied, referring to China\u2019s demand that Taipei agree to its \u201cone China\u201d policy to attend the assembly. WHO officials say the director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cannot invite Taiwan since there are divergent views on the issue within. The EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, has called for an independent inquiry into the crisis, writing: \u201cTo strengthen our defences against future pandemics, we also need a thorough, independent scientific inquiry into the origins of the crisis.\u201d China has been resistant, and the terms of any inquiry, as well as its timing, will be contested. Last month, Tedros himself accused Taiwan of racist \u201cattacks\u201d over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, an allegation that Taiwan denied as \u201cunprovoked and untrue\u201d. Tedros\u2019s claim came after Taiwan said in March that the organization had ignored its December warnings that human-to-human transmission of coronavirus was possible. A WHO tweet on 14 January said: \u201cPreliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.\u201d But documents show that the international body warned the US and other countries about the risk of human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 as early as 10 January. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has dismissed claims of Chinese dominance at the WHO as rumour and smear-mongering.",

The latest data from Sage is based on the levels of transmission from two to three weeks ago, calling into question whether England should be easing its lockdown restrictions just yet.</li> \n   <li><strong>More than a quarter of all care home deaths in England and Wales since the beginning of the crisis involved Covid-19, data from the ONS revealed.</strong> In the period from 2 March to 1 May, there were 45,899 registered deaths of care home residents in England and Wales, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/coronavirus-care-home-residents-deaths-england-wales\">12,526 (27.3%) of which involved the virus</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>All care home residents and staff in England will be tested for Covid-19 by early June, the health secretary announced.</strong> It came as Matt Hancock outlined plans for a \u00a3600m funding boost for the social care sector, after the government came under fierce criticism this week for acting too slowly to contain the spread of the virus in care homes.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Welsh government published its roadmap for easing the lockdown in Wales, keeping the \u2018stay home\u2019 message in place for another two weeks.</strong> The traffic light system will move from lockdown into the \u201cfirst cautious step\u201d of the red zone, then the amber zone, and finally the green zone. The traffic light categories will apply to different aspects of daily life and activities, which may well happen at different rates.</li> \n   <li><strong>Schools in Wales will not fully reopen before September, Mark Drakeford confirmed.</strong> But he said the ambition remained for some cohorts of children to return to school before the summer holidays.</li> \n   <li><strong>Transport for London is to raise the congestion charge by 30% to secure a \u00a31.6bn government bailout after it took a 90% hit to its revenue due to the pandemic.</strong> The capital\u2019s congestion charge of \u00a311.50 will be reimposed from Monday, as will the separate \u00a312.50 charge imposed on vehicles with high emissions entering central London. This will rise to \u00a315 from 22 June, with enforcement extended from weekdays to the whole week and for longer hours. Free travel for under-18s will also be temporarily suspended, so too for people over 60 or with a disability during peak hours.</li> \n   <li><strong>\u201cVery little progress\u201d has been made in the latest round of Brexit talks, the UK\u2019s chief negotiator said.</strong> David Frost said the EU\u2019s demands on a level playing field for trade was \u201cthe major obstacle\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from the UK today.

An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e60c6aea-b500-4a5a-b6af-b1d99f7d0511\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n    <div>\n     <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n      <p></p>\n      <p>R, or the 'effective reproduction number', is a way of rating a disease\u2019s ability to spread. It\u2019s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out \u2013 eventually.</p>\n      <p>At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 \u2013 higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.</p>\n      <p>The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus; people's behaviour, such as social distancing;&nbsp;and a population\u2019s immunity. A country may see regional variations in its R number, depending on local factors like population density and transport patterns.</p>\n      <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin\"><b>Hannah Devlin</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Science correspondent</i></p>\n      <p></p>\n     </div>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The range is slightly higher than that quoted by officials in recent weeks.

Lockdown restrictions have less impact in these settings and there are still concerns about the levels of testing available in care homes.</p> \n  <p>The figure suggests that, while the lockdown has been extremely effective at bringing down case numbers, R is still close to 1, meaning that it would not be possible to ease restrictions significantly without new measures to contain outbreaks, such as extensive testing and tracing.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T15:57:15.171Z\">at 4.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebeb3148f0849a584fe145a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T15:23:53.499Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>People wrongly charged under coronavirus laws have included a teenager fined after going to visit his mother and a woman arrested at a train station.</p> \n  <p>Marie Dinou, 41, was held by British Transport Police at Newcastle Central station just days after the Coronavirus Act came into force and wrongly fined \u00a3660.</p> \n  <p>Her case was an early warning that the legislation \u2013 which allows officers to remove or detain a \u201csuspected infectious person\u201d for screening and assessment \u2013 was being misused by police.</p> \n  <p>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has now admitted all 44 charges under the act, from when it was introduced on 27 March to the end of April, were wrong, following a review launched after errors were highlighted by journalists, lawyers and campaigners.</p> \n  <p>Thirty-one of the wrongful charges were corrected in court, but included 13 convictions, which have since been sent back to be withdrawn.</p> \n  <p>Lewis Brown, 18, was fined for allegedly breaching lockdown rules after going to visit his mother.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s R rate is still dangerously close to one, having risen in the past week to between 0.7 and 1, bringing lockdown-easing moves into question. An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which wold result in a second wave of cases. The latest data from Sage is based on the levels of transmission from two to three weeks ago, calling into question whether England should be easing its lockdown restrictions just yet. More than a quarter of all care home deaths in England and Wales since the beginning of the crisis involved Covid-19, data from the ONS revealed. In the period from 2 March to 1 May, there were 45,899 registered deaths of care home residents in England and Wales, 12,526 (27.3%) of which involved the virus. All care home residents and staff in England will be tested for Covid-19 by early June, the health secretary announced. It came as Matt Hancock outlined plans for a \u00a3600m funding boost for the social care sector, after the government came under fierce criticism this week for acting too slowly to contain the spread of the virus in care homes. The Welsh government published its roadmap for easing the lockdown in Wales, keeping the \u2018stay home\u2019 message in place for another two weeks. The traffic light system will move from lockdown into the \u201cfirst cautious step\u201d of the red zone, then the amber zone, and finally the green zone. The traffic light categories will apply to different aspects of daily life and activities, which may well happen at different rates. Schools in Wales will not fully reopen before September, Mark Drakeford confirmed. But he said the ambition remained for some cohorts of children to return to school before the summer holidays. Transport for London is to raise the congestion charge by 30% to secure a \u00a31.6bn government bailout after it took a 90% hit to its revenue due to the pandemic. The capital\u2019s congestion charge of \u00a311.50 will be reimposed from Monday, as will the separate \u00a312.50 charge imposed on vehicles with high emissions entering central London. This will rise to \u00a315 from 22 June, with enforcement extended from weekdays to the whole week and for longer hours. Free travel for under-18s will also be temporarily suspended, so too for people over 60 or with a disability during peak hours. \u201cVery little progress\u201d has been made in the latest round of Brexit talks, the UK\u2019s chief negotiator said. David Frost said the EU\u2019s demands on a level playing field for trade was \u201cthe major obstacle\u201d. That\u2019s it from the UK today. If you\u2019d like to continue following the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. Q. What does the government intend to do to ease the double pressures on businesses in Northern Ireland impacted by the lockdown and by pending Brexit border checks? Hancock says the government intends to deliver on the referendum result. Q. Given that the devolved regions are now leaving lockdown at different rates and with different R rates, will you be advising measures such as temperature checks at ports and airports for people travelling between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK? Harries says there may be times when differential policies will have to apply, whether that\u2019s within England or between the different countries of the UK. This will come as we gather more evidence on the different populations, she adds. She adds that temperature checks for Covid-19 isn\u2019t a very valid intervention because of the 14-day incubation period. That\u2019s the end of the press conference. Q. Some care homes are not telling residents and their families how many infections and deaths with coronavirus they have had, should that be made publicly available? Hancock says he didn\u2019t know about this and would like to look into it. Transparency is the best forward, he says. Harries adds that some care homes are very small, so we need to be careful about disclosing clinical information. She adds that it isn\u2019t always easy to pinpoint the overriding cause of death. Q. Do you think the prime minister should correct what he said in parliament, given that the only directive on a ban on care home visits came on 2 April, 10 ten days after the national lockdown? Hancock says that on 13 March, extra guidance was introduced, after which many care home providers stopped visitors. This guidance was strengthened \u201call along\u201d, he adds. He then moved swiftly on. The question referred to Boris Johnson\u2019s claim during PMQs that it \u201cwasn\u2019t true\u201d that as late as 12 March the care home sector had been advised that it was unlikely to face an outbreak. Labour has asked for the prime minister to return to the Commons to correct the record. Q. What does the government consider an acceptable level of risk when it comes to reopening schools? Q. What consequences would schools face if they refuse to reopen because the risk is too great? Hancock says reopening schools has to be \u201ca team effort\u201d and accepts it\u2019s a \u201chuge challenge\u201d. Kanani says that risk is relative; the government wouldn\u2019t send children back unless it was safe to do so, which is why it will be phased and careful. Harries adds the risk should be kept in perspective. The likelihood of anyone having the disease by the time schools do reopen will be diminished. There are longer term health risks of not getting a good education, she adds. Q. Lots of very vulnerable people in care homes who are under the age of 65 with multiple health conditions and problems and also those with learning disabilities can\u2019t apply for tests on the portal [it\u2019s currently only only open to those over 65 and those with dementia] \u2013 why have they been left out? Hancock acknowledges that those in care homes who are working age and are clinically vulnerable need support. We\u2019re rolling that out, he says. Harries adds there is a very stark variation in risk for the elderly, compared to all other variables. Q. Are people with learning disabilities being put at the back of the queue? Hancock says the government is following the clinical advice on individual risks in terms of applying testing capability. Q. Why do you collectively appear quite relaxed that the R rate is up today, and the latest R rate suggests transmission of the disease might not be reducing? Will you reconsider the timetable for lifting England\u2019s lockdown? Hancock says the R is based on data from several weeks ago so there is a lag, but it is still an important tool for policy makers. The R is still below 1, he adds. Harries adds that R is a very standard way of comparing what\u2019s happening and is an important measure, but the real outcome we need is a reduction in the number of cases. It\u2019s not just the R value, it\u2019s the triangulation of all the evidence we have, she adds. It\u2019s an important measure but not the only one. Q. On a day when the R is up, are you absolutely confident that allowing an easing of measures ahead of a sunny, warm weekend is the right decision? Hancock says R isn\u2019t above 1, so it still meets the test. People must observe physical distancing measures, he adds. They are taking questions from the media now. Q. Are the measures you set out today too little too late, given the high numbers of deaths of care home residents? Hancock says throughout the crisis the government has supported those in care homes. Kanani adds primary care support for care home residents has been \u201cramped up\u201d in recent weeks. Q. If the R rate has increased [see 16.51], are you re-thinking the easing of the lockdown? Hancock says the R is being kept constantly under review. It\u2019s one of the government\u2019s five tests to keep the R below 1, he says. Current estimates are that it\u2019s between 0.7 and 1, which still meets the test, he adds. Q. Anna from Worthing asks if the government recognises that nursing is a highly skilled profession that deserves better pay. Hancock says it is a highly skilled profession that deserves decent pay. He says pay for nurses went up last year. He adds that as health secretary he will \u201cfight to have that fair reward\u201d for nurses. They are taking questions from members of the public now. Q. Susanna from Oxford asks if the government\u2019s alert level 1 - eradication of coronavirus in the UK - is a realistic target. Harries says it\u2019s an ambitious target. In global terms, there isn\u2019t an immediate easy outcome to achieve this, she says. Smallpox is the only disease we have eradicated, but having the ambition is good, she says. Understanding antibody response and immunity in the population, treatments and a vaccine are ongoing areas, she says. The immediate effort is to reduce the number of cases, she adds. The number of deaths confirmed with a positive test across all settings is steadily decreasing, Harries says. London had a severe and sharper rise in hospitalisations, this is coming down now, Harries says. Across the UK, the numbers are flattening off, she says, but we need to continue adhering to physical distancing measures to make good progress. Hospital admissions are falling but it is a \u201cslow, careful\u201d downward trend, so must continue to observe physical distancing, Harries says. Testing is on the rise, with 3,560 positive cases recorded in the last 24 hours, Harries says. Despite the rise in testing and increased likelihood of finding new cases, the number of new cases is continuing to come down, she says. Around 44% of employed adults worked from home between 24 April and 3 May, compared to around 12% last year, Harries says. And 80% of adults only left their home for the permitted reasons, if at all, she adds. There has been a rise in the use of parks this week and physical distancing measures must be observed. Dr Jenny Harries is going through the daily slides now. The R number - the average number of additional people infected by each infected person - is currently estimated to be between 0.7 and 1, she says. Based on an ONS survey, the slide shows an estimate that 148,000 people in England have had Covid-19 between 27 April and 10 May. A national average of 0.27% people in the community have been infected in that period, she says. This is an average across the country, Harries says. In places where people have been able to better physically distance, the rate will be lower, she adds. This Guardian video explainer is really useful in explaining very clearly what the R number is. All care home residents and staff in England, both with and without symptoms, are now being tested, Hancock says. Every resident and member of staff will be tested between now and June, he says, and every care home in England will have a named clinical lead. In April, 31,203 people died in care homes. Of those, 11,560 died with coronavirus, Hancock says, quoting figures from the ONS report. For the vast majority of people, staying alert still means staying home as much as possible, Hanocock says. Washing your hands regularly is still the single most effective thing you can do to keep safe, he adds. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 is 13% lower than this time last week and the number of deaths is falling each day in all settings \u2013 we are past the peak, Hancock says. The health and social care secretary is speaking now. He is going over the daily figures on testing, positive cases, hospitalisations and deaths. Details of these can be found here. The government\u2019s daily news briefing is due to begin shortly and will be fronted by the health and social care secretary Matt Hancock. He will be joined by England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries and Dr Nikki Kanani, the medical director of primary care for NHS England. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the prison estate in England and Wales continues to rise, Ministry of Justice figures show. As of 5pm on Thursday, 405 prisoners had tested positive for the coronavirus across 74 prisons, a rise of just 0.2% in 24 hours, while the number of infected staff increased by 4% to 586 workers across 71 prisons. There are around 80,000 prisoners in England and Wales across 117 prisons, while around 33,000 staff work in the public sector prisons. It emerged on Friday that the MoJ purchased 2,000 electronic monitoring tags for prisoners released early under emergency measures that have only seen 57 inmates freed. When the scheme was announced, it was said up to 4,000 were eligible. The department insisted the scheme was still running but would look for alternative uses for any surplus tags not used. The prison service is to roll out secure video calls to inmates at 10 prisons and youth offender institutions (YOIs), it was announced on Friday. Prisons are operating under a heavily restrictive regime, which includes a ban on visits. Transmission rates of Covid-19 remain dangerously close to the levels that could cause the epidemic in the UK to start to grow again, according to the government\u2019s latest estimates, raising questions about the extent to which restrictions can be safely eased in the coming weeks. The latest official estimate places the national R value - the rate at which people are passing on infections to others \u2013 at between 0.7 and 1. An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases. The range is slightly higher than that quoted by officials in recent weeks. When announcing plans to ease some lockdown restrictions on Sunday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said: We have the R below one, between 0.5 and 0.9 \u2013 but potentially only just below one. The slight increase, and narrowing in the range, is not linked to relaxations that have occurred this week as the estimate is based largely on hospital admissions and deaths data, which reflect the levels of transmission two to three weeks ago. A likely explanation is that as the overall levels of infection have fallen, hospital and care home settings are making a relatively bigger contribution to the overall estimate of R. Lockdown restrictions have less impact in these settings and there are still concerns about the levels of testing available in care homes. The figure suggests that, while the lockdown has been extremely effective at bringing down case numbers, R is still close to 1, meaning that it would not be possible to ease restrictions significantly without new measures to contain outbreaks, such as extensive testing and tracing. People wrongly charged under coronavirus laws have included a teenager fined after going to visit his mother and a woman arrested at a train station. Marie Dinou, 41, was held by British Transport Police at Newcastle Central station just days after the Coronavirus Act came into force and wrongly fined \u00a3660. Her case was an early warning that the legislation \u2013 which allows officers to remove or detain a \u201csuspected infectious person\u201d for screening and assessment \u2013 was being misused by police. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has now admitted all 44 charges under the act, from when it was introduced on 27 March to the end of April, were wrong, following a review launched after errors were highlighted by journalists, lawyers and campaigners. Thirty-one of the wrongful charges were corrected in court, but included 13 convictions, which have since been sent back to be withdrawn. Lewis Brown, 18, was fined for allegedly breaching lockdown rules after going to visit his mother. Prosecutors withdrew the charge and the conviction was set aside after the case, first reported by the Oxford Mail, was highlighted by an investigation by the civil liberties group Big Brother Watch. Many of the cases wrongly brought under the act, for alleged breaches of lockdown rules, should have been dealt with using the Health Protection Regulations, which give police powers to fine people for flouting movement restrictions. The CPS said 12 of the 187 charges for breaching the regulations were incorrect, usually because Welsh legislation had been applied in England or the other way around. But the review of prosecutions which have either been stopped or ended in a conviction is not likely to show the full extent of wrongful charges, with dozens of cases still working their way through the courts. A coronavirus survivor has met his first grandson, who was born as he was being treated for the virus in hospital. Geoffrey McKillop, 56, was cheered by staff and family as he left the Causeway hospital in Coleraine, County Derry, before receiving a hero\u2019s welcome in his home town of Bushmills. The most poignant moment came as the businessman, who at one stage was given just hours to live, caught sight of his first grandson. Alexander was born four weeks ago, while McKillop, a former badminton player for Ulster and Ireland, was on a ventilator in intensive care. Bushmills residents lined the streets as he was driven through the town, where he owns the Hip Chip and the Codsway restaurants. Then the car paused to allow his daughter Hannah to take her son in a pram to the window for McKillop to see. McKillop paid tribute to the hospital staff for saving his life, adding: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t lose sight of that, these people saved me. \u201cIt\u2019ll be nice to be home.\u201d Three workers at a food factory that supplies supermarkets have died with coronavirus. The members of staff worked at Cranswick, in Wombwell, Barnsley, and were part of the 1,300-strong workforce at the site \u201cmaintaining vital supplies of fresh food into the supermarkets\u201d, the company said. A spokesman for Cranswick said: Sadly, three of our colleagues have passed away with Covid-19. Our thoughts and condolences are with their families and we are providing full support to them and to all of our colleagues directly affected by Covid-19. It is thought the three employees worked in different areas of the factory. In total, nine workers at the factory have contracted the disease, with seven needing hospital treatment. The firm has 12 production sites across the UK. Since the start of the pandemic, the company says it has \u201cimplemented additional measures to protect both the physical and mental wellbeing of our people\u201d. This includes physical distancing measures and recommended PPE, with Cranswick insisting it is doing its utmost to protect key workers. The spokesman added: All colleagues are also advised not to attend work if they have any symptoms. Cranswick employees are designated key workers and are at the forefront of maintaining vital supplies of fresh food into the supermarkets. We are doing everything we can to protect them while they carry out this critical role. The number of children using food banks has increased by 122%, MPs have been told. Emma Revie, chief executive of the Trussell Trust charity, told the environment, food and rural affairs committee on Friday that Covid-19 had an \u201cinstantaneous and profound\u201d impact on the number of people using food banks. Revie said: We analysed the last two weeks of March compared to the same time last year and we identified that there was an 81% increase in demand and quite alarmingly a 122% increase in the number of children receiving food. What this told us was the number of families with children that were coming to us had doubled from its normal levels, so we\u2019re definitely seeing a disproportionately high number of children. Revie said children not attending school was \u201cpart of the issue\u201d, but not the whole reason behind the rise in demand. A further 384 people who tested positive for Covid-19 across all settings in the UK have died, the DHSC said. It brings the total to 33,998, up from 33,614 yesterday. This is from the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Brussels, Jennifer Rankin Transport for London is to raise the congestion charge by 30%, temporarily stop free travel for children, and charge over-60s to travel at peak times as part of a deal to secure a \u00a31.6bn bailout from the government. TfL was forced to turn to the government after reporting a 90% fall in income as journeys on public transport in London have dried up during the nationwide lockdown. The capital\u2019s congestion charge of \u00a311.50 will be reimposed from Monday, as will the separate \u00a312.50 charge imposed on vehicles with high emissions entering central London. They had been lifted during lockdown. The congestion charge will then rise to \u00a315 from 22 June, with enforcement extended from weekdays to the whole week and for longer hours. Free travel for under-18s will also be temporarily suspended, so too for people over 60 or with a disability during peak hours. Here is the full story: This is from the Guardian\u2019s Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll. More than one in three nurses and healthcare assistants are caring for Covid-19 patients without adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), a poll suggests. The UK-wide survey of more than 5,000 nursing staff for the Royal College of Nursing found 34% were working without adequate PPE, including gowns that have been promised by the government. Almost a quarter (23%) of respondents who need gowns said there were not enough for them to use, with a further 34% concerned about the supply for their next shift. Some 58% of nursing staff across both the NHS and social care said they had raised concerns about PPE, with 27% saying these concerns had not been addressed. For those who did not raise concerns, many said they thought it would make no difference to the action taken in their workplace while others were worried it would have a negative impact on their career. Almost one in five (19%) staff working in high-risk environments said there were not enough respirator masks for them to use, with a further 35% concerned about the supply for their next shift. More than four in 10 (44%) are being forced to reuse single use equipment and 32% had not been adequately fit-tested for respirator masks. Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive of the RCN, said: We continue to hear that our members are still not adequately protected. This is particularly concerning especially if the country faces the threat of a second wave. We have repeatedly raised the issue with UK governments and have heard assurances that PPE is being delivered. But this survey - and the direct contact I have with members - shows that is not the experience on the ground in hospitals as well as in care homes. One of the world\u2019s biggest punk festivals staged every August for the last two decades in Blackpool is the latest cultural event to be cancelled due to the pandemic. Rebellion 2020 which stretches over four days was to be headlined this year by Belfast punk veterans Stiff Little Fingers and include other acts from the 1970s new wave era like Sham 69 and the Angelic Upstarts. \u201cGutted doesn\u2019t even come into it,\u201d said the organisers of the event which includes 300 bands on seven different stages inside Blackpool\u2019s Winter Gardens arena. They added that all tickets for this year\u2019s aborted festival will be valid for Rebellion 2021. NHS England has announced 186 more deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 24,345. Of the 186 new deaths announced today: - 45 occurred on 14 May - 66 occurred on 13 May - 32 occurred on 12 May The figures also show 39 of these deaths took place between 1-11 May, and four took place in April. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for postmortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated. The figures published today by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number for hospital deaths occurring on a single day, with a current total of 889. Dozens of people have been wrongly charged by police under new coronavirus laws, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has said. All 44 charges brought under the Coronavirus Act, which allows officers to remove or detain a \u201csuspected infectious person\u201d for screening and assessment, since it was brought in on 27 March were incorrect. And 12 charges under the Health Protection Regulations 2020, which give powers to break up gatherings and fine people breaching restriction of movement rules, were also wrong. The figures come following a CPS review of all 231 police charges under coronavirus legislation in England and Wales up to the end of April, where the prosecution has either been stopped or ended in a conviction. Service director of legal services, Gregor McGill, said: Under the regulations, the vast majority, that\u2019s 175 out of 187, have been charged correctly. And these included people driving from London to Leicester for a party, groups drinking and misbehaving in the park and other groups hanging around the town centre after being asked to go home by police on several occasions. Where mistakes were made, it was usually because Welsh regulations were used in England, or vice versa. Under the act, all 44 charges were incorrect because they did not cover potentially infectious people, which is what the legislation is intended for. He said 38 of the 44 charges had been brought alongside other offences, including assaults on emergency workers, theft and burglary, while 31 of the wrongful charges were withdrawn in court, with 13 wrongful convictions returned to court to be withdrawn. Of those 13, some 11 were substituted with charges under the regulations. Another nine people have died in Wales, bringing the total there to 1,173, Public Health Wales said. The number of reported cases of Covid-19 also rose by 126, bringing that total to 11,834. The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, has published a framework for how schools in Wales could start to begin to return to normal - but has stopped short of setting any firm dates. She said: Nothing would make me happier than seeing our classrooms full again. But I want to be clear that this framework does not \u2013 and I will not - set an arbitrary date for when more pupils will return to school. Setting a date before we have more evidence, more confidence and more control over the virus would be the wrong thing to do. This will not be one decision but a series of decisions over time. These changes will be complex, with many different considerations. I want the working document to be a stimulus for wider discussion and feedback. I am sharing this today to be as transparent as possible. I want everyone to know the extent of the issues related to the next phase. When we are ready to move into that next phase, I will ensure that there is enough time for preparation and for staff to carry out any necessary training. A wide range of possible options are set out. They include, for example: Schools could open full time to disadvantaged children/learners. Or they could open to focus on specific year groups about to make a key transition in learning or those at the end of a cycle. Or they could be open to all children/learners at a reduced time \u2013 schools and providers would be open for all children/learners who would attend for a limited time, depending on maximum safe capacity: for example, one day a week. Staff would similarly rotate. The public have been urged to continue practising social distancing as sunny weather is forecast for the first weekend following the slight easing of lockdown restrictions in England. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) has warned people to stay safe at sea as the majority of beaches will not have lifeguards, and the National Trust has introduced a booking process in some of its car parks to limit visitor numbers. The Met Office has predicted higher temperatures for much of England and Wales at the weekend. Meteorologist Bonnie Diamond said: \u201cWe should have seen the last of the overnight frost, and after tonight temperatures are on the rise. \u201cThe settled weather that we have had this week is continuing across the southern half of the UK. \u201cDuring the daytime on Saturday and Sunday, we\u2019re seeing sunny spells with possibly the odd isolated shower, and average daytime temperatures of 17C to 18C in England.\u201d She added highs of 20C are forecast in the south-west of England, with cloudier and potentially wet weather in Scotland, and Northern Ireland facing lows of 7C. The MCA has urged people planning to surf, swim or pursue boating activities in the sea to make sure they know how to contact HM Coastguard beforehand, as the majority of beaches will not have lifeguards. The RNLI suspended lifeguard provision during lockdown and there are currently no lifeguards on the 240 beaches that it normally patrols. The director of HM Coastguard, Claire Hughes, said people could get help at sea by calling 999. Hughes said: \u201cIn England, now more than ever, people need to respect the sea and the coast. \u201cWhether you\u2019re local or not, whatever your ability or experience in your chosen sport or leisure activity, the sea can still catch you out and be unmerciful when it does. \u201cCoronavirus hasn\u2019t gone away and we all need to follow the rules.\u201d The Local Government Association (LGA) has urged further caution, advising people not to go in the sea at beaches where lifeguards are not present. The LGA also advised people to check advice on their council website before travelling, as not all beaches will be open. The National Trust began reopening some of its smaller car parks on Wednesday, and will be introducing a booking system for larger car parks, which are due to begin reopening next Thursday. While the trust\u2019s houses and gardens remain closed, those planning to head to national parks will be able to book a car park space online in England from Monday, with non-members required to pay a fee. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has expressed disappointment at the lack of meetings between his administration and the UK government to discuss moving out of lockdown. Drakeford has previously characterised meetings with the devolved administrations and Boris Johnson\u2019s government on Covid-19 as \u201ca fits-and-starts experience.\u201d Asked how the last week had gone, he said: \u201cI\u2019m afraid this week has been one of the stops in the stop-start process.\u201d Drakeford has called for a regular pattern of meetings between the four UK governments. He said he did not want a \u201csudden splurge\u201d of meetings before the end of the current three-week lockdown period. \u201cThat\u2019s not the best way to make sure that we share information, share each other\u2019s perspective and move ahead together,\u201d he said. Nicola Sturgeon said at today\u2019s briefing that while the stay at home advice in Scotland remains firmly in place, the Scottish government is continuing to assess different means of easing restrictions. She added that social interactions had to be given as much as importance as the economy. \u201cA life where we go to work but stay locked down with no family interaction for the rest of the time is not one many of us would enjoy,\u201d she said. Asked about the confirmation of an eighth death at the Home Farm care home on Skye, which the Care Inspectorate is currently moving to strip of its licence after finding serious shortcoming in its management, Sturgeon said that care homes had been \u201cat the front of our thinking\u201d. She added: \u201cAs we come out of this period we will all want to reflect and think about how we do things differently in the future.\u201d Sturgeon said that unannounced inspections, of the kind that led to the current action against Home Farm, were \u201cunder way\u201d across Scotland, adding that it was important to point out there were many care homes, around half, which did not have the virus. She was asked about the call from teaching unions for clarity about an August return to schools. They also criticised the \u201ccavalier approach\u201d of the UK government to opening up schools from June. She said that discussions were ongoing, adding: \u201cThere will be no cavalier approach to any aspect of this on the part of the Scottish government.\u201d She went on: \u201cIt is not going to be the case that schools are back to normal in any way, shape or form this side of the summer holidays. We are of course discussing if it is possible for any pupils to be back in that timescale but if it is it is likely to be on a very limited basis.\u201d Here are some of the main points from the daily lobbing briefing by the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman: There are no plans at the moment for schools in different regions to begin their phased reopening at different times based on differing infection rates. No 10 said: The road map that we set out does talk about the fact that we will be responsive to local infection rates and to the other data which is available and that it could lead to some of the measures being eased at different rates in different parts of the country. At the same time it could lead to some measures being reimposed in some parts of the country but not in the others. I\u2019m not aware of any plans at the moment to do that with regards to schools. There are no specific plans to provide PPE in schools. The spokesman added: It is rare for a teacher to have to wear PPE. They should only be worn if providing close-contact care for a child with symptoms. [However] any child with symptoms shouldn\u2019t be going into school in the first place. Plans to have 18,000 contact tracers by next week are still \u201con course\u201d, despite the Northern Ireland secretary\u2019s admission that only 1,500 have already been recruited. The spokesman said: The numbers he [Brandon Lewis] had were a little behind where we are, so I think it was just from a couple of days ago. I don\u2019t have a more up-to-date number but I know that we have recruited significantly more than the 1,500 he spoke about and we are on course to have the 18,000 in place next week. More than half of the population of the Isle of Wight have downloaded the contact-tracing app and the intention remains to roll it out nationwide after the trial. No 10 said problems with using the app on Huawei phones were being \u201cironed out\u201d and the app would also be \u201cavailable\u201d for the Scottish government to use in Scotland. The government plans to invest in \u201cpreventative and personalised solutions to ill-health\u201d to help people live healthier and more active lives. Downing Street said: It is critical to understand how different factors such as ethnicity, deprivation, age, gender and obesity could be disproportionately impacting how people are affected by coronavirus. It follows this report in the Times (paywall) that Boris Johnson is convinced his own weight is the reason he ended up in intensive care when he came down with Covid-19, following research suggesting that being obese doubles the risk of needing hospital treatment for the disease. Public Health England\u2019s review into the factors affecting health outcomes from Covid-19 \u2013 including ethnicity, gender and obesity \u2013 would be published by the end of May, he added. The Welsh government has made it clear that schools in Wales will not fully open before September. Speaking at his government\u2019s daily press conference, the first minister Mark Drakeford said the ambition remained for some cohorts of children to return to school before the summer holidays. He said more details would be given later today. The Welsh government has not put dates on its roadmap out of lockdown (see 12.31pm.). Drakeford said he preferred a \u201csequence\u201d or \u201cpathway\u201d rather than specific \u201carbitary\u201d dates. He said: The journey has begun. We have begun to move out of the lockdown phase. For all of us the journey needs to be taken carefully, cautiously. Drakeford appealed for people in England not to travel to Wales this weekend, warning police would stop them and turn them back if they did. \u201cPlease visit Wales later,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is not the moment.\u201d He added: Our rules are clear. Travel should only be local and only for essential purposes.\u201d He said people should not travel to beauty spots or second homes. An eighth resident has died at a care home at the centre of a Covid-19 outbreak on Skye. It emerged on Thursday that the Care Inspectorate, which regulates the industry in Scotland, had asked a sheriff to strip the care home\u2019s owners, HC-One, of its licence to operate after finding serious shortcomings in its management. The decision came after an unannounced inspection of the Home Farm facility in Portree, Skye\u2019s main town, that raised \u201cserious and significant concerns\u201d about the quality of care. The care home has been under intense scrutiny after it emerged earlier this month that nearly all of its 34 residents and half of its staff had contracted Covid-19. The UK\u2019s chief negotiator David Frost said \u201cvery little progress\u201d had been made in the third round of Brexit talks with the EU\u2019s demands on a level playing field for trade as \u201cthe major obstacle\u201d. It now appears that little progress on this central issue will be made in the next round of talks with a working assumption that it will take a summit between Boris Johnson and commission president Ursula von der Leyen in mid-June to break the impasse. One senior UK source described the talks as \u201cdestructive and tetchy\u201d at times but believed short-tempers could reflect a sense of realisation the EU side that the UK will not be budging on level playing field issues. Sources say the UK made it clear \u201cthere is no half-way house\u201d or compromise to be had in the EU level playing field deal that would result in the UK losing \u201ccontrol of our laws\u201d. The UK made it clear it will not be asking to extend the transition period despite the likely recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic, claiming that trading on \u201cAustralia terms\u201d is with the EU is \u201cperfectly doable and satisfactory\u201d. In a statement, Frost said: I regret however that we made very little progress towards agreement on the most significant outstanding issues between us\u201d adding that there was good progress made towards a mutual understanding on some trade issues and issues such as civil nuclear energy, aviation and law enforcement. The major obstacle to this is the EU\u2019s insistence on including a set of novel and unbalanced proposals on the so-called \u201clevel playing field\u201d which would bind this country to EU law or standards, or determine our domestic legal regimes, in a way that is unprecedented in Free Trade Agreements. The UK claims the EU budged \u201ca little\u201d on fisheries and London says it will consider giving the EU access to British fishing waters but that Brussels is still insisting on a \u201cmaximalist\u201d approach binding the fishing deal to the overall trade deal. There was also disagreement on services and on governance issues. Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed a decrease of 31 people in hospital with suspected or confirmed coronavirus in Scotland, as well as a further 46 deaths taking the total by this measure to 2,053. As of this morning, there have been 14,260 positive cases confirmed - an increase of 143 from yesterday, the first minister said. Tributes have been paid to a \u201cselfless\u201d nurse and former rugby player who died after testing positive for coronavirus. Andy Collier, 53, a nurse practitioner at Hollins Park Hospital in Warrington, Cheshire, died on 15 April, a spokesman for the North West Boroughs Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said. He was admitted to the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan after becoming seriously ill on 31 March and died with his wife Carol by his bedside. Collier, who ran The First and Last pub in Leigh with his wife, had previously played for Wigan and Leigh Centurions rugby league clubs. His ward manager Rob Kelly said: Andy was all about putting other people first - whether that was patients on the ward or his colleagues across the trust. He was very down to earth, fair and selfless. I will remember him as a team player and someone who was passionate about bringing people together on our team development days to improve our environment for staff and patients. The team has raised a few virtual glasses to Andy and we will miss him massively. The Welsh government has published its roadmap out of lockdown (pdf), which includes a red, amber and green traffic light system spelling out how restrictions may be lifted. The first minister Mark Drakeford said the roadmap was part of \u201ca cautious, coherent approach\u201d to easing lockdown, and that for the next two weeks at least its \u201cstay home\u201d message - stricter than England - would remain in place. He said: We, like countries across the world, are able to think about how we can move out of the lockdown. But it is essential as we do so that we recognise this is not a short-term crisis. Until there is a vaccine or effective treatments, we will have to live with the disease in our society and try to control its spread and mitigate its effects. Drakeford said Wales strongly supported a four-nation approach to the lifting of the lockdown but said this had to respect the responsibilities of each government to determine the speed at which it is safe to move. He added: For the next two weeks, at least, I urge everyone in Wales to stick to the advice: \u2018Stay home, protect our NHS and save lives\u2019. The traffic light categories take in a wide number of areas of life and activities, including schools, seeing family and friends, getting around, playing sport, work, shopping and practising faith. The government says Wales may well be on \u201cred\u201d for one type of activity, \u201camber\u201d for another and still in lockdown for a third. Under \u201cseeing family and friends\u201d, for example, Wales is still in complete lockdown. The next phase \u2013 red \u2013 would be seeing one person from outside your household to provide or receive care or support whilst maintaining appropriate physical distancing. But Wales is already in the red phase for working or running a business \u2013 some construction sites are able to re-open under safe working practices. The amber phase for work includes trialling some personal services with appointments, such as hairdressers. Scotland\u2019s teaching unions are urging the Scottish government not to replicate the \u201ccavalier attitude\u201d of UK ministers in announcing an early re-opening of schools \u2013 a move which they claim has created fear among teachers and parents. In a letter to the deputy first minister, John Swinney, the Teachers\u2019 Panel of the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT) calls for clarity on a potential partial return for pupils and teachers in August. Des Morris of the SNCT and Educational Institute of Scotland warns against \u201ca premature and enforced return to schools in June\u201d, adding: There is a strong argument to maintain a cautionary approach and to reinforce such by indicating schools will reopen after the summer break. Not only does that bring clarity to parents, pupils, and teachers, it provides a significant period to plan and prepare for the very real challenge of delivering a blended learning experience for Scotland\u2019s pupils in session 2020/21. Ryanair has announced it has cut another 250 jobs across its offices in the UK, Ireland, Spain and Poland amid the collapse in demand for flights. The airline\u2019s people director Darrell Hughes said: While we expect to reopen our offices from 1 June, we will not require the same number of support team members in a year when we will carry less than 100 million passengers, against an original budget of 155 million. These job losses were communicated to individual team members this week, and they will not be returning to work in our Dublin, Stansted, Madrid or Wroclaw offices when they reopen on 1 June. We are continuing to meet our pilot and cabin crew unions across Europe to finalise up to 3,000 job cuts and 20% pay cuts as we return to approximately 40% of our normal flight schedules from July onwards. British Transport Police will receive \u00a31.5m of additional funding to boost the number of officers at railway stations in London, the transport secretary Grant Shapps announced. He said: Extra boots on the ground working closely with station staff will help manage crowding, provide clear guidance and ensure passengers have the space to maintain social distancing. However, the key message remains that people should only go to work if they cannot work from home, and should avoid public transport if possible to ease pressure on the network. Those who need to use it should avoid rush hour, maintain social distancing wherever possible and respect others. The Birmingham Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s NHS foundation trust has confirmed that a midwife and a senior mental health nurse have died after treatment for Covid-19. Trust chief executive Sarah-Jane Marsh paid tribute to 41-year-old Lillian Mudzivare for her commitment to mental health and young people. Lillian was a much-loved member of our Forward Thinking Birmingham team whose bubbly, vibrant and bright approach touched the lives of everyone who knew her. Safaa Alam was described by the trust as an inspirational and much-loved member of staff known for her kindness and compassion. Safaa was an amazing midwife whose skills and expertise helped to bring hundreds of new lives into the world, whilst supporting women on their journey to motherhood. Our thoughts and prayers are with her husband and family as they come to terms with their devastating loss. The makers of Coronation Street and Emmerdale are in the \u201cfinal stages\u201d of working on plans for the soaps to return to production, according to a spokeswoman for the programmes. Filming of the soaps had been paused since March because of the pandemic. ITV reduced the number of episodes being aired each week to three in an effort to make the content they had already filmed last longer. Coronation Street producer Iain MacLeod said last week that coronavirus will feature in future episodes of the soap but will not \u201cdominate\u201d the soap\u2019s storylines. The update on a possible return to filming comes after ITV\u2019s director of television Kevin Lygo said that Emmerdale will run out of episodes at the end of May, while Coronation Street will run out of episodes after June. On Thursday the BBC\u2019s director of content, Charlotte Moore, said in the Telegraph that the broadcaster plans \u201cto begin filming again on both EastEnders and Top Gear by the end of June\u201d. Shoppers stockpiling supermarket produce left food banks \u201ccut off at the knees\u201d with a dramatic fall in their supply, which was salvaged mainly after the closure of pubs and restaurants, MPs have been told. Lindsay Boswell, CEO of food poverty charity FareShare, told the Commons environment, food and rural affairs committee the amount of produce food banks received \u201cimmediately surged\u201d following the closure of pubs and restaurants. Asked by Angus MP Dave Doogan about the fall in availability of surplus food and the disruption to produce supply, Boswell said: Initially with the dramatic increase in consumer demand and clearing of shelves and stocking that went on, our supply chain was cut off at the knees. The supermarkets, although they reacted incredibly quickly, had to divert all their attention and focus into just trying to find whatever supply they could. We have about 7,500 charities that collect food from the back of supermarket stores on a daily basis, as well as the other 5,500 that are supplied through a wholesale model and we saw a dramatic drop. However, as soon as the food service and hospitality sectors were closed down, we saw an immediate surge in very large volumes of very high quality, fresh produce that was imminently destined from the distribution centres to go to those pub, restaurants and schools. That\u2019s been the predominant driver in us seeing between March and April a 100% increase in the volume of food we could handle. What\u2019s been incredibly bad news for that sector, we\u2019ve managed to divert a lot of that food and make a massive difference to frontline organisations. Good morning everyone. I\u2019m Lucy Campbell, taking over the live blog for the rest of the day. If you would like to get in touch with me to share news tips, ideas, comments or suggestions, please feel free to do so via the usual channels. Your thoughts are always welcome and apologies in advance if I cannot reply to every message. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ In a move that may give us a glimpse into what the short-term future of train travel may look like, a train operator is to ban passengers from travelling without a reservation to allow it to enforce physical distancing. London North Eastern Railway (LNER), which operates Anglo-Scottish journeys on the East Coast Main Line, will introduce the measure when services are increased next week. It is asking passengers to ignore their reserved seat and to sit in a window seat, with one person per row of four seats, and two empty rows between each passenger. People travelling as a household will be allowed to sit together but must maintain \u201ca safe distance\u201d from other passengers. Avanti West Coast, which operates intercity journeys on the West Coast Main Line, warned its customers that anyone without a reservation may not be able to travel on their choice of train due to capacities being limited to around a quarter of normal levels. The firm has introduced a series of additional hygiene measures, including issuing staff with face masks, enhanced cleaning regimes and closing waiting rooms and lounges. Transport operators are being urged by the government to rearrange, remove or limit seating \u201cto try and ensure social distancing is observed\u201d. Services across the rail network will be increased from around 50% of the normal timetable to 70% on Monday, as part of the easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions. The industry body the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) is urging passengers to avoid non-essential travel after recording a rise in journey planning of nearly a quarter this week. It said 3.7m journeys were planned between Sunday and Thursday, compared with 3m over the same period one week earlier. Residents of Barrow in Cumbria, which has the highest coronavirus infection rate in the UK have demanded to know whether the local docks \u2013 where Britain\u2019s nuclear submarines are built \u2013 were a disease-spreading hotspot, writes the Guardian\u2019s North of England Editor. Read the full story here: More than a quarter of all deaths of care home residents in England and Wales since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis involved Covid-19, new official figures show. Data from the Office for National Statistics reveals that in the period from 2 March to 1 May 2020, there were 45,899 registered deaths of care home residents in England and Wales, 12,526 (27.3%) of which involved the virus. Of the deaths of care home residents involving Covid-19, 72.2% (9,039 deaths) occurred at a care facility, and 27.5% (3,444 deaths) occurred at a hospital. 14.6% of all hospital deaths involving Covid-19 in that period were accounted for by care home residents. Read the full story here: The Welsh government will publish a \u201croad map\u201d out of lockdown later on Friday, Wales\u2019s first Minister, Mark Drakeford, told Sky News. Drakeford said it would be a \u201ctraffic light system\u201d that moved from lockdown into the \u201cfirst cautious step\u201d of the red zone, then the amber zone, and finally the green zone. The Welsh government would not provide timings of the different stages, he added: Once you provide a date, people get fixated with a date rather than with a process you have to go through to make sure that it is then safe to take those measures. The World Health Organization\u2019s coronavirus special envoy has warned the government against giving specific dates in which lockdown measures could be released before a comprehensive testing, tracing and isolating system is in place. Asked how he feels about schools returning from June 1, Dr David Nabarro told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: Other countries are saying very clearly: we want to make sure that the capacity to test, trace and isolate is present throughout our country before we really start lifting the restrictions on movement. After all, what is lockdown? It is freezing the lockdown in place and it is giving us a time to get ready so that when we release the lockdown we are better protected. And I suppose my request to all countries is that rather than giving precise dates, they say: we\u2019ll release the lockdowns when we know that we\u2019ve got the defence mechanisms in place, when we know that our people understand the severity of this virus, and what we\u2019ve got to do and when we\u2019ve made sure that, in the settings where the virus is most easily transmitted, we\u2019ve put in place the best possible protection to keep those at risk most safe. Nabarro said that people with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes should keep their distance from others. I\u2019m very clear that people with diabetes, people with cardiovascular disease are at risk. And it is not so much that I want them to be shielded, it is just that I want them to be given the necessary advice and encouragement to be able to keep their distance from other people. And wherever possible, if they are forced to be close together, that we actually do everything possible to avoid them being exposed to infection. We look after them, that is the key point. The Scottish Refugee Council has written to the UK home secretary, Priti Patel, demanding urgent action following the death of an asylum seeker at a hotel in Glasgow. The man was one of hundreds of asylum seekers who were moved en masse from their existing accommodation into hotels at the beginning of lockdown, where significant concerns have been raised about physical distancing, cleanliness and food. In a move condemned by campaigners, they also had all financial support withdrawn. At PMQs on Wednesday this week, Boris Johnson committed to investigate this decision by the private housing contractor Mears. As the Guardian reported earlier this week, outreach workers have identified increasing fear, stress and anxiety among this vulnerable population, who have no information about future housing arrangements and no money to top up their phones to continue communication with lawyers, or buy extra food, hand sanitiser or period products for women. The council wants Patel to commit to moving the hotel stayers back into more permanent accommodation and to ensure that no one is left destitute once lockdown eases. Transport for London has been given a government bailout to help it fill a coronavirus-related black hole in its budget after its income slumped by 90%. But public transport users in London can expect fare hikes and restrictions on free travel as a result of the government\u2019s \u00a31.6bn bailout of TfL. Mayor Sadiq Khan accused the Department for Transport (DfT) of \u201cmaking ordinary Londoners pay the cost for doing the right thing on Covid-19\u201d. The department said it included a series of caveats as part of the funding package \u201cin order to safeguard services in the future\u201d. Temporary measures consist of stopping free travel for children and only allowing people over 60 or with a disability to travel for free outside peak hours. Fares on buses \u2013 scrapped to help protect drivers from Covid-19 \u2013 will be reintroduced, and the congestion charge for people driving into the centre of the city will resume. These changes will take place \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d, the DfT said. A decline in passenger numbers of 95% on the London Underground and 85% on buses due to the coronavirus lockdown has caused a 90% fall in income. Khan said TfL had been negotiating with the government for around six weeks. He said: I\u2019m unclear about why the government are waiting until the 11th hour to agree a deal. It is really bad form. I had no choice but to accept it to keep the tubes and buses running. Concerns have been raised about packed tube trains and buses this week after the prime minister encouraged people in England to go to work if they could not work from home. A London Covid-19 taskforce \u2013 including representatives from the government and TfL \u2013 has been established to oversee operational decisions during the pandemic. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said services must be increased to \u201csupport social distancing and ensure our capital keeps moving\u201d. He said: This deal will encourage a real move towards greener and healthier walking and cycling options, ease pressure on our public transport and provide certainty and stability for London\u2019s transport services in the future. Families of loved ones who have died in Northern Ireland\u2019s care homes during the coronavirus crisis have demanded a public inquiry into the deaths, writes Henry McDonald. The health minister, Robin Swann, was warned today that relatives of those dying in the local care sector could sue unless there was an independent inquiry into the care homes death toll. The threat of legal action from Belfast law firm KRW comes after it emerged that 40 residents in one of the city\u2019s care homes had been diagnosed with Covid-19 a fortnight after being told it was free of the virus. Solicitor Kevin Winters said the firm had sent a letter to the minister urging him to set up an inquiry into the high number of care home deaths. He said: These residents are the most vulnerable of all in society, yet instead of being prioritised for oversight they are downgraded because they are elderly. An inquiry would afford an opportunity for failures to be exposed, accountability to be secured and reforms to be proposed. Northern Ireland\u2019s power-sharing government meanwhile has announced \u201cphase one\u201d of its programme to de-escalate lockdown during the pandemic. On Monday, garden centres and recycling plants will reopen across Northern Ireland. The first minister, Arlene Foster, described the move as \u201cthe tentative first steps\u201d towards lifting the shutdown. The government in Belfast has published a \u201croad map\u201d for easing the lockdown but, unlike in England, there is no timetable or target dates for the reopening of factories, shops, retail outlets, cafes, bars and so on. More from Brandon Lewis on Sky News, where the Northern Ireland Secretary insisted that using public transport is safe if people use proper social distancing. Lewis said: Well if we\u2019re practising proper social distancing, yes it is safe. And I think actually the point I would make is, look, it is a fair point, if everybody goes onto public transport there will be a challenge with being able to continue to follow social distancing and people see images of people showing where social distancing isn\u2019t being followed. That is why we\u2019re so clear in saying to people we must follow social distancing to keep on top of this R level, that is why we\u2019re saying to people don\u2019t use public transport unless you absolutely have to. Asked whether lockdown measures could be released regionally, Lewis said: Well we\u2019re taking a data and science-led approach at all stages of this. If analysis is correct and London is that much lower than elsewhere it is important we don\u2019t allow that to rise again. Speaking on Sky News Brandon Lewis admitted just 1,500 of the Government\u2019s target of 18,000 contact tracers have been appointed. Asked how many of the 18,000 contact tracers wanted have been appointed, Lewis told Sky News: I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got to 18,000 just yet, I think there\u2019s about 15,000 applications, we\u2019re looking to as you say get up to 18,000. Pushed again on how many of the 15,000 applicants have been appointed, he added: As of this morning I\u2019m not sure of exactly how many of the 15,000 have been hired, earlier in the week it was about 1,500, it would have gone up since then. Asked whether he would be comfortable for his children to return to schools, Lewis said that although they are above school age \u201cyes, absolutely\u201d. He added: I think I would be very comfortable with my children going back in a safe environment with social distancing with schools able to advise children about all of those practical things we need to do in terms of staying alert - washing hands, practising social distancing. I think schools are a very good environment to do that and that is why we\u2019re working with schools to make sure they are ready to do that in a very safe and appropriate way for children when they are ready to return. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has said it is possible for young children to socially distance in schools. Lewis told BBC Breakfast: I know the Education Secretary and his team are talking continually to the unions and to teachers directly as well around making sure that we\u2019ve got a good, safe environment. He added that this was important \u201cnot just so that parents can get to work, but [for] those age groups it is a really key time for children to be taking in that knowledge - and a few weeks out of school can make quite a big difference\u201d. On whether children can socially distance, Lewis said: I think one of the things about being at school is the ability for teachers who, I know when I was at school and my children look up to teachers, have that opportunity to ensure we\u2019re educating children. [...] l I think one of the things teachers are able to do, both in the classroom and outside the classroom, and all of us as parents and people in society, is to continue to educate each other around social distance. So yes, even in a school environment I think it is important that we do what we can to encourage and explain and educate around social distancing. If you are working relatively efficiently from home (the word efficient may have taken on an entirely new meaning if, like me, you have small people at home too) analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggests you may have to continue to do so for quite some time. The IFS has said that maintaining social distancing at work after the lockdown eases will need substantial changes to commuting patterns including allowing people to continue to work from home. Research found that while fewer than one in six people use public transport to get to work across the UK, this rises to one in two among workers living in London. Younger workers are most reliant on public transport to get to work, with almost a fifth of those aged 16-24 using it compared to just 9% of workers aged 55 and over. In London, almost two out of three young people commute to work by public transport, compared to 40% of those aged 55 and over, the study indicated. Getting workers who can to continue to work from home will be important, said the report. Alex Davenport, a research economist at the IFS, said: Fortunately, many who previously used public transport are able to work from home, such as those working in finance. If social distancing on public transport is to be achieved then getting these workers to continue to work from home will be very important. In contrast, reopening the hospitality sector will create a particular challenge as many workers in this sector cannot work from home and were relatively heavy users of public transport to get to work. Tan Dhesi, shadow rail minister, said: The footage of people packed onto public transport this week was deeply worrying, but it was unsurprising after Boris Johnson ordered a return to work with just 12 hours\u2019 notice, and no official guidance on how workers can keep safe and no measures in place to deal with demand. Health unions have produced a nine-point blueprint for reopening the NHS. The full text of the blueprint can be read here. In it 16 unions, including Britain and Ireland\u2019s largest union Unite, have said the most pressing issues are continuing lack of PPE the \u2018messy\u2019 testing regime which has seen samples sent to the USA and the withdrawal of the threat that NHS staff could be subject to a public sector pay freeze highlighted in leaked Treasury documents. Unite national officer for health Colenzo Jarrett-Thorpe said: This blueprint by the health unions should act as a rocket booster for ministers to really get to grips with key elements of the pandemic. A continuing shortage of PPE is a dark stain on the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus emergency. We have ambulance, biomedical scientist, nursing and speech and language therapist (SALT) members telling us that there are still shortages and, in some cases, when it does arrive it is out-of-date, ill-fitting or not up to standard. [...] The testing regime totters between the shambolic and the messy. There is little openness and transparency about how the government will hit its increased 200,000 daily test target. [...] Finally, our members are furious at the leaked Treasury assessment that a public sector pay freeze could be on the cards to pay for the cost of the pandemic. If the Thursday \u2018clap for carers\u2019 means anything, it should be that there can be no return to the age of austerity. More than 270 NHS and social care workers have died due to Covid-19 and hundreds of thousands more are risking their lives on a daily basis to care for others \u2013 yet this does not seem to stop Treasury mandarins drawing up heartless proposals to freeze public sector pay, which a recent Unite survey has shown the public does not want. The NHS unions are: British Association of Occupational Therapists, British Dental Association, British Dietetic Association, British Orthoptists Society, Chartered Society of Physiotherapists, College of Podiatry, Federation of Clinical Scientists, GMB, Healthcare Consultants and Specialists Association, Managers in Partnership, Prison Officers Association, Royal College of Midwives, Royal College of Nursing, Society of Radiographers, UNISON and Unite. Education union leaders will today meet with the Chief Medical Officer and other experts to hear reasons for the Government\u2019s push to reopen schools in England from June 1. The Press Association reports: England is the only part of the UK asking schools to begin phased reopenings from the start of next month, raising fears among teachers\u2019 unions about the risks of infection from the coronavirus. Sending children back to school will be encouraged but voluntary. Writing in the Daily Mail, education secretary Gavin Williamson gave reasons for the move, and says he has arranged today\u2019s meeting to brief teachers\u2019 representatives on \u201cthe scientific advice underpinning our approach\u201d. He wrote: The best place for youngsters to learn is in school and I have wanted to get more children back there as soon as possible. Parents are doing a fantastic job helping them to learn at home but nothing can take the place of a teacher. It is known that the first few years of a child\u2019s education are so important. [...] That is why younger children are at the head of the queue to go back to school, along with pupils who will be moving up to secondary school and those older pupils who are going to be sitting their GCSEs and A Levels next year. Now I want to be clear, this is the first phase of a controlled and careful return to school. It\u2019s not happening overnight and it isn\u2019t going to happen without schools putting in place a range of protective measures to reduce transmission. The safety of children and their teachers is my No 1 priority. I know some teaching unions still have concerns, just as I know parents and teachers have some worries. I intend to carry on talking to all of them and working with them on any issues they may have. The education secretary assured teachers and parents the envisaged June 1 returns would be the first phase of a \u201ccontrolled and careful\u201d return to schooling which would involve a range of protective measures. These would include keeping class sizes small, making sure children stayed within small groups, observing strict hygiene and cleaning measures, and having breaks and mealtimes staggered to reduce crowding. Williamson was writing after National Education Union joint secretary Mary Bousted said a \u201cwider opening of schools, too early, poses a lot of unanswered questions about the risks in poor communities\u201d. Here is a quick round up of the best of the morning\u2019s stories The private firm contracted to run the government\u2019s stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE) was beset by \u201cchaos\u201d at its warehouse that may have resulted in delays in deploying vital supplies to healthcare workers. It has emerged that antibody blood tests to find out whether individuals have had Covid-19 are unlikely to be generally available on the NHS any time soon, despite continued enthusiasm from government ministers and advisers on Thursday. One in four people who have died in hospital with Covid-19 also had diabetes, the NHS\u2019s first breakdown of underlying health conditions among the fatalities shows. The NHS coronavirus app\u2019s advisory board is split over whether it has the authority to tell the government to ditch its version and switch to a decentralised model proposed by Apple and Google. Health unions have insisted that rapid testing and enough protective equipment must be available when the NHS reopens services cancelled during the peak of the coronavirus outbreak. People going into hospital in England for planned surgery will in future have to isolate for two weeks before they arrive, in a move that will affect about 700,000 patients a month.

Players are to be tested for Covid\u201119 twice a week during a first stage of return, with a positive test requiring the player to isolate for seven days under Public Health England guidelines.

It\u2019s time to stop squabbling and agree a staggered, safe return that is accompanied by rigorous testing of teachers, children and families.\u201d</p> <p>Longfield said reopening schools in England to some primary pupils was \u201csensible\u201d and called for other year groups to return as soon as possible, alongside summer schools and other support during the holidays.</p> <p>In the face of scepticism from teachers and school leaders, the government has increasingly raised the stakes in recent days.

Some complained that their questions were not answered.</p> <p>Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the evidence presented to the meeting was \u201cflimsy at best\u201d but that there was room for further discussion.</p> <p>\u201cThis was never in our minds a make-or-break meeting, that was never its purpose. It\u2019s for the government to demonstrate that the scientific advice is there, and then it\u2019s for schools and government to demonstrate that schools will be safe for reopening, from whatever date,\u201d Roach said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s vitally important that the government and employers are behaving reasonably. It\u2019s disappointing that many of the questions that we put to the scientific advisers this afternoon haven\u2019t yet been answered. We hope that they will be answered \u2013 our members are hoping they will be answered.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has got to win the confidence of the profession, and it\u2019s got to win public confidence as well, if parents are going to entrust their children into schools where there is a risk of greater transmission of the virus.\u201d</p> <p>The NEU\u2019s Courtney welcomed Vallance\u2019s pledge to publish the papers presented to the Sage group of government advisers relating to education. But he also said the scientific advice presented to the meeting appeared mixed, and he was surprised to learn of instances in Australia where children had carried coronavirus cases into their households as \u201cindex cases\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe things that they told us didn\u2019t give me confidence that we should be going ahead without the social distancing and measures that schools in other countries have. It\u2019s really not clear what the government\u2019s test is to reopen schools,\u201d Courtney said.</p> <p>The governments in Wales and Scotland remain unmoved by Westminster\u2019s decision to reopen schools. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said: \u201cThere will be no cavalier approach to any aspect of this on the part of the Scottish government.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not going to be the case that schools are back to normal in any way, shape or form this side of the summer holidays. We are of course discussing if it is possible for any pupils to be back in that timescale. But if it is, it is likely to be on a very limited basis.\u201d</p> <p>Kirsty Williams, the Welsh education minister, also said no date had been set for schools there to reopen. But she announced the publication of a working document to stimulate discussion over how to reopen.</p> <p>\u201cSetting a date before we have more evidence, more confidence and more control over the virus would be the wrong thing to do,\u201d Williams said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said at Friday\u2019s Downing Street press conference: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t support a proposal to start to reopen schools unless it was safe to do so, and it is safe to do so.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIn the same way that it\u2019s terrible news that this virus impacts on the elderly so much, the good news is that it seems to spare children in almost every case. And so the the risk to children is much, much lower than to any other age group \u2013 certainly if you don\u2019t have underlying health conditions.\u201d</p> <p>The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said the falling number of cases across the community would reduce the risks further in coming weeks. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety I think around this, but people need to think through, in an average infant school of maybe 100 children, the likelihood of anybody having this disease is very small, and diminishing with time, so we just need to keep that in perspective.\u201d</p> <p>Williamson said: \u201cGetting children back to school is vital for their educational development and many schools are already taking steps to welcome back their pupils. I am grateful for their support.\u201d</p>",

Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the evidence presented to the meeting was \u201cflimsy at best\u201d but that there was room for further discussion. \u201cThis was never in our minds a make-or-break meeting, that was never its purpose. It\u2019s for the government to demonstrate that the scientific advice is there, and then it\u2019s for schools and government to demonstrate that schools will be safe for reopening, from whatever date,\u201d Roach said. \u201cIt\u2019s vitally important that the government and employers are behaving reasonably. It\u2019s disappointing that many of the questions that we put to the scientific advisers this afternoon haven\u2019t yet been answered. We hope that they will be answered \u2013 our members are hoping they will be answered. \u201cThe government has got to win the confidence of the profession, and it\u2019s got to win public confidence as well, if parents are going to entrust their children into schools where there is a risk of greater transmission of the virus.\u201d The NEU\u2019s Courtney welcomed Vallance\u2019s pledge to publish the papers presented to the Sage group of government advisers relating to education. But he also said the scientific advice presented to the meeting appeared mixed, and he was surprised to learn of instances in Australia where children had carried coronavirus cases into their households as \u201cindex cases\u201d. \u201cThe things that they told us didn\u2019t give me confidence that we should be going ahead without the social distancing and measures that schools in other countries have. It\u2019s really not clear what the government\u2019s test is to reopen schools,\u201d Courtney said. The governments in Wales and Scotland remain unmoved by Westminster\u2019s decision to reopen schools. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said: \u201cThere will be no cavalier approach to any aspect of this on the part of the Scottish government. \u201cIt is not going to be the case that schools are back to normal in any way, shape or form this side of the summer holidays. We are of course discussing if it is possible for any pupils to be back in that timescale. But if it is, it is likely to be on a very limited basis.\u201d Kirsty Williams, the Welsh education minister, also said no date had been set for schools there to reopen. But she announced the publication of a working document to stimulate discussion over how to reopen. \u201cSetting a date before we have more evidence, more confidence and more control over the virus would be the wrong thing to do,\u201d Williams said. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said at Friday\u2019s Downing Street press conference: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t support a proposal to start to reopen schools unless it was safe to do so, and it is safe to do so.\u201d He added: \u201cIn the same way that it\u2019s terrible news that this virus impacts on the elderly so much, the good news is that it seems to spare children in almost every case. And so the the risk to children is much, much lower than to any other age group \u2013 certainly if you don\u2019t have underlying health conditions.\u201d The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said the falling number of cases across the community would reduce the risks further in coming weeks. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety I think around this, but people need to think through, in an average infant school of maybe 100 children, the likelihood of anybody having this disease is very small, and diminishing with time, so we just need to keep that in perspective.\u201d Williamson said: \u201cGetting children back to school is vital for their educational development and many schools are already taking steps to welcome back their pupils. I am grateful for their support.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "US officials gave dozens of detained immigrant parents an ultimatum \u2013 allow your children to be released from detention without you or face indefinite detention together, according to legal representatives from the country\u2019s three family detention centers. In one chaotic day on Thursday, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) instituted what legal representatives for detained families called an \u201cindefinite detention or family separation\u201d policy. Ice officials met with asylum-seeking parents, gave them papers and told them conflicting things about what signing the documents meant, advocates said. At the country\u2019s largest family detention center in Dilley, Texas, a lawyer said Ice stopped mothers from keeping copies of the document and ignored their requests to speak to attorneys before signing. \u201cOne mother reported that Ice officers were very mad when she refused to sign, they were intimidating, they were speaking firmly to her and when she said she didn\u2019t want to sign, they told her it wasn\u2019t really up to her,\u201d said Allison Herre, managing attorney for the Dilley Pro Bono Project. The attorney Bridget Cambria represents families at Berks detention center in Pennsylvania and said the pro-bono law firm Aldea\u2019s phone line was flooded with calls from families on Thursday. \u201cThe families were each upset, most of them were crying,\u201d Cambria said. \u201cBecause immigration had called them down one by one and told them that if they wanted their children to leave detention, they had to sign a paper that would separate the parents from the child.\u201d Because prisons are a cauldron for infectious disease, the US immigration detention system is facing additional scrutiny amid the Covid-19 outbreak. People inside these facilities are detained on civil immigration violations, not criminal charges, and the government has the power to release them unless they are considered a danger to the community. In February, advocates urged the government to release people held in the world\u2019s largest immigrant detention system to minimize the spread of coronavirus before it was too late. Last week, Carlos Ernesto Escobar Mej\u00eda became the first person to die from Covid-19 in immigration custody. The push to have parents release their children but remain detained themselves came the day before the government was due to provide a report to a court on how many children are in detention as part of the Flores settlement. That agreement says the government must hold children in the least restrictive setting and release them as quickly as possible, generally after 20 days in detention. Donald Trump\u2019s administration has repeatedly attempted to end these court-ordered protections and has kept children well past the 20-day limit.

He presents like a proud parent at a school speech night: sure, George is terrible at clarinet, but how great are kids, warbling away, expressing themselves.</p> <p>At one level Morrison has to indulge what he can\u2019t control. At another level, this is a frictionless rebuke. If you listen closely there are always adults and kids in the prime minister\u2019s \u201chow great\u201d parables. There is always a responsible adult, Morrison, who is in charge, and getting on with things, and then there are others enjoying their hobbies. It\u2019s a frictionless rebuke that nimbly asserts a hierarchy.</p> <p>The frictionless rebuke is different from Tony Abbott deploying Peta Credlin to keep the show on a tight leash, and the various, ultimately fruitless accommodations Malcolm Turnbull tried to make with the right to prevent a repeat of 2009.</p> <p>It is too soon to say whether the Morrison management technique will be any more successful than the strategies of his predecessors. All we can say right now, 12 months on from the miracle, is it is quantifiably different.</p>",

If pesky ideologues inside his own ranks start sounding off unhelpfully, in recent examples cartoonishly about China, or to query whether a Liberal government should be paying people not to work, Morrison says isn\u2019t free speech wonderful. He presents like a proud parent at a school speech night: sure, George is terrible at clarinet, but how great are kids, warbling away, expressing themselves. At one level Morrison has to indulge what he can\u2019t control. At another level, this is a frictionless rebuke. If you listen closely there are always adults and kids in the prime minister\u2019s \u201chow great\u201d parables. There is always a responsible adult, Morrison, who is in charge, and getting on with things, and then there are others enjoying their hobbies. It\u2019s a frictionless rebuke that nimbly asserts a hierarchy. The frictionless rebuke is different from Tony Abbott deploying Peta Credlin to keep the show on a tight leash, and the various, ultimately fruitless accommodations Malcolm Turnbull tried to make with the right to prevent a repeat of 2009. It is too soon to say whether the Morrison management technique will be any more successful than the strategies of his predecessors. All we can say right now, 12 months on from the miracle, is it is quantifiably different.",

Yet the interview finished by saying, \u2018What an amazing couple\u2019, rather than with something constructive, like follow government directives to \u2018leave and live\u2019, or actually pointing out the lifelong impact of almost dying while saving a house. \u201cToo many Australians are complacent about bushfires\u2019 impact at every level.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The start of Pete Evans\u2019 long goodbye from the mainstream first became apparent in 2012. After two seasons as a judge on the successful Channel 7 cooking show My Kitchen Rules, co-owner of the glamorous Sydney hotspot Hugos (in its heyday voted best pizza in the world) and a guest on cooking shows such as MasterChef, Sunday Life magazine approached him to take part in their weekly column, My Day on a Plate.</p> <p>The column \u2013 a chance to perve on celebrities\u2019 sometimes bizarre food habits \u2013 often provokes mockery, yet <a href=\"https://kitchen.nine.com.au/healthy/the-pete-evans-diet-decoder/0fcf035f-84f5-4238-a3e3-b4d047128fc0\">Evans topped them all</a>. His morning began with \u201ca smoothie of blended alkalised water, organic spirulina, activated almonds, maca, blueberries, stevia, coconut kefir and two organic, free-range eggs.\u201d The howls of derision could be heard all over the internet and in homes around Australia. Just what the hell were activated almonds?</p> <p>While activated almonds (nuts soaked for 24 hours in water, then dried out again over a low heat) have crossed over to the mainstream and can now be found on supermarket shelves, over the last eight years Evans has been walking a tightrope between two worlds. In one world he\u2019s a prime time television personality and author whose cookbooks, with their wide availability and low price point, have brought him into millions of homes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/chef-pete-evans-criticised-for-trying-to-sell-15000-light-device-to-fight-coronavirus\">Chef Pete Evans criticised for trying to sell $15,000 light device to fight coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the other world he\u2019s a promoter of alternative medicines and health claims that have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/14/doctors-warns-pete-evans-to-stick-to-cooking-after-sharing-anti-vaxx-podcast\">slammed by medical authorities</a>, caused his books to be pulled from shelves and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/chef-pete-evans-criticised-for-trying-to-sell-15000-light-device-to-fight-coronavirus\">most recently attracted penalties</a> from the Therapeutic Goods Administration for promoting a $15,000 light device that could be used in relation to \u201cWuhan Coronavirus\u201d. The TGA said the claim had no apparent foundation.</p> <p>Evans, 47, finally severed ties with the mainstream last week, when the contract for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/08/pete-evans-mkr-celebrity-chef-leaving-exit-seven-my-kitchen-rules-ratings-slump\">long-running judging gig at MKR was not renewed</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s unknown whether the decision is a cost-cutting measure by Channel 7, which has been hit hard by the Covid-19 advertising downturn, or a response to the latest controversy.</p> <p>But since then, Evans has been let off the leash \u2013 a freedom he appears to be relishing.</p> <p>Consuming his hugely popular social media channels \u2013 he has 1.4 million followers on Facebook and 234,000 on Instagram \u2013 has been a wild ride.</p> <p>He posted an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/australian-celebrity-chef-pete-evans-under-fire-for-sharing-views-of-uk-conspiracy-theorist-david-icke\">interview with the Holocaust denier David Icke</a>, who was spouting <a href=\"https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2020/05/01/coronaviurs-5g-theory/\">5G conspiracies</a> and claiming Covid-19 was fake and shared stories about the link between Bill Gates and Covid-19.</p> <p>On Mother\u2019s Day, Evans posted a photo of his elderly mum with her grandchildren and revealed that he is disregarding social distancing guidelines and embracing her every time he sees her.</p> <p>And in a since deleted post, he warned followers that high-profile figures <a href=\"https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2020/05/12/pete-evans-coronavirus-conspiracy/\">were being executed</a> under the guise of having Covid-19. He recently took part in the surge of disinformation around Covid-19 and anti-vaxx theories when he posted on Facebook a link to the discredited conspiracy theory film Plandemic before it was removed.</p> <p>A theme that recurs in his social media feed is mistrust of authorities, the mainstream media and a belief that the real truth is being hidden from the people.</p> <p>After leaving MKR, on Instagram under a picture of Donald Trump and hashtagged with #obamagate he wrote: \u201cThis may be a great time to take off the mainstream media lens, if that is what you have been viewing the world through, and perhaps look through a different lens....or not.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CABro77jvXC/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The run on toilet paper and panic buying was an expression of that. Conspiracy thinking is a consequence of increased fear when people\u2019s idea systems break down,\u201d says Rose. \u201cExcessive and unreasonable conspiracy thinking arises when some people attempt to fill gaps in idea systems that are breaking down. Their existing ideas no longer help them understand a changing world, so they look around for new ideas to fill the gaps.\u201d</p> <p>These include ideas such as the virus being caused by 5G \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/01/why-the-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory-is-false-video-explainer\">categorically found to be false</a> \u2013 or conversely not existing at all.</p> <p>Evan\u2019s social media platforms have a massive, global reach and include a Facebook page that has more followers than a lot of mainstream news organisations, a podcast and a role in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/03/pete-evans-documentary-should-be-cut-from-netflix-doctors-group-says\">controversial Netflix documentary The Magic Pill</a>. Another documentary on cannabis is in the pipeline.</p> <p>Adam Ferrier, a consumer psychologist and founder of Thinkerbell brand agency, told Guardian Australia that \u201cif you have a strong opinion and a distinctive brand then there\u2019s never been a better time to powerfully amplify your message on different platforms. Evans doesn\u2019t need traditional broadcast television any more.\u201d</p> <p>Years in the public eye have meant that Evans has already built a solid following. Now, as his message is increasingly unorthodox, followers aren\u2019t necessarily being repelled by Evans but are supporting him, says Ferrier.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are a person or brand with a lot of followers and you are under attack, the followers like you even more because they have sunk in capital and attention into your brand.\u201d</p> <p>Capital and attention include watching Evans every night on MKR, buying his cookbooks and trying his paleo diet.</p> <p>\u201cThey have already invested in him, they have to keep on rationalising it,\u201d says Ferrier. \u201cIf you\u2019ve sunk costs into something, it\u2019s hard to pull out.\u201d</p> <p>Ferrier, who has also worked as a cult buster, says: \u201cEveryone who has a cookbook in his house is one step closer to believing his bullshit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb8b64e7de642be703115cb9dc82d512c943a4f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb8b64e7de642be703115cb9dc82d512c943a4f9/0_104_3110_1867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"My Kitchen Rules co-hosts Manu Feildel and Pete Evans, in a publicity still from 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">My Kitchen Rules co-hosts Manu Feildel and Pete Evans in a publicity still from 2016.

      "bodyText": "The start of Pete Evans\u2019 long goodbye from the mainstream first became apparent in 2012. After two seasons as a judge on the successful Channel 7 cooking show My Kitchen Rules, co-owner of the glamorous Sydney hotspot Hugos (in its heyday voted best pizza in the world) and a guest on cooking shows such as MasterChef, Sunday Life magazine approached him to take part in their weekly column, My Day on a Plate. The column \u2013 a chance to perve on celebrities\u2019 sometimes bizarre food habits \u2013 often provokes mockery, yet Evans topped them all. His morning began with \u201ca smoothie of blended alkalised water, organic spirulina, activated almonds, maca, blueberries, stevia, coconut kefir and two organic, free-range eggs.\u201d The howls of derision could be heard all over the internet and in homes around Australia. Just what the hell were activated almonds? While activated almonds (nuts soaked for 24 hours in water, then dried out again over a low heat) have crossed over to the mainstream and can now be found on supermarket shelves, over the last eight years Evans has been walking a tightrope between two worlds. In one world he\u2019s a prime time television personality and author whose cookbooks, with their wide availability and low price point, have brought him into millions of homes. In the other world he\u2019s a promoter of alternative medicines and health claims that have been slammed by medical authorities, caused his books to be pulled from shelves and most recently attracted penalties from the Therapeutic Goods Administration for promoting a $15,000 light device that could be used in relation to \u201cWuhan Coronavirus\u201d. The TGA said the claim had no apparent foundation. Evans, 47, finally severed ties with the mainstream last week, when the contract for his long-running judging gig at MKR was not renewed. It\u2019s unknown whether the decision is a cost-cutting measure by Channel 7, which has been hit hard by the Covid-19 advertising downturn, or a response to the latest controversy. But since then, Evans has been let off the leash \u2013 a freedom he appears to be relishing. Consuming his hugely popular social media channels \u2013 he has 1.4 million followers on Facebook and 234,000 on Instagram \u2013 has been a wild ride. He posted an interview with the Holocaust denier David Icke, who was spouting 5G conspiracies and claiming Covid-19 was fake and shared stories about the link between Bill Gates and Covid-19. On Mother\u2019s Day, Evans posted a photo of his elderly mum with her grandchildren and revealed that he is disregarding social distancing guidelines and embracing her every time he sees her. And in a since deleted post, he warned followers that high-profile figures were being executed under the guise of having Covid-19. He recently took part in the surge of disinformation around Covid-19 and anti-vaxx theories when he posted on Facebook a link to the discredited conspiracy theory film Plandemic before it was removed. A theme that recurs in his social media feed is mistrust of authorities, the mainstream media and a belief that the real truth is being hidden from the people. After leaving MKR, on Instagram under a picture of Donald Trump and hashtagged with #obamagate he wrote: \u201cThis may be a great time to take off the mainstream media lens, if that is what you have been viewing the world through, and perhaps look through a different lens....or not. In a Good Weekend profile in 2016, he told the reporter: \u201cI believe we have the wrong information taught to us.\u201d Taught to us by whom? \u201cThe people in charge.\u201d While on the face of it Evans\u2019 departure from his $800,000 a year MKR gig looks like a personal failure, Evans is on track to becoming far more famous and influential outside the mainstream media than within it. While MKR and his restaurants made him well known in Australia, global recognition has come from leading a community that seeks to challenge orthodoxy. This community has the potential to expand during the pandemic and economic downturn, according to Dr James Rose, a social anthropologist at the University of Melbourne. \u201cWhen you have a population-wide crisis such as a pandemic, people whose idea systems are fragile can be driven to act out of fear. The run on toilet paper and panic buying was an expression of that. Conspiracy thinking is a consequence of increased fear when people\u2019s idea systems break down,\u201d says Rose. \u201cExcessive and unreasonable conspiracy thinking arises when some people attempt to fill gaps in idea systems that are breaking down. Their existing ideas no longer help them understand a changing world, so they look around for new ideas to fill the gaps.\u201d These include ideas such as the virus being caused by 5G \u2013 categorically found to be false \u2013 or conversely not existing at all. Evan\u2019s social media platforms have a massive, global reach and include a Facebook page that has more followers than a lot of mainstream news organisations, a podcast and a role in the controversial Netflix documentary The Magic Pill. Another documentary on cannabis is in the pipeline. Adam Ferrier, a consumer psychologist and founder of Thinkerbell brand agency, told Guardian Australia that \u201cif you have a strong opinion and a distinctive brand then there\u2019s never been a better time to powerfully amplify your message on different platforms. Evans doesn\u2019t need traditional broadcast television any more.\u201d Years in the public eye have meant that Evans has already built a solid following. Now, as his message is increasingly unorthodox, followers aren\u2019t necessarily being repelled by Evans but are supporting him, says Ferrier. \u201cIf you are a person or brand with a lot of followers and you are under attack, the followers like you even more because they have sunk in capital and attention into your brand.\u201d Capital and attention include watching Evans every night on MKR, buying his cookbooks and trying his paleo diet. \u201cThey have already invested in him, they have to keep on rationalising it,\u201d says Ferrier. \u201cIf you\u2019ve sunk costs into something, it\u2019s hard to pull out.\u201d Ferrier, who has also worked as a cult buster, says: \u201cEveryone who has a cookbook in his house is one step closer to believing his bullshit. \u201cThere is a massive difference between having a cookbook and believing in the conspiracy theories \u2013 but there could be lots of stepping stones on the way. He\u2019s a judge on MKR, you try his paleo, you start following his social media or his podcasts and the conspiracy theories get to you via these channels. It\u2019s called the foot-in-the-door technique \u2013 as soon as you\u2019ve listened to a few sentences then you\u2019ll listen to a few more and then step by step you\u2019ll start believing in something you once thought was absurd. He\u2019s like a classic cult leader.\u201d Evans also \u201ccleverly\u201d selects big targets \u2013 the medical establishment, the media, \u201cthe government putting fluoride in the water\u201d \u2013 and \u201ctaking on these big institutions gives him bigger standing\u201d, says Ferrier. Says Rose: \u201cConspiracy thinkers often seek out explicit group membership in order to build a stronger sense of their own identity. They are trying to make sense of their changed environment in an immediate way by imagining connections between themselves and others, in an effort to feel safer and more in control of a confusing situation.\u201d Sometimes, a sense of superiority can also pervade the identity of conspiracy-based communities. \u201cFor some people, positioning themselves above others is a source of reinforced identity \u2013 and Pete Evans and his community are very explicit about it \u2013 they believe they are better, more pure, that they are fitter and more active than other people.

Ferrier believes Evans\u2019 power is increasing. \u201cIt depends what\u2019s driving him, but the more influential he becomes, the bigger the harm.\u201d In many ways, Evans is tapping into a prevailing mood \u2013 anxiety, confusion and distrust of authority. \u201cI think he\u2019s always had the ability to have the taste of popular culture \u2013 ever since Hugos.

A number of other community and investor groups have expressed similar sentiments.</p> <p>\u201cAnybody who looks at our economy objectively and thinks about what will be the source of growth after this crisis clearly thinks that industry needs to have cheaper and cleaner energy,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cWe need to get that skills mix, the R&amp;D commercialisation side \u2013 all of those things \u2013 they will be the key to the future.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess what I am relaying is what business says to me \u2026 business can\u2019t understand why we can\u2019t get a resolution on energy, and if you think about our challenges on growth, employment and wages, then I think any serious objective observer would say energy has got to be part [of post-Covid recovery].\u201d</p> <p>Chalmers said it \u201cremains to be seen\u201d whether the major parties could come to terms but he said Labor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/21/labor-to-keep-national-energy-guarantee-in-bid-for-climate-truce\">attitude towards the national energy guarantee</a> indicated \u201cthere were compromises Labor was prepared to make to get some kind of certainty in the system so business could invest with confidence\u201d.</p> <p>In a wide-ranging conversation, Chalmers also flagged Labor would look to develop policies during the current parliamentary term that recognised that unemployment was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/unemployment-rate-in-australia-jumps-to-62-due-to-covid-19-as-600000-jobs-lost\">likely to remain elevated</a> in Australia after the worst of the coronavirus economic shock had passed.</p> <p>New figures released this week show the jobless rate in Australia has hit the highest level since September 2015, with seasonally adjusted employment falling by 594,300 in April. The Australian Bureau of Statistics said around 2.7 million people, or one in every five person employed in March, either left employment, or had their hours reduced between March and April.</p> <p>Chalmers said there was a problem with demand in the economy and there was also a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/01/newstart-crisis-calls-for-independent-commission-to-set-rate-of-welfare-payments\">problem that the unemployment benefit was too low</a>.

      "bodyText": "The shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers says if the Morrison government is serious about kickstarting the economy after the coronavirus, it will seek bipartisan agreement with Labor on a new energy policy, and end the decade long climate wars. In an interview with Guardian Australia\u2019s politics podcast, Chalmers says Labor was prepared to end the \u201cdecade-long barney\u201d in the last parliament by supporting the national energy guarantee to \u201cget some certainty in the system\u201d. He said that mechanism allowed the major parties to bridge their long running disagreement about how quickly Australia should reduce emissions \u201cbecause at some point in the future Labor could dial up the ambition, and the Coalition theoretically could dial down the ambition at some future point\u201d. With the government flagging a program of reforms to boost growth as part of the recovery post-Covid-19, Chalmers said energy was the obvious place to start. \u201cIf they are serious about getting the economy going again, if they are serious about revisiting some of those things they\u2019ve rejected before \u2013 remembering that the last architect of an energy policy is now the treasurer \u2013 for all those reasons I think it would be worth seeing if something is possible.\u201d A leading Australian business organisation, the AiGroup, has recently called for the two biggest economic challenges in memory \u2013 recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and cutting greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 to be addressed together, saying that would boost economic growth and put the country on a firm long-term footing. A number of other community and investor groups have expressed similar sentiments. \u201cAnybody who looks at our economy objectively and thinks about what will be the source of growth after this crisis clearly thinks that industry needs to have cheaper and cleaner energy,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cWe need to get that skills mix, the R&amp;D commercialisation side \u2013 all of those things \u2013 they will be the key to the future.\u201d \u201cI guess what I am relaying is what business says to me \u2026 business can\u2019t understand why we can\u2019t get a resolution on energy, and if you think about our challenges on growth, employment and wages, then I think any serious objective observer would say energy has got to be part [of post-Covid recovery].\u201d Chalmers said it \u201cremains to be seen\u201d whether the major parties could come to terms but he said Labor\u2019s attitude towards the national energy guarantee indicated \u201cthere were compromises Labor was prepared to make to get some kind of certainty in the system so business could invest with confidence\u201d. In a wide-ranging conversation, Chalmers also flagged Labor would look to develop policies during the current parliamentary term that recognised that unemployment was likely to remain elevated in Australia after the worst of the coronavirus economic shock had passed. New figures released this week show the jobless rate in Australia has hit the highest level since September 2015, with seasonally adjusted employment falling by 594,300 in April. The Australian Bureau of Statistics said around 2.7 million people, or one in every five person employed in March, either left employment, or had their hours reduced between March and April. Chalmers said there was a problem with demand in the economy and there was also a problem that the unemployment benefit was too low. The shadow treasurer said he was not an advocate of universal basic income as a concept. Universal basic income provides all citizens with a cash payment, replacing traditional welfare systems. But Chalmers said there was clearly a need to \u201crethink whether the social safety net is stitched together robustly enough to deal with crises like [Covid-19] and the aftermath of crises like this\u201d. He said reference points for that conversation would be job guarantees, or labour market programs like Working Nation \u2013 a labour market program from the Keating era. Chalmers said there was an \u201cappetite\u201d for a place-based labour market program \u201cwhere we recognise for young people in particular, they may be unemployed for longer, and we need to think in innovative ways how we employ these people\u201d. He said central to his thinking was the need to avoid \u201cinter-generational carnage\u201d after an economic downturn. \u201cI think a first world, first rate, wealthy country like ours shouldn\u2019t have disadvantage cascade through the generations.\u201d Chalmers said he was particularly concerned about workers aged over 55 and young people becoming detached from the labour market.",

      "bodyText": "The Gomeroi yinarr (woman) photojournalist Barbara McGrady is hardly ever seen without a camera in her hand. For decades McGrady, in her trademark red, black and yellow tam, has documented Aboriginal life, community and culture and worked the sidelines as one of few women photographers at the NRL. McGrady, 70, has a chronic lung condition, meaning she has been in strict isolation. Some days are good but some days end in a visit to hospital, and for now the view is from the front window of her home in inner Sydney, thanks to Covid-19. \u201cThe world has changed for everybody now. I\u2019m one of those people who are always looking forward to the next day. I want to keep busy working, and because of my illness it\u2019s a real challenge,\u201d McGrady says. \u201cI try and stay motivated and interested in the world around me.\u201d McGrady\u2019s image at the Art Gallery of NSW during the 22nd Biennale of Sydney As one of the 2020 Sydney Biennale artists, McGrady has enjoyed some overdue recognition for the role she has played as a trailblazing Aboriginal woman photographer. Some of those works can still be seen online, but much of the Biennale, like most art and cultural life, has been cancelled, evaporated or viewed on a computer screen. McGrady\u2019s 2019 solo exhibition, Ngiyaningy maran yaliwaunga ngaara-li (Our ancestors are always watching) was \u201can insight into what it means to be a First Nations person surviving and thriving in a colonial world\u201d. \u201cYou need to live and breathe and know your culture.\u201d McGrady says her images are not those of an interested outsider. \u201cThere are a lot of great photographers out there, but nobody has my eye, nobody has my sense of being a blackfella and seeing through a black lens, the way I photograph. Above: Bangarra Dance Theatre. Below: Sister Girls stylin\u2019 up at 2013 Sydney Mardi Gras. Pictures \u2013 Barbara McGrady. \u201cI think that\u2019s why my images resonate with not just our mob but the wider community.\u201d She explains what\u2019s different about the way she sees. \u201cI\u2019m 70 years of age now. So I bring that with me. I bring 60 to 100,000 years of my ancestors with me. That\u2019s how I see the world, that\u2019s how I see my images. That\u2019s my representation. That\u2019s my eye. That\u2019s the way I look at it,\u201d she says. \u201cAnything to do with Aboriginal people I find important to document. I think it\u2019s one way of putting us out in the public domain because mainstream doesn\u2019t seem to cover or put much importance on our events.\u201d \u201cPhotography is an expensive business to be in. You\u2019ve got to have good equipment and good cameras, and be in amongst it all,\u201d McGrady says. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s very important for our stories to be told by us. No one else can tell our stories, we have to tell them and to be out there in the public domain.\u201d Adam Goodes, Lewis Jetta and Lance Franklin after Sydney Swans won the AFL\u2019s Indigenous round at the SCG in 2015. Picture \u2013 Barbara McGrady. McGrady\u2019s images frequently foreground activism, but she is a mad keen sports photographer. One of her favourite images is of Adam Goodes, Lewis Jetta and Buddy Franklin, captured just after the Swans\u2019 win in the 2015 Indigenous round. At the time, Goodes was copping extraordinary public abuse for his anti-racist stand. \u201cI actually photographed three years of the booing of Adam Goodes,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the only one who got that photograph on that day. \u201cI\u2019ve worked very hard to be given NRL media accreditation, to be in amongst the boys\u2019 club, that exclusive club,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ve always wanted to do, to photograph elite sports like the NRL, the AFL and boxing, because I\u2019ve always had a love of sport.

The harsh reality though was it\u2019s almost as if I have less time being at my new desk.</p> <p>A lot of people have jumped into the habit of drinking more during isolation. The first thing my daughter did when her bar was closed was buy ingredients for strawberry daiquiris, \u201cto keep up her bartending skills\u201d.

While she is bored at home, she spends my money on eyelashes, nail polish, shampoos and makeup. Not a lot of my time or effort is put into personal shopping or beauty products. I cut my own hair and never visit beauty salons.</p> <p>Habits that helped control spending went out the window in March and April. There was no real panic-buying or stocking up, it was the fact I had more access and time to shop for groceries, as well as having to spend on goods for the other members of the household as I am the designated shopper (not self-appointed). Until I instil some shopping habits to keep the cost down, this new work-from-home life is very expensive.</p> <p>I spent $42.45 on lottery tickets in March and $59.95 in April. It\u2019s my personal desperation to win money to enable me to stop working. I am never an idle person, so I find that work really gets in the way of how I would love to spend my time.

I also splurged on Animal Crossing ($79.95) in March to give myself a sense of purpose for the next few months \u2013 it worked.</p> <p>I began drinking more in isolation (particularly in March) partially due to boredom and the fact that everyday\u2019s the weekend to me.

      "bodyText": "In Australia \u2013 like the rest of the world \u2013 Covid-19 has put a pause on live entertainment, overseas travel and wining and dining at restaurants. Given lockdown prevents Australians from enjoying many of the luxuries they usually spend their money on, and many face financial insecurity for the first time, it is easy to imagine our spending would slow. But this is not always the case. Commsec data shows retail spending rose by a record 8.5% in March, driven largely by an increase in spending on food and alcohol. Retail prices also rose by 1.9%, the largest rise in 31 years, excluding the introduction of the GST. We asked five Australians, in different financial circumstances, to share their bank statements and spending habits over the first two months of lockdown. With their recurring bills unaltered, their spending \u2013 or in some cases, lack thereof \u2013 on lifestyle items such as alcohol, beauty, deliveries and major splurges tells the story of how a health and economic crisis has changed habits in ways that are not always predictable. Amy Age: 58 Household income: $200,000 Sydney resident Amy is a full-time accountant (for now) who lives with her two elderly parents, her partner and her 20-year-old daughter. Her income supports the majority of the household. When I was forced to work from home, I pictured having a lot more time on my hands for home projects, so I went out and spent the money on things needed to begin in March and then more in April. The harsh reality though was it\u2019s almost as if I have less time being at my new desk. A lot of people have jumped into the habit of drinking more during isolation. The first thing my daughter did when her bar was closed was buy ingredients for strawberry daiquiris, \u201cto keep up her bartending skills\u201d. I tried to put the brakes on as soon as I could. A lot of the expenses for beauty in April are for my daughter. While she is bored at home, she spends my money on eyelashes, nail polish, shampoos and makeup. Not a lot of my time or effort is put into personal shopping or beauty products. I cut my own hair and never visit beauty salons. Habits that helped control spending went out the window in March and April. There was no real panic-buying or stocking up, it was the fact I had more access and time to shop for groceries, as well as having to spend on goods for the other members of the household as I am the designated shopper (not self-appointed). Until I instil some shopping habits to keep the cost down, this new work-from-home life is very expensive. I spent $42.45 on lottery tickets in March and $59.95 in April. It\u2019s my personal desperation to win money to enable me to stop working. I am never an idle person, so I find that work really gets in the way of how I would love to spend my time. Winning the lottery is one (incredibly unlikely) way that could happen. Jess Age: 24 Household income: $20,000 Jess is a student who lives in Toowoomba with her mother, who owns the house. Jess was a library assistant, however she has been stood down from her job and will return when restrictions are lifted. I\u2019ve been stressed about money for so much of my life that I swear it\u2019s become a personality trait at this point. This period has been no different. Luckily, I\u2019m now receiving jobseeker payments. The twisted irony of it all is that I\u2019m actually earning more being unemployed on benefits than I was while I was working. My spending habits have been a combination of necessity and \u201cthink of your sanity\u201d. I paid a fortune for a uni textbook in March \u2013 $210.90. I asked the bookshop if they\u2019d rather take my kidney as payment, and they declined. My choice to order food came not from necessity, however, but from two questions: \u201cwill you butcher this dish if you made it yourself?\u201d and \u201cwill you eventually start crying if this craving is not satisfied?\u201d to which the answer was \u201cyes\u201d on both counts. I also splurged on Animal Crossing ($79.95) in March to give myself a sense of purpose for the next few months \u2013 it worked. I began drinking more in isolation (particularly in March) partially due to boredom and the fact that everyday\u2019s the weekend to me. I did set myself some drinking boundaries though, after polishing off half a bottle of wine before the clock struck noon. In April, I secured 40 litres of fuel for just $38. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I drive a small Nissan, so that was a full tank for me. I haven\u2019t even come close to running low either! Just one of a few silver linings.

      "bodyText": "As Donald Trump spoke to the press in his Rose Garden on Friday, a low hum could be heard from outside the White House grounds. The president said the sound was truckers \u201cshowing support\u201d and insisted: \u201cThey love their president.\u201d In fact, the noise, which grew to include the honking of airhorns, was a protest. According to a long-haul trucking industry website, the Trucker, the protest has been active for 15 days. The drivers involved say they have not received targeted support in any coronavirus stimulus package and do not have adequate access to protective equipment and healthcare. They have also voiced serious concerns about the rates they are getting through brokers who connect them with people needing to ship goods. According to the Washington Post, \u201cJust two weeks ago, President Trump personally extended his gratitude to truckers, welcoming representatives of the industry to the White House and calling truckers \u2018the foot soldiers\u2019 in the war against the novel coronavirus.\u201d But the paper quoted Santiago, \u201ca 21-year veteran of the industry from New Jersey\u201d, as saying: \u201cThe American truck driver needs help, and we need it now. This is our distress call to our commander in chief to address the problems we are facing. He has called us heroes \u2013 his heroes need his help now.\u201d On Wednesday, the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, met the protesters for nearly 15 minutes, the Trucker reported. This, the website said, gave some enough hope to return to work, though it added that many did so simply because they could not afford more unpaid leave. The Trucker reported that Meadows met Michael Landis, founder and chief executive of the United States Transportation Alliance, who acted as a spokesman. Meadows \u201coffered his personal email and promised that if Landis put together a list of priorities and [sent] it to him, Meadows [would] act\u201d, the website reported. \u201cThe wary Landis, who has personally heard years of promises of action from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and others in Washington, responded, \u2018We\u2019d like to hear that from the president.\u2019\u201d Meadows reportedly insisted he was \u201cspeaking on behalf of the president of the United States\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Global number of confirmed cases passes 4.5m According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 4,523,916 people are known to have been infected and 306,412 people have died worldwide since the pandemic began. The figures are likely to represent a significant underestimate of the true scale of the pandemic. Record increase in cases in Brazil Brazil confirms 15,305 new cases; a record for a 24-hour period, as well as 824 related deaths, according to data from the country\u2019s health ministry. The country has registered 218,223 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, as well as 14,817 deaths. Fears US could hit 100,000 deaths within weeks The CDC director Robert Redfield says the number of deaths in the US is projected to exceed 100,000 by 1 June. The agency came to the conclusion after tracking 12 different forecasting models, which all predicted at least 100,000 deaths. China seeks Taiwanese exclusion from WHO meeting Beijing steps up pressure on European states to reject Taiwan\u2019s call to be represented at next week\u2019s assembly of the World Health Organization, arguing that its presence can only be justified if it accepts that it is part of China. The World Health Assembly is being held virtually on Monday and Taiwan\u2019s attendance \u2013 as well as a possible international inquiry into the origins of the pandemic \u2013 are likely to be the two big political flashpoints between China and the West. EU states yet to reach funding agreement There is no agreement yet between European Union countries on how much of the bloc\u2019s proposed new recovery fund should be handed out as grants to member states and how much in loans, a senior EU official says. Europe could see second wave of winter infections, WHO warns European countries face a deadly second wave of infections in the winter, the World Health Organization\u2019s top official in Europe says. Dr Hans Kluge, the director for the WHO European region, warned countries beginning to ease their lockdown restrictions that now is the \u201ctime for preparation, not celebration\u201d. Dr Kluge told the Telegraph countries should use the current period to build capacity in hospitals and strengthen public health systems. Denmark reports nil deaths for first time since March Denmark reports zero deaths on Friday \u2013 the first time it has seen no fatalities in a 24-hour period since 13 March. The country\u2019s total number of confirmed cases rises by 78 to 10,791, while the number of hospitalisations falls by 10 to 137. The death toll remains unchanged at 537. Italian death and infection rates fall Italy reports 242 more fatalities, down by 20 on the number seen in the previous 24 hours.

Restaurants, bars, hairdressers and beauty salons are due to reopen on Monday, while the ban on inter-regional travel might be lifted from 3 June. Spain hails large-scale antibody study The Spanish government hails a large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the efforts to end the pandemic, but warns that any premature or irresponsible relaxation of restrictions could have \u201cenormous consequences\u201d given that only 5% of Spaniards have had the disease. The country\u2019s Socialist-led coalition government is under growing pressure from political opponents to end the two-month state of emergency that underpins one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.",

An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases.</p> \n  <p>The range is slightly higher than that quoted by officials in recent weeks. When announcing plans to ease some lockdown restrictions on Sunday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have the R below one, between 0.5 and 0.9 \u2013 but potentially only just below one.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The slight increase, and narrowing in the range, is not linked to relaxations that have occurred this week as the estimate is based largely on hospital admissions and deaths data, which reflect the levels of transmission two to three weeks ago.</p> \n  <p>A likely explanation is that as the overall levels of infection have fallen, hospital and care home settings are making a relatively bigger contribution to the overall estimate of R. Lockdown restrictions have less impact in these settings and there are still concerns about the levels of testing available in care homes.</p> \n  <p>The figure suggests that, while the lockdown has been extremely effective at bringing down case numbers, R is still close to 1, meaning that it would not be possible to ease restrictions significantly without new measures to contain outbreaks, such as extensive testing and tracing.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebec4768f0886ce4f5d45fa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T16:41:21.413Z\">5.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d7388d2ee2c9fff7a954ed6079712d4216c9d22\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d7388d2ee2c9fff7a954ed6079712d4216c9d22/0_67_4152_2493/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street performer Robert John Burck, known as The Naked Cowboy poses at Times Square on May 15, 2020 in New York City.

study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Spanish government has hailed a large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus, but warned that any premature or irresponsible relaxation of restrictions could have \u201cenormous consequences\u201d given that only 5% of Spaniards have had the disease.<br></p> \n  <p>The country\u2019s Socialist-led coalition government is under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/spain-path-out-of-covid-lockdown-complicated-by-polarised-politics\">growing pressure from political opponents to end the two-month state of emergency</a> that underpins one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.</p> \n  <p>On Friday, the health ministry was due to decide whether the Madrid region would be granted permission to follow other areas into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/global-report-spain-and-italy-grapple-with-how-to-end-covid-19-lockdown\">next stage of the de-escalation</a>, which allows up to 10 people to meet and permits the reopening of cafe and restaurant terraces at 50% capacity.</p> \n  <p>Pedro Duque, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/06/new-spanish-pm-appoints-astronaut-pedro-duque-science-minister\">former astronaut who serves as Spain\u2019s science minister</a>, told the Guardian that the preliminary results of a nationwide serological study published earlier this week would be crucial to the government\u2019s response.</p> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-05-14/antibody-study-shows-just-5-of-spaniards-have-contracted-the-coronavirus.html\">study, which involved more than 60,000 people</a>, revealed that around 5% of the population \u2013 about 2 million people \u2013 had had the coronavirus. It also showed that 33% of those who had caught the virus had not shown any symptoms.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe think that the seroprevalence test we\u2019ve carried out is the best that\u2019s been done anywhere in the world so far. The most important conclusion we\u2019ve reached is that it is vital to keep acting very prudently when it comes to this illness \u2013 there are still a lot of people who haven\u2019t been exposed to the virus,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Duque said the pronounced geographical variations underscored the need for a region-by-region loosening of restrictions: while Murcia, Melilla, Asturias and the Canary islands showed an infection rate of less than 2%, the proportion rose to more than 10% in the regions of Madrid and Castilla-La Mancha.</p> \n  <p>\u201cRight now, the only way to act is by making small changes when it comes to relaxing the conditions, by maintaining the distances between people, and by keeping up with the infection precautions,\u201d he added.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe consequences of acting irresponsibly could be enormous given that we know that only 5% of the population has some degree of immunity against the virus. That means that 95% don\u2019t.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Duque also dismissed talk of so-called \u201cimmunity passports\u201d to allow more freedom of movement to those who had recovered from the disease. The science, he said, simply did not support such a move.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFrom a personal scientific point of view, all I can say is that we don\u2019t even know for sure that immunity exists, so we\u2019re very far from all of that. We don\u2019t have scientific information that guarantees that people with the antibodies are immune to future infections. So we\u2019re very far from being able to take legal responsibility for that.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T13:26:20.543Z\">at 2.26pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe8b868f08898ae689138e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kateconnolly\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T12:42:03.142Z\">1.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Travellers arriving to Germany from the European Union and the Schengen passport-free zone will no longer have to go into quarantine for two weeks as has been the case since March, according to the interior ministry.</p> \n  <p>The new measure is on condition that the country the visitor has travelled from does not have a high number of coronavirus infections.

Details on the precise implementation of the rules is to follow, but the western state of North Rhine Westphalia already applied them on the stroke of midnight on Friday.</p> \n  <p>Germans are closely watching the gradual easing of travel restrictions wanting to know to what extent they can hope to go on a foreign holiday this year. From May, 25 flights between Germany and Greece will resume. But officially the advice remains that Germans should not travel anywhere abroad, until at least 14 June.</p> \n  <p>On Monday Heiko Maas, the foreign minister, will hold a video conference with his counterparts from European countries where Germans typically go on holiday, including Spain, Italy, Austria, Greece, Croatia, Portugal, Malta, Slovenia, Cyprus and Bulgaria. The aim is to facilitate a coordinated reopening of borders including mutual agreements on being able to swiftly close them again in case of a rise in cases.</p> \n  <p>On Wednesday, the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, announced that an opening of the borders with France, Switzerland and Austria was on the cards from 15 June. On Wednesday, border traffic between Germany and Luxembourg is due to normalise again. Discussions with Denmark are still ongoing.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T13:31:26.329Z\">at 2.31pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe895b8f0849a584fe11e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T12:30:58.134Z\">1.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d449499bdbd6a41bba2045349f8c1b558c21f8a9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d449499bdbd6a41bba2045349f8c1b558c21f8a9/0_44_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Health workers in the Take Care of Care movement protest in Liege against the Belgian authorities\u2019 management of coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Health workers in the Take Care of Care movement protest in Liege against the Belgian authorities\u2019 management of coronavirus.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T13:32:36.324Z\">at 2.32pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe88bf8f08898ae689136b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T12:20:07.127Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Denmark reports zero coronavirus-related deaths for the first time since March</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Denmark has reported zero coronavirus-related deaths in the last 24 hours for the first time since 13 March, Reuters reports.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T13:33:01.701Z\">at 2.33pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe87d98f08898ae6891364\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/david-agren\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T12:15:50.238Z\">1.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More than 100 Mexicans have died from drinking adulterated alcohol over the past month in a string of mass poisonings which followed a ban on the sale of liquor during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> \n  <p>Deaths from unsafe alcohol have been reported in at least four states.

Whether there is a maximum number of people allowed for each household has not been specified. For those from a single household the distancing rules do not apply. </p> \n  <p>Waiting staff are required to wear face coverings.

If restaurants submit applications specific to the streets they would like to occupy, officials will move to close the roads to traffic on Fridays and at weekends, between 11am and 10pm.</p> \n  <p>Some concerns have been expressed that that arrangement may put the safety of diners under threat \u2013 with some sceptics making reference to the Berlin Christmas market attack of 2016 when an Islamist terrorist drove a lorry into the crowd, killing 12.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T11:13:13.631Z\">at 12.13pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe70258f08898ae689124f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T10:36:25.650Z\">11.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin, taking over the liveblog from my colleague Matt. </p> \n  <p>If you want to get in touch, you can email me (aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com) or reach me on Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/aamnamohdin\">@aamnamohdin</a>).</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe6bb88f08898ae689122b\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T10:33:52.799Z\">11.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a roundup of the key developments so far on Friday: </p> \n  <p><strong>China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced</strong><br></p> \n  <p>China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus on Friday, all local cross-infections in the north-eastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April.</p> \n  <p><strong>Virus pushes Germany into recession</strong><br></p> \n  <p>German output shrank by 2.2% in the first quarter of 2020, according to new official data. The quarter-on-quarter contraction is \u201cthe worst since the financial crisis\u201d in 2009, the federal statistics office Destatis said. The agency also revised its gross domestic product (GDP) figure for the final quarter of 2019 from zero growth to a contraction of 0.1%, meaning Germany has now experienced two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 the technical definition of a recession.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Slovenia proclaims end to the outbreak</strong></p> \n  <p>Slovenia has become the first European country to proclaim an end to the coronavirus epidemic at home. It said on Friday that the spread of Covid-19 was under control and there was no longer a need for extraordinary health measures.</p> \n  <p><strong>Spain announces lowest daily death toll since Monday</strong></p> \n  <p>Spain\u2019s death toll from coronavirus registered its lowest increase since Monday with 138 new fatalities announced by the health ministry. The overall coronavirus death toll, in Europe\u2019s fourth worst hit country, rose to 27,459 on Friday, while the number of diagnosed cases rose to 230,183 cases from 229,540.</p> \n  <p><strong>Italy and Germany to ease more restrictions</strong></p> \n  <p>Italy is set to allow free travel across the country from 3 June, according to a draft decree seen by Reuters. The draft, which could still be modified before it is approved, also said all travel within separate Italian regions would be allowed from 18 May. Germany will loosen quarantine rules for travellers arriving from the European Union and the UK, according to the interior ministry. </p> \n  <p><strong>China responds diplomatically to Trump threat of cutting off ties</strong></p> \n  <p>China\u2019s foreign ministry has responded diplomatically to Donald Trump\u2019s threat of cutting ties with Beijing over the virus. The US president said the pandemic had cast a pall over his January trade deal with Beijing and that he had no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment. China\u2019s foreign ministry said on Friday that steady Sino-US bilateral relations served the interests of both countries.</p> \n  <p><strong>Baltic states restore free movement </strong></p> \n  <p>The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have opened their borders to each other to create a mini-Schengen area. Free movement of people will be restored to all 6 million permanent residents of the Baltic states, but arrivals from outside the three countries will have to undergo a two-week quarantine period.</p> \n  <p><strong>Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases</strong></p> \n  <p> Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally.</p> \n  <p><strong>Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000</strong></p> \n  <p>The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday. The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in the last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. 844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993.</p> \n  <p><strong>South Korea, China and Japan\u2019s health ministers to hold video conference</strong></p> \n  <p>The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will get together by video conference on Friday to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the east Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.</p> \n  <p><strong>Covid-19 reaches refugee camps in Bangladesh</strong></p> \n  <p>Aid groups have warned of a looming humanitarian disaster after coronavirus was detected for the first time in the sprawling camps that host about 1 million Rohingya refugees.

This is a \u201creciprocal\u201d measure after Spain imposed 14 days\u2019 quarantine for anyone arriving from the EU/Schengen area.</p> \n  <p> The French border is currently closed to any visitors other than essential travellers who have a \u201ccompelling\u201d professional or personal reason to enter the country and are carrying a sworn declaration to that effect. June 15 has been set for a possible reopening of French borders to European visitors.</p> \n  <p>Deaths on French roads dropped by just under 56% during April compared with the same month last year. This is hardly surprising as everyone was locked down, but police records suggested those who were on the empty roads drove faster.

According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 302,452 people have now died as a result of the outbreak. The institution says it has counted 4,443,597 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.</li> \n   <li><strong>China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced. </strong>China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus on Friday, all local cross-infections in the northeastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump threatens to cut China ties. </strong>US President Donald Trump signalled a further deterioration of his relationship with China over coronavirus, saying he has no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment and going so far as to suggest he could cut ties with the world\u2019s second largest economy. Chinese state media has responded saying his comments are \u201clunacy\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself. </strong>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">without wearing a mask himself</a>. Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases. </strong>Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000. </strong>The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday.The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. 844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Korea, China and Japan health ministers to hold video conference. </strong>The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will get together by video conference on Friday to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the novel coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the East Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.</li> \n   <li><strong>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus. </strong>Doctors in northern Italy,<strong> </strong>one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</li> \n   <li><strong>Covid-19 reaches refugee camps in Bangladesh. </strong>A Rohingya man has become the first person to test positive for Covid-19 in the vast refugee camps in Bangladesh that is home to almost one million people. Local health coordinator Abu Toha Bhuiyan initially said two refugees had been put into isolation. The World Health Organization later said one case was of a Rohingya man, and the other was of a local man who lived near the camp and was being treated at a clinic inside the area.</li> \n   <li><strong>36 million Americans are now unemployed. </strong>Another 3 million Americans filed for benefits, bringing the country\u2019s total unemployed to 36 million. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T07:05:58.460Z\">at 8.05am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe2d908f08d99d46a174b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T05:50:18.490Z\">6.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Get in touch on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter @helenrsullivan</a>. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe2c038f08d99d46a174a3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/alison-rourke\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T05:45:17.107Z\">6.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Global report: Trump threat to cut trade ties over Covid-19 branded \u2018lunacy\u2019 by Chinese media</h2> \n  <p>An escalation of rhetoric between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> and China over the coronavirus pandemic has sparked concerns that a trade deal between the nations is in peril, as Chinese state media dismissed as \u201clunacy\u201d a suggestion by the US president that he could \u201ccut off relations with Beijing.</p> \n  <p>The US president said he was very disappointed with China\u2019s failure to contain Covid-19 in an interview with Fox Business news.

According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 302,452 people have now died as a result of the outbreak.The institution says it has counted 4,443,597 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.</li> \n   <li><strong>China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced. </strong>China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus Friday, all local cross-infections in the northeastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump says he could cut China ties. </strong>US President Donald Trump signalled a further deterioration of his relationship with China over the novel coronavirus, saying he has no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping right now and going so far as to suggest he could even cut ties with the world\u2019s second largest economy. </li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">Donald Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself</a>. </strong>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but without wearing a mask himself.Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</li> \n   <li><strong>The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will gather by video conference </strong>to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the novel coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the East Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases. </strong>Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000. </strong>The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday.The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. 844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993.</li> \n   <li><strong>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus. </strong>Doctors in northern Italy,<strong> </strong>one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</li> \n   <li><strong>A vaccine for coronavirus must be available to all countries, the EU has insisted</strong>, after the British chief executive of French drugs company Sanofi said it was reserving the first shipments of its vaccine for the US. \u201cThe vaccine against Covid-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal,\u201d said the European commission spokesman, Stefan de Keersmaecker.</li> \n   <li><strong>36 million Americans are now unemployed as another 3 million filed for benefits</strong>. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</li> \n   <li><strong>The European commission has suspended the delivery of 10 million face masks from China</strong> after two countries complained about the poor quality of the batches they received, the Associated Press reports. As part of its efforts to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, this month the commission started dispatching the masks to healthcare workers in its 27 member states and the UK.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T07:07:10.737Z\">at 8.07am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe1d1b8f080c727453b50c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T04:41:08.002Z\">5.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Get in touch on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter @helenrsullivan</a>. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe1c578f080c727453b508\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T04:37:51.856Z\">5.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kjalee/status/1260918708458991616\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Oh my god, this is amazing.

The true number is likely to be higher. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Global death toll passes 300,000. </strong>The global toll from Covid-19 has just passed 300,000, with nearly 4.5 million people infected.According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 301,370 people have now died as a result of the outbreak.The institution says it has counted 4,426,937 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Nearly 600,000 Australians have lost their jobs during the pandemic. </strong>Almost 600,000 Australians lost their jobs between March and April, unemployment rose to 6.2%, the underemployment rate increased by 4.9 points to 13.7% and the underutilisation rate increased by 5.9 points to 19.9%.The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the figures were \u201cterribly shocking, although not totally unexpected\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus. </strong>Doctors in northern Italy,<strong> </strong>one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">Donald Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself</a>. </strong>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but without wearing a mask himself.Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</li> \n   <li><strong>A vaccine for coronavirus must be available to all countries, the EU has insisted</strong>, after the British chief executive of French drugs company Sanofi said it was reserving the first shipments of its vaccine for the US. \u201cThe vaccine against Covid-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal,\u201d said the European commission spokesman, Stefan de Keersmaecker.</li> \n   <li><strong>36 million Americans are now unemployed as another 3 million filed for benefits</strong>. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</li> \n   <li><strong>The European commission has suspended the delivery of 10 million face masks from China</strong> after two countries complained about the poor quality of the batches they received, the Associated Press reports. As part of its efforts to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, this month the commission started dispatching the masks to healthcare workers in its 27 member states and the UK.</li> \n   <li><strong>Officials in Bangladesh have announced the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the country\u2019s Rohingya refugee camps</strong>. Health experts and NGOs have issued warnings that the virus could race through the camps that house almost a million people forced to flee a military offensive in Myanmar almost two years ago.</li> \n   <li><strong>Greece will open 515 organised beaches to the public this weekend</strong>, but alcohol and music will be banned, along with sports and games. Scientists advising the government also insisted that given the dictates of social distancing there can only be 40 people per 1000 sq meters.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Governments, health authorities and civil society groups should urgently address mental health problems sparked by the coronavirus pandemic</strong>, the UN secretary general has said. Launching a policy briefing on mental health during the outbreak, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said that \u201cthe Covid-19 pandemic is now hitting families and communities with additional mental stress.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Ten people in Vietnam, including a 70-year-old military veteran, have offered to donate their lungs to a British man </strong>who is the country\u2019s most seriously ill Covid-19 patient. \u201cWe are touched by their good intentions, but current regulations don\u2019t allow us to transplant lungs donated by most living people,\u201d a representative of Vietnam\u2019s organ transplant authority said.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div>",

According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, there are 4,531,811 confirmed cases worldwide. The number of people who have lost their lives is 307,001 according to official tolls, but the true number is likely to be much higher. The number of deaths in the US is projected to exceed 100,000 by 1 June, according to the CDC director Robert Redfield. The agency came to the conclusion after tracking 12 different forecasting models; all of which predicted at least that number of deaths.Trump has oscillated, but has previously said the toll would be lower. Record increase in cases in Brazil. Brazil has confirmed 15,305 new cases; a record for a 24-hour period, as well as 824 related deaths, according to data from the country\u2019s Health Ministry. Brazil has registered 218,223 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, as well as 14,817 deaths. Beijing increases pressure on European states to reject Taiwan\u2019s WHO inclusion. China has stepped up the pressure on European states to reject Taiwan\u2019s call to be represented at next week\u2019s assembly of the World Health Organization, arguing that its presence can only be justified if it accepts that it is part of China.The World Health Assembly is being held virtually on Monday, and Taiwan\u2019s attendance \u2013 as well as a possible international inquiry into the start of the pandemic \u2013 are likely to be the two big political flashpoints between China and the west. US president Donald Trump said on Friday the US government was working with other countries to develop a coronavirus vaccine at an accelerated pace. Trump expressed his hope that a vaccine would be in place before the end of the year at an event in the White House Rose Garden and said his administration would mobilise its forces to get a vaccine distributed once one was in place. UK\u2019s reproduction rate still close to 1, bringing lockdown-easing steps into question. The latest official estimate places the national R value - the rate at which people are passing on infections to others \u2013 at between 0.7 and 1. An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases. Europe could face deadly second wave of winter infections, WHO warns. Dr Hans Kluge, director for the WHO European region, warned countries beginning to ease their lockdown restrictions that now is \u201ctime for preparation, not celebration\u201d. Second health minister resigns in Brazil after less than a month on the job. Brazil\u2019s health minister, Nelson Teich, handed in his resignation on Friday, his office said, after less than a month on the job as the country becomes a world hotspot for coronavirus. Teich is believed to have disagreed with the rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro. Brazil has now surpassed Germany and France and had more than 200,000 confirmed cases of the virus as of Thursday. Spain hails large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus. The Spanish government has hailed a large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus, but warned that any premature or irresponsible relaxation of restrictions could have \u201cenormous consequences\u201d given that only 5% of Spaniards have had the disease. Denmark reports zero coronavirus-related deaths for the first time since March. The country reported zero coronavirus-related deaths in the last 24 hours for the first time since 13 March. Hi, Helen Sullivan joining you now for the next few hours. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. The number of deaths in the US is projected to exceed 100,000 by 1 June, according to the CDC director Robert Redfield. The agency came to the conclusion after tracking 12 different forecasting models; all of which predicted at least that number of deaths. Trump has oscillated, but has previously said the toll would be lighter. Dr Deborah Birx of the White House coronavirus task force has repeatedly asserted the number of deaths by 1 June will be between 100,000 and 240,000 if mitigation strategies continue. Hundreds of people are expected to be evicted from their hillside homes in a slum of Colombia\u2019s capital Bogota, despite having nowhere to go during the country\u2019s lockdown. The informal houses have been declared illegal by local authorities and will be knocked down as part of the evictions, Reuters reports. Residents accuse police accompanying the eviction process of excessive force. The Altos de la Estancia neighbourhood was home to about 1,000 families when evictions began two weeks ago. Now just some 100 families remain, residents told the news agency. John Parra, 36, moved to Bogota after being displaced by the country\u2019s internal conflict. He said: The majority of the people that live here are unemployed because of Covid-19 and the pandemic. Brazil has confirmed 15,305 new cases; a record for a 24-hour period, as well as 824 related deaths, according to data from the country\u2019s Health Ministry. Brazil has registered 218,223 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, as well as 14,817 deaths. As the outbreak in Ecuador\u2019s largest city of Guayaquil begins to stabilise, the government is bracing for worsening spread in the highland capital Quito, where at least six people have died in the streets in the past month. Guayaquil was at the centre of one of Latin America\u2019s worst outbreaks in March and April. Cemeteries ran out of space and families stored relatives\u2019 dead bodies in their homes or on the streets as the virus strained the health system\u2019s capacity to collect them, Reuters has reported. But authorities\u2019 attentions are now turning to Quito, whose 2.8 million residents are under a strict lockdown to contain the virus\u2019 spread. The local government said that, between 4 April and 13 May, it had picked up the bodies of six people who had died in the streets, in addition to seven bodies from homes and two from nursing homes. The government said on Thursday night that 135 of the 164 intensive care beds in the city\u2019s public hospitals are occupied, and that it plans to install about 80 more. \u201cQuito\u2019s health system is reaching its limit,\u201d the city\u2019s mayor Jorge Yunda said on Friday during the opening of a temporary 380-bed hospital for epidemic patients. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 2,043 more deaths and 27,191 new cases, bringing the totals to 85,990 and 1,412,121, respectively. Panama has extended its ban on international flights by a month to 22 June, the country\u2019s aviation authority has said. The possibility that Americans may have to pay to be vaccinated against the virus remains open, though the US president Donald Trump says he is looking at possibly making a future vaccine available for free. A woman in the American state of Georgia has been arrested for allegedly cheating Medicare \u2013 the US health insurance program for those aged older than 65 and the disabled \u2013 by submitting fraudulent claims related to coronavirus testing and genetic cancer tests, the US Justice Department has said. The case against 32-year-old Ashley Hoobler Parris marks one of the first Medicare fraud cases in connection with Covid-19 billings. The latest Australian politics live blog has been released. After taking a break, Katharine Murphy is back to speak with Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, about the post-coronavirus economy. They discuss the nation\u2019s level of debt and the possible long-term changes to Australia\u2019s welfare system. Will a universal basic income be introduced in the future? How can we stop intergenerational unemployment? What lessons from the global financial crisis can be used? Soldiers from the British Gurkha regiments have rescued more than 100 Britons stuck in remote parts of Nepal. Strict lockdown measures and reduced transport in the country meant many travellers were unable to reach chartered repatriation flights last month. A total of 109 British nationals and 28 foreign nationals stranded in isolated parts of the country were picked up over three weeks. Using the local knowledge of British Ghurka networks based in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Dharan, staff at the UK Embassy and soldiers were able to locate the travellers and devise plans to reach them. The Mexican president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has accused international media outlets of lying as stories accumulate on the country\u2019s alleged undercounting of its case numbers and death toll. Investigations by the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and El Pa\u00eds have all included such suggestions. In a rambling response to an unrelated question, L\u00f3pez Obrador complained about reporters \u201cgoing to graveyards\u201d and crematoria to verify Covid-19 deaths. The famously stubborn L\u00f3pez Obrador, who seldom lets critical comments pass unanswered, also called for the foreign press to practice some \u201cself-criticism\u201d. There\u2019s a crisis of the lack of ethics in the handling of information in Mexico, in the world. The world\u2019s most famous newspapers lie, slander. The New York Times, the Washington Post, the Financial Times, El Pa\u00eds, are very famous, but without ethics. The outburst came after Reforma, a Mexican newspaper L\u00f3pez Obrador frequently criticises, reported it had received threats from someone claiming to be part of the Sinaloa Cartel to blow up its building if it didn\u2019t stop critical coverage. Mexico has reported 42,595 cases and 4,477 deaths as of Thursday. A Sky News investigation estimated Mexico City\u2019s death rate is five times higher than the official figures. Still, parts of the country will reopen on Monday and L\u00f3pez Obrador says the curve has been \u201cflattened\u201d. The president has said he will ask the health secretariat it is okay for him to resume his tours of the country to check on the progress of mega projects under construction and open branches of a government bank. Medical experts have questioned if Mexico is ready to reopen; the country has guided its Covid-19 response with disease modelling, rather than testing. Its testing rates rank among the lowest in Latin America at 0.4 per 1,000 people. English Premier League squads could be quarantined in the event of a single failed test if clubs vote to return to training next week. Players are to be tested for Covid\u201119 twice a week during a first stage of return, with a positive test requiring the player to isolate for seven days under Public Health England guidelines. But the rules also require that a \u201ccontact\u201d of a known case should isolate, as someone would if they were living in the same house. That quarantine period should last for 14 days. The English Football League, in training protocols sent to its clubs this week, confirmed that a \u201cplaying group\u201d would be quarantined for 14 days if one of their number tested positive. The Premier League would not comment on the details of its protocols but confirmed it was following PHE guidelines. Beijing has stepped up the pressure on European states to reject Taiwan\u2019s call to be represented at next week\u2019s assembly of the World Health Organization, arguing that its presence can only be justified if it accepts that it is part of China. The World Health Assembly is being held virtually on Monday and Taiwan\u2019s attendance \u2013 as well as a possible international inquiry into the start of the pandemic \u2013 are likely to be the two big political flashpoints between China and the west. Chinese diplomats have been contacting governments across Europe to limit the diplomatic support for Taiwan\u2019s attendance, targeting northern and eastern European states. Maintaining collective EU unity on China is proving difficult. But in a letter to the Guardian, the former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former president of Poland Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski and the former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt argue that Taiwan should be permitted to attend because of its pioneering response to the pandemic, which has drawn on the lessons of the 2003 Sars outbreak. Amazon is aiming to gradually reopen its French warehouses from 19 May as it finalises an agreement with unions and work councils to end a spat that led to a more than one-month closure of the sites, Reuters reports. Its six French warehouses have been closed since 16 April following court rulings that ordered it to restrict deliveries during the pandemic or face hefty fines. Portugal will reopen its beaches on 6 June, its prime minister Antonio Costa has said. And he encouraged the public to download an app that will tell them if their beach of choice is full or still has space. Groups must stay 1.5m apart, deck-chairs may only be booked for the morning or afternoon, and beach sports of two people or more will not be allowed, according to the new rules. But the police will not be keeping watch, Costa said, urging people to adhere to the measures by themselves. \u201cBeaches should be places of leisure,\u201d Costa said. \u201cWe have to be checking ourselves.\u201d There is no agreement yet between European Union countries on how much of the bloc\u2019s proposed new recovery fund should be handed out as grants to member states and how much in loans, a senior EU official has said. The official spoke to the Reuters news agency on condition of anonymity as the EU executive in Brussels pushed back the unveiling of its new proposal for the bloc\u2019s next long-term budget, and the accompanying recovery fund, until 27 May. The fund aims to kick-start growth on the continent as it heads for its worst-ever economic downturn. The jackpot question is what is the size and what will be loans and grants. Here there is a lot of work to do... This process is an extremely fragile one. The official said all the EU\u2019s 27 member states agree that the European commission will raise money on capital markets for the recovery fund. The funds will be channelled through the EU\u2019s next budget, called the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). \u201cThe question of loans or grants is not quite there,\u201d the person said, adding that some of the northern EU countries continued to oppose handing out money in grants. Mexico\u2019s automotive industry can exit the lockdown before 1 June if companies have approved safety measures in place, the country\u2019s government has said, seeking to set the record straight after sending out confusing signals on the matter. Announced in the government\u2019s official gazette, the instructions should allow companies to reconnect key supply chains between Mexico and the rest of North America, which depends considerably on parts made south of the US border. The directive refers to manufacturers of transportation equipment, as well as the mining and construction industries, all of which the government have designated essential and from 18 May can begin establishing security protocols. \u201cIf the process is concluded and approved before 1 June, the relevant company or industry will be able to begin its operations,\u201d the government said, noting that companies which put workers\u2019 health at risk would be shut down. In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) is making preparations to roll out its Covid-19 contact-tracing app nationwide before the end of the month, the Guardian understands. The smartphone app, which alerts people if they have come into contact with an individual who has reported coronavirus symptoms, is being trialed on the Isle of Wight and is a key part of the government\u2019s \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d strategy as the country eases out of lockdown. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, previously said the app, which has been beset by privacy issues, fears about its uptake among older people and concern it may be dropped entirely, would be released nationwide in mid-May. However, Simon Murphy, Heather Stewart, Alex Hern and Denis Campbell write that the wider public in England will now have to wait until at least the week commencing 25 May. Hancock has been receiving daily progress updates, he said. Asked whether it would be rolled out to Scotland, he replied: \u201cIt will be a matter for the Scottish government. It will be available, but public health is a devolved matter.\u201d French health authorities have reported 104 more deaths, or a decelerating increase of 0.4%. That brings the total to 27,529 \u2013 the fourth worst in the world. The ministry added that the number of confirmed cases has risen to 141,919 \u2013 up from 141,356 on Thursday, which also represents a rise of 0.4% in 24 hours. US president Donald Trump said on Friday the US government was working with other countries to develop a coronavirus vaccine at an accelerated pace.

The country reported zero coronavirus-related deaths in the last 24 hours for the first time since 13 March President Donald Trump said on Friday the US government was working with other countries to develop a coronavirus vaccine at an accelerated pace, Reuters reports. Trump expressed his hope that a vaccine would be in place before the end of the year at an event in the White House Rose Garden and said his administration would mobilise its forces to get a vaccine distributed once one was in place. Trump also said the government would invest in all the top coronavirus vaccine candidates and said a list had been narrowed to 14 promising possibilities with a plan to narrow further. The Spanish government has just announced that the Madrid and Barcelona regions will remain in the first stage of lockdown de-escalation, but says some restrictions will be lifted. From Monday, small businesses in both regions will be allowed to serve people without prior appointments, and places of worship will be able to reopen at 30% capacity. Almost three-quarters of the country will be in the second phase by Monday, while 30% - some 14 million people - will remain in the first stage of lockdown loosening. The coronavirus has prompted almost two-thirds of American believers to feel that God is telling humanity to change how it lives, a poll has found. Downing Street has rolled back on the idea of exempting travellers from France from incoming quarantine rules, with only freight drivers and experts working on anti-Covid-19 efforts being able to avoid the 14-day isolation period. Boris Johnson used his TV address last Sunday to announce that quarantine restrictions would soon be imposed on people entering the UK, but only mentioned those arriving by air. It later became clear that the rules would also apply to arrivals by road, rail and sea. Later on Sunday, after a call between Johnson and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, Downing Street said \u201cno quarantine measures would apply to travellers coming from France at this stage\u201d. Asked about it on Friday, however, Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a French exemption. What the statement at the weekend said was they were quoting measures applied to France [at that stage], and that was a joint statement between ourselves and the French.\u201d Transmission rates of Covid-19 remain dangerously close to the levels that could cause the epidemic in the UK to start to grow again, according to the government\u2019s latest estimates, raising questions about the extent to which restrictions can be safely eased in the coming weeks. The latest official estimate places the national R value - the rate at which people are passing on infections to others \u2013 at between 0.7 and 1. An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases. The range is slightly higher than that quoted by officials in recent weeks. When announcing plans to ease some lockdown restrictions on Sunday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said: We have the R below one, between 0.5 and 0.9 \u2013 but potentially only just below one. The slight increase, and narrowing in the range, is not linked to relaxations that have occurred this week as the estimate is based largely on hospital admissions and deaths data, which reflect the levels of transmission two to three weeks ago. A likely explanation is that as the overall levels of infection have fallen, hospital and care home settings are making a relatively bigger contribution to the overall estimate of R. Lockdown restrictions have less impact in these settings and there are still concerns about the levels of testing available in care homes. The figure suggests that, while the lockdown has been extremely effective at bringing down case numbers, R is still close to 1, meaning that it would not be possible to ease restrictions significantly without new measures to contain outbreaks, such as extensive testing and tracing. Pandemic lockdown measures in New York City have been extended until 13 June under an executive order signed by the state governor, Andrew Cuomo. Stay at home orders will be eased for the state\u2019s five least populated regions, however, allowing businesses there to get back to work gradually. New York will join the nearby states of New Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware in partially reopening beaches for the Memorial Day weekend, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, said on Friday. Reuters reports that Cuomo\u2019s announcement comes one day after the New Jersey governor, Phil Murphy, said he was opening the beaches for the traditional 23-25 May start of summer.

There were 242 new coronavirus fatalities in Italy on Friday, down by 20 from Thursday, bringing the total death toll to 31,610. New infections rose by 789, down by over 200 within the last 24 hours, according to the civil protection authority. Restaurants, bars, hairdressers and beauty salons are due to reopen on Monday as Italy gradually eases restrictions, while the ban on inter-regional travel might be lifted from 3 June. Italy has had 223,885 confirmed cases of Covid-19 to date, including 120,205 survivors. Ireland\u2019s \u2018phase one\u2019 of easing coronavirus lockdown will allow construction workers, gardeners and some retail businesses to get back to work on Monday. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Friday that farmers\u2019 markets could also open up as well as builders\u2019 merchants, tool suppliers for gardening, farming and agriculture. Opticians and shops selling hearing aids will open too as well as outlets selling IT, electrical and office goods, the Irish prime minister said. Varadkar urged anyone using public transport in Ireland to wear a facial covering. He said that the country may move to lift further restrictions within the next three weeks. Varadkar warned however that \u201cCovid-19 is an inferno that is raging around the world\u201d. While in Ireland it is a \u201cfire in retreat\u201d the Irish people will not defeat the virus until every spark and ember is quenched, the Taoiseach added. European countries could face a deadly second wave of coronavirus infections in the winter, the World Health Organization\u2019s top official in Europe has said. Dr Hans Kluge, director for the WHO European region, warned countries beginning to ease their lockdown restrictions that now is \u201ctime for preparation, not celebration\u201d. Dr Kluge told the Telegraph that countries should use the current period to build capacity in hospitals and strengthen public health systems. Dr Kluge said: Singapore and Japan understood early on that this is not a time for celebration, it\u2019s a time for preparation. That\u2019s what Scandinavian countries are doing \u2013 they don\u2019t exclude a second wave, but they hope it will be localised and they can jump on it quickly. He had also warned about the real risks of a second wave: I\u2019m very concerned about a double wave \u2013 in the fall, we could have a second wave of Covid and another one of seasonal flu or measles. Two years ago we had 500,000 children who didn\u2019t have their first shot of the measles vaccine. Turkish teenagers were allowed out for the first time in seven weeks on Friday ahead of a new four-day total lockdown across the country this weekend that will stretch into Tuesday\u2019s national holiday. People aged over 65 and under 20 have been under a 24-hour curfew as part of Turkey\u2019s efforts to combat one of the world\u2019s largest coronavirus outbreaks, numbering nearly 145,000 confirmed cases. Youths aged 15-20 were allowed out between 11am - 3pm, with Turkish media showing footage of teenagers playing football in parks, visiting malls and queuing up for takeaway ice cream and drinks from cafes. The elderly were allowed to leave the house for four hours last Sunday, and children under 14 on Wednesday, as Turkey tentatively seeks to ease lockdown restrictions. The government has said a \u201cnormalisation plan\u201d is dependent on any rise in new infections but is hoping many sectors can reopen after the Bayram (Eid al-Fitr) holiday ends on 26 May. Turkey\u2019s airspace is due to reopen 28 May with a handful of flights operated by the national carrier. Aid groups have warned of a looming humanitarian disaster after coronavirus was detected for the first time in the sprawling camps that host about one million Rohingya refugees, report Rebecca Ratcliffe and Redwan Ahmed. Brazil\u2019s health minister has resigned less than a month after being appointed and the morning after the country announced it had passed 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and recorded nearly 14,000 deaths. The sudden resignation of Nelson Teich, an oncologist and partner in a medical service consulting outfit, was announced in a curt WhatsApp message from the health ministry on Friday morning. Teich took over after Bolsonaro sacked his popular predecessor, Luiz Mandetta, on 16 April following disagreements over social isolation measures, which Mandetta supported and Bolsonaro opposes. Initially he appeared to follow Bolsonaro\u2019s line, arguing that Brazil\u2019s economy was as important as the lives the pandemic is increasingly claiming there. But in recent weeks Teich had increasingly disagreed with Bolsonaro on social isolation and the use of chloroquine, which he had described as an \u201cuncertainty\u201d. Bolsonaro said on Thursday he wanted to change protocols regulating its use that Mandetta had introduced. Teich was publicly embarrassed on Monday when he discovered during a press conference that the president had issued a decree that classified gyms, beauty salons and barbers as essential services. \u201cThis was not our role. It was the president\u2019s decision,\u201d he said, looking flummoxed. Brazil reported 844 new deaths in 24 hours on Thursday night, taking the total to 13,993 and it now has 202,918 cases, making it the world\u2019s sixth most impacted country, according to John Hopkins University figures. Tedros Adhanom, director general of the World Health Organization, has said vaccines and medicine will not end the Covid-19 pandemic if we can\u2019t ensure equitable distribution. Almost half the current Covid-19 hotspots in the US are linked to meat processing plants where poultry, pigs and cattle are slaughtered and packaged, which has led to the virus spiking in many small towns and prompted calls for urgent reforms to an industry beset by health and safety problems. At least 12 of the 25 hotspots in the US \u2013 counties with the highest per-capita infection rates \u2013 originated in meat factories where employees work side by side in cramped conditions, according to an analysis by the Guardian. In Nebraska, five counties have outbreaks linked to meat plants including Dakota county, where about one of every 14 residents has tested positive \u2013 the second-highest per capita infection rate in the US. As of Thursday, the Nebraska counties of Dakota, Hall, Dawson, Saline, and Colfax accounted for almost half the state\u2019s 9,075 positive cases, according to data tracking by the New York Times. Meat processing plants seem to have emerged as incubators for the coronavirus, which has spread rapidly among workers unable to perform physical distancing. Coronavirus cases in Canada have risen to 73,818 on Friday from 72,536 on Thursday. The country\u2019s public health agency has recorded a total of 5,499 deaths, up from 5,337. Brazil\u2019s health minister, Nelson Teich, handed in his resignation on Friday, his office said, after less than a month on the job as the country becomes a world hotspot for coronavirus, Reuters reports. Teich, who disagreed with the rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro, is expected to hold a press conference later on Friday. Brazil has now surpassed Germany and France and had more than 200,000 confirmed cases of the virus as of Thursday. Wisconsin\u2019s supreme court struck down the state\u2019s stay-at-home order on Wednesday, and some residents took immediate advantage \u2013 by packing the bars, reports Adam Gabbatt. Videos and reports from some areas of Wisconsin showed some bars filled with revellers, most of them not wearing masks. The slow fall in the numbers being infected by coronavirus in Iran has ended and now gone into reverse with the health ministry reporting official figures for new infections reaching their highest level for a month. The health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 2,102 new cases had been confirmed across the country in the past 24 hours, bringing the overall total to 116,635. The number of dead in the last 24 hours was 48, still relatively low in comparison with the pandemic\u2019s high point, bringing the total death toll to 6,902. The new infections figure is the highest Iran has announced for a single day since 6 April. The worrying aspect for the government is that there appears to be a steady week-long reversal in the trend in new infections, suggesting ministers may have lifted the lockdown prematurely. But the ministry said 80% of the new infections were mild, and the national press contained little criticism of the government. The health ministry will now be hoping the growth in infections can be limited to specific provinces in Iran, but with travel restrictions lifted the chances of containing the virus to small areas are slim. The south-western province of Khuzestan has been named as a problem area for a week, along with Tehran, but Jahanpour for the first time expressed concern about the trends in the provinces of Lorestan, Sistanb and Baluchistan and east Azerbaijan. Iran started relaxing its controls through April and schools are due to open in most provinces from 17 June. Teachers are due to be present in schools on Saturday, but pupils\u2019 attendance is not mandatory. Dormitories in universities are also being opened. A decision on the full opening of mosques is due next month. Iran does not publish official province-by-province figures, but has a colour-coding scheme designed to show the seriousness of the pandemic regionally. A keenly anticipated Covid-19 vaccine will be priced to allow as wide as possible access to it, if it proves successful, the Oxford University professor co-leading its development told Reuters. Adrian Hill, director of Oxford\u2019s Jenner Institute, which has teamed up with the drugmaker AstraZeneca to develop the vaccine, said ensuring wide distribution and low cost had been central to the project from the start. He said: This not going to be an expensive vaccine. It\u2019s going to be a single dose vaccine. It\u2019s going to be made for global supply and it\u2019s going to be made in many different locations. That was always our plan. The UK death toll has risen by 384 to 33,998 on Friday, the Department of Health and Social Care said. You can find out more on the UK-specific live blog on coronavirus. Single men and women in the Netherlands are being advised to organise a seksbuddy (sex buddy) after criticism of rules dictating that home visitors maintain a 1.5-metre distance from their hosts during the coronavirus lockdown. In a typically open-minded intervention, official guidance from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) has been amended to suggest those without a permanent sexual partner come to mutually satisfactory agreements with like-minded individuals. On the advice of scientists at the RIVM, the Netherlands has been on what the government describes as an \u201cintelligent lockdown\u201d since 23 March, allowing up to three visitors into homes on the strict condition that they keep their distance. But the RIVM now concedes that \u201cit makes sense that as a single [person] you also want to have physical contact\u201d while warning that the risks of such intimacy should be managed. \u201cDiscuss how best to do this together,\u201d the RIVM suggests. \u201cFor example, meet with the same person to have physical or sexual contact (for example, a cuddle buddy or \u2018sex buddy\u2019), provided you are free of illness. Make good arrangements with this person about how many other people you both see. The more people you see, the greater the chance of (spreading) the coronavirus.\u201d Austria has outlined plans to start allowing seated cultural events of up to 100 people in two weeks\u2019 time, ramping up to 1,000 people from 1 August, Reuters reports. Austria flattened its curve of infections with an early lockdown and has been loosening curbs for a month. Shops have reopened in phases and on Friday, restaurants, bars, cafes, churches and some museums followed suit, under strict social-distancing rules and with face masks required in many places. Theatres and cinemas, however, have remained closed and the conservative-led government has come under growing pressure from the cultural sector to allow events, to the point that the junior minister for culture resigned on Friday. \u201cWe will in a first step allow cultural events of up to 100 people both indoors and outdoors,\u201d the health minister, Rudolf Anschober, told a news conference. \u201cWe will in a second step do the same for artistic and cultural events of up to 250 people from 1 July. That is a big step, a very big step.\u201d Cinemas would also be allowed to open from 1 July, with the same capacity limit, he added. There will be a general requirement that people in an audience stay 1 metre apart. From August events of up to 500 people would be allowed, Anschober said, with the possibility of holding events of up to 1,000 people when a \u201cspecial security concept\u201d is prepared for the event in question. US stock market futures have fallen ahead of the opening bell on Wall Street today after worse than expected US retail sales and revived fears of a China-US trade war. The Czech Republic is to allow gatherings of up to 300 people later this month as its coronavirus infection rate remains among the lowest in Europe, AFP reports. Gatherings including sports events will be allowed from 25 May, when businesses including restaurants and pubs will also be allowed to open, the health minister, Adam Vojtech, said. Shopping centres, cinemas, barbers and restaurant terraces opened on Monday after nearly two months under lockdown. The country of 10.7 million people had registered 8,352 confirmed coronavirus cases and 293 deaths by Friday morning. \u201cIf the epidemiological situation remains favourable, the limit will grow to 500 people on 8 June and to 1,000 on 22 June,\u201d Vojtech said of the size of gatherings that would be permissible. He said restaurants and bars would not be allowed to stay open after 11pm after a recent upsurge of cases in South Korea was linked to nightclubs. Further easing would take place only if daily infection counts did not increase after staying well under 100 cases daily throughout May, said the epidemiologist Rastislav Madar, part of an official advisory team. Some credit the success in stemming infections to the mandatory face mask rule, which will be eased from 25 May, when they will only be required in shops, offices and on public transport. The Spanish government has hailed a large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus, but warned that any premature or irresponsible relaxation of restrictions could have \u201cenormous consequences\u201d given that only 5% of Spaniards have had the disease. The country\u2019s Socialist-led coalition government is under growing pressure from political opponents to end the two-month state of emergency that underpins one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe. On Friday, the health ministry was due to decide whether the Madrid region would be granted permission to follow other areas into the next stage of the de-escalation, which allows up to 10 people to meet and permits the reopening of cafe and restaurant terraces at 50% capacity. Pedro Duque, the former astronaut who serves as Spain\u2019s science minister, told the Guardian that the preliminary results of a nationwide serological study published earlier this week would be crucial to the government\u2019s response. The study, which involved more than 60,000 people, revealed that around 5% of the population \u2013 about 2 million people \u2013 had had the coronavirus. It also showed that 33% of those who had caught the virus had not shown any symptoms. \u201cWe think that the seroprevalence test we\u2019ve carried out is the best that\u2019s been done anywhere in the world so far. The most important conclusion we\u2019ve reached is that it is vital to keep acting very prudently when it comes to this illness \u2013 there are still a lot of people who haven\u2019t been exposed to the virus,\u201d he said. Duque said the pronounced geographical variations underscored the need for a region-by-region loosening of restrictions: while Murcia, Melilla, Asturias and the Canary islands showed an infection rate of less than 2%, the proportion rose to more than 10% in the regions of Madrid and Castilla-La Mancha. \u201cRight now, the only way to act is by making small changes when it comes to relaxing the conditions, by maintaining the distances between people, and by keeping up with the infection precautions,\u201d he added. \u201cThe consequences of acting irresponsibly could be enormous given that we know that only 5% of the population has some degree of immunity against the virus. That means that 95% don\u2019t.\u201d Duque also dismissed talk of so-called \u201cimmunity passports\u201d to allow more freedom of movement to those who had recovered from the disease. The science, he said, simply did not support such a move. \u201cFrom a personal scientific point of view, all I can say is that we don\u2019t even know for sure that immunity exists, so we\u2019re very far from all of that. We don\u2019t have scientific information that guarantees that people with the antibodies are immune to future infections. So we\u2019re very far from being able to take legal responsibility for that.\u201d Travellers arriving to Germany from the European Union and the Schengen passport-free zone will no longer have to go into quarantine for two weeks as has been the case since March, according to the interior ministry. The new measure is on condition that the country the visitor has travelled from does not have a high number of coronavirus infections. Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Britain are also included. But as soon as the virus rate in those states rises, the quarantine rule will be immediately reintroduced, the ministry spokesman said. The two-week quarantine still applies to arrivals from all other countries. Germany\u2019s public health advisory body, the Robert Koch Institute, has said it will monitor other countries even more closely than it has been doing, in order to be aware of danger areas. Details on the precise implementation of the rules is to follow, but the western state of North Rhine Westphalia already applied them on the stroke of midnight on Friday. Germans are closely watching the gradual easing of travel restrictions wanting to know to what extent they can hope to go on a foreign holiday this year. From May, 25 flights between Germany and Greece will resume. But officially the advice remains that Germans should not travel anywhere abroad, until at least 14 June. On Monday Heiko Maas, the foreign minister, will hold a video conference with his counterparts from European countries where Germans typically go on holiday, including Spain, Italy, Austria, Greece, Croatia, Portugal, Malta, Slovenia, Cyprus and Bulgaria. The aim is to facilitate a coordinated reopening of borders including mutual agreements on being able to swiftly close them again in case of a rise in cases. On Wednesday, the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, announced that an opening of the borders with France, Switzerland and Austria was on the cards from 15 June. On Wednesday, border traffic between Germany and Luxembourg is due to normalise again. Discussions with Denmark are still ongoing. Denmark has reported zero coronavirus-related deaths in the last 24 hours for the first time since 13 March, Reuters reports. More than 100 Mexicans have died from drinking adulterated alcohol over the past month in a string of mass poisonings which followed a ban on the sale of liquor during the Covid-19 pandemic. Deaths from unsafe alcohol have been reported in at least four states. On Thursday, health officials in the central state of Puebla said the death toll there had reached 51 after a batch of moonshine was tainted with methanol \u2013 a wood alcohol that can cause blindness and kidney damage. The deaths in Puebla occurred in several municipalities across the rugged Sierra Madre Oriental mountains, a region where \u201cmoonshining is kind of a sport\u201d, said Rodolfo Soriano-N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a sociologist who has worked in the region. At least 17 people died in the corn-farming village of Chiconcuautla after consuming cheap home-brewed liquor on Mother\u2019s Day, according to the municipal government and a local official. The drink \u2013 known as refino, made from sugarcane \u2013 is thought to have originated in the neighbouring community of Zacatl\u00e1n, which is famed for its cider. No arrests have been made. Impressions conveyed abroad that Sweden has adopted a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d approach to the coronavirus are wrong, its prime minister said on Friday, Reuters reports. Sweden has not declared a full lockdown, in sharp contrast to many of its European neighbouring countries, instead adopting a mix of legislation and recommendations in response to the virus. Some foreign newspapers and broadcasters have widely labelled a relatively soft policy. Stefan Lofven said he rejected that narrative: \u201cThe image that Sweden is doing so totally different than other countries, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d The Swedish model for managing society was built on trust between citizens, who had \u201ca responsibility to do the right thing\u201d, and lawmakers and other authorities, he told a briefing with foreign media. \u201cLife is not carrying on as normal in Sweden. It is not business as usual.\u201d Current guidelines have banned large gatherings, while high schools and universities are closed. The government has recommend social distancing, protecting the elderly, working from home and staying at home if unwell. Elementary schools however remain open, people have not been obliged to stay indoors and can meet in small groups, and stores have not been forced to close. Sweden has registered more than 3,500 coronavirus-linked deaths \u2013 a toll far lower than many large EU countries but around five times higher than Denmark and more than 10 times that of its other Nordic neighbours. The Robert Koch Institute, Germany\u2019s leading public health body monitoring and advising how to tackle the coronavirus, has said it is revising its \u201cR\u201d evaluation, or reproduction rate, which is the number of people an individual infected with coronavirus infects, after much confusion. It will now release a weekly R value instead, which takes into account all the dips and rises in registered cases in a week and most importantly takes into account the regional differences. The new R value is being referred to as the gegl\u00e4tterte or \u201csmoothed\u201d R. Germany\u2019s current seven-day R value is 0.88 \u2013 every infected person is infecting less than one further person. Under the old system, Tuesday\u2019s value would have been 0.75. Slovenia opened its borders on Friday after declaring an end to its coronavirus epidemic, AFP reports, despite new infections. The government opened borders for all EU citizens, while non-EU citizens will have to stay in quarantine. People coming from Slovenia will still have to undergo a two-week home quarantine in Austria, however, according to the Austrian interior ministry. \u201cToday Slovenia has the best epidemic situation in Europe, which enables us to call off the general epidemic,\u201d the prime minister, Janez Jansa, said. He added \u201csome general and special measures will remain in force\u201d in Slovenia to prevent a resurgence in virus cases. Georgia will cancel the state of emergency it declared over the coronavirus after 22 May, the prime minister, Giorgi Gakharia, said on Friday according to a report by Reuters citing the Tass news agency. Restaurants in Berlin are allowed to reopen this evening for the first time in two months, and with the weather forecast looking good, it is predicted that they will be very full. Here is a breakdown of the rules governing the new normal here in the world of gastronomy. People from two separate households will be allowed to share a table, but must keep a distance of 1.5 metres from each other. Whether there is a maximum number of people allowed for each household has not been specified. For those from a single household the distancing rules do not apply. Waiting staff are required to wear face coverings. Cooks, and other kitchen staff who do not come into contact with diners, are not. Diners are not required to wear masks, although it is recommended they do so. It\u2019s unclear how that is compatible with eating and drinking, as repeatedly taking off and putting on the masks is not recommended by hygiene experts. While guests are not obliged to make reservations, Berlin\u2019s senate has strongly advised restaurants to take down contact details of their guests, and to keep them for four weeks, in order to enable tracing in case of an infection. The likelihood is that restaurateurs will soon be allowed to put chairs and tables in front of their establishments without having to gain the necessary permit \u2013 on condition that the pavement is wide enough. In the district of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, officials have announced a plan to allow restaurants to effectively take over entire streets so that they can maximise the number of tables they can serve, and to ensure pavements do not become crowded. If restaurants submit applications specific to the streets they would like to occupy, officials will move to close the roads to traffic on Fridays and at weekends, between 11am and 10pm. Some concerns have been expressed that that arrangement may put the safety of diners under threat \u2013 with some sceptics making reference to the Berlin Christmas market attack of 2016 when an Islamist terrorist drove a lorry into the crowd, killing 12. I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin, taking over the liveblog from my colleague Matt. If you want to get in touch, you can email me (aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com) or reach me on Twitter (@aamnamohdin). Here\u2019s a roundup of the key developments so far on Friday: China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus on Friday, all local cross-infections in the north-eastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April. Virus pushes Germany into recession German output shrank by 2.2% in the first quarter of 2020, according to new official data. The quarter-on-quarter contraction is \u201cthe worst since the financial crisis\u201d in 2009, the federal statistics office Destatis said. The agency also revised its gross domestic product (GDP) figure for the final quarter of 2019 from zero growth to a contraction of 0.1%, meaning Germany has now experienced two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 the technical definition of a recession. Slovenia proclaims end to the outbreak Slovenia has become the first European country to proclaim an end to the coronavirus epidemic at home. It said on Friday that the spread of Covid-19 was under control and there was no longer a need for extraordinary health measures. Spain announces lowest daily death toll since Monday Spain\u2019s death toll from coronavirus registered its lowest increase since Monday with 138 new fatalities announced by the health ministry. The overall coronavirus death toll, in Europe\u2019s fourth worst hit country, rose to 27,459 on Friday, while the number of diagnosed cases rose to 230,183 cases from 229,540. Italy and Germany to ease more restrictions Italy is set to allow free travel across the country from 3 June, according to a draft decree seen by Reuters. The draft, which could still be modified before it is approved, also said all travel within separate Italian regions would be allowed from 18 May. Germany will loosen quarantine rules for travellers arriving from the European Union and the UK, according to the interior ministry. China responds diplomatically to Trump threat of cutting off ties China\u2019s foreign ministry has responded diplomatically to Donald Trump\u2019s threat of cutting ties with Beijing over the virus. The US president said the pandemic had cast a pall over his January trade deal with Beijing and that he had no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment. China\u2019s foreign ministry said on Friday that steady Sino-US bilateral relations served the interests of both countries. Baltic states restore free movement The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have opened their borders to each other to create a mini-Schengen area. Free movement of people will be restored to all 6 million permanent residents of the Baltic states, but arrivals from outside the three countries will have to undergo a two-week quarantine period. Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally. Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000 The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday. The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in the last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. 844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993. South Korea, China and Japan\u2019s health ministers to hold video conference The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will get together by video conference on Friday to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the east Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. Covid-19 reaches refugee camps in Bangladesh Aid groups have warned of a looming humanitarian disaster after coronavirus was detected for the first time in the sprawling camps that host about 1 million Rohingya refugees. The UN confirmed that an ethnic Rohingya refugee and another person had tested positive for Covid-19. \u201cBoth patients are in isolation and contact tracing is under way,\u201d the UN\u2019s refugee agency said in a statement. Germany will loosen coronavirus quarantine rules for travellers arriving from the European Union, the Schengen passport-free zone and Britain, Reuters reports, citing a spokesman for the interior ministry. Authorities will only recommend travellers go into quarantine if they arrive from countries with elevated numbers of infections, he said at a regular news conference. A mandatory two-week quarantine still applies for travellers from countries outside the EU, the spokesman said Children in Finland have been returning to school after eight weeks of lockdown, AFP reports. They will return for just two weeks before the summer holidays begin. The French health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, has said he has been assured France will benefit from a coronavirus vaccine \u201cif there is one\u201d. The comment came after Paul Hudson, the British CEO of the French-based pharmaceutical giant Sanofi, said it was working with the Americans to develop a Covid-19 vaccine and the US would be given priority. Hudson\u2019s remarks caused outrage in France, where Sanofi has received research tax credits. V\u00e9ran said he had been reassured this would not be the case. \u201cI believe it was a phrase, as far as I can understand, that was slightly clumsy and perhaps taken out of context. I was quite reassured by the conversation I had with Sanofi,\u201d V\u00e9ran told French television. Two new studies have reportedly shown that hydroxychloroquine is not particularly effective against Covid-19 despite the claims of the charismatic Marseille epidemiologist Didier Raoult. New studies \u2013 one French and one Chinese \u2013 found the anti-malarial drug, whose use has been promoted by Donald Trump among others, did not significantly reduce the risk of the disease worsening or killing a patient, nor did it eliminate the virus any quicker than standard treatments. France is to quarantine arrivals from neighbouring Spain. This is a \u201creciprocal\u201d measure after Spain imposed 14 days\u2019 quarantine for anyone arriving from the EU/Schengen area. The French border is currently closed to any visitors other than essential travellers who have a \u201ccompelling\u201d professional or personal reason to enter the country and are carrying a sworn declaration to that effect. June 15 has been set for a possible reopening of French borders to European visitors. Deaths on French roads dropped by just under 56% during April compared with the same month last year. This is hardly surprising as everyone was locked down, but police records suggested those who were on the empty roads drove faster. The drop in road deaths explains why some departements saw fewer deaths even during the coronavirus crisis. Italy is set to allow free travel across the country from 3 June, according to a draft decree seen by Reuters, as the government moves to unwind the coronavirus lockdown and revive the battered economy. Rigid restrictions were imposed on Italy in March in an effort to halt the disease and, with the death rate now falling, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is rolling back the curbs. The draft decree, which could still be modified before it is approved, also said all travel within separate Italian regions would be allowed from 18 May. The phased reopening of America\u2019s national parks has raised concerns about exacerbating the spread of Covid-19 and endangering the residents of rural towns located near parks. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the parks to become super-spreaders,\u201d said Timothy Whitehouse, executive director of the non-profit Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. \u201cThese communities simply do not have the capacity or the medical infrastructure to deal with an outbreak.\u201d Spain\u2019s death toll from coronavirus registered its lowest increase since Monday with 138 new fatalities announced by the health ministry, Reuters reports. The overall coronavirus death toll, in Europe\u2019s fourth worst hit country, rose to 27,459 on Friday, while the number of diagnosed cases rose to 230,183 cases from 229,540 on Thursday, the ministry said. The UK, Italy and France have all announced more coronavirus deaths than Spain. Slovenia has become the first European country to proclaim an end to the coronavirus epidemic at home, AP reports. It said on Friday that the spread of Covid-19 was under control and there was no longer a need for extraordinary health measures. The government says EU residents are free to cross into Slovenia from Austria, Italy and Hungary at predetermined checkpoints, while most non-EU nationals will have to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine. The first coronavirus case in Slovenia was recorded on 4 March, in someone returning from neighbouring Italy. By 13 May, there were 1,467 confirmed cases and 103 deaths in Slovenia. Update: Shaun Walker adds: An easing of restrictions began on 20 April when some shops reopened, while restaurants and bars are now allowed to serve customers on their outdoor terraces. Public transport is slowly resuming and some schools will open on Monday. Citizens are still advised to stick to social distancing and other virus prevention measures, but visitors arriving from EU countries who show no symptoms will no longer be required to quarantine. Russia has announced more than 10,000 new coronavirus infections on Friday, bringing the country\u2019s total to 262,843, the second-highest in the world after the United States. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, this week announced that a nationwide lockdown aimed at slowing the spread of the virus would be eased, even as health officials record a steady increase in new cases. The country reported 113 new coronavirus deaths on Friday, bringing Russia\u2019s total to 2,418. On Thursday, Russian officials defended the country against claims that its unusually low mortality rate from Covid-19 was suspicious, saying its method of ascribing cause of death was \u201cexceptionally precise\u201d. German output shrank by 2.2% in the first quarter of 2020, official data showed on Friday, as the coronavirus pandemic tipped Europe\u2019s top economy into a recession, AFP reports. The quarter-on-quarter contraction is \u201cthe worst since the financial crisis\u201d in 2009, the federal statistics office Destatis said. The agency also revised its gross domestic product (GDP) figure for the final quarter of 2019 from zero growth to a contraction of 0.1%, meaning Germany has now experienced two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 the technical definition of a recession. The German economy minister, Peter Altmaier, last month warned that the country was facing \u201cthe worst recession\u201d in its postwar history as the pandemic battered the global economy. Most New Zealanders have embraced the easing restrictions with the first stop for many being the local hairdresser. In Auckland, the barber Tomi Cvetanovski said he saw his fair share of unkempt hair coming through his doors. He opened up at one minute past midnight on Thursday with a line outside and he did not close until 4.30am. Then he reopened at 6am and kept going until 7pm. Oh man, it\u2019s crazy, but I like it when it\u2019s like this. It was a big day, but everyone needs a haircut. For over a week Belgians have been allowed to pick just four friends or family who they may host at their home as part of a tentative easing of the lockdown. But a study from the University of Antwerp has revealed that social embarrassment is holding many back from breaking their lockdown bubbles. The study showed that nearly half (43%) of the 83,000 people who participated in the study had not taken advantage of relaxation and 41% said the \u201crule of four\u201d forcing them to choose among their friends had made them tense. Koen Pepermans, faculty director of social sciences at Antwerp University, said: The confusion and choice stress that this measure brought with it could have led to people being reluctant. I also noticed in my circle that it was a difficult choice. Not making a choice at all was perhaps the best choice that almost half of the participants chose. There is also a lack of trust with 85% of participants admitting that they did not think their friends would stick to the social distancing rules. \u201cThe younger the participant, the more pessimistic they are towards the other,\u201d Pepermans said. The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have opened their borders to each other from Friday to create a mini Schengen area, Latvia\u2019s broadcaster LSM.LV reports. Free movement of people will be restored to all 6 million permanent residents of the Baltic states, but arrivals from outside the three countries will have to undergo a two-week quarantine period. The Latvian president, Egils Levits, said: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have created a small Schengen area in Europe \u2013 an area without internal borders. From today, all of us, the 6 million of the Baltics, are free to cross the borders between our countries, subject to epidemiological rules. This is especially important for Latvia because Lithuania and Estonia are our largest economic partners. Life-sized cardboard cutouts of football fans are being used to try to provide atmosphere at empty stadiums in Germany as the suspended Bundesliga gets ready to resume. Thousands of Borussia Moenchengladbach fans have ordered \u20ac18 cutouts of themselves for their first home fixture at Borussia Park next week, Reuters reports. Belgian Trappist monks who brew one of the world\u2019s most coveted beers have reopened for business after a two-month break, though Covid-19 restrictions mean they can only supply local rather than international demand, Reuters reports. The Saint-Sixtus abbey, home to 19 monks, launched an online sale on Thursday evening of 6,000 crates, with pick-ups starting on Friday. Exceptionally, customers can buy three crates. Normally it is just two. Customers can come as usual by car, but are told not to leave their vehicles while queuing until they pass a newly installed traffic light before the pick-up point. There, a lay worker in mask and gloves passes their 24-bottle crates through a small gap in a plastic screen. Payment must made electronically, not with cash. The nearby cafe serving the beers remains closed. Demand is no issue. Brother Godfried said 5,000 new online accounts were created from Wednesday to Thursday, bringing the total to 35,000. \u201cThe picture is a bit distorted as for now we can only offer on the Belgian market. The borders are shut, even though the beer draws a certain international interest,\u201d he told Reuters. The monks sold a few cases in advance to test their new system. Thomas Vuylsteke, a 33-year-old lawyer, was one of the lucky recipients. \u201cIt has been selected a few times as the best beer in the world and it is really tasty. It\u2019s always great,\u201d he said. Afghanistan has recorded its worst day of the crisis so far, as the country\u2019s health ministry confirmed 414 new transmissions of Covid-19 and 17 more deaths. Afghanistan has so far confirmed 6,053 cases, 153 deaths and 745 recoveries. In a WhatsApp message to reporters, Wahid Majroh, the country\u2019s deputy health minister, said 1,122 suspected patients had been tested in the last 24 hours after the ministry pledged to increase the number of tests. The capital, Kabul, and the western province of Herat recorded most of the new infections. Kabul is the country\u2019s worst affected area with 1,793 cases. Despite a government authorised lockdown in several provinces, the streets are still crowded, raising fears among experts of a surge in the number of death and infections. China\u2019s foreign ministry has responded diplomatically to Donald Trump\u2019s threat of cutting ties with Beijing over the virus. The US president said the pandemic had cast a pall over his January trade deal with Beijing and that he had no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment. Asked what measures he intended to take against China, he said: \u201cThere are many things we could do \u2026 We could cut off the whole relationship.\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry said on Friday that steady Sino-US bilateral relations served the interests of both countries. But its foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, told reporters during a daily briefing that the US needed to cooperate with China in order to achieve stable relations. The environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg has challenged \u201cthe myth\u201d that children are not affected by the virus and can\u2019t spread it. Speaking to CNN, the 17-year-old activist urged children to stick to physical distancing rules. She said: It\u2019s sort of a myth right now that children are not being being affected by this virus. And that is very wrong. Children both do get this disease and they also spread it on to others. So we need to be very careful that this misinformation, that it doesn\u2019t affect children, becomes mainstream. We need to make sure that people understand that this affects children. Thunberg went into isolation in March after displaying mild symptoms of coronavirus. She said: Many people don\u2019t even notice that they have symptoms and then they might spread the virus without even knowing it. We young people have a very big responsibility because we we might not experience the symptoms as as bad as many others. So we have to be extra careful, because our actions can be the difference between life and death for many others. She also expressed hope that the crisis would mean that politicians and the public now followed the warnings of scientists. She said: More people are starting to realise that we are actually depending on science, and that we need to listen to scientists and experts. I really hope that stays for other crises, such as the climate crisis and the environmental crisis, that we understand that we have to listen to the scientists. Nearly a quarter of a billion people across 47 African countries will catch coronavirus over the next year, but the result will be fewer severe cases and deaths than in the US and Europe, new research predicts. A model by the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) regional office for Africa, published in the BMJ Global Health, predicts a lower rate of transmission and viral spread across the continent than elsewhere, resulting in up to 190,000 deaths. But the authors warn the associated rise in hospital admissions, care needs and \u201chuge impact\u201d on services such as immunisation and maternity, will overwhelm already stretched health services. About one in four (22%) of the one billion people in the countries measured would be infected in the first year of the pandemic, the model suggests. However the disease is likely to linger for longer \u2013 possibly for several years. Aid groups have warned of a looming humanitarian disaster after coronavirus was detected for the first time in the sprawling camps that host about one million Rohingya refugees. The camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, which are more densely populated than some of the world\u2019s busiest cities, have been under lockdown since 14 March, in an attempt to stop the virus from spreading. On Thursday, the UN confirmed that an ethnic Rohingya refugee and another person had tested positive for Covid-19. \u201cBoth patients are in isolation and contact tracing is underway,\u201d the UN\u2019s refugee agency said in a statement. Like many children across the world sent home from school, youngsters in Turkey were encouraged to draw pictures of rainbows and place them in windows to cheer up the country in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. Orders to teachers from some local education boards to stop because the rainbows were part of a \u201cplot\u201d to turn children gay were met with surprise. Instead of boosting morale, the lockdown rainbows have become yet another symbol of division, the latest cultural battleground in a country highly polarised along political and religious lines. \u201cUnfortunately this sort of anti-LGBTQ mentality is widespread amongst policy makers even if ordinary people don\u2019t see a connection between children\u2019s drawings and gay rights,\u201d said Meral G\u00fclsen, a representative for teachers union E\u011fitim Sen. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. I only wish I knew when that would be it for my neighbour\u2019s music speaker, too. Thanks, as always, for following along. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Global death toll passes 302,000. The global toll from Covid-19 has passed 300,000, with nearly 4.5 million people infected. According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 302,452 people have now died as a result of the outbreak. The institution says it has counted 4,443,597 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures. China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced. China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus on Friday, all local cross-infections in the northeastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April. Trump threatens to cut China ties. US President Donald Trump signalled a further deterioration of his relationship with China over coronavirus, saying he has no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment and going so far as to suggest he could cut ties with the world\u2019s second largest economy. Chinese state media has responded saying his comments are \u201clunacy\u201d. Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself. Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but without wearing a mask himself. Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work. Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases. Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally. Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000. The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday.The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. 844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993. South Korea, China and Japan health ministers to hold video conference. The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will get together by video conference on Friday to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the novel coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the East Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus. Doctors in northern Italy, one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation. Covid-19 reaches refugee camps in Bangladesh. A Rohingya man has become the first person to test positive for Covid-19 in the vast refugee camps in Bangladesh that is home to almost one million people. Local health coordinator Abu Toha Bhuiyan initially said two refugees had been put into isolation. The World Health Organization later said one case was of a Rohingya man, and the other was of a local man who lived near the camp and was being treated at a clinic inside the area. 36 million Americans are now unemployed. Another 3 million Americans filed for benefits, bringing the country\u2019s total unemployed to 36 million. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Global report: Trump threat to cut trade ties over Covid-19 branded \u2018lunacy\u2019 by Chinese media An escalation of rhetoric between Donald Trump and China over the coronavirus pandemic has sparked concerns that a trade deal between the nations is in peril, as Chinese state media dismissed as \u201clunacy\u201d a suggestion by the US president that he could \u201ccut off relations with Beijing. The US president said he was very disappointed with China\u2019s failure to contain Covid-19 in an interview with Fox Business news. Trump said the pandemic had cast a pall over his January trade deal with Beijing and that he had no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment. Asked what measures he intended to take against China, he said: \u201cThere are many things we could do \u2026 We could cut off the whole relationship.\u201d \u201cNow, if you did, what would happen? You\u2019d save $500bn,\u201d Trump said, referring to estimated US annual imports from China, which he has previously referred to as lost money. The state-backed Global Times responded with an editorial titled \u201cTrump turns up election strategy nonsense with China \u2018cut-off\u2019 threat\u201d. \u201cThe very idea should not come as a surprise for those who remember when Trump speculated if disinfectants could be used on humans \u2018by injection\u2019 to wipe out the novel coronavirus [Covid-19],\u201d it said. \u201cSuch lunacy is a clear byproduct, first and foremost, of the proverbial anxiety that the US has suffered from since China began its global ascension,\u201d it said on Friday. \u201cTrump seems insane right now or may have some psychological problems,\u201d another editorial wrote. The escalating row between the two countries came as China marked one month with no deaths from Covid-19 and just four newly confirmed cases in the 24 hours to Friday. What coronavirus is doing to stressed US health workers \u2013 and why it will be felt for years Jenn Caldwell is a hospital nurse in Kansas City, Missouri. By her estimate, she has cared for nearly three dozen Covid-19 patients since the pandemic began, and her close friend, a fellow nurse, has died from the virus. When she developed an upset stomach consistent with Covid-19 she lost her composure. She curled up in a ball, cried and hyperventilated. Later, Caldwell wrote down all her financial account information, put it in her lockbox and texted her 20-year-old daughter the code. \u201cIt\u2019s so random who is getting Covid and dying. There was a definite panic, a definite freak-out,\u201d Caldwell said, a member of the union National Nurses United. \u201cIt heightens my anxiety and paranoia \u2026 I didn\u2019t feel like I had any before.\u201d The the airlines Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon saw their passenger loads plummet by 62.3% to 21.7% in April, Reuters reports. Cathay Pacific &amp; Cathay Dragon carried a total of 13,729 passengers, a decrease of 99.6% compared to April 2019. In April, the two airlines carried 84,634 tonnes of cargo and mail, a decrease of 48.3% compared to April 2019. The airlines expect that average daily passenger numbers will remain at around 500 in May. In a report, the airlines said it is \u201cwidely expected that international travel demand will only return to pre covid-19 levels in a few years.\u201d But, it added, \u201cAt this stage, we still see no immediate signs of improvement\u201d. This Australian snake doesn\u2019t seem to have heard that there are now more reasons to leave the house: Australia is easing restrictions: Global death toll passes 302,000.

A vaccine for coronavirus must be available to all countries, the EU has insisted, after the British chief executive of French drugs company Sanofi said it was reserving the first shipments of its vaccine for the US. \u201cThe vaccine against Covid-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal,\u201d said the European commission spokesman, Stefan de Keersmaecker. 36 million Americans are now unemployed as another 3 million filed for benefits. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The European commission has suspended the delivery of 10 million face masks from China after two countries complained about the poor quality of the batches they received, the Associated Press reports. As part of its efforts to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, this month the commission started dispatching the masks to healthcare workers in its 27 member states and the UK. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will get together by video conference on Friday to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the novel coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the East Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. \u201cThe ministers will exchange views on the latest Covid-19 situation and related policy of each country,\u201d South Korea\u2019s Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told a briefing, referring to the disease caused by the new coronavirus. \u201cWe\u2019re planning to introduce our work on information sharing, special entry procedures and large-scale treatment facilities.\u201d All three countries are optimistic they have got their outbreaks under control and are looking to get their economics back on track while keeping a wary eye out for any second waves of infection. China\u2019s Wuhan is seeking to test all of its 11 million residents for the coronavirus after a small cluster of new cases stoked fears after a long lockdown was lifted. Japan lifted a state of emergency in large swaths of the country on Thursday but major cities remain under restrictions and new testing indicated the outbreak in Tokyo was wider than the figures showed. South Korea, which suffered the first major outbreak outside China, has been held up as a coronavirus mitigation success story, bringing its daily rate of cases down to near zero without major disruptions, thanks to intensive testing and contact tracing. But a recent spike in infections linked to nightclubs and bars in some Seoul nightlife districts has led to the re-closing of some night spots and the postponement of the opening of schools by a week. Uki Go\u00f1i reports for the Guardian: Coronavirus statistics have started rising sharply in Argentina in line with government predictions that mid-May could see a spike in cases. Thursday saw a record 24 deaths and 255 new cases, after Wednesday\u2019s record 317 new cases, bringing the total so far to 353 deaths and 7134 cases. The numbers are being pushed up by a sudden rise in the capital city of Buenos Aires, with 60% of reported new cases Thursday, most of them in the city\u2019s large \u201cvillas\u201d, or shanty towns, home to some 400 thousand of the city\u2019s three million inhabitants. The city\u2019s surrounding Greater Buenos Aires Area, home to another seven million people, was responsible for 30% of the day\u2019s new cases, with the rest of Argentina, total population 44 million, reporting only 10% of the day\u2019s toll. The national duplication rate of cases showed a worrying fall in recent days, from 25 days just one week ago, to only 17 days Thursday. The duplication rate in the city of Buenos Aires is well below the national average, at only 10 days Thursday. As Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison mentioned in that press conference earlier, suicides in three Australian states, Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania, have not increased during the lockdown. Christine Morgan, CEO of the National Mental Health Commission and National Suicide Prevention Adviser to Morrison, was asked at the national press conference what she made of Japan\u2019s decline in suicides in April, reported on Thursday. In response she asked: Is there a protective component in what we are finding (in the lockdown)? Which has been so challenging for so many. But maybe there\u2019s a silver lining. We have stopped. We have connected. We have been at home. We are in communication with people. We don\u2019t know the answer, but that\u2019s really important. \u201c Helen Sullivan with you here. A short while ago I took a lunchtime stroll around my neighbourhood, which happens to be Bondi, in Sydney, Australia. The New South Wales state regulations were eased today, which means people can dine in at bars, restaurants and cafes \u2013 something in no short supply in the neighbourhoods surrounding one of the world\u2019s most famous beaches. Small restaurants and cafes are allowed 10 patrons at a time. Blog readers, it was a sight for sore eyes: a family of four walking around a little uncertainly, like they had perhaps been really strict about social distancing, looking for \u2013 it seemed \u2013 a cafe to go to. Dad patted his back pocket to make sure his wallet was there, and they crossed the road with purpose. My local repainted its walls for the occasion of the eased restrictions, and was looking pretty schmick: A nearby bagel shop had both its outside tables \u2013 it usually has about seven or so \u2013 occupied and a lunchtime queue was forming. Next door, a barber shop, which had closed completely on 28 March, was doing a roaring trade. All barbers and customers wore masks, and in the window was a laminated poster showing that the business had completed Covid-19 training. A customer left, and one of the barbers sprayed what I assume was disinfectant to an empty chair and wiped it down vigorously. There was a very faint drizzle in the air \u2013 winter is arriving in Sydney \u2013 but the sun was shining. Mate, it was pretty good. That press conference has now ended. I spoke too soon. Back to that press conference for a moment, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is talking about the country\u2019s relationship with China now and he\u2019s getting a bit worked up: When it comes to our relationship with China, it is built on mutual benefit. And we have a comprehensive strategic partnership which we\u2019ve formed. And within that partnership, there are issues that need to be addressed from time to time, and the issues around beef and barley are those matters. And they have been, particularly on the barley issue, been running for some time. He is speaking after China imposed a ban on beef supplied by four Australian abattoirs and Beijing proposed imposing crippling tariffs on barley imports. I\u2019d stress again that what the Australian Government is doing is completely unremarkable. We are standing our ground on our values and the things that we know are always important. ... One of the most important things about our approach to relationship is we\u2019re always consistent. We\u2019re always consistent. We draw very clear lines about things that are very important to us, as does the Chinese government. And we respect their lines, as we expect our lines to be respected, whether it\u2019s on our foreign investment rules, or our rules around technology, our rules regarding human rights and things of that nature. I don\u2019t think anyAustralian would want us to compromise on those important things. And those things are not to be traded. Ever. Now, our Government is very clear about these things, and we will always continue to be clear. And these are not things to be traded. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Trump and jobs: Reporter: What\u2019s your response toPresident Trump announcing that he\u2019s \u201cchanging all the policies\u201d? Morrison: We\u2019ll see what occurs there as it rolls out. But we have our contracts and arrangements in place for all of those matters, so we\u2019ll continue to pursue them in the normal way. Reporter: The \u201cAmerica First\u201d slogan, is that something that Australia should perhaps adopt and prioritise Australian jobs? Morrison: Australia will always prioritise Australian jobs, and we always have. And one of the ways we\u2019ve always done that is we\u2019ve always had an outward look when it comes to our economic opportunities. Australia is one of the most successful trading nations on earth, and our economic prosperity lies not just here, but continuing to be an open trading nation. This is how we\u2019ve always succeeded in the past.And Australia will continue to look to its prosperity both here at home and overseas to ensure that we can prioritise Australian jobs. As Australia adopts its National Mental Health and Wellbeing Pandemic Response Plan, Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt says: We\u2019ve already had some information from Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania that is heartening, and more heartening than we\u2019d expected. For the first four months, there has been no known increase in suicide rates in those three states. We watch very carefully, however, because these things can build up. They can brew. People can dwell. And so we want to get ahead of the curve.\u201d Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison says just 1% of the country\u2019s aged care facilities were affected by Coronavirus: There are two areas that National Cabinet was most concerned at the start of this crisis more than any. One was, of course, our elderly, and the fact that only 1%, or thereabouts, of the aged care facilities in this country have been affected by Covid is a tremendous credit to the aged care sector. But the other has been the low level of infection that has occurred in Indigenous communities around Australia. And to ourIndigenous leaders in each and everyone of those hundreds of communities, thank you for your leadership. Thank you for keeping your communities, our people, together, safe. Brendan Murphy, the country\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, is speaking now. There are just 50 Covid-19 patients in hospitals across Australia, with 12 of those people on ventilators, he says. My general epidemiology update, with 7,017 cases at the moment. Around about 20 new cases a day over recent days. Still a small number of community-acquired cases in some jurisdictions. Just a reminder this virus is still there, at very low levels in the community, and I reiterate the Prime Minister\u2019s message - as people start to go back to some normal activities and open up, please, please be careful. Please practise all of those new ways of interacting that we\u2019ve talked about on so many occasions. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison says: As businesses and cafes and others are opened up this weekend, those businesses, knowing that at just 10patrons at a time, that won\u2019t necessarily be a profitable patronage for them to really sustain that, they\u2019re backing themselves, they\u2019re backing their staff, they\u2019re backing their communities, and they\u2019re backing their country. And I want to commend them for that brave step that they\u2019re taking this weekend. Good on ya for reopening. Morrison announces decisions made by the national Cabinet: Elective surgeries can resume The National Mental Health and Wellbeing Pandemic Response Plan was adopted. An additional AI$48.1 million was committed for the implementation of that plan. Human biosecurity emergency powers have also been extended under the Biosecurity Act, from June 17 to September 17. Australia\u2019s Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, is speaking to the media now. Morrison begins with the usual preamble about the difficulties we all face. Says state leaders have met more in the past two months than the previous 10 years. But with restrictions easing following the release of the government\u2019s roadmap last week, Morrison says now \u201cthe task is to really build that confidence and to get that momentum going, as we move to the next challenge, which is to reset the Australian economy for growth to support Australians and their livelihoods well into the future\u201d. He says today\u2019s National Cabinet meeting was briefed by the head of the Treasury department, Philip Lowe, the head of the Reserve Bank, and Wayne Byres, the head of APRA. Top luxury brands from Chanel to Louis Vuitton have increased prices of some of their most coveted products as they seek to make up for sales lost during weeks of coronavirus lockdowns. High-end houses have all reported brisk business in South Korea and the key Chinese market, where shops began to reopen in March, partly offsetting a slump in Europe and the United States, where restrictions are only just starting to be lifted. But with consultancy Bain estimating sales for the $300 billion sector to fall by up to 35% this year, bringing to a crushing halt a decade of spectacular growth, luxury groups are moving quickly to protect margins. Chanel said on Wednesday it was increasing prices on its iconic handbags and some small leather goods by between 5% and 17% around the world as the pandemic had pushed up the cost of certain raw materials. \u201cThese adjustments are made while ensuring that we avoid excessive price differentials between countries,\u201d it said. Industry powerhouse LVMH\u2019s star fashion label Louis Vuitton - which the company said last month was enjoying sales growth in excess of 50% in China in early April - has also been hiking prices of handbags in the United States and Europe. In China and South Korea, people were queuing outside Chanel stores as soon as rumours of imminent price increases began to spread on social media. Xie Lan, a documentary maker in Beijing, said she had managed to buy a handbag for nearly 30,000 yuan ($4,225) before the price hike. \u201cWork is busy and stressful, I wanted to give myself a treat,\u201d she said by phone. Israel\u2019s children can go back to school and nurseries full-time, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday, as the country presses on with easing its coronavirus curbs. Israel, which has a population nine million, has reported 16,579 cases of the novel coronavirus and 265 deaths. With the new case rate levelling out in the past few weeks, it has lifted bans on gatherings, eased travel and reopened malls and markets. A partial reopening of schools began on 3 May, with the first three grades of elementary school and the last two grades of high school redistributed in classes capped at 15 pupils to enforce social-distancing. Kindergartens joined a week later. In a written statement, Netanyahu said that from Sunday all children, from the age of zero, may go back to school on a voluntary basis. Those in outbreak epicentres, however, would have to stay home for now. Schools reopening full time could help the economy contend with the fallout of weeks of coronavirus lockdown, relieving working parents from having to stay at home and mind their children. More than 1.1 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, which would be equal to a jobless rate of about 27%. They include employees put on unpaid leave, some self-employed, as well as those who have lost their jobs entirely. We have more from Mexico, which has recorded its biggest daily rise in cases. Assistant health secretary Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell has called it the \u201cpeak moment\u201d when the country is experiencing its fastest growth but also pointed to declines in cities such as Canc\u00fan, Villahermosa in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco, Culiac\u00e1n in the northern state of Sinaloa, and the border city of Tijuana. Mexico recorded 2,409 cases on Thursday, the first time it has exceeded 2,000 in one day. Officials also reported 257 more deaths from Covid-19, making a total of 4,477 since the pandemic began \u2018They threw us into chaos\u2019: Wisconsin lockdown ruling is latest in partisan war A conservative majority on the Wisconsin supreme court struck down a stay-at-home order from the state\u2019s Democratic governor on Wednesday, further illustrating the remarkable amount of power Republicans have in the state and the way they have been able to curb the authority of their Democratic rivals. The Wisconsin decision is the most significant legal victory for conservatives, egged on by Donald Trump, who are beginning to challenge stay-at-home orders across the country through protests and legal actions. Republican lawmakers in Michigan, where the legislature is extremely gerrymandered, are also challenging the legal authority of a similar order issued by the state\u2019s Democratic governor there. Other suits from businesses challenging stay-at-home orders in other states have been largely unsuccessful, so far. The decision was the latest in a nasty partisan battle in Wisconsin between Republicans and Democrats that has shaped the last decade. The state is narrowly divided politically and seen as a crucial state to win for both campaigns in the November presidential election. Stranded without support, international students across Australia rely on free food to survive International students and other temporary visa holders locked out of federal government support are relying on food banks and restaurants giving away free meals to survive during the coronavirus pandemic. Images of long lines outside emergency relief services have emerged in the international student hubs of Sydney and Melbourne, as well as smaller cities including Darwin. Australia has more than 560,000 international students, many of whom have supported themselves with part-time or casual jobs while studying. But as the economy has shut down and with the federal government declining to offer direct financial support to temporary visa holders, the queues forming outside food banks each day suggest that startling numbers are now struggling to feed themselves. National food relief charities say the increase in demand has been huge, driven by a surge in requests from temporary visa holders. Here is the video of US President Donald Trump saying that he could \u2018cut off\u2019 the relationship with China following the coronavirus outbreak. In an interview wth Fox Business, Trump expressed his disappointment with China for failing to contain the Covid-19 outbreak before adding he maintained a good relationship with leader, Xi Jinping, but \u2018right now, I don\u2019t want to speak with him\u2019: China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus, AP reports. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus Friday, all local cross-infections in the northeastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April. Just 91 people remain in treatment for Covid-19 and 623 others are under isolation and monitoring for being suspected cases or for having tested positive without showing symptoms, including 11 newly detected. In total, China has reported 4,633 deaths among 82,933 cases since the virus was first detected late last year in the central city of Wuhan. China has maintained social distancing and bans on foreigners entering the country, but has increasingly opened up the world\u2019s second-largest economy to allow both large factories and small businesses to resume production and dealings with customers. The government plans to hold the ceremonial parliament\u2019s annual session later this month, but with highly limited access for journalists and others. Beleaguered cruise operators signalled a return in demand for cruises that would set sail late this year or early 2021 after travel restrictions and no-sail orders due to the Covid-19 pandemic raised concerns about the future of the industry. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd and Carnival Corp said on Thursday customers were booking trips, even though there was no clarity on when the cruises would begin. Shares of Norwegian, Carnival and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd reversed course following the positive commentary on demand from Norwegian executives on a post-earnings call. The cruise industry has been hammered by the coronavirus as health officials asked customers to avoid cruises and extended port quarantines in Japan and California. Norwegian Cruise\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Frank Del Rio said the company noticed a significant amount of new cash bookings in April and collected advanced ticket sales. \u201cIt took decades to build this industry,\u201d Del Rio told analysts on the call. \u201cAnd in a matter of weeks, we dismantled it. And it\u2019s going to take not decades to build it up again, but a little time. And we just have to be patient.\u201d This three Michelin star Virginia restaurant has its own innovative solutions to the new normal: There you are enjoying a nice meal at an ornate, three-Michelin star restaurant, when you spot something odd. The waiter refills the wine glass of the patron sitting next to you. The person does not move, they do not blink. They do not even say \u201cthank you\u201d to the waiter. You are dining with a dummy. Welcome to dining out in the age of coronavirus. That\u2019s the experience the Inn at Little Washington, a restaurant in northern Virginia, is planning for diners as they experiment with what dining in could look like amid the Covid-19 pandemic. With the idea that guests may feel lonely eating at a restaurant that can only reach 50% capacity \u2013 the maximum mandated by Virginia\u2019s social distancing regulations \u2013 the restaurant will be placing mannequins throughout its dining rooms. A pub with no bar: what visiting a pub in the Australian state of New South Wales will look like now In Australia, the New South Wales state government has announced that bars and clubs with kitchens will be able to reopen on 15 May, as Covid-19 lockdowns ease. Restaurants and cafes will be permitted to reopen on the same date. But to say that \u201cpubs are reopening\u201d does not quite capture the truth of the situation. Bars and pubs will be subject to the same social distancing and headcount caps as other venues \u2013 with 4 square metres of space for each patron, up to a maximum of 10 patrons. Pubs and clubs will only be allowed to open \u201can eating area on the premises\u201d according to the public health order issued 14 May, and can serve alcohol \u201conly if any liquor sold is sold with or ancillary to food served\u201d. The experience most typically associated with a pub \u2013 ordering a beer from the counter \u2013 will not be back on the menu. \u201cThe ability to conduct politics at the front bar of a pub are probably a way away yet,\u201d John Green of the Australian Hotels Association told Guardian Australia: Reunions, eating out and a lot of haircuts: New Zealand embraces relaxation of lockdown Charles Anderson reports for the Guardian from Nelson: Joshua Young was raring to get to the Tahunanui Beach playground on Friday morning. For almost two months, the seven-year-old Nelson resident has had to see one of his favourite play spots wrapped up in caution tape, while New Zealand undertook the strictest lockdown in its history. While Joshua and his mother Claire Young have explored other parts of Nelson, there was no substitute for the popular beachside park. \u201cWe are lucky here that there are plenty of places to play without climbing structures, but he just couldn\u2019t wait to come today,\u201d she said. Returning to the playground was one of several signs of normality creeping across New Zealand as the nation settled into Covid-19 alert level 2. It began on Thursday with the re-opening of shops, malls, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, and other public spaces, including playgrounds and gyms. Family members kept apart by the lockdown were also finally allowed to reunite. Next week, schools and early learning centres across the country will also reopen. Vietnam reported 24 new coronavirus infections on Friday, all of which were imported cases involving Vietnamese citizens returning from Russia who were placed under quarantine on arrival, the country\u2019s health ministry said. The Southeast Asian country has gone 29 days without a domestically transmitted infection and has registered a total of 312 cases, with no deaths, the ministry said. Over 90% of Vietnam\u2019s confirmed cases have recovered. Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began. The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally. Meanwhile, the EU pledged to step up support for the island\u2019s breakaway Turkish-run north. Commission president Ursula Von Der Leyen, responding to a request for aid from the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mustafa Akinci, said the bloc would provide 2.5 million euro for the immediate purchase of medical equipment. Further assistance will also be sent for the support of 25 health workers over the next three months with additional aid earmarked for farmers, she wrote in a letter to Akinci. \u201cThe pandemic has forced humanity to deal with an unprecedented situation so we must all do our part and work together throughout these difficult times,\u201d the EU chief was quoted as saying in the letter. A moderate, whose five-year term was due to end in April before the coronavirus caused presidential elections to be postponed, Akinci had requested the support at the end of March. The leader had been slammed by the self-styled state\u2019s hawkish prime minister and other hardline nationalist politicians for previously accepting aid from Greek Cypriots. One MP described it as a backhanded attempt to \u201cmake the Greek side look nice.\u201d Akinci has said he will be competing for a second term when the polls take place October 11th. After implementing strict lockdown measures, Cyprus, the EU\u2019s eastermost member, has managed to keep a tight lid on the pandemic reporting 905 confirmed cases in the internationally recognised Greek south and some 108 in the north. To date there have been 24 Covid-related deaths in the south and four in the north. Another case of coronavirus has been detected in Cyprus\u2019 sovereign British base areas, it was announced on Thursday. A statement confirmed \u201cone further member of the British Forces Cyprus community\u201d had tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. The individual was in self-isolation after displaying what were described as \u201conly mild symptoms.\u201d \u201cThis brings the total number of positive tests within the British bases to 12,\u201d the announcement said. It was unclear if the person had travelled recently from the UK. Despite commercial air traffic being suspended since 21 March by Greek Cypriot authorities in the war-split Mediterranean island, the UK military is believed to have continued airlifting personnel on transport planes from Britain. The Republic\u2019s lockdown regulations are however adhered to on the overseas territories with arrivals from the UK screened for the virus and ordered to self-isolate for two weeks. The bases \u2013 a legacy of Cyprus\u2019 past as a former crown colony \u2013 are home to nearly 6,000 British military personnel and their dependents. The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday. The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in last 24 hours, according to health ministry. The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. 844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993. And in other Trump news, in case you missed it: Donald Trump goes maskless to tour medical equipment facility Donald Trump traveled to a medical equipment distribution facility in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Thursday, to tout a plan to replenish and upgrade the vital federal stockpile. According to the pool report, \u201cthe president and his entourage were led around by Owens and Minor employees, who explained their distribution system and the products they handle. \u201cTrump and [White House chief of staff] Mark Meadows did not wear masks. Everyone else did.\u201d The Pennsylvania event had the trappings of a campaign rally. For his remarks, Trump approached the podium to the sound of God Bless the USA: Meanwhile a reporter for News 12 Long Island has shared this video of Trump supporters at a protest: Trump\u2019s remarks drew ridicule from Hu Xijin, editor in chief of China\u2019s influential Global Times tabloid, who referred to Trump\u2019s much-criticized comments last month about how Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, might be treated: US President Donald Trump signalled a further deterioration of his relationship with China over the novel coronavirus, saying he has no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping right now and going so far as to suggest he could even cut ties with the world\u2019s second largest economy, Reuters reports. In an interview with Fox Business Network broadcast on Thursday, Trump said he was very disappointed with China\u2019s failure to contain the disease and that the pandemic had cast a pall over his January trade deal with Beijing, which he has previously hailed as a major achievement. \u201cThey should have never let this happen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo I make a great trade deal and now I say this doesn\u2019t feel the same to me. The ink was barely dry and the plague came over. And it doesn\u2019t feel the same to me.\u201d Trump\u2019s pique extended to Xi, with whom the US president has said repeatedly he has a good relationship. \u201cBut I just \u2013 right now I don\u2019t want to speak to him,\u201d Trump said in the interview, which was taped on Wednesday. Trump was asked about a Republican senator\u2019s suggestion that US visas be denied to Chinese students applying to study in fields related to national security, such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence. \u201cThere are many things we could do. We could do things. We could cut off the whole relationship,\u201d he replied. \u201cNow, if you did, what would happen? You\u2019d save $500 billion,\u201d Trump said, referring to estimated US annual imports from China, which he often refers to as lost money. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s coverage of the global coronavirus pandemic. I\u2019m Helen Sullivan, with you for the next few hours. You can get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. US President Donald Trump has said he has no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping right now and going so far as to suggest he could even cut ties with the world\u2019s second largest economy. More on this shortly. Meanwhile, more than 300,000 people are confirmed to died in this crisis so far, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. The true number is likely to be higher. Global death toll passes 300,000. The global toll from Covid-19 has just passed 300,000, with nearly 4.5 million people infected.According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 301,370 people have now died as a result of the outbreak.The institution says it has counted 4,426,937 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures. Nearly 600,000 Australians have lost their jobs during the pandemic. Almost 600,000 Australians lost their jobs between March and April, unemployment rose to 6.2%, the underemployment rate increased by 4.9 points to 13.7% and the underutilisation rate increased by 5.9 points to 19.9%.The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the figures were \u201cterribly shocking, although not totally unexpected\u201d. Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus. Doctors in northern Italy, one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation. Donald Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself. Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but without wearing a mask himself.Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work. A vaccine for coronavirus must be available to all countries, the EU has insisted, after the British chief executive of French drugs company Sanofi said it was reserving the first shipments of its vaccine for the US. \u201cThe vaccine against Covid-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal,\u201d said the European commission spokesman, Stefan de Keersmaecker. 36 million Americans are now unemployed as another 3 million filed for benefits. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The European commission has suspended the delivery of 10 million face masks from China after two countries complained about the poor quality of the batches they received, the Associated Press reports. As part of its efforts to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, this month the commission started dispatching the masks to healthcare workers in its 27 member states and the UK. Officials in Bangladesh have announced the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the country\u2019s Rohingya refugee camps. Health experts and NGOs have issued warnings that the virus could race through the camps that house almost a million people forced to flee a military offensive in Myanmar almost two years ago. Greece will open 515 organised beaches to the public this weekend, but alcohol and music will be banned, along with sports and games. Scientists advising the government also insisted that given the dictates of social distancing there can only be 40 people per 1000 sq meters. Governments, health authorities and civil society groups should urgently address mental health problems sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, the UN secretary general has said. Launching a policy briefing on mental health during the outbreak, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said that \u201cthe Covid-19 pandemic is now hitting families and communities with additional mental stress.\u201d Ten people in Vietnam, including a 70-year-old military veteran, have offered to donate their lungs to a British man who is the country\u2019s most seriously ill Covid-19 patient. \u201cWe are touched by their good intentions, but current regulations don\u2019t allow us to transplant lungs donated by most living people,\u201d a representative of Vietnam\u2019s organ transplant authority said.",
