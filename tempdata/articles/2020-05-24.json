Unsurprisingly, many of these revolved around allegations that the PM\u2019s advisor Dominic Cummings broke the lockdown rules back in March. Here\u2019s a summary of the key points:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The government has announced it will put \u00a3283m into moving public transport back to a full timetable</strong>. However, those who can should still work from home, and those who can should still avoid all forms of public transport. Even a fully restored service will only be capable of carrying, at best, one fifth of normal capacity, to allow for social distancing. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>There have been a further 282 recorded deaths, bringing the UK\u2019s total death toll to 36,675</strong>. Important to note - the government publishes the death toll based on those who definitely had Covid-19; broader figures based on suspected coronavirus deaths is larger. On average, the number of deaths is starting to come down, Harries said. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The \u201csteady, slow\u201d <strong>downward trend in hospital admissions in England is continuing</strong>. Across all four nations, the percentage of mechanical ventilator beds occupied by patients with Covid-19 is also falling.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Testing for under 5s will be \u201cprogressed\u201d going forward</strong>, said Harries, after a question on whether they\u2019ll be able to get tested once early years facilities are reopened. Harries said it is known that children rarely become ill with Covid-19 and there are signals that the transmission from children is reduced.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <h2><strong>Shapps was grilled on Cummings</strong></h2> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Shapps dodged a question on whether or not the PM knew of Dominic Cummings\u2019 400km journey, simply saying: \u201cthe important thing is that everyone remains in the same place whilst they are in lockdown\u201d. He also said the welfare of Cummings\u2019 4 year old child was \u201cthe important thing\u201d - this is a reference to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iainjwatson/status/1264124644191277057\">explanation</a> given by Downing Street for Cummings\u2019 journey.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The PM gives Cummings his full support.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Asked if, like Cummings, those who become ill with the virus can go closer to relatives, Shapps says if you\u2019re symptomatic, you have to get yourself locked down in the most practical way, and that this will be different depending on different family circumstances.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>If you want more detail, you can read some of the exchanges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/23/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-under-pressure-to-sack-dominic-cummings-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec942418f0886ce4f5d91c7#block-5ec942418f0886ce4f5d91c7\">here </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/23/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-under-pressure-to-sack-dominic-cummings-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec940278f0864e579f167ae#block-5ec940278f0864e579f167ae\">here</a>.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T19:51:23.657Z\">at 8.51pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec9498f8f0886ce4f5d91fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T16:06:59.567Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The death toll in <strong>Italy </strong>has risen by 119 to 32,735, the third highest in the world after the US and the UK.</p> \n  <p>There have been another 669 confirmed cases, taking the total to 229,372, the sixth highest global tally behind those of the US, Russia, Spain, Britain and Brazil.

Early analysis by WHO suggests that Africa\u2019s lower mortality rate may be the result of demography and other possible factors. Africa is the youngest continent demographically, with more than 60% of the population under the age of 25. Older adults have a significantly increased risk of developing a severe illness. In Europe nearly 95% of deaths occurred in those older than 60 years.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>WHO also noted that African governments swiftly imposed restrictive measures on their populations in an attempt to contain the spread of the disease.

The celebration marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan, and usually involves travelling, visiting family and gathering for lavish meals, all of which will be largely prohibited as authorities try to prevent virus outbreaks. </li> \n   <li>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/22/hydroxychloroquine-trumps-covid-19-cure-increases-deaths-global-study-finds\">another study has shown that the anti-malarial drug the US president,<strong> Donald Trump,</strong> is taking</a> to prevent Covid-19 has increased deaths in patients treated with it in hospitals around the world. It follows a<a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v2\"> study published in April that showed hospital patients given hydroxychloroquine</a> in the US found no benefit from the drug, either alone or given in combination with an antibiotic. In fact the patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone had a higher mortality rate.</li> \n   <li>Still in the US, in yet another attack on media Trump called the editor of the New York Times \u201cone of the dumbest men\u201d in journalism, and as CNN\u2019s fact-checker has noted, this is the third time in the last month he has called a prominent black journalist \u201cdumb\u201d. He also spent his Friday evening attacking his former attorney general, <strong>Jeff Sessions, </strong>on Twitter. Trump declared churches, mosques and synagogues \u201cessential services\u201d and threatened to override governors who refuse to reopen them this weekend \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/donald-trump-churches-mosques-synagogues-reopen\">a power he does not possess</a>.</li> \n   <li>In Russia, the Chechen leader,<strong> Ramzan Kadyrov</strong>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/ramzan-kadyrov-vanishes-amid-reports-he-has-coronavirus\"> is being treated for Covid-19 in Moscow</a>.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/22/jobkeeper-to-cost-60bn-less-than-originally-forecast-due-to-reporting-error\">error between the number of employees businesses estimated would be covered by the scheme and the actual number receiving the payment means the scheme will cover 3.5m workers, down from 6.5m</a>.

I\u2019ll be taking you through the latest global developments in the coronavirus pandemic for the next few hours. Please do get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. I welcome your questions, comments, tips, and news. Transport secretary Grant Shapps appeared visibly flustered when answering journalists\u2019 questions on government aide Dominic Cummings\u2019s lockdown breach in March. Pressure has been mounting for the prime minister\u2019s top adviser to resign or be fired after reports he breached lockdown rules to travel to a family home while sick with Covid-19: I\u2019m going to be handing the blog over to my colleagues in Australia. Thank you all for joining me, on what has been at times a nail-biting few hours. A special thanks to all those who got in touch with tips and pointers, it\u2019s always much appreciated. I hope you\u2019re all able to stay safe and well, wherever you are in the world. Before I go, here\u2019s a quick summary of some of the key developments over the past few hours: New York\u2019s daily death toll falls below 100 for first time since March, as Trump causes controversy with golfing trip. India to organise special trains for migrant workers to get at least 3.6 million people who have been stranded in the cities, often walking hundreds of miles, home. More than 40 infected a German religious gathering after reopening. Six were hospitalised after the service, which was was held on May 10, a few days after the reopening of places of worship in Germany. Spanish death toll falls overtakes France for first time in 10 days. After confirming several hundred deaths on Friday, Spain\u2019s death toll stood at 28,678 on Saturday, 346 more than France. This is the first time the Spanish toll has overtaken the French for ten days, giving Spain the world\u2019s fourth-highest death toll after the United States, Britain and Italy. Cyprus beaches reopen, but with social distancing measures in place and limits on water sports, as country records first day of zero new infections. In the UK... New witnesses say UK chief advisor broke lockdown twice. After a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Mirror found police had spoken to Boris Johnson\u2019s chief aide Dominic Cummings after he made a journey of more than 200 miles from London to Durham during lockdown when he had coronavirus symptoms, new findings suggested he made at least two trips from London to Durham, and travelled to tourist hotspots in the north east of England. Police contradict UK government claims over chief advisor. After Downing Street flatly denied that Cummings had any contact with police over his trip, Durham constabulary have confirmed that they did speak to Cummings over allegations that he broke the lockdown. This came as a serious blow to the UK government, who had said that \u201cat no stage was [Cummings] or his family spoken to by the police about this matter\u201d. Calls mount for Cummings to be sacked. The reports have led to a chorus of calls for Cummings to be sacked, including from the leaders of the Liberal Democrats and SNP, while Labour called for an urgent investigation. Government officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo have denied manipulating the country\u2019s figures for coronavirus cases and deaths. The controversy came as health officials announced the latest Covid-19 figures, reporting 63 deaths out 2,025 cases, mostly in the capital of Kinshasa. So far, 312 people have recovered. Late on Friday, the government reported that a doctor and a hospital administrator had been arrested and later released over accusations of falsely declared coronavirus cases. The arrests were made after \u201ca controversy over a patient who died this month\u201d, according to a government news bulletin. The country\u2019s Council of Ministers met on Friday after President Felix Tshisekedi asked the health minister to investigate rumours of fake patient deaths in connection with coronavirus. \u201cA negative media campaign is being waged against our country by some foreign media, with the aim of tarnishing its image in connection with the management of Covid-19,\u201d the Council of Ministers said in the minutes of the meeting. A former political advisor to prime minister John Major and Conservative leader William Hague has criticised the government\u2019s handling of the Cummings controversy. Daniel Finklestein, now a columnist and Conservative member of the House of Lords, tweeted that suggesting the chief aide was not in breach of lockdown restrictions \u201cdiminishes everyone\u201d. Finklestein suggested a better route was to apologise. The vaccine being trialled at Oxford University has just a 50% chance of success, project leader Adrian Hill has told the Telegraph. I\u2019ll update you with more information as and when I get it... \u201cMuslims worldwide prepared to celebrate Eid under lockdown, with the strictest governments bringing in 24-hour curfews for the holiday \u2013 but across the world the slow march is continuing out of coronavirus quarantine.\u201d For an overview of key stories around the world, check out this global report from Emma Graham-Harrison: For deeper analysis of the Dominic Cummings story, you can read this piece from my colleagues at the Observer: The UK\u2019s trace and track system will launch at the end of the week, Reuters are reporting, attributing the announcement to Downing Street. The statement also said the public will be updated on coronavirus next week, with Reuters suggesting this will include schools and possibly non-essential retail. Prime minister Johnson will hold a cabinet meeting on Monday to discuss easing lockdown. \u201cA test and trace system allows us to isolate new infections so that we can control the spread of this virus, which will be vital while coronavirus remains present in the UK,\u201d a Downing Street spokesman said. The Chinese government is sending a medical expert team to the Republic of the Congo to support the country\u2019s coronavirus response, Chinese state media are reporting. The British government have said they will \u201cnot waste their time\u201d responding to what they describe as \u201cinaccurate allegations\u201d from \u201ccampaigning newspapers\u201d. However, they do not specify what they claim is inaccurate. Thanks to everyone who\u2019s getting in touch with tips, and my apologies if I haven\u2019t been able to get back to you. I am keen to look at developments all over the world - as well as the nail-biting news from the UK - so please do let me know if you something you think we should be reporting on this blog. You can drop me a message on Twitter. Here is the statement we\u2019ve received from Durham Constabulary in full: Following a significant number of media enquiries over the weekend, Durham Constabulary can add the following detail. On Tuesday, March 31, our officers were made aware that Dominic Cummings had travelled from London to Durham and was present at an address in the city. At the request of Mr Cummings\u2019 father, an officer made contact the following morning by telephone. During that conversation, Mr Cummings\u2019 father confirmed that his son had travelled with his family from London to the North-East and was self-isolating in part of the property. Durham Constabulary deemed that no further action was required. However, the officer did provide advice in relation to security issues. Durham police have contracted the claims made by the British prime minister\u2019s office that his chief adviser was not spoken to by police about allegations he had broken the lockdown, seriously undermining the government\u2019s response to the reports. Downing Street had previously said that police had not been in touch with Cummings over the allegations. In a statement, the prime minister\u2019s office said: \u201cat no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter\u201d. The Scottish National Party\u2019s Westminster leader Ian Blackford has described the fresh allegations against the British prime minister\u2019s senior aide as \u201cextraordinary\u201d, and described Downing Street\u2019s response as a \u201ccover up\u201d. \u201cIf true, they raise serious questions for Dominic Cummings - and over Boris Johnson\u2019s judgment,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe Prime Minister must come out of hiding, sack Mr Cummings, and then answer for his own role in this mess and the Downing Street cover-up.\u201d \u201cGiven the seriousness of these issues, the Cabinet Office inquiry should take place regardless of when Mr Cummings is removed from post. We need to know who knew what and why the public were kept in the dark for eight weeks over the rule-breaking,\u201d he said. \u201cDominic Cummings broke multiple lockdown rules, possibly on multiple occasions, and polls show the majority of the public think he should go.\u201d \u201cIf Boris Johnson is to salvage any public confidence in his Government he must finally act and show Mr Cummings the door,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats joined calls for Cummings to be sacked. Ed Davey aid: \u201cIf Dominic Cummings is now allowed to remain in place a moment longer, it will increasingly be the Prime Minister\u2019s judgment that is in the spotlight. \u201cSurely Boris Johnson must now recognise the actions of his top adviser are an insult to the millions who have made huge personal sacrifices to stop the spread of coronavirus. \u201cEach minute the Prime Minister allows this scandal to drag on is another minute the Government is distracted from upscaling Britain\u2019s testing capacity, securing PPE for frontline workers and ending tragic deaths in our care homes.\u201d It comes after the Labour Party wrote to the head of the civil service calling for an \u201curgent investigation\u201d into the movements of Cummings during the lockdown. In the letter to Sir Mark Sedwill, the party said that Downing Street\u2019s explanation for Dominic Cummings\u2019 journey from London to County Durham \u201craised more questions than they answer\u201d. Rachel Reeves, shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, wrote: \u201cThe British people have made important and painful sacrifices to support the national effort, including being away from family in times of need.\u201d \u201cIt is therefore vital that the Government can reassure the public that its most senior figures have been adhering to the same rules as everyone else.\u201d In what appears to be a deliberate attempt at normalcy, Donald Trump has travelled to Trump National Golf Club for a round of golf. It is the first time he\u2019s done this since the White House declared a national emergency in March. Despite a rising death toll, Trump is keen to promote the idea that the US is returning to normality and is encouraging states to kick start their economies.

This is an increase of 0.2% - below the average 0.3% increase of the past seven days and well below the average 0.8% increase seen in the last week of lockdown. France\u2019s coronavirus death toll stood at 28,332, an increase of 117 compared to Thursday. Friday\u2019s death toll data were not available, the ministry said. The number of people in hospital with coronavirus in France fell by 205 to 17,178 on Saturday, continuing a gradual decline that has been ongoing for more than five weeks since a high of 32,292 on 14 April. The number of people in intensive care also fell by 36 (or 2.1%) to 1,665. This has been continuing to fall for six weeks since the 8 April 8 peak of 7,148. Beaches in Cyprus have reopened, as the country marks its first day of zero new cases of coronavirus since its first cases were reported on March 9. Before today, residents had only been allowed to swim, but can now congregate on the beaches as long as they remain spaced apart. Only members of the same family can participate in water sports together. We\u2019ve put the tables two metres apart,\u201d Panayiotis Neokleous told AFP, owner of the Ammos beach club in the southern resort town of Larnaca. \u201cAll the staff have taken the (COVID-19) test, they are all negative. Now we are all wearing protective masks, gloves and we disinfect our hands many times,\u201d he said. However, he warned that the summer was not going to be as prosperous as usual due to a lack of tourism. \u201cWe are going to see a lot of restaurants and hotel businesses not going to make it and will have to close down,\u201d he said. The Taliban in Afghanistan have declared a three-day Eid ceasefire starting on Sunday, a spokesman for the group has tweeted. It comes after fighting intensified between the warring sides despite the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cDo not carry out any offensive operations against the enemy anywhere, if any action is taken against you by the enemy, defend yourself,\u201d wrote spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, adding that the ceasefire was declared solely for Eid festivities. The Afghan government has just welcomed the ceasefire. If you\u2019d like to read more on this issue, check out this article from Jason Burke last month: In case you missed it, here\u2019s an explainer from our science editor Ian Sample on the obstacles to creating a coronavirus vaccine: New testimony suggests Cummings left the home where he was staying in Durham to visit a town 30 miles away, the Guardian can reveal. He was allegedly spotted back in Durham on 19 April, days after he was photographed in London having recovered from the virus, indicating he made more than one trip between London and Durham. In essence, not only has Cummings left London during lockdown, he\u2019s allegedly also left Durham, returned to London, and travelled back again. This follows transport secretary Grant Shapps telling the UK during the coronavirus briefing today that Cummings had stayed in Durham when he travelled there, shedding serious doubt over the government\u2019s defence of Cummings. Read the full story here: One of Dominic Cumming\u2019s close friends and colleagues, who he travels in to work with each day, lives just two streets away from him, the chief political reporter at the Financial Times has tweeted. This has raised questions about why Cummings needed to travel over 200 miles away from London to get support. Downing Street, the prime ministers office, has said that Cummings\u2019 sister shopped for the family. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported 1,595,885 cases of coronavirus, an increase of 24,268. The number of deaths had risen by 1,852 to 96,002. The figures, which have just been announced, were correct as of 22 May 4pm ET, and compared with the same count a day earlier. If you\u2019re wondering about any discrepancies, it\u2019s possible that the CDC figures do not reflect cases reported by individual states. Thanks to all those getting in touch with tips and pointers, it\u2019s very much appreciated. If you spot something you think we should be reporting on in this blog, you can drop me a message on Twitter. I won\u2019t always be able to reply, but will try to read everything! A police commissioner and former Conservative councillor has criticised the government\u2019s response to allegations that the British prime minister\u2019s top aide broke lockdown restrictions, saying its approach \u201conly emphasises an arrogance manifested in Cummings\u2019 action\u201d. Simon Hayes, police commissioner for Hampshire, tweeted that it was \u201ctime to say a mistake was made, explain why and then move on\u201d, saying that the \u201cvolume of identical high level response\u201d was \u201cdamaging government and party\u2019s reputation making more difficult fight for Boris\u201d. A chorus of MPs and cabinet members have come out in support of Cummings\u2019 actions. Unsure of what\u2019s going on with the British prime minister\u2019s top aide? Here\u2019s a quick summary to bring you up to speed: Back in March, Boris Johnson\u2019s most senior advisor, Dominic Cummings, drove 264 miles north of his home in London with his family despite having symptoms of coronavirus, and met at least one family member. According to a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Mirror, police spoke to Cummings over the move after a member of the public spotted him and made a complaint. 10 Downing Street, the prime minister\u2019s office, have issued a statement explaining Cummings\u2019 travel. They say he was dropping off his young child to be cared for by relatives whilst he and his wife were unwell. Almost in unison, chorus of Conservative MPs have tweeted their support for Cummings, and Johnson and the Cabinet have also given their support, saying he has not broken the rules. Cummings has told reporters he will \u201cobviously not\u201d be considering his position. There has been a massive backlash and social media storm, with many calls for him to resign. I\u2019ll update you with any key developments on the story, as and when they unfold. A snap poll by YouGov has found that 68% of Britons think Dominic Cummings broke coronavirus rules by taking his family to Durham, and another 52% think he should resign. The survey of 3,707 adults, carried out on Saturday, showed just 28% think he should stay on, with 20% on the fence. Police have arrested around 60 demonstrators at an anti-lockdown protest in Frankfurt, German newspaper Tagesspiegel report. Two police officers were slightly injured, the paper added. If you\u2019d like to catch up with the key developments in the pandemic over the last few hours, here\u2019s a summary to bring you up to speed: The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Canada has risen to 82,892 from 81,765 on Friday. The country\u2019s death toll now stands at 6,277, up from 6,180. Correction: The French health ministry has said that the number of people in hospital with coronavirus has fallen by 205 to 17,178, not risen, as was previously reported. This is a continuation of its downward trend. I\u2019m not sure if the error has come from the news agency Reuters, or the health ministry itself, but we\u2019ve just received the correction. Apologies on whoever\u2019s behalf! Dominic Cummings, the top aide to British prime minister Boris Johnson, has told reporters that we will \u201cobviously not\u201d consider resigning over allegations he broke lockdown rules in March. \u201cI behaved reasonably and legally,\u201d Cummings told reporters outside his house after telling them to stay 2 metres apart in accordance with government guidelines, Reuters are reporting. Asked if he would consider his position, he said: \u201cObviously not.\u201d \u201cYou guys are probably all about as right about that as you were about Brexit: do you remember how right you all were about that?\u201d Cummings said. You can read more on the Cummings controversy here: The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Spain has risen to 235,290 - up from 234,824 on Friday, the health ministry has said. The death toll has risen by 48, bringing the total to 28,678. US president Donald Trump plans to attend the launching of US astronauts into orbit from the Kennedy Space Center on Wednesday. The event will mark the first time since the space shuttle program ended in 2011 that American astronauts will launch into space on an American rocket from American soil. It is also the first time that a private company - rather than NASA - is running the operation. Elon Musks SpaceX is the conductor and NASA the customer. The astronauts are scheduled to blast off at 4:33 p.m. EDT from launch pad 39A, the same one the Apollo astronauts used to get to the moon. More than 40 people have been infected with coronavirus after attending at a mass in Frankfurt, Germany earlier this month. Six were admitted to hospital. The service was held on May 10, a few days after the reopening of places of worship in Germany, the daily Frankfurter Rundschau reported. The UK\u2019s (rather tense) daily coronavirus briefing, hosted by deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries and and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, has just ended. It included questions from the press and public. Unsurprisingly, many of these revolved around allegations that the PM\u2019s advisor Dominic Cummings broke the lockdown rules back in March. Here\u2019s a summary of the key points: The government has announced it will put \u00a3283m into moving public transport back to a full timetable. However, those who can should still work from home, and those who can should still avoid all forms of public transport. Even a fully restored service will only be capable of carrying, at best, one fifth of normal capacity, to allow for social distancing. There have been a further 282 recorded deaths, bringing the UK\u2019s total death toll to 36,675. Important to note - the government publishes the death toll based on those who definitely had Covid-19; broader figures based on suspected coronavirus deaths is larger. On average, the number of deaths is starting to come down, Harries said. The \u201csteady, slow\u201d downward trend in hospital admissions in England is continuing. Across all four nations, the percentage of mechanical ventilator beds occupied by patients with Covid-19 is also falling. Testing for under 5s will be \u201cprogressed\u201d going forward, said Harries, after a question on whether they\u2019ll be able to get tested once early years facilities are reopened. Harries said it is known that children rarely become ill with Covid-19 and there are signals that the transmission from children is reduced. Shapps was grilled on Cummings Shapps dodged a question on whether or not the PM knew of Dominic Cummings\u2019 400km journey, simply saying: \u201cthe important thing is that everyone remains in the same place whilst they are in lockdown\u201d. He also said the welfare of Cummings\u2019 4 year old child was \u201cthe important thing\u201d - this is a reference to the explanation given by Downing Street for Cummings\u2019 journey. The PM gives Cummings his full support. Asked if, like Cummings, those who become ill with the virus can go closer to relatives, Shapps says if you\u2019re symptomatic, you have to get yourself locked down in the most practical way, and that this will be different depending on different family circumstances. If you want more detail, you can read some of the exchanges here and here. The death toll in Italy has risen by 119 to 32,735, the third highest in the world after the US and the UK. There have been another 669 confirmed cases, taking the total to 229,372, the sixth highest global tally behind those of the US, Russia, Spain, Britain and Brazil. This is a marginal increase from 652 new cases on Friday. There were 572 people in intensive care on Saturday, down from 595 on Friday, maintaining a long-running decline. Of those originally infected, 138,840 were declared recovered, against 136,720 a day earlier. Another 84 deaths have been recorded in New York \u2013 62 in hospitals and 22 in nursing homes. It\u2019s \u201cstill a tragedy\u201d, says the state governor, Andrew Cuomo, but the figure had been over 100 for the past five days, so this is a significant drop. He is encouraging everyone to wear a mask. \u201cI am telling you, those masks can save your life. Those masks can save another person\u2019s life,\u201d he said. He said emergency room health professionals have lower rate of infection than the general public \u201cbecause the masks work\u201d. Authorities in Sudan are working to create a police force to protect health facilities, the prime minister\u2019s office said on Saturday. The government will also introduce a draft bill offering protection to health workers. This development appears to be in response to a threat from doctors on Thursday to go on strike to pressure the authorities to offer greater protection for health workers and facilities. At least two dozen attacks on healthcare workers and facilities have taken place in the past two months across the country, according to a tally by the Sudan doctors committee. Last month there was a riot at a hospital in the city of Omdurman after a rumour circulated that it would take coronavirus patients. The prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, met the doctors on Friday in an attempt to find a solution for the repeated attacks. Sudan has reported at least 63 deaths from coronavirus, and around 3,380 confirmed cases. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus is under way, led by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps. It comes as Downing Street is under pressure to sack top adviser Dominic Cummings after reports that he breached lockdown rules in March. My colleague Lucy Campbell is blogging the briefing here, if you\u2019d like to follow it live. I\u2019ll post a summary here after it\u2019s finished. Thailand has begun testing a coronavirus vaccine on monkeys after a positive trial in mice, the country\u2019s minister of higher education, science and research and innovation has said. Suvit Maesincee said researchers hoped to have a \u201cclearer outcome\u201d of the effectiveness of the vaccine by September. \u201cThis project is for the human race, not just Thais. The prime minister [Prayuth Chan-ocha] has outlined a policy that we must develop a vaccine and join the world community workforce on this,\u201d Suvit told reporters on Saturday. The Thai vaccine uses messenger RNA, which prompts body cells to produce antigens that spur the immune system into action. This vaccine is one of at least 100 in works worldwide, and is being developed by the National Vaccine Institute, the Department of Medical Science and Chulalongkorn University\u2019s vaccine research centre. A new coronavirus test that gives results in just over an hour is being trialled in London hospitals. Currently, the UK is mainly relying on laboratory tests that take around 48 hours to give a result. The new test is based on the same design as the DNA test developed at Imperial College London, and was approved for clinical use at the end of April after successful trials. Hello everyone, I\u2019m Molly Blackall, taking over the blog for the next few hours. If you see something you think we should be reporting on in this blog, feel free to drop me a message on Twitter. I won\u2019t be able to reply to everything, but will try to read it all. Thanks! Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: The coronavirus pandemic \u201cappears to be taking a different pathway in Africa,\u201d the World Health Organization said, after it took 14 weeks for the continent to reach 100,000 cases and 3,100 deaths. \u201cCase numbers have not grown at the same exponential rate as in other regions and so far Africa has not experienced the high mortality seen in some parts of the world,\u201d the agency said. France has announced it will bring in a reciprocal 14-day quarantine for all visitors from the UK from 8 June, the same day that the UK imposes quarantine on all those coming into the country from abroad. However, unlike in Britain, visitors will be asked to voluntarily self-quarantine at home. Spain will reopen to overseas tourists from July, the prime minister announced on Saturday afternoon, adding that the government would guarantee the safety of visitors and locals as the country emerges from one of Europe\u2019s strictest coronavirus lockdowns. The prime minister said central and regional governments had been planning and coordinating the return to tourism for weeks. China has recorded no new confirmed cases for the first time since the outbreak began. Beijing\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday there were only two suspected cases in mainland China: in Shanghai and in the north-eastern Jilin province. New asymptomatic cases fell to 28, from 35 a day earlier, it said. Downing Street is facing accusations of a cover-up over a 264-mile journey by the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser at the height of the national lockdown. There were reports that No 10 knew Dominic Cummings had made the trip to Durham, a northern city, after developing coronavirus symptoms. The 102-year-old firm Hertz has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US after its business all but vanished during the pandemic. Hertz said in a US court filing on Friday it had voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 reorganisation. Its international operating regions including Europe, Australia and New Zealand were not included in the proceedings. They\u2019ve picked apart the holiday experience, lingering on moments such as breakfast buffets, poolside lounging and golf tee times. As officials in Spain\u2019s Canary Islands gear up to receive tourists as early as July, every aspect of travel is being recast against the backdrop of Covid-19, writes Ashifa Kassam in Madrid. \u201cWe call it a global laboratory for safe tourism,\u201d Cristina del R\u00edo Fresen, of the region\u2019s tourism ministry, told the Observer. \u201cWe\u2019re analysing every link in the chain \u2013 everything that has anything to do with the tourist experience, we want to make it safe from a health perspective.\u201d Since the start of this month, she has led a team of more than 200 people, including health and industry professionals, to hammer out protocols for everything from hotels to restaurants and museums. The aim is to rebrand the islands, which include Lanzarote and Tenerife, as tourist destinations that offer safety along with the usual sun, sand and sea. The new protocols, which begin in July, embrace physical distancing: hotel common areas are set to be enlarged and sunbeds moved apart; buffet breakfasts will be served, making use of partitions to separate guests from the food and extra serving staff; and all-inclusive vacations will rely on either automated machines or extra staff to serve drinks. India will organise special trains to get at least 3.6 million migrant workers stranded by the pandemic lockdown back home, authorities said on Saturday, AFP reports. With fears rising over the spread of the disease in Mumbai and other major cities, the government said 2,600 special trains would run over the next 10 days to help the workers who lost jobs when the lockdown started two months ago. Millions of migrant workers have been stranded in the densely populated cities and many have walked hundreds of miles to get home. Vinod Kumar Yadav, the chair of the Indian Railway Board, said about 80% of the new shamrik (labourer) trains would go to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states, the biggest source of domestic migrant workers. About 4 million people have already been moved on the special trains. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, is gradually easing the world\u2019s biggest lockdown, which has caused mass unemployment among India\u2019s 1.3 billion population. But at the same time, the number of new cases is rising each day, with at least 6,600 reported Saturday. The health ministry has confirmed at least 125,101 cases and 3,720 deaths. Experts say the outbreak will not peak in India until June or July and authorities face an increasing struggle to contain the pandemic in Mumbai, Delhi and other cities that account for the bulk of cases. A 77-year-old woman became the first coronavirus victim in Gaza on Saturday after she died at a field hospital set up near the Rafah border crossing after arriving from Egypt. There have been persistent fears that a widespread outbreak in the Gaza Strip could prove disastrous. According to the Associated Press, Gaza\u2019s healthcare system is fraying under the weight of an Israeli-Egyptian blockade, internal Palestinian division and repeated wars and skirmishes between Israel and Palestinian militant groups. Authorities in the strip reported 35 confirmed new cases this week, bringing the total to 55. All of the infected have been in designated quarantine and isolation facilities hosting returnees from abroad. There were no reports of community transmission of the virus. The number of coronavirus cases in the Netherlands passed 45,000on Saturday, after 176 more people tested positive for the virus. According to the latest update from the Dutch public health institute, the total number of confirmed cases in the Netherlands since the pandemic first spread there is 45,064. Of those, 5,811 have died, with 23 more deaths announced on Saturday. Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has given the green light for football to return in the week beginning 8 June, allowing La Liga to go ahead with plans to restart the first division with the Seville derby on Friday 12 June. A formal announcement on the date of the return to competition will be made by the league\u2019s president, Javier Tebas, in the next couple of days. S\u00e1nchez made the announcement during a press conference on Saturday afternoon in which he said the \u201cworst has passed\u201d and Spain was now at \u201cthe end of the tunnel\u201d, allowing for a further relaxing of the state of alarm that was first declared on 14 March. \u201cThe time has come to recover some of the activities that were suspended,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cI want to inform you that, in agreement with the CSD [the sports council] and the ministry of health, the government has given the Spanish professional league the green light to return to playing. From the week of 8 June, La Liga will return.\u201d Beaches in Portugal were packed on Saturday as thousands flocked to the coast for the first state-sanctioned beach weekend of the year, Reuters reports. The nation of 10 million people has reported just 30,471 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,302 deaths, a small fraction of neighbouring Spain\u2019s 28,628 fatalities. Restrictions imposed during a six-week state of emergency starting 18 March are being lifted in 15-day intervals, as long as the number of cases keeps falling. Some confusion was caused after the prime minister, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, announced on 15 May that beaches would open on 6 June, and a government decree two days later stated people could go to the beach from the beginning of this week. Vietnam recorded no new cases of coronavirus for a fifth consecutive day on Saturday, and has recorded no local transmission of the virus for 37 days straight, Xinhua reports. The country, which took extreme measures to curb the spread of the virus, has reported no deaths from Covid-19 so far. The health ministry said 14,700 people were being monitored and quarantined, according to the report by the Chinese news agency. In total, Vietnam has recorded 324 confirmed cases of coronavirus, of which 267 have recovered and 57 remain active patients, VN Express reported. Doctors are still battling to save the life of a 43-year-old British man who is Vietnam\u2019s most seriously ill coronavirus patient. The man, designated patient 91, was transferred on Friday night from the Ho Chi Minh city hospital for tropical diseases to Cho Ray hospital after he was confirmed to be free of the coronavirus. However, his condition remains critical and he has only 30% lung function, up from 10% a week ago. Spain will reopen to overseas tourists from July, the prime minister announced on Saturday afternoon, adding that the government would guarantee the safety of visitors and locals as the country emerges from one of Europe\u2019s strictest coronavirus lockdowns, write Sam Jones in Madrid and Stephen Burgen in Barcelona. Pedro S\u00e1nchez also said a \u20ac3bn minimum basic income scheme to help families most affected by the pandemic would come into effect in the next few weeks. S\u00e1nchez said: As you know, Spain receives more than 80 million visitors a year. And that is why I am announcing that from July, Spain will reopen for foreign tourism in conditions of safety. Foreign tourists can also start planning their holidays in our country. Spain needs tourism \u2013 and tourism needs safety in both origin and destination. We will guarantee that tourists will not run any risks, nor will they bring any risk to our country. The prime minister said the central and regional governments had been planning and coordinating the return to tourism for weeks, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re sending everyone a message today: Spain will be waiting for you from July.\u201d He called on Spaniards to begin planning domestic holidays, and also announced that the football league would be allowed to resume from 8 June. S\u00e1nchez said the minimum basic income was part of the coalition government\u2019s commitment to reducing poverty. He said: It will cost around \u20ac3bn a year and will help four out of five people in severe poverty and benefit close to 850,000 households \u2013 half of which include children. Neither the government now Spanish society is going to look the other way while our compatriots queue up to eat, as we are sadly seeing now in some parts of the country. S\u00e1nchez confirmed that the government had not ruled out seeking a sixth two-week extension of the state of emergency, which has been in force since 14 March. Mob violence has risen around the world since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project (Acled). The US non-profit collates information on all reported political violence and protest events across Africa, south Asia, south-east Asia, the Middle East, central Asia and the Caucasus, Latin America and the Caribbean, and south-eastern and eastern Europe and the Balkans. It said it had recorded more than 1,100 events of mob violence \u2013 violence by spontaneous, unarmed or crudely armed groups - in nearly 90 countries since 11 March. The organisation is running a Covid-19 disorder tracker, which aims to detail the pandemic\u2019s impact on political violence and protest around the world. Sixty-seven more deaths from Covid-19 have been announced by Sweden, the highest number reported on a Saturday since 18 April, taking the total death toll in the country to 3,992. According to the latest update from Sweden\u2019s public health authority, 379 more people have tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of infections to 33,188 since it reported its first confirmed case on 31 January. Of those, 4,971 people have recovered. Sweden has eschewed the kinds of compulsory lockdown measures seen elsewhere in the world. That it has again recorded a high death rate on a Saturday, a day when its numbers generally drop due to delays in reporting, will be seen as a sign that it has left its society open to the virus even as other European countries are experience drops in death rates. The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, has signed an order easing the US state\u2019s ban on gathering in groups, allowing up to 10 people to assemble as long as they stay at least 6ft from each other or wear face masks if they must stand closer. Cuomo signed the order on Friday night, the Associated Press reports, clearing the way for New Yorkers to gather together in time for the Memorial Day weekend. People in New York City were also given the all-clear to visit beaches this weekend, but they may not swim, the city\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, has said. \u201cI\u2019ve been really clear about the beaches; they are closed for swimming,\u201d de Blasio said Friday at his daily coronavirus briefing on Friday. \u201cThere will not be lifeguards. People are not supposed to go to the beach to swim.\u201d Memorial Day weekend usually marks the beginning of beach season in New York City, with lifeguards starting duty and swimming permitted in normal times. The main reason the mayor has cited for the swimming ban is to curb the spread of the virus by keeping people off public transport. Fifty-nine more people lost their lives to Covid-19 in Iran in the past 24 hours, the health ministry has said, as the country began reopening businesses, religious and cultural sites on the eve of Eid al-Fitr. Museums and historical sites are to reopen on Sunday to coincide with the celebrations that end Ramadan, the Muslim holy fasting month, President Hassan Rouhani said on state television, according to Reuters. Saints\u2019 shrines, some of which became flashpoints at the outset of the coronavirus epidemic in Iran, will reopen on Monday. All workers in the country will return to work from next Saturday. The health ministry\u2019s spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour, said in his latest coronavirus update that the death toll from the virus in Iran had reached 7,359, and the total number of confirmed cases was 133,521, after 1,869 more people tested positive in the past 24 hours. So far, 104,072 have recovered, Jahanpour was quoted as saying by the Islamic Republic News Agency. Rouhani said on Saturday that 88% of the people who died from Covid-19 in Iran had underlying illnesses. The Chinese city of Wuhan conducted nearly 1.5 million tests for coronavirus on Friday. The city where the pandemic began increased its testing total by just under 50% in 24 hours, according to the local health authority. Officials took 1,470,950 nucleic acid tests for Covid-19 on Friday, compared with 1,000,729 the previous day. The scaling up of testing to industrial levels followed a cluster of cases being discovered in the city two weeks ago Wuhan came out of lockdown on 8 April, but after positive cases were confirmed on 9/10 May an expanded testing programme sought to identify asymptomatic patients \u2013 infected people who show no outward sign of illness but remain capable of transmitting the disease. The Malaysian health ministry has confirmed another new cluster of coronavirus cases at a detention centre for undocumented migrants. The Semenyih detention centre near the capital, Kuala Lumpur, which houses around 1,600 detainees, has reported 21 new cases of Covid-19. It is the second detention centre to report an outbreak. Around 60 cases were reported among the 1,400 detainees at the Bukit Jalil centre earlier this week. Malaysia has so far reported a total of 7,185 cases of Covid-19 and 115 deaths. This month more than 2,000 foreign nationals were arrested and accused of not having permits to allow them to remain in the country. The migrants have since been housed in centres that are crowded, with dozens often packed in a single cell. Refugees and other foreigners have been the victims of an uptick of hate speech in the country in recent weeks, accused of spreading disease, burdening the state and taking jobs as the economy plummets. Rohingya refugees in particular have been targets of harassment and threats. The United Nations and human rights groups have called on Malaysia to stop the crackdown and criticised authorities for going after a vulnerable community during the pandemic. Human Rights Watch has said the new Malaysian government, which came to power at the end of February, \u201chas completely fallen down on the job when it comes to protecting the rights of Rohingya refugees\u201d. Hallo this is Paul MacInnes, sitting in for Damien while he takes a deserved break. A \u201ccar demo\u201d called by the far-right Vox party in Spain to protest against the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic led to some streets in Madrid and other cities filling with honking vehicles, Sam Jones reports from the Spanish capital. Vox, the third largest party in the Spanish parliament, wants the Socialist-led coalition government to resign and it urged people to get in their cars and create caravans of stationary vehicles. In order to limit possible infections, participants were told to stay in their cars and wear the mandatory face masks. Vox has accused the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, of a draconian response to the virus, which has killed 28,628 people and infected 234,824. It says the government\u2019s response has resulted in \u201cunemployment and misery\u201d. Vox were not the only ones out in the streets of Madrid on Saturday. Members of the Spanish Communist party gathered at the Puerta del Sol to call for a a social emergency plan to ameliorate the impact of the emergency on the poor. Protesters wearing masks and obeying social distancing rules held up banners calling for \u201cwork, rights and and urgent social emergency plan,\u201d as well as against the privatisation of the health service. Spain\u2019s lockdown, ordered after a state of emergency was declared on 14 March, is gradually being lifted and by Monday all parts of the country will have moved to at least the second phase of the de-escalation. The government\u2019s latest two-week extension of the state of emergency was hard won, and nightly protests against the lockdown have spread from wealthy barrios of Madrid to other regions. Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero, the finance minister who serves as the government\u2019s spokeswoman, said people had a right to protest, as long as their demonstrations did not risk spreading the coronavirus. She said on Friday: The only things that the state of emergency limits its people\u2019s freedom of movement and reunion. Very often, some of the shouts you hear during these demonstrations are contradictory because people are out protesting. Some people shout \u2018freedom\u2019 when they\u2019re actually exercising the right to criticise things and protest. But you can\u2019t mix up freedom with the freedom to infect people. Bangladesh has reported its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases after 1,873 more people tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours. The south Asian country, which is still cleaning up after its worst cyclone in nearly two decades this week, now has a total 32,078 confirmed cases. Twenty more deaths over the past 24 hours took its total toll from Covid-19 to 452. Dhaka, the capital, is by far the worst-affected area, with 13,093 cases, according to the latest data from the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR). France has announced it will bring in a \u201creciprocal\u201d 14-day quarantine for all visitors from the UK on the same day the UK imposes quarantine on all those coming into the country from abroad, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent. However, unlike in Britain, visitors will be asked to voluntarily self-quarantine at home. The French measure appears to be a tit-for-tat political move by Paris after the UK quarantine decision was announced without any apparent consultation. In any case, France\u2019s external borders have been closed since early April to all except those who have a \u201ccompelling\u201d professional or family reason to enter, so the French quarantine will affect few people and, as a non-obligatory measure, will be hard to police. From 8 June, anyone arriving in the UK by plane, ferry or train, including British nationals, will be required to give an address where they will remain for 14 days. There will be a \u00a3100 fine for anyone who does not fill in the form, and unannounced visits will be made to check those in quarantine are remaining isolated, the UK authorities announced last week. Fines of up to \u00a31,000 could be given to those who do not self-isolate. Kenya is to take out a \u20ac188m (\u00a3165m) loan from the African Development Bank to support its efforts to contain its coronavirus pandemic, the bank reported on Saturday. Poorer countries around the world are being forced to take on huge amounts of debt to finance their efforts against the spread of Covid-19. The AfDB said the money would help Kenya to \u201cstrengthen the national health system to effectively respond to the pandemic, build economic resilience and ensure quick recovery,\u201d as well as support poorer people. The bank\u2019s acting director general for east Africa, Nnenna Nwabufo, said: We are very pleased to join other development partners in supporting the government of Kenya\u2019s efforts in mitigating the financial impact of the pandemic, especially in terms of the country\u2019s expenditure in the health, social and economic sectors. The next step will focus on helping build resilience for post Covid-19. On Saturday, Kenya\u2019s ministry of health said on Twitter that 31 more people had tested positive for coronavirus, increasing the country\u2019s number of confirmed cases to 1,192. Fifty people have died from Covid-19 in Kenya. The Philippines has reported 180 more cases of coronavirus, and six more deaths. In a bulletin, the health ministry said total infections have risen to 13,777 and the death toll had reached 863. Eighty-five more patients have recovered, bringing total recoveries to 3,177. Splits are already emerging in plans for the post-lockdown economic recovery in Europe. Four EU countries calling themselves the \u201cfrugal four\u201d presented their own proposals on Saturday, AFP reports. Restating their rejection of any jointly issued debt instruments, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden said they wanted help for badly affected countries to take the form of one-off loans, according to a proposal published by the office of the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz. The money lent must be \u201cdirected towards activities that contribute most to the recovery such as research and innovation, enhanced resilience in the health sector and ensuring a green transition,\u201d the proposal says. This week the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, proposed a \u20ac500bn fund to mend the economy. But the frugal four insist there must be no mutualisation of debt, a process they believe would allow EU economies they see as less disciplined to get an undue benefit of cheaper funding on the back of their stronger northern peers. The deputy health minister in Afghanistan survived an assassination attempt on Saturday as the country recorded its worst day yet in the coronavirus crisis while war rages on with full intensity, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports for the Guardian from Herat. Wahid Majroh escaped unharmed when armed men opened fire on his vehicle as he was on the way back to Kabul early on Saturday. He has been spending most of his time visiting medical centres and briefing the media on coronavirus since the crisis began. \u201cThis morning I went to Khost, Paktia and then Logar provinces. On the way back, around 500 metres away from provincial capital of Logar, unknown armed men tried to stop our vehicle and when we didn\u2019t, they opened fire,\u201d Majroh said at a press conference in Kabul. He said he had gone to the remote provinces to \u201cget assured that everyone gets medical treatment\u201d. He added: \u201cI\u2019m a doctor, I don\u2019t have any military and political goals, I don\u2019t travel with security [guards], I don\u2019t know who they [the perpetrators] were.\u201d Afghanistan reported 782 new coronavirus cases and 11 deaths in last 24 hours, taking the totals to 9,998 and 216 respectively. There have been 1,040 recoveries. Kabul recorded 377 new cases, the biggest one-day rise yet, bringing the total to 3,460 with 29 deaths. The western province of Herat also recorded its worst day after eight patients died of Covid-19 overnight and 150 new infections were detected. Herat borders Iran and recorded the first case of the virus in Afghanistan after thousands of Afghan migrants poured back from Iran in February and March. Majroh said the \u201ccatastrophe\u201d of coronavirus was spreading across the country, and people had two options for Eid, which is scheduled for Sunday: \u201cYou either stay at home and safe or go out to visit your relatives and friends, which causes everyone in your family [to get] infected.\u201d He said the ministry was concerned about lockdown breaches. \u201cWhen people were heeding, daily number of infections was just about 250 or so a day, but now as the people continue to break the rules and we test more, the number is rising.\u201d Majroh said the ministry was preparing more hospital beds for Covid-19 patients. Early in the week he said beds had run out in most parts of the country. Meanwhile, war rages on across the country. According to the office of the national security council, 576 civilians were killed or wounded in Taliban attacks in the month of Ramadan. The 102-year-old car rental firm Hertz has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US after its business all but vanished during the coronavirus pandemic, Reuters reports. Hertz said in a US court filing on Friday that it had voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 reorganisation. Its international operating regions including Europe, Australia and New Zealand were not included in the US proceedings. The firm, whose largest shareholder is the billionaire investor Carl Icahn, is reeling from government orders restricting travel. A large portion of Hertz\u2019s revenue comes from car rentals at airports, which have all but dried up. With nearly $19bn (\u00a315.6bn) of debt and roughly 38,000 employees worldwide as of the end of 2019, Hertz is among the largest companies to be undone by the pandemic. The 54 countries of the African Union were reporting a total of 103,933 cases of coronavirus on Saturday morning, according the Africa Centres for Disease Control. So far African nations have reported 3,183 deaths from Covid-19, and 41,473 people have recovered since the virus was first detected on the continent 14 weeks ago. There had been apocalyptic forecasts for the potential impact of the pandemic in Africa. On Friday evening, after the 100,000th case was reached, the World Health Organization\u2019s Africa office circulated a note saying that it now seemed clear that the pandemic \u201cappears to be taking a different pathway in Africa.\u201d The note continued: Case numbers have not grown at the same exponential rate as in other regions and so far Africa has not experienced the high mortality seen in some parts of the world. Today, there are 3,100 confirmed deaths on the continent. By comparison, when cases reached 100,000 in the World Health Organization (WHO) European region, deaths stood at more than 4,900. Early analysis by WHO suggests that Africa\u2019s lower mortality rate may be the result of demography and other possible factors. Africa is the youngest continent demographically, with more than 60% of the population under the age of 25. Older adults have a significantly increased risk of developing a severe illness. In Europe nearly 95% of deaths occurred in those older than 60 years. WHO also noted that African governments swiftly imposed restrictive measures on their populations in an attempt to contain the spread of the disease. However, it also said that despite \u201csignificant progress in testing\u201d, rates of testing remain low in comparison to other regions. It insisted that despite the relatively low number of cases, \u201cthe pandemic remains a major threat to the continent\u2019s health systems\u201d. Now that countries are starting to ease their confinement measures, there is a possibility that cases could increase significantly, and it is critical that governments remain vigilant and ready to adjust measures in line with epidemiological data and proper risk assessment. Russia said on Saturday that 9,434 new cases of the novel coronavirus had been reported in the last 24 hours, pushing its nationwide tally to 335,882, according to Reuters. The country\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre reported 139 more deaths, after a record of 150 deaths the day before, bringing the death toll to 3,388. Numbers of new cases have dipped slightly in Russia after a surge earlier in May. However, Vladimir Putin has ordered the health ministry to be prepared for a second wave of coronavirus in October and November. The latest figures mean Russia has snatched back its position as the second worst affected country in the world by cases of coronavirus, which was briefly held by Brazil after it reported 20,803 new cases on Friday. Singapore has reported 642 more coronavirus cases, taking its tally of infections to 31,068, Reuters reports. The vast majority of the newly infected people are migrant workers living in dormitories, the health ministry said in a statement. Six are permanent residents. So far the south-east Asian city state has reported just 23 deaths from Covid-19. Here are the headlines from the UK papers this morning: The Guardian says \u201cPolice spoke to Cummings about lockdown breach\u201d, our scoop on Boris Johnson\u2019s key adviser Dominic Cummings who is facing calls to resign after police spoke to him about breaching the government\u2019s lockdown. He was seen in Durham, 425km (264 miles) from his London home, despite having had symptoms of Covid-19. The Daily Mirror, which broke the story with the Guardian after a joint investigation, has the same story, saying \u201cCUMMING BROKE LOCKDOWN RULES ... while he had coronavirus symptoms\u201d. The Daily Telegraph follows up the Cummings story for its splash, and also reports that \u201cPM to scale back Huawei 5G role in wake of coronavirus crisis,\u201d in the latest developments on the controversial deal to put the Chinese tech giant at the heart of British mobile communications infrastructure. \u201cSunak to push the PM to lift lockdown,\u201d the FT Weekend reports, with news that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is pressing Boris Johnson to end restrictions on businesses, with the treasury alarmed at the cost to the government and the economy. \u201cFirms must pay quarter of staff wages,\u201d the Times reports, referring to the news that after August companies in the UK may be asked to contribute to the state wage subsidy scheme. The Sun says \u201cDON\u2019T BOOK YET BUT JET YOUR HOPES UP\u201d referring to the possibility of \u201csafe corridors\u201d for travel being opened in July. The Daily Mail follows suit, with \u201cCORONA PASSPORT TO SAVE HOLIDAYS\u201d, claiming that the government hopes to \u201cstrike quarantine-free pacts with summer destinations \u2013 such as France, Spain and Greece.\u201d The Daily Express has its own patriotic slant, imploring readers \u201cLET\u2019S ALL GO ON A BRITISH SUMMER HOLIDAY\u201d and suggesting that quarantines for international travellers could, in fact, boost the UK tourism sector. Hi, this is Damien Gayle taking over the world news blog now, for the next eight or so hours, bringing you all the latest developments in the global coronavirus outbreak. As ever, I am keen to hear your comments, tips and suggestions for coverage of news around the world. If you want to get in touch drop me a line either via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via Twitter direct message to @damiengayle. Here is a rundown of some of the biggest events from the last few hours: The World Health Organization says South America is a new epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, with Brazil and Chile recording more than 333,000 and 60,000 cases respectively. Mexico has recorded another single-day record for Covid-19 deaths, with 62,527 total cases since the pandemic began. On Friday the health ministry said 479 more deaths had been recorded, and 2,960 new infections. China recorded no new confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland for 22 May, the first time it had seen no daily rise since the pandemic began in the central city of Wuhan late last year. Australia\u2019s death toll has risen by one to 102 after the death of a man in a hospital in Victoria. Efforts to highlight Donald Trump\u2019s largesse during his time in office have backfired after his press secretary appeared to display the US president\u2019s personal bank details to the world. The more than a century old car rental firm Hertz Global Holdings Inc has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US. In the UK, Boris Johnson\u2019s key adviser, Dominic Cummings, is facing calls to resign after police spoke to him about breaching the government\u2019s lockdown rules. He was seen in Durham, 425km (264 miles) from his London home, despite having had symptoms of coronavirus. This was revealed in a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Mirror. China has betrayed the people of Hong Kong so the west should stop kowtowing to Beijing for an illusory great pot of gold, says Chris Patten, the last governor of the former British colony. \u201cThe Hong Kong people have been betrayed by China,\u201d Patten was quoted as saying by the Times newspaper. Britain has a \u201cmoral, economic and legal\u201d duty to stand up for Hong Kong, he said. \u201cWhat we are seeing is a new Chinese dictatorship,\u201d Patten said. \u201cWe should stop being fooled that somehow at the end of all the kowtowing there\u2019s this great pot of gold waiting for us. It\u2019s always been an illusion.\u201d Mainland China has stepped up efforts to control the semi-autonomous city in recent days, with some suggesting this may spell the end of the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 era. Moscow doctors have described their ordeal as the city is overwhelmed with Covid-19 cases. \u201cFrankly speaking, I just want to be in silence for a couple of days. I would like to go somewhere in the mountains where there is no cell phone signal, so I can sit quietly and have some air,\u201d the intensive care physician Dr Osman Osmanov told the Associated Press at the end of yet another long shift at the epicentre of Russia\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. Moscow accounts for about half of all of Russia\u2019s 326,000 coronavirus cases and 3,249 deaths, a deluge that strains the city\u2019s hospitals and has forced Osmanov to work every day for the past two months, sometimes for 24 hours at a time. The demands are intense; the rewards are gratifying. \u201cWhen a patient starts suffocating, you should calm him down. People are just scared,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes all you need is to calm down a patient, and then he feels much better.\u201d In the early days of the outbreak, he said, he watched the crisis unfold with some scientific detachment. \u201cAt first, it was interesting, of course. Everyone took it as something new,\u201d he said. \u201cI had an impression at first that we were fighting an invisible enemy.\u201d Now, after weeks of seemingly endless work, he is struggling to remain stoic. \u201cI am not at the end of my rope,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I feel tired.\u201d There is no end in sight for Osmanov\u2019s punishing workload. Although new case counts have begun falling, to 8,849 on Friday, down from more than 10,000 a day last week, Russia on Friday recorded its highest one-day death toll of 150. \u201cThe current situation doesn\u2019t allow\u201d for rest, he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re just hoping that soon it will all end, we will win and it will all be fine.\u201d Still on the UK for a moment, Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, the union that represents senior civil servants, says Boris Johnson must explain reports that his chief aide, Dominic Cummings, broke lockdown rules. The comments come after the chief adviser was accused of travelling 260 miles during the lockdown. Penman told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that \u201cessentially, when he (Cummings) says or does something he is doing it in the prime minister\u2019s name\u201d. He added: \u201cI think the prime minister needs to understand how heartbreaking this lockdown has been for so many families and the sacrifices that have been made up and down the country. \u201cI think in these circumstances, if it looks like there is one rule for those at the centre of government and one rule for rest of the country, then really the prime minister has a responsibility, as well as a constitutional responsibility, to explain his actions. \u201cHe has known about this for six weeks.\u201d The Dorset police and crime commissioner, Martin Underhill, has urged UK residents not to travel to Dorset, in the south of England, over the weekend after their beaches were clogged with tourists on Friday. He spoke to BBC radio today: Yesterday was the busiest day for our police in nine weeks. It was a normal Friday ... As the numbers increase the chances of socially distancing are reducing. And, of course, the issue of Dorset is that some of our beauty spots, the zigzag at Bournemouth beach going down to the beach, you can\u2019t socially distance trying to get to the beach, and therefore we\u2019re saying think twice, and please use common sense when you come to us, if you are going to come, is what you\u2019re doing safe and is it fair. The United Kingdom has drawn up plans to require employers to cover 20% to 30% of furloughed employees\u2019 wages from August to reduce the burden of the coronavirus crisis on government finances, the Times newspaper has reported. The UK on 12 May extended its job retention scheme \u2013 the centrepiece of its attempts to cushion the coronavirus hit to the economy \u2013 by four months but told employers they would have to help to meet its huge cost from August. \u201cThe Treasury has drawn up plans that would require employers to cover between 20 and 30 per cent of people\u2019s wages,\u201d the Times said. \u201cThey would also be required to cover the cost of employer\u2019s national insurance contributions, on average 5 per cent of wages.\u201d Australia continues to ease restrictions in some states as case numbers there remain in single digits. The New South Wales government has flagged the \u201cimminent\u201d reopening of gyms and beauty salons as the state prepares over the next two weeks for a landmark easing of Covid-19 lockdowns. The government remains cautious yet bullish after three cases of coronavirus were recorded over the preceding 24 hours; all three were overseas acquired. The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has announced that from 1 June, up to 50 people will be allowed in restaurants, pubs and cafes. Regional travel restrictions will also ease while museums, galleries and libraries will also be allowed to open. That has been met with a chorus of industries clamouring for the government to allow them to resume trading. Some news from the plane that crashed into homes in Pakistan\u2019s port city of Karachi on Friday afternoon. One of the two survivors has described his escape from the burning plane after it came down during a second attempt at a landing. \u201cAll I could see around was smoke and fire,\u201d engineer Muhammad Zubair told Geo News. \u201cI could hear screams from all directions. Kids and adults. All I could see was fire. I couldn\u2019t see any people \u2013 just hear their screams. \u201cI opened my seat belt and saw some light. I went towards the light. I had to jump down about 10 feet to get to safety.\u201d You can read the full report here: Hello, Matilda Boseley here, I\u2019ll be taking over from Melissa Davey and guiding you through all the important news from across the globe for the coming hours. We have published a breakdown of the latest events from the past 12 hours or so. A few of the key events: Mexico has recorded another single-day record for Covid-19 deaths, with 62,527 total cases since the pandemic began. On Friday the health ministry said 479 more deaths had been recorded, and 2,960 new infections. The previous daily peak of 424 fatalities was reported by authorities on 20 May. There have been 6,989 deaths in total. Ramadan travel bans are under strain in Indonesia where people are turning to smugglers and bogus travel documents to get around bans on an annual end-of-Ramadan exodus that could send coronavirus cases skyrocketing in the world\u2019s biggest Muslim majority nation, AFP reports. Thousands are using any trick in the book to reach their home towns in time for celebrations at the end of Islam\u2019s holy fasting month this weekend, a festival known as Eid al-Fitr. In the UK, Boris Johnson\u2019s key adviser Dominic Cummings is facing calls to resign after police spoke to him about breaching the government\u2019s lockdown rules. He was seen in Durham, 425km (264 miles) from his London home, despite having had symptoms of coronavirus. Officers approached him days after he was seen rushing out of Downing Street when the prime minister tested positive for the virus at the end of March, a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Mirror found. There have now been 5,213,483 confirmed cases and 338,225 deaths globally, according to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University. On Saturday Thailand reported three new coronavirus cases and no new deaths, bringing the country\u2019s total to 3,040 confirmed cases and 56 dead since the outbreak started in January. The new cases are two Thai nationals recently returned from overseas and under quarantine and a 49-year-old Italian man living in Phuket, said Panprapa Yongtrakul, a spokeswoman for the government\u2019s coronavirus task force. There are 2,916 patients who have recovered and returned home since the outbreak started. Australians are being invited to record their coronavirus experiences for future generations in a new campaign by the country\u2019s postal service. Australia Post says it\u2019s important to mark this moment in the nation\u2019s history as the past few months have had an extraordinary impact on families, communities and our way of life. It\u2019s created a \u201cnational letterbox\u201d for people to write describing how the Covid-19 pandemic affected them. The project is in conjunction with the National Archives, which will keep some of the Dear Australia letters for posterity. Hong Kong\u2019s pro-Beijing politicians have sought to allay worries about the impact of China\u2019s proposed national security legislation on the Asian financial hub\u2019s business environment, saying it would boost investor sentiment, Reuters reports. The legislation aims to tackle secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference and could see mainland intelligence agencies set up bases in Hong Kong, raising fears of direct law enforcement. The US said the legislation would end the Chinese-ruled city\u2019s autonomy and would be bad for both its and China\u2019s economies. Bankers and headhunters said it could lead to money and talent leaving the city. Hong Kong stocks slumped 5.6% on Friday. When she returned from Beijing late on Friday, Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, said the stock market \u201cgoes up and comes down\u201d and it was in fact the large scale pro-democracy protests in 2019 which destabilised the business environment. \u201cEspecially having gone through almost one year of disruptions, violence and uncertainties, anything particularly in safeguarding national security that will help stabilise the environment is indeed very good for local investment sentiment,\u201d she said. Henry Tang, a member of the standing committee of the Chinese people\u2019s political consultative conference, said the legislation was \u201cbeneficial\u201d for the business environment as it brings stability and strengthens the rule of law. The Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, has added to calls for the Australian government to extend the jobkeeper payment scheme in which eligible employers, sole traders and other entities can apply to receive $1,500 for each eligible employee a fortnight. It follows revelations that there have been reporting errors relating to the scheme. Rather than costing the federal budget $130bn, that figure has been slashed to $70bn. The government was also forced to downgrade its forecast that 6.5m employees would be assisted, down to 3.5m employees. Gutwein said the massive overestimate presents an opportunity for the scheme to be extended. \u201cThe scheme is an excellent one and is doing what was intended to with all eligible workers being paid,\u201d he said on Saturday. \u201cHowever, now that it is apparent that it will cost significantly less than first thought, the scheme should be extended for a longer period targeting additional support at those industries such as tourism and hospitality that will take longer to recover. \u201cI\u2019m certain that most states and territories will be of a similar view and I look forward to discussing this with national cabinet when we meet this week.\u201d Germany has reported an increase of 638 cases, taking its total to 177,850. An additional 42 deaths have been recorded, taking the death toll there to 8,216. Boris Johnson has been forced to cave into to Conservative backbench rebels opposed to the presence of Huawei in 5G networks and has drawn up plans to reduce the Chinese company\u2019s involvement to zero by 2023, Dan Sabbah reports: The UK prime minister\u2019s retreat is designed to stave off what could have been an embarrassing defeat when his existing proposal to reduce Huawei to a 35% market share was to be voted on in the Commons. Although Johnson boasts an 80-strong majority, the number of Conservative MPs willing to rebel on the issue is estimated to be 50 \u2013 enough in theory to defeat the government \u2013 as anti-Chinese sentiment hardens in the light of the coronavirus crisis. The mooted retreat will delight the White House which has been relentlessly campaigning against Huawei, but is likely to provoke a hostile reaction from Beijing, which has believed the UK was open to inward investment until now. Read the full story here. The US is preparing to add 33 Chinese firms and institutions to an economic blacklist for alleged ties to China\u2019s military or persecution of Uighurs. Seven companies and two institutions were listed for being \u201ccomplicit in human rights violations and abuses committed in China\u2019s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labour and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs\u201d and others, the commerce department said. Two dozen other companies, government institutions and commercial organisations were added for supporting procurement of items for use by the Chinese military, it also said. The blacklisted companies focus on artificial intelligence and facial recognition, markets that US chip companies such as Nvidia Corp and Intel Corp have been heavily investing in. Among those named is NetPosa, one of China\u2019s most famous AI companies, whose facial recognition subsidiary is linked to the surveillance of Muslims. The coronavirus crisis has forced Greece to take rapid steps to computerise its lumbering civil service and belatedly introduce e-governance in one of the EU\u2019s worst digital laggards, experts say. After recording its first coronavirus death on 12 March, Athens took unprecedented measures totally at odds with its previous love affair with paperwork and red tape. Diomidis Spinellis, head of the department of management science and technology at the Athens University of Economics, says the Covid-19 crisis \u201caccelerated\u201d Greece\u2019s digital turn, although critics say the country has a long way to go. Between 23 March and 4 May, when a nationwide lockdown was imposed, Greeks were required to inform authorities when leaving their homes. A special SMS service was introduced for those unable to print a special form created by the government. Eventually, some 110m messages were sent free during this period, in an initiative praised by the OECD. Greece\u2019s digital governance minister, Kyriakos Pierrakakis, said the platform freed thousands of users \u2013 especially high-risk groups \u2013 from having to turn up at public services as they now could sign documents digitally. Indonesians are turning to smugglers and bogus travel documents to get around bans on an annual end-of-Ramadan exodus that could send coronavirus cases skyrocketing in the world\u2019s biggest Muslim majority nation, AFP reports. Thousands are using any trick in the book to reach their home towns in time for celebrations at the end of Islam\u2019s holy fasting month this weekend, a festival known as Eid al-Fitr. \u201cIt is a critical moment,\u201d said Doni Monardo, head of Indonesia\u2019s Covid-19 mitigation task force. \u201cI\u2019m afraid people who go to other regions will come back infected and all of our efforts will be wasted.\u201d Every year millions of travellers pack into airports, train stations and ports across the nearly 5,000km-long (3,100-mile) archipelago in a mass migration similar to China\u2019s lunar new year holiday or Christmas. Fearing a public health disaster, last month the government slapped a ban on domestic sea and air travel and set up roadblocks. It later relaxed those rules over concerns about a collapse in south-east Asia\u2019s biggest economy, but only for those who could prove they were virus-free and had a professional reason to travel. To recap the latest news from around the world over the past few hours: Australia\u2019s death toll has risen by one to 102 after the death of a man in a hospital in Victoria. Still in Australia, the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said the government\u2019s massive multibillion-dollar jobkeeper mistake raises questions over how it will manage the economic recovery coming out of the pandemic. It follows the government admitting on Friday to a $60bn reporting error in the much-heralded subsidy scheme. Rather than costing the budget $130bn, that figure has been slashed to $70bn, and is forecast to assist 3.5m employees instead of 6.5m. The World Health Organization says South America is a new epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, with Brazil and Chile recording more than 333,000 and 60,000 cases respectively. China recorded no new confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland for 22 May, the first time it had seen no daily rise since the pandemic began in the central city of Wuhan late last year. Efforts to highlight Donald Trump\u2019s largesse during his time in office have backfired after his press secretary appeared to display the US president\u2019s personal bank details to the world. The more than a century old car rental firm Hertz Global Holdings Inc has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US. Earlier we reported that China recorded no new confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland for 22 May, the first time it had seen no daily rise since the pandemic began in the central city of Wuhan late last year. It has seen a sharp fall in locally transmitted cases since March as major restrictions on people movement helped it to take control of the epidemic in many parts of the country. However, Reuters reports it has continued to see an influx of imported cases, mainly involving Chinese nationals returning from abroad, while new clusters of infections in the north-eastern border provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang have emerged in recent weeks. Wuhan also reported this month its first cluster of infections since a lockdown on the city ended on 8 April, prompting authorities to warn that counter-epidemic measures could not be relaxed and to launch a campaign to test all of Wuhan\u2019s 11m residents. The number of confirmed cases in the mainland stood at 82,971 and the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634. Australia\u2019s death toll is now 102. On Saturday, Victoria\u2019s deputy chief health officer, Dr Annaliese van Diemen, said 10 new cases had been recorded in the state and that a man aged in his 60s had died in hospital; 19 people have died in Victoria, where there has been 1,602 cases. The state\u2019s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said: \u201cToday\u2019s increase in cases illustrates once again that while we have been flattening the curve, our battle against Covid-19 is far from over. \u201cRestrictions around some activities have now been eased in Victoria in recognition of the current low rate of community transmission of this virus. \u201cWhile encouraging, we need to remain vigilant. We must maintain physical distancing, practise hygiene and self-isolation when ill. These are commonsense actions to ensure we don\u2019t create a second wave of this serious disease, as we have seen in other countries once they have eased their stringent regulations. \u201cPeople with even the mildest of symptoms of coronavirus including fever, chills, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, runny nose or loss of sense of smell are encouraged to get tested.\u201d Meanwhile Western Australia again recorded no new cases overnight. However, the state\u2019s total stands at 560 after three historical cases were identified through serology testing. These cases are no longer infectious and do not carry any ongoing risk to the public, the health department said. The more than a century old car rental firm Hertz Global Holdings Inc has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US after its business all but vanished during the coronavirus pandemic and talks with creditors failed. Its international operating regions including Europe, Australia and New Zealand were not included in the US proceedings. Reuters reports that the firm, whose largest shareholder is the billionaire investor Carl Icahn, is reeling from government orders restricting travel and requiring citizens to remain home. A large portion of Hertz\u2019s revenue comes from car rentals at airports, which have all but evaporated as potential customers eschew plane travel. With nearly $19bn of debt and roughly 38,000 employees worldwide as of the end of 2019, Hertz is among the largest companies to be undone by the pandemic. US airlines have so far avoided similar fates after receiving billions of dollars in government aid, an avenue Hertz explored without success. Meanwhile in North America, the company recently laid off about 10,000 employees. The New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, has just given an update in Sydney saying the state had three additional cases of the virus yesterday. That takes the state\u2019s total to 3,086. Almost 9,000 were tested in the last recorded 24-hour period. \u201cI must say, as the health minister, I would love to see a lot more people coming forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is absolutely essential as we move forward. As we try to relax the restrictions that we have lived under for the past two months, it is crucial, absolutely crucial, people come forward for testing if they have the slightest hint of any respiratory issues at all, a cough, a cold, temperature, whatever it may be. \u201cWe now have a total of 411,618 people who have been tested in NSW so we are fast closing in on half a million people.\u201d He urged young people to be careful with social distancing and not to assume they were safe; 20% of all those who have tested positive had been in the 20-29 age bracket, he said. In Australia the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said the government\u2019s massive multibillion-dollar jobkeeper mistake raises questions over how it will manage the economic recovery coming out of the coronavirus pandemic. The payment scheme is a temporary subsidy for businesses. Eligible employers, sole traders and other entities can apply to receive $1,500 for each eligible employee a fortnight. But on Friday, the government admitted to a $60bn reporting error to its much-heralded scheme. Rather than costing the budget $130bn, that figure has been slashed to $70bn, and is forecast to assist 3.5m employees instead of 6.5m. \u201cIf they can\u2019t manage a program like jobkeeper to the tune of a mistake of $60bn and three million people ... then there has got to be a great question mark over how they\u2019ll manage the economic recovery,\u201d he said in Sydney on Saturday. \u201cThis is a government that\u2019s good at boasting that the budget is \u2018back in black\u2019, that they\u2019ve got this all under control, but when it comes to the detail they\u2019re simply not capable of delivering.\u201d Labor has been calling for the jobkeeper payment to be broadened to casuals and other workers who missed out, but the government has repeatedly rejected the idea, even with the program now much smaller. A Labor frontbencher, Amanda Rishworth, said the bungle was a \u201cslap in the face\u201d for close to 1m workers who were told by the government that the program was over-subscribed and they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to enter it. The New York Times reports that the press secretary of the White House accidentally revealed Donald Trump\u2019s private bank account and routing numbers. At a press conference on Friday Kayleigh McEnany announced Trump would donate his quarterly pay cheque to the health and human services department as it responds to Covid-19. As she held up the $100,000 cheque, it was complete with the relevant banking details. An administration official told the New York Times mock cheques were never used in the briefing. We have cropped out those details in the image below. Sydney\u2019s lord mayor, Clover Moore, has been speaking to the ABC about how the city and its public transport will manage as office workers return to the CBD. Moore said that unlike other Australian capitals such as Adelaide and Perth, where people are being encouraged to drive rather than take public transport, Sydney\u2019s city centre is geographically constrained. The government and the council have been encouraging workers to ride to work, and temporary bike lanes will be installed, but Moore acknowledged there were limits to what can be done. \u201cPeople are going to drive, and that will mean the air quality goes down again,\u201d she said. \u201cThere will be tremendous congestion. And when they get into the city, you can only have two people per lift. Most of these are high-rise buildings. So how long is it going to take people to get into their workplace and get them out for lunch at home for dinner? So it\u2019s a challenge.\u201d Science magazine has an interesting article by Gretchen Vogel which describes how Sweden wasted a rare opportunity to study coronavirus in schools. Despite bucking a global trend by keeping primary schools open since Covid-19 emerged without any major adjustments to class size, lunch policies or recess rules, Swedish officials have not tracked infections among schoolchildren. This was even the case when large outbreaks led to the closure of individual schools or staff members died of the disease. Vogel writes: Emma Frans, a clinical epidemiologist at KI who also writes a regular newspaper column on science and health, says Sweden\u2019s overall goal during the pandemic has not been to eliminate transmission completely, but to prevent the health system from becoming overburdened and to protect the elderly. (It has succeeded at the former but not the latter: Sweden has suffered very high mortality among nursing home residents.) Regarding schools, Frans says, \u201cMost people in Sweden are quite happy with [them] being open.\u201d She acknowledges the lack of data is a missed opportunity. With Sweden\u2019s centralised health system and extensive records \u201cit would have been possible\u201d to track cases fairly easily had there been more testing. Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have issued a joint statement expressing deep concern at proposals from China for introducing legislation related to national security in Hong Kong that will impinge on civil liberties. \u201cMaking such a law on Hong Kong\u2019s behalf without the direct participation of its people, legislature or judiciary would clearly undermine the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 principle under which Hong Kong is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy,\u201d the statement says. AP reports that on Friday the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, condemned China\u2019s move, calling it a \u201cdeath knell for the high degree of autonomy\u201d that Beijing had promised the territory. He called for Beiing to reconsider and warned of an unspecified US response if it proceeds. Meanwhile, a White House economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said China risked a major flight of capital from Hong Kong that would end the territory\u2019s status as the financial hub of Asia. Shortly afterwards the commerce department announced restrictions on sensitive exports to China. The contentious measure, submitted on Friday on the opening day of China\u2019s national legislative session, is strongly opposed by pro-democracy lawmakers in semi-autonomous Hong Kong. Pompeo called the proposal an effort to unilaterally and arbitrarily impose national security legislation on Hong Kong. \u201cHong Kong has flourished as a bastion of liberty,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThe United States strongly urges Beijing to reconsider its disastrous proposal, abide by its international obligations, and respect Hong Kong\u2019s high degree of autonomy, democratic institutions, and civil liberties, which are key to preserving its special status under US law.\u201d In Australia, thousands of people in Sydney have had their vehicles sanitised for free in a trial launched and funded by the state government in April. Point-to-point vehicles were eligible, including all taxis, ride share and hire vehicles. The trial included disinfecting outside and inside door handles, boot handle, window controls, steering wheel, visors, centre console, gear stick, handbrake, grip handles, glove box, dashboard, seatbelts, seats, headrests, mobile phone holders, cup holders, fuel door, fuel cap meters, and payment equipment. It is not a car wash service. Spot cleaning in between sanitisation is also required by drivers. The transport minister, Andrew Constance, said the trial was the first of its kind in the country. \u201cIt has been so successful we\u2019re now rolling it out across other metro areas and the regions,\u201d he said. There have been 101 deaths from the virus in Australia. Cafes, pubs and some businesses are slowly reopening, and travel within states has been gradually increasing. There has been debate in recent days about when interstate travel should restart. Mexico has recorded another single-day record for Covid-19 deaths, with 62,527 total cases since the pandemic began. On Friday the health ministry said 479 more deaths had been recorded, along with 2,960 new infections. The previous daily peak of 424 fatalities was reported by authorities on 20 May. There have been 6,989 deaths in total. Argentina surged past the 10,000-mark of total coronavirus cases on Friday in a fourth record day of sharply rising numbers. Nearly all are concentrated in the capital Buenos Aires and its surrounding Greater Buenos Aires area. The Buenos Aires metropolitan area, with a population of 12m, reported 93% of Friday\u2019s 718 new cases, bringing the total so far to 10,649 reported cases across the country. The total death count is now 433, with 17 deaths reported on Friday. Unlike its neighbours Brazil and Chile, with more than 333,000 and 60,000 cases respectively, Argentina\u2019s numbers had stayed low after an early government lockdown went into force on 20 March. But numbers have started rising sharply recently. Today\u2019s record 718 new daily cases follows a record 648 cases on Thursday, a record 474 on Wednesday and a record 438 on Tuesday. Driving the numbers are the \u201cvillas\u201d or slums of Buenos Aires with cramped living conditions and problems in the supply of running water. Buenos Aires city accounted for 56% of Friday\u2019s new cases, the province of Buenos Aires, including the city\u2019s greater metropolitan area, 37%, and the rest of Argentina, with a total population of 44m, accounted for only 7% of new cases. Chinese media are reporting no new cases of the virus were detected in China on Friday. There have been 4,638 deaths from the virus in that country. As mentioned, the US president, Donald Trump, declared churches, mosques and synagogues \u201cessential services\u201d and threatened to override governors who refuse to reopen them this weekend \u2013 a power he does not possess. The Guardian\u2019s US reporter, David Smith, reports from Washington that Trump held a two-minute press conference without taking questions from media, declaring: \u201cThe governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now. For this weekend. If they don\u2019t do it, I will override the governors. In America we need more prayer, not less.\u201d His remarks sowed confusion, Smith reports, because the federal government does not have the constitutional right to unilaterally order individual states to reopen businesses, churches or schools. But they did seem likely to play well with his support base: Trump won four in five Christian evangelical voters in the 2016 presidential election. About an hour ago, Trump then began posting on Facebook about the media, declaring the executive editor of the New York Times, Dean Baquet, \u201cone of the dumbest men in the world of journalism\u201d. Baquet is a Pulitzer prize winner. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic. To recap the latest developments around the world: About 1.8bn Muslims worldwide will celebrate one of their biggest holidays, the three-day Eid al-Fitr, largely confined to their home. The celebration marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan, and usually involves travelling, visiting family and gathering for lavish meals, all of which will be largely prohibited as authorities try to prevent virus outbreaks. Meanwhile, another study has shown that the anti-malarial drug the US president, Donald Trump, is taking to prevent Covid-19 has increased deaths in patients treated with it in hospitals around the world. It follows a study published in April that showed hospital patients given hydroxychloroquine in the US found no benefit from the drug, either alone or given in combination with an antibiotic. In fact the patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone had a higher mortality rate. Still in the US, in yet another attack on media Trump called the editor of the New York Times \u201cone of the dumbest men\u201d in journalism, and as CNN\u2019s fact-checker has noted, this is the third time in the last month he has called a prominent black journalist \u201cdumb\u201d. He also spent his Friday evening attacking his former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, on Twitter. Trump declared churches, mosques and synagogues \u201cessential services\u201d and threatened to override governors who refuse to reopen them this weekend \u2013 a power he does not possess. In Russia, the Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, is being treated for Covid-19 in Moscow. He has not been seen publicly in the 24 hours since Russian state media said he had been taken to hospital with symptoms. South America has become a new centre of the pandemic, the World Health Organization has said. Peru has extended its state of emergency until June. In the UK, police have spoken to the prime minister\u2019s key adviser, Dominic Cummings, about breaching the government\u2019s lockdown rules. Cummings was seen in Durham, 425km from his London home, despite having had symptoms of coronavirus. Finally, in Australia, the federal government blamed employers incorrectly filling in a form for massively overestimating the size of the jobkeeper payment scheme. The error between the number of employees businesses estimated would be covered by the scheme and the actual number receiving the payment means the scheme will cover 3.5m workers, down from 6.5m. It will also cost about $70bn, not $130bn. The government is so far resisting calls from Labor to extend the payment to casuals and those workers who were not eligible for the payment.",

In a decision the paper said was intended to convey the vastness and variety of the tragedy, the front page is a simple list of names and personal details taken from obituaries around the US. The headline is \u201cUS deaths near 100,000, an incalculable loss\u201d, with a sub-heading that reads: \u201cThey were not simply names on a list. They were us.\u201d The entire list, which continues inside, numbers nearly 1,000 names \u2013 a fraction of the total loss of life in the US during the outbreak so far. The US death toll stands at more than 97,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, by far the highest in the world, and the Times said it had been considering how to mark expected milestone of 100,000 deaths. In an article for Times Insider, assistant graphics editor Simone Landon explained the treatment was a way of personalising the tragedy as readers and staff developed data fatigue from the constant reporting of the pandemic. Landon led a team of researchers in searching obituaries in hundreds of US newspapers that listed Covid-19 as the cause of death and extracting names and key personal details \u201cthat depicted the uniqueness of each life lost\u201d, such as: \u201cAlan Lund, 81, Washington, conductor with \u2018the most amazing ear\u201d. Tom Bodkin, its chief creative officer, said the all-text treatment referenced early newspaper designs, but that he could not remember another front page without an image in his 40 years at the paper. \u201cThis is certainly a first in modern times,\u201d Bodkin said. The Times tweeted an image of the front page on Saturday afternoon and within hours had 61,000 retweets and more than 116,00 likes. Monday in the US is Memorial Day, the traditional start of the American summer, and some experts fear that the return of warmer weather combined with a loosening of lockdowns around the country could trigger a deadly second wave of the coronavirus. On Friday, White House coronavirus taskforce member Dr Anthony Fauci said new localised outbreaks were \u201cinevitable\u201d as mitigation measures were relaxed. He said a full-blown second wave could be avoided if the holy grail of containment measures \u2013 testing, quarantine and contact tracing \u2013 continued to be adhered to.

      "bodyText": "Most of Europe and all 50 US states are in various stages of \u201creopening\u201d. But why, exactly? The pandemic is still with us. After the first tentative steps to ease the lockdown in Germany \u2013 the most successful large European country in halting the spread of the virus, thanks to massive testing \u2013 the disease has shown signs of spreading faster. At least Germany is opening slowly and carefully, as is the rest of the EU. By contrast, the US \u2013 with the highest number of deaths and most haphazard response to Covid-19 of any advanced nation \u2013 is opening chaotically, each state on its own. Some are lifting restrictions overnight. Researchers expect the reopenings to cause thousands of additional deaths. Two weeks after Texas\u2019 governor, Greg Abbott, began reopening, the state experienced the single-highest rise in cases since the beginning of the pandemic. Since Nebraska reopened on 4 May, Covid-19 cases in Colfax county alone surged 1,390%. Experts warn that Dallas, Houston, Florida\u2019s Gold Coast, the entire state of Alabama and several other places in the south that have rapidly reopened their economies are in danger of a second wave of coronavirus infections over the next four weeks. Last Monday, Ford reopened its large North American assembly plants. On Tuesday, it closed and reopened its Chicago Assembly plant twice in less than 24 hours, after two workers tested positive for Covid-19. On Wednesday, Ford temporarily shut its Dearborn, Michigan truck plant after an employee tested positive, then promptly resumed operations. So why \u201creopen\u201d so abruptly, when Covid-19 continues to claim lives? The main reason given is to get the economy moving again. But this begs the question of why an economy exists in the first place, other than to promote the wellbeing of people within it. Both Ford plants are vital to the company\u2019s profitability, and that profitability is important to jobs in the midwest. But surely the wellbeing of Ford workers, their families, the people of Chicago and Dearborn and others are more important. A related argument is that workers are clamoring to return to their jobs. \u201cPeople want to get back to work,\u201d Trump has asserted repeatedly. Fox News host Sean Hannity claims people are \u201cdying to get back to work\u201d, seemingly unaware of the irony of his words. Polls suggest otherwise. Americans whose jobs require them to leave home express trepidation about doing so: 60% fear exposing their families to Covid-19. Many Americans must return to work because they need the money, but this doesn\u2019t have to be the case. Rich economies can support their people for years if necessary. During the second world war, America shut down most of its economy for nearly four years. The obstacle right now is a lack of political will to provide such support, at least until testing and tracing provide reasonable assurance the pandemic is contained.

It was led by the vice-president, Mike Pence, but Don Jr was second, Nikki Haley third and Ivanka fourth. Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about that but I think the stark political reality that will hit them all, whether Donald Trump wins re-election or not, is that there are a whole lot of Republicans waiting in the wings for this administration\u2019s transition to lame duck and they are not going to go quietly into that good night. \u201cIt will not be, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re Donald Trump\u2019s son or daughter so we bow and get out of the way.\u2019 That ain\u2019t happening.\u201d",

The party of Abraham Lincoln and the upward arc is gone.</p> <p>Frum was a speechwriter to George W Bush and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/28/usa.iran\">helped coin the phrase \u201caxis of evil\u201d</a>. Now he declares that 21st-century conservatism has \u201cdelivered much more harm than good, from the Iraq war to the financial crisis to the Trump presidency\u201d. Yet he remains committed to his Burkean worldview, of individual autonomy fused to social cohesion.</p> <p>Trumpocalypse quotes the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, that it is \u201cculture, not politics, that determines the success of a society\u201d. By the same measure, \u201cpolitics can change a culture and save it from itself\u201d.</p> <p>Frum criticizes the effective disenfranchisement wrought by the electoral college but does not call for its abolition. That would be futile. Although the Republicans lost the popular vote in six of seven presidential contests since 1992, they captured the White House three times. Few surrender power for the asking.</p> <p>After the debacle of 2000, Frum\u2019s boss extended an olive branch to blue America. Bush sought to broaden his mandate. Trump still spits in half the country\u2019s eye. Conciliation is not part of his DNA, or even his playbook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"33951935cc61ded727629b7eddba39baf2d9e1a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33951935cc61ded727629b7eddba39baf2d9e1a1/0_0_2928_2756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Frum speaks at Politicon in Nashville, Tennessee last October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"941\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Frum speaks at Politicon in Nashville last October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Cahn/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Frum questions the legitimacy of the process if Trump wins re-election but finishes second again in the popular vote. He also homes in on the contradiction at the heart of Trumpian populism.</p> <p>On the one hand, it is rooted in the belief that the silent majority should come first, not the elites. On the other, its operative dictum is \u201cwe should not choose our leaders just by counting who got the most votes\u201d. Shades of Animal Farm: some folks are more equal than others.</p> <p>Said differently, the people\u2019s preferences should not be equated with \u201cwill of <em>the </em>people\u201d. In the end, Frum says, Trumpism is about defending a \u201cdistinct way of life\u201d, one challenged by modernity.</p> <p>Frum makes clear that this outlook is shared by the cosseted segments of Trump\u2019s base. Trumpocalypse quotes <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/fema-tells-states-to-hand-public-health-data-over-to-palantir\">Peter Thiel, a pillar of Silicon Valley</a> and an early Trump supporter, who sees democracy at odds with his libertarian ideals. Thiel has written that he \u201cno longer believes that freedom and democracy are compatible\u201d.</p> <p>A PayPal co-founder and Kushner family partner, Thiel blames this decoupling on the \u201cextension of the franchise to women\u201d. He also contends that the welfare state has \u201crendered the notion of \u2018capitalist democracy\u2019 into an oxymoron\u201d. Recent reports, however, describe even Thiel <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/billionaire-maga-fan-peter-thiel-has-had-it-with-trumps-covid-19-response\">as displeased with Trump</a> over his handling of the pandemic.</p> <p>Trumpocalypse voices irreconcilable grievance. Still, Frum\u2019s dismay is not directed at the president\u2019s supporters, at least he tries not to. Frum understands that even if the incumbent loses re-election, the great American divide is not disappearing anytime soon.</p> <p>On that note, Trumpocalypse rejects progressivism\u2019s embrace of the \u201cGreat Awokening\u201d, the volatile brew of identity politics and intersectionality. The left\u2019s orthodoxies find few takers in swing districts. Frum opposes liberal immigration policies as devaluing the rights and status of actual citizens. He also criticizes Biden for advocating healthcare expansion to cover undocumented migrants.</p> <p>More Americans <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/440012308/Fox-December-8-11-2019-National-Topline-December-15-Release#fullscreen&amp;from_embed\">favor a wall along the southern border</a> than <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-candidates-healthcare-benefits-undocumented-immigrants-2019-7\">support granting government healthcare</a> to the undocumented. Frum warns that \u201cthe election can be thrown away by people who will not meet voters where they are\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/17/pelosi-review-speaker-donald-trump-brain\">Pelosi review: the speaker, her rise and how she came to rent space in Donald Trump's brain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trumpocalypse proposes a series of reforms to rebalance the disconnect between the populace and electoral outcomes. Among other things, Frum urges abolishing the filibuster if the Democrats retake the Senate: \u201cDon\u2019t study or debate it. Just do it.\u201d Right now, the odds of the GOP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/us-senate-democrats-elections-2020?CMP=share_btn_tw\">keeping the upper chamber</a> are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-grow-nervous-about-losing-the-senate-amid-worries-over-trumps-handling-of-the-pandemic/2020/05/09/65691184-915f-11ea-a9c0-73b93422d691_story.html\">no better than 50-50</a>.</p> <p>As for climate change, the author opposes the Green New Deal but backs a carbon tax and carbon sequestration. In 2010, the GOP regained the House in part due to congressional Democrats passing a \u201ccap and trade\u201d tax.</p> <p>Whenever Trump leaves office, his legacy will haunt. He was more than just a candidate, he embodied a movement. His children show no hint of leaving the stage.</p> <p>Frum observes that in theology, the apocalypse was not \u201cthe end\u201d but the harbinger of a \u201cnew and better order\u201d. We\u2019ll see. But Trumpocalypse is an apt title for these blighted times.</p>",

The party of Abraham Lincoln and the upward arc is gone. Frum was a speechwriter to George W Bush and helped coin the phrase \u201caxis of evil\u201d. Now he declares that 21st-century conservatism has \u201cdelivered much more harm than good, from the Iraq war to the financial crisis to the Trump presidency\u201d. Yet he remains committed to his Burkean worldview, of individual autonomy fused to social cohesion. Trumpocalypse quotes the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, that it is \u201cculture, not politics, that determines the success of a society\u201d. By the same measure, \u201cpolitics can change a culture and save it from itself\u201d. Frum criticizes the effective disenfranchisement wrought by the electoral college but does not call for its abolition. That would be futile. Although the Republicans lost the popular vote in six of seven presidential contests since 1992, they captured the White House three times. Few surrender power for the asking. After the debacle of 2000, Frum\u2019s boss extended an olive branch to blue America. Bush sought to broaden his mandate. Trump still spits in half the country\u2019s eye. Conciliation is not part of his DNA, or even his playbook. Frum questions the legitimacy of the process if Trump wins re-election but finishes second again in the popular vote. He also homes in on the contradiction at the heart of Trumpian populism. On the one hand, it is rooted in the belief that the silent majority should come first, not the elites. On the other, its operative dictum is \u201cwe should not choose our leaders just by counting who got the most votes\u201d. Shades of Animal Farm: some folks are more equal than others. Said differently, the people\u2019s preferences should not be equated with \u201cwill of the people\u201d. In the end, Frum says, Trumpism is about defending a \u201cdistinct way of life\u201d, one challenged by modernity. Frum makes clear that this outlook is shared by the cosseted segments of Trump\u2019s base. Trumpocalypse quotes Peter Thiel, a pillar of Silicon Valley and an early Trump supporter, who sees democracy at odds with his libertarian ideals. Thiel has written that he \u201cno longer believes that freedom and democracy are compatible\u201d. A PayPal co-founder and Kushner family partner, Thiel blames this decoupling on the \u201cextension of the franchise to women\u201d. He also contends that the welfare state has \u201crendered the notion of \u2018capitalist democracy\u2019 into an oxymoron\u201d. Recent reports, however, describe even Thiel as displeased with Trump over his handling of the pandemic. Trumpocalypse voices irreconcilable grievance. Still, Frum\u2019s dismay is not directed at the president\u2019s supporters, at least he tries not to. Frum understands that even if the incumbent loses re-election, the great American divide is not disappearing anytime soon. On that note, Trumpocalypse rejects progressivism\u2019s embrace of the \u201cGreat Awokening\u201d, the volatile brew of identity politics and intersectionality. The left\u2019s orthodoxies find few takers in swing districts. Frum opposes liberal immigration policies as devaluing the rights and status of actual citizens. He also criticizes Biden for advocating healthcare expansion to cover undocumented migrants. More Americans favor a wall along the southern border than support granting government healthcare to the undocumented. Frum warns that \u201cthe election can be thrown away by people who will not meet voters where they are\u201d. Trumpocalypse proposes a series of reforms to rebalance the disconnect between the populace and electoral outcomes. Among other things, Frum urges abolishing the filibuster if the Democrats retake the Senate: \u201cDon\u2019t study or debate it. Just do it.\u201d Right now, the odds of the GOP keeping the upper chamber are no better than 50-50. As for climate change, the author opposes the Green New Deal but backs a carbon tax and carbon sequestration. In 2010, the GOP regained the House in part due to congressional Democrats passing a \u201ccap and trade\u201d tax. Whenever Trump leaves office, his legacy will haunt. He was more than just a candidate, he embodied a movement. His children show no hint of leaving the stage. Frum observes that in theology, the apocalypse was not \u201cthe end\u201d but the harbinger of a \u201cnew and better order\u201d. We\u2019ll see. But Trumpocalypse is an apt title for these blighted times.",

      "bodyText": "We are now a long two months into lockdown \u2013 a necessary step to help save lives but one that has brought with it huge costs. New data last week showed the number of employees falling by 450,000 in April as government borrowing hit a new record high of \u00a362bn. But while economic issues dominate the news, they are far from the only costs. Warnings of an increase in domestic violence have been issued, although with such a fast-moving picture it has been hard to understand the scale. But a new study from the US has spelled it out in painful detail. Across 15 large US cities, the research found that social-distancing measures led to a 10.2% increase in domestic violence-related calls to the police \u2013 a high cost for asking people to spend a lot more time at home in a very stressful period. For some households that stress is amplified by intense financial pressures. We know from previous UK research that increases in female unemployment are associated with increases in domestic abuse. The rise in calls isn\u2019t triggered by any particular demographic group, and appears to be driven by households without a history of domestic violence. So while the government\u2019s hidden harms summit last Thursday was welcome, all of society needs to face up to the tragedy of this widespread increase in violence. \u2022 Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.

He said the US would \u201cnot take any risk to our telecommunications infrastructure, any risk to the national security elements of what we need to do with our Five Eyes partners\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re going to protect and preserve the security of those institutions, so I don\u2019t know the nature of those projects precisely, but to the extent they have an adverse impact on our ability to protect telecommunications from our private citizens, or security networks for our defence and intelligence communities, we will simply disconnect, we will simply separate,\u201d he told Sky\u2019s Outsiders program. \u201cWe\u2019re going to preserve trust in networks for important information. We hope our friends and partners and allies across the world, especially our Five Eyes partners like Australia, will do the same.\u201d There is no mention of telecommunications-related projects in the framework agreement, signed last year, between the Victorian government and China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission. And the federal government has already moved to ban the Chinese-owned Huawei and ZTE from Australia\u2019s 5G network in response to security advice \u2013 a decision, made in 2018, that Beijing still cites as a source on ongoing diplomatic tension. A Victorian government spokesperson said the state had not, and would not in the future, agree to telecommunications projects under the Belt and Road Initiative \u2013 and noted that telecommunications regulation was a federal responsibility. The spokesperson said the Belt and Road framework agreement was \u201cabout creating opportunities for Victorian businesses and local jobs \u2013 opportunities that will be more important than ever as we rebuild from the coronavirus pandemic\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Lockdown has made me nostalgic \u2013 not about travelling so much as about places. It\u2019s no surprise the focus of some of my fondest remembering has been the world capital of looking back: Buenos Aires. The reasons behind this are many and complex. Porte\u00f1os \u2013 BA residents \u2013 are famously given to looking far away, to the Spain or Italy of their ancestors, and to romanticising the brief belle \u00e9poque of the early 20th century, when Argentina was rich and promising. Tango is laced with longing for the missed and elusive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/05/lockdown-learning-how-to-dance-tango-classes-online-youtube\">Bored in lockdown? Try learning how to tango online</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I lived there for a decade and have revisited every year during the two decades since. This has inevitably made my nostalgia layered, but more than anything I miss walking, roaming the Argentinian capital. Now, incarcerated in my English semi-rural home, I yearn for people and movement and being lost in the crowd.</p> <p>I have tried to walk every street of Buenos Aires. It\u2019s a foolish quest. There are 2,154 of them, according to one local author, and combined they must measure thousands of miles. But the kindest way for a foreigner to own a city is arguably to walk it. Conquest as reconnaissance. When I first bought a Lumi guidebook \u2013 a street map of the capital \u2013 I was struck by the regularity of the grid of streets, as well as its immensity. So, unlike England, with its medieval town plans, curves and cul-de-sacs, BA beckoned like a maze.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"267822043cb177615929f471547193e13d68b8fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/267822043cb177615929f471547193e13d68b8fa/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Palace of National Congress on Avenida Rivadavia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Palace of National Congress on Avenida Rivadavia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But as I wandered ever further from the centre \u2013 along Avenida Rivadavia, at 23 miles the longest street in the city, turned north into working-class Saavedra and down to El Sur, BA\u2019s southside, associated with tango legends but also a bit sketchy and shabby \u2013 I couldn\u2019t help but wonder at the cliched claim that this is \u201cthe most European\u201d city in South America. I saw a very Latin American reality: squat, functional terraces, shanties and high-rises predominated. Yet something in the juxtaposition of old and new, burnished and broken, beautiful and bland, beguiled.</p> <p>Guidebooks were too literal. What I needed was a native to help me decode the metropolis. I found one in an author known outside Argentina as a master of conundrum and enigma.</p> <p>I\u2019d first come across Jorge Luis Borges in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/23/caspar-henderson-rereading-jorge-luis-borges\">The Book of Imaginary Beings</a> as a teenager. In BA, his name was dropped all the time, and not only in literary circles. The handsome, sober-jacketed hardbacks of publisher Emec\u00e9\u2019s complete works stood firmly at the centre of the \u201cArgentinian Literature\u201d sections in city bookshops. Photographs of him often appeared in the newspapers. An arts centre bearing his name sits incongruously in the corner of a downtown shopping mall.</p> <p>Borges is best known for his Ficciones short-story collection, but it was his poems that provided me with epiphanies on my walks. At the simplest level they helped me decode the built environment. The opening lines of \u201cThe Streets\u201d, which opens his first collection, 1923\u2019s Fervour of Buenos Aires, are \u201cMy soul is in the streets/of Buenos Aires\u201d. The poem tells how he identifies not with the city centre but with the \u201cneighbourhood streets where nothing is happening\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04643c32a1dfdd1eec3c513581590bb5cc6b043e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04643c32a1dfdd1eec3c513581590bb5cc6b043e/150_315_3233_1940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jorge Luis Borges on the terrace of his house.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jorge Luis Borges on the terrace of his house.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MP/Leemage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Borges was a serious fl\u00e2neur, making epic wanderings like a modern psychogeographer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He uses words derived from Arabic that evoke Andaluc\u00eda. I was seeing, through Borges, an old world in the new world. In a poem titled El Patio, a simple courtyard becomes \u201cheaven\u2019s watercourse\u2026 the slope/Down which the sky flows into the house\u201d. Borges was a serious fl\u00e2neur, making epic wanderings like a modern psychogeographer. He notes \u201cthe drab houses, the crude banisters, the doorknockers\u201d \u2013 of tourist-free suburbs such as Caballito, Pompeya and Villa Ort\u00fazar \u2013 but in the silver light of evening finds them \u201cvivid as a verse\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Lockdown has made me nostalgic \u2013 not about travelling so much as about places. It\u2019s no surprise the focus of some of my fondest remembering has been the world capital of looking back: Buenos Aires. The reasons behind this are many and complex. Porte\u00f1os \u2013 BA residents \u2013 are famously given to looking far away, to the Spain or Italy of their ancestors, and to romanticising the brief belle \u00e9poque of the early 20th century, when Argentina was rich and promising. Tango is laced with longing for the missed and elusive. I lived there for a decade and have revisited every year during the two decades since. This has inevitably made my nostalgia layered, but more than anything I miss walking, roaming the Argentinian capital. Now, incarcerated in my English semi-rural home, I yearn for people and movement and being lost in the crowd. I have tried to walk every street of Buenos Aires. It\u2019s a foolish quest. There are 2,154 of them, according to one local author, and combined they must measure thousands of miles. But the kindest way for a foreigner to own a city is arguably to walk it. Conquest as reconnaissance. When I first bought a Lumi guidebook \u2013 a street map of the capital \u2013 I was struck by the regularity of the grid of streets, as well as its immensity. So, unlike England, with its medieval town plans, curves and cul-de-sacs, BA beckoned like a maze. But as I wandered ever further from the centre \u2013 along Avenida Rivadavia, at 23 miles the longest street in the city, turned north into working-class Saavedra and down to El Sur, BA\u2019s southside, associated with tango legends but also a bit sketchy and shabby \u2013 I couldn\u2019t help but wonder at the cliched claim that this is \u201cthe most European\u201d city in South America. I saw a very Latin American reality: squat, functional terraces, shanties and high-rises predominated. Yet something in the juxtaposition of old and new, burnished and broken, beautiful and bland, beguiled. Guidebooks were too literal. What I needed was a native to help me decode the metropolis. I found one in an author known outside Argentina as a master of conundrum and enigma. I\u2019d first come across Jorge Luis Borges in The Book of Imaginary Beings as a teenager. In BA, his name was dropped all the time, and not only in literary circles. The handsome, sober-jacketed hardbacks of publisher Emec\u00e9\u2019s complete works stood firmly at the centre of the \u201cArgentinian Literature\u201d sections in city bookshops. Photographs of him often appeared in the newspapers. An arts centre bearing his name sits incongruously in the corner of a downtown shopping mall. Borges is best known for his Ficciones short-story collection, but it was his poems that provided me with epiphanies on my walks. At the simplest level they helped me decode the built environment. The opening lines of \u201cThe Streets\u201d, which opens his first collection, 1923\u2019s Fervour of Buenos Aires, are \u201cMy soul is in the streets/of Buenos Aires\u201d. The poem tells how he identifies not with the city centre but with the \u201cneighbourhood streets where nothing is happening\u201d. He uses words derived from Arabic that evoke Andaluc\u00eda. I was seeing, through Borges, an old world in the new world. In a poem titled El Patio, a simple courtyard becomes \u201cheaven\u2019s watercourse\u2026 the slope/Down which the sky flows into the house\u201d. Borges was a serious fl\u00e2neur, making epic wanderings like a modern psychogeographer. He notes \u201cthe drab houses, the crude banisters, the doorknockers\u201d \u2013 of tourist-free suburbs such as Caballito, Pompeya and Villa Ort\u00fazar \u2013 but in the silver light of evening finds them \u201cvivid as a verse\u201d. The plainest streets are as profound and generous as poetry. The title of Borges\u2019s second poetry collection, Moon Across the Way (1925), captures how Buenos Aires was expanding westward, away from the River Plate estuary. If you walked to the edge of the built-up area you would, eventually, come to a street that looked over the pampas. In his next collection, San Mart\u00edn Copybook (1929), his beautiful and oft-quoted poem The Mythical Foundation of Buenos Aires ends: A cigar store perfumed the desert like a rose. The afternoon had established its yesterdays, and men took on together an illusory past. Only one thing was missing \u2013 the street had no other side. Hard to believe Buenos Aires had any beginning; it feels as eternal as air and water. Like many city dwellers, Borges laments the passing of what once was: \u201cOur image of the city is always slightly out of date. Cafes have degenerated into bar-rooms; old arched entranceways with their grilled inner gates, once giving us a glimpse of patios and of overhanging grapevines, are now dingy corridors... that lead abruptly to an elevator.\u201d On my ramblings, I was always looking out for the old, the low-slung, the elegantly faded. Such craving for the picturesque came partly from being a foreigner but it also, over time, turned me into a bit of a porte\u00f1o \u2013 prone to idealising the past, imagined or real. As with the stories, Borges loads his verse with classical allusions and speculative meditations. By treating Buenos Aires as palimpsest and puzzle, he turns a walk into an investigation, and makes the 500-year-old city as mysterious and captivating as any ancient archaeological site. Walking a great city can be a balm to the soul: it makes us engage at different levels, rediscover the familiar, and ourselves. In one of the short essays on 19th-century poet Evaristo Carriego (1930), Borges writes: \u201cBuenos Aires is deep, and never have I, disillusioned or suffering, given myself over to its streets without receiving some unexpected consolation, whether from feeling unreality, from guitars at the back of a patio, or from contact with other lives.\u201d Buenos Aires made sense of the poems, which in turn made sense of the city. Now, several years and an ocean away, in the strange new nostalgia imposed by coronavirus, I can reread poems and evoke the city, and its layers of time and memory.

For years, in his newspaper letters and public appearances, Britain\u2019s most celebrated living painter has doubled as Big Tobacco\u2019s greatest asset: a militant smoker who has become only more valuable as smoking bans have proliferated, health warnings intensified, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/25/health/in-unforgettable-final-act-a-king-got-revenge-on-his-killers.html\">less fortunate</a> famous smokers died prematurely.

Shortly before it made space for Hockney\u2019s latest tribute to tobacco, the <em>Daily Mail</em> had referred to 5G conspiracy theorists as \u201ccoronavirus cranks\u201d; it <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8267993/Groups-sow-doubt-COVID-vaccine-one-exists.html\">warned</a>, correctly, that \u201canti-vaxxers are already peddling bizarre theories about Covid-19 vaccine BEFORE it even exists\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"31cf94c87095c0563cc91b8829481b53645171eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31cf94c87095c0563cc91b8829481b53645171eb/0_0_4096_2861/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Hockney\u2019s recent work depicts the consolations of nature in springtime.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"698\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Hockney\u2019s recent work depicts the consolations of nature in springtime.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hockney</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it\u2019s easy to forget that the <em>Mail</em> is edited by someone who, when he\u2019s not supervising the paper\u2019s war on lefties and foreigners (\u201cDid <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8163427/Did-Michel-Barnier-infect-PM-EUs-Brexit-negotiator-Downing-Streets-Patient-Zero.html\">Michel Barnier </a> infect Boris Johnson?\u201d), tireless persecution of luvvies and \u2013 most unforgivable \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7408771/Remoaner-luvvies-HYSTERICAL-outbursts-anti-Boris-weeping-wailing.html\">\u201cremoaner </a><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7408771/Remoaner-luvvies-HYSTERICAL-outbursts-anti-Boris-weeping-wailing.html\">luvvies\u201d</a>, lives for art. Or, at any rate, its most eminent older creators. Geordie Greig, the former boon companion of, among others, Lucian Freud and VS Naipaul, is a close friend of Hockney. Perhaps naturally, he sympathised with the painter\u2019s indignation on having to have his thoughts published in the <em>Mail</em>, rather than the <em>Guardian</em>.</p> <p>\u201cDavid Hockney accuses newspaper of censorship,\u201d ran the Mail headline. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking,\u201d Hockney told Greig, in a <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8328825/David-Hockney-gets-animated-Artist-82-accuses-Guardian-censorship.html\">story</a> eagerly tweeted by the industry-funded Forest, \u201cthat their agenda doesn\u2019t allow them to engage in open debate on this.\u201d</p> <p>Nor, he might have added, is he alone, as an unconventional health thinker, in being subjected to this sort of disrespectful treatment. As Index on Censorship will be aware, <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2020/04/how-celebrities-became-biggest-peddlers-5g-conspiracy-theory-coronavirus-covid-19\">groundbreaking speculation</a> of all kinds has been marginalised if not effectively suppressed during this crisis, for no better reason than it might be injurious to life. Donald Trump was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/trump-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus-claims-reaction\">denied serious examination</a> of the protective properties of injected bleach, the martyrdom of <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-david-icke-facebook-page-removed-over-covid-19-conspiracy-theories-11981821\">David Icke</a> continues, the musician MIA was dropped by <em>Vogue</em> (for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/22/mia-claims-british-vogue-pulled-article-about-her-over-anti-vax-comments\">preferring death</a> to vaccines), the self-styled rule-breaker <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52358920\">Eamonn Holmes</a> is neutered by Ofcom. And unlike Hockney\u2019s, their alleged censors can\u2019t invariably cite decades of research proving their proposals would kill millions of people. Though, if I understand him in the <em>Mail</em>, cigarette-related benefits and casualties are alike irrelevant to his main point, a firm rejection of Housman\u2019s \u201cAnd since to look at things in bloom/Fifty springs are little room\u201d. Hockney informs the medical establishment: \u201cIt is the intensity of life that counts, not longevity.\u201d</p> <p>It may do little to mollify the artist, but any less eminent smoker would long ago have lost credibility on this particular theme, well before Covid-19 denied many of his contemporaries one last sight of blossom.</p> <p>\u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist</p>",

Shortly before it made space for Hockney\u2019s latest tribute to tobacco, the Daily Mail had referred to 5G conspiracy theorists as \u201ccoronavirus cranks\u201d; it warned, correctly, that \u201canti-vaxxers are already peddling bizarre theories about Covid-19 vaccine BEFORE it even exists\u201d. But it\u2019s easy to forget that the Mail is edited by someone who, when he\u2019s not supervising the paper\u2019s war on lefties and foreigners (\u201cDid Michel Barnier infect Boris Johnson?\u201d), tireless persecution of luvvies and \u2013 most unforgivable \u2013 \u201cremoaner luvvies\u201d, lives for art. Or, at any rate, its most eminent older creators. Geordie Greig, the former boon companion of, among others, Lucian Freud and VS Naipaul, is a close friend of Hockney. Perhaps naturally, he sympathised with the painter\u2019s indignation on having to have his thoughts published in the Mail, rather than the Guardian. \u201cDavid Hockney accuses newspaper of censorship,\u201d ran the Mail headline. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking,\u201d Hockney told Greig, in a story eagerly tweeted by the industry-funded Forest, \u201cthat their agenda doesn\u2019t allow them to engage in open debate on this.\u201d Nor, he might have added, is he alone, as an unconventional health thinker, in being subjected to this sort of disrespectful treatment. As Index on Censorship will be aware, groundbreaking speculation of all kinds has been marginalised if not effectively suppressed during this crisis, for no better reason than it might be injurious to life. Donald Trump was denied serious examination of the protective properties of injected bleach, the martyrdom of David Icke continues, the musician MIA was dropped by Vogue (for preferring death to vaccines), the self-styled rule-breaker Eamonn Holmes is neutered by Ofcom. And unlike Hockney\u2019s, their alleged censors can\u2019t invariably cite decades of research proving their proposals would kill millions of people. Though, if I understand him in the Mail, cigarette-related benefits and casualties are alike irrelevant to his main point, a firm rejection of Housman\u2019s \u201cAnd since to look at things in bloom/Fifty springs are little room\u201d. Hockney informs the medical establishment: \u201cIt is the intensity of life that counts, not longevity.\u201d It may do little to mollify the artist, but any less eminent smoker would long ago have lost credibility on this particular theme, well before Covid-19 denied many of his contemporaries one last sight of blossom. \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>Almost all of us will have missed out on something important in the last few weeks. My lockdown low was missing my niece\u2019s first birthday, a virtual singalong no substitute for a real cuddle. But celebrations and holidays can be postponed; children and young people are missing out on rites of passage they will never get back: their last day at primary school with the class they\u2019ve grown up with; the end of GCSE and A-level parties; their final term at university.</p> <p>Autumn is unlikely to herald a return to normality. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/19/cambridge-university-moves-all-lectures-online-until-summer-2021\">Cambridge Universit</a>y announced that it was moving all of its large-group teaching online for the whole of the next academic year; others are likely to follow. So many of the events that make up university life will also have to likely go: freshers\u2019 fairs; sports, music and drama; student parties. Little wonder that one in five prospective students say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/20/uk-universities-facing-760m-hit-one-in-five-students-plan-defer\">they are considering deferring</a>.</p> <p>There has so far been no sign of a fee reduction; most full-time students in England will still be paying the maximum \u00a39,250 a year in tuition. It\u2019s hard not to sympathise with this take from a second-year student: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/20/very-very-upsetting-students-face-tough-decisions-over-university\">We\u2019re paying a lot of money to jump on a Zoom call</a>.\u201d Because repayment of student debt is income contingent and written off after 30 years, <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/R162-Education-spending-in-England-2019.pdf\">the government will end up </a>contributing around 45% of the cost of each cohort\u2019s tuition over their lifetime, possibly more depending on the length and depth of the recession. That\u2019s scant consolation, though, for a young person about to graduate in a fearsomely hostile labour market, facing decades of monthly repayments once they start earning above the threshold.</p> <p>But if it is rough to be contemplating a first year peppered with virtual lectures and minus a freshers\u2019 week, it is worse still to be a school leaver not going to university, who has lost their last term and had to make do with predicted A-level or BTec grades. These young people get a raw deal at the best of times: while university students\u2019 education and living costs are subsidised to the tune of \u00a325,000 on average, most of them don\u2019t get a fraction of that. </p> <p>They also get none of the state and institutional support with the social transition to adulthood that those going away to university do: the relatively frictionless glide into student accommodation followed by a house share; the mental health services and pastoral care; the self-discovery opportunities of student social life. No extended adolescence awaits them: too often a move straight into work that lacks training opportunities and prospects for progression, while feeling their own way towards independent living, with profound impacts for social inequality.

      "bodyText": "Almost all of us will have missed out on something important in the last few weeks. My lockdown low was missing my niece\u2019s first birthday, a virtual singalong no substitute for a real cuddle. But celebrations and holidays can be postponed; children and young people are missing out on rites of passage they will never get back: their last day at primary school with the class they\u2019ve grown up with; the end of GCSE and A-level parties; their final term at university. Autumn is unlikely to herald a return to normality. Last week, Cambridge University announced that it was moving all of its large-group teaching online for the whole of the next academic year; others are likely to follow. So many of the events that make up university life will also have to likely go: freshers\u2019 fairs; sports, music and drama; student parties. Little wonder that one in five prospective students say they are considering deferring. There has so far been no sign of a fee reduction; most full-time students in England will still be paying the maximum \u00a39,250 a year in tuition. It\u2019s hard not to sympathise with this take from a second-year student: \u201cWe\u2019re paying a lot of money to jump on a Zoom call.\u201d Because repayment of student debt is income contingent and written off after 30 years, the government will end up contributing around 45% of the cost of each cohort\u2019s tuition over their lifetime, possibly more depending on the length and depth of the recession.

      "body": "<p>The recent struggles of Formula One once more contorting itself over budget cap disagreements have illustrated the fierce, often hostile, rivalry that is an almost inexorable current flowing through the sport. With the budget-cap changes finally agreed, F1\u2019s focus now is on the calendar \u2013 and resuming those rivalries \u2013 so it is perhaps worth noting there was ample evidence as the coronavirus outbreak engulfed the world of just what a remarkable force the sport can be when it bends its collective will to a single purpose.</p> <p>Galvanised by the British government\u2019s call for ventilators, F1\u2019s response, requiring teams to dismiss both secrecy and enmity, might have seemed unlikely. Yet for the man at the heart of the operation it was no surprise that when it mattered the sport delivered a triumph of camaraderie over competitive instinct.</p> <p>Two days after the Australian Grand Prix <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/formula-one-australian-grand-prix-melbourne-coronavirus\">was cancelled</a> on 13 March, Mark Gillan, the chief technology officer of Innovate UK \u2013 a publicly funded agency promoting research and development \u2013 called F1\u2019s chief technical officer, Pat Symonds, to discuss how the sport might adapt to meet the needs of the NHS. Three days later, a virtual meeting with the seven teams based in the UK was held and Project Pitlane \u2013 a collective effort to meet the ventilator crisis \u2013 was in motion.</p> <p>It has been remarkably effective. Within 10 days the continuous positive airway pressure device (CPAP) had been reverse-engineered, designed, tested and approved. A month later, 10,000 of them had been built and shipped. During the same period, the Penlon ventilator, built in collaboration with a consortium, had been re-engineered from scratch to allow it to be manufactured at speed, tested and approved. Manufacture of 15,000 is now in progress at a rate of 1,500 a week, where previously production capacity had been at 50-60.</p> <p>Gillan had enjoyed a long career in F1. He began with McLaren in 1998, moving on to Jaguar, Red Bull and Toyota before becoming chief operations engineer at Williams. His final year with the team was in 2012 \u2013 the last season when they won a race \u2013 and he had cause to remember it as he considered asking F1 to stand together.</p> <p>\u201cAfter Pastor Maldonado won in Spain we had a fire in the garage and we lost about 90% of our equipment,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember preparing for the next round in Monaco, thinking: \u2018This is going to be really hard.\u2019 But without even having to ask, the other teams collectively supported us with their equipment, all the kit. We ended up on the grid thanks to them, so the enthusiasm for Project Pitlane did not surprise me in the least.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b01f261f6e0db66bdc385f28cb7097f58d0d1ca1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b01f261f6e0db66bdc385f28cb7097f58d0d1ca1/105_287_3229_1938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The continuous positive airway pressure device designed by F1 engineers that can help keep Covid-19 patients out of intensive care.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The continuous positive airway pressure device designed by F1 engineers that can help keep Covid-19 patients out of intensive care.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daimler AG</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gillan has been in his post at Innovate only since January but when the need for ventilators was clear he knew F1 could contribute. \u201cF1\u2019s strengths are pace, teamwork and the ability to rapidly manufacture complex systems in tight timelines and take on board new ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are also very good at competitive analysis, looking at a complex system, understanding how to reverse-engineer it and make it.\u201d</p> <p>Daily virtual meetings began to harness these skills at every UK-based team, with Mercedes, Red Bull, Renault, Williams, McLaren, Racing Point and Haas volunteering enthusiastically. They coordinated with clinicians to identify targets, with the feedback on the effects of Covid-19 providing a constant reminder of how important the work was.</p> <p>Andy Cowell, the managing director of Mercedes AMG High-Performance Powertrains, which manufactures the team\u2019s engines, led their work on CPAP where engine bays were converted to become a life-saving production line and the F1 mindset adapted.</p> <p>\u201cThere was absolutely no competition, it was pure collaboration,\u201d he says. \u201cWe would all talk about what we knew and what we were doing, a huge amount of collaboration and open information sharing. Now we have staff members more proud of the fact that they have made something that is helping covid patients than they are of winning races. It\u2019s a remarkable, emotional feeling for the people who have worked on it and the whole company.\u201d</p> <p>What was notable was the unreserved extent to which the teams came together, the formerly sacrosanct access to their factories now open to one another. A truce was declared as the frontline of their battle shifted to face the virus.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was nice to see the various team shirts operating in different sites</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe had multiple teams operating in different facilities,\u201d says Gillan. \u201cIt was nice to see the various team shirts operating in different sites. Great credit to them for the way they were able to operate and push aside traditional competitiveness to drive at this single goal.\u201d</p> <p>Every team was involved. Mercedes were the lead on CPAP while Red Bull and Renault worked alongside one another to develop the BlueSky device.

      "bodyText": "The recent struggles of Formula One once more contorting itself over budget cap disagreements have illustrated the fierce, often hostile, rivalry that is an almost inexorable current flowing through the sport. With the budget-cap changes finally agreed, F1\u2019s focus now is on the calendar \u2013 and resuming those rivalries \u2013 so it is perhaps worth noting there was ample evidence as the coronavirus outbreak engulfed the world of just what a remarkable force the sport can be when it bends its collective will to a single purpose. Galvanised by the British government\u2019s call for ventilators, F1\u2019s response, requiring teams to dismiss both secrecy and enmity, might have seemed unlikely. Yet for the man at the heart of the operation it was no surprise that when it mattered the sport delivered a triumph of camaraderie over competitive instinct. Two days after the Australian Grand Prix was cancelled on 13 March, Mark Gillan, the chief technology officer of Innovate UK \u2013 a publicly funded agency promoting research and development \u2013 called F1\u2019s chief technical officer, Pat Symonds, to discuss how the sport might adapt to meet the needs of the NHS. Three days later, a virtual meeting with the seven teams based in the UK was held and Project Pitlane \u2013 a collective effort to meet the ventilator crisis \u2013 was in motion. It has been remarkably effective. Within 10 days the continuous positive airway pressure device (CPAP) had been reverse-engineered, designed, tested and approved. A month later, 10,000 of them had been built and shipped. During the same period, the Penlon ventilator, built in collaboration with a consortium, had been re-engineered from scratch to allow it to be manufactured at speed, tested and approved. Manufacture of 15,000 is now in progress at a rate of 1,500 a week, where previously production capacity had been at 50-60. Gillan had enjoyed a long career in F1. He began with McLaren in 1998, moving on to Jaguar, Red Bull and Toyota before becoming chief operations engineer at Williams. His final year with the team was in 2012 \u2013 the last season when they won a race \u2013 and he had cause to remember it as he considered asking F1 to stand together. \u201cAfter Pastor Maldonado won in Spain we had a fire in the garage and we lost about 90% of our equipment,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember preparing for the next round in Monaco, thinking: \u2018This is going to be really hard.\u2019 But without even having to ask, the other teams collectively supported us with their equipment, all the kit. We ended up on the grid thanks to them, so the enthusiasm for Project Pitlane did not surprise me in the least.\u201d Gillan has been in his post at Innovate only since January but when the need for ventilators was clear he knew F1 could contribute. \u201cF1\u2019s strengths are pace, teamwork and the ability to rapidly manufacture complex systems in tight timelines and take on board new ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are also very good at competitive analysis, looking at a complex system, understanding how to reverse-engineer it and make it.\u201d Daily virtual meetings began to harness these skills at every UK-based team, with Mercedes, Red Bull, Renault, Williams, McLaren, Racing Point and Haas volunteering enthusiastically. They coordinated with clinicians to identify targets, with the feedback on the effects of Covid-19 providing a constant reminder of how important the work was. Andy Cowell, the managing director of Mercedes AMG High-Performance Powertrains, which manufactures the team\u2019s engines, led their work on CPAP where engine bays were converted to become a life-saving production line and the F1 mindset adapted. \u201cThere was absolutely no competition, it was pure collaboration,\u201d he says. \u201cWe would all talk about what we knew and what we were doing, a huge amount of collaboration and open information sharing. Now we have staff members more proud of the fact that they have made something that is helping covid patients than they are of winning races. It\u2019s a remarkable, emotional feeling for the people who have worked on it and the whole company.\u201d What was notable was the unreserved extent to which the teams came together, the formerly sacrosanct access to their factories now open to one another. A truce was declared as the frontline of their battle shifted to face the virus. \u201cWe had multiple teams operating in different facilities,\u201d says Gillan. \u201cIt was nice to see the various team shirts operating in different sites. Great credit to them for the way they were able to operate and push aside traditional competitiveness to drive at this single goal.\u201d Every team was involved. Mercedes were the lead on CPAP while Red Bull and Renault worked alongside one another to develop the BlueSky device. The latter went from a design proposal on the bench at Red Bull to submission for medical approval in just three and a half weeks. BlueSky was deemed a success although, with the understanding of treating the virus having changed at that point, not put into production. Teams also used their extensive supply chains to source materials and equipment. It was, as Gillan stresses, a truly collective effort and while rivalries will begin anew and the politicking continues, for now Project Pitlane should be lauded as the time F1 put it all aside and did the right thing. \u201cWe brought highly competitive teams used to fighting each other day-in, day -out together,\u201d says Gillan. \u201cBut there were no egos. There was no them and us. It was fantastic to see.\u201d",

Instead of communal prayers at mosques or in the open air, large gatherings of family, friends and neighbours, and outings to enjoy special street lights and festivities, many of the world\u2019s two billion Muslims will be in lockdown. Some countries have imposed curfews, and religious authorities have told people to pray at home.</p> <p>In Iran, the centre of the pandemic in the Middle East, there has been a fresh surge in Covid cases since the government began lifting restrictions, allowing people back to work in mid-April and to communal prayers at mosques in the first week of May.</p> <p>Critics said moves to reopen the economy had been made before critical benchmarks indicatingthe spread of the disease had been brought under control were met. Official Covid figures \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/iran/\">7,300 dead and almost 132,000 infected</a> \u2013 are widely thought to be an underestimate, and the government has been criticised for its response to the outbreak, which began in mid-February.</p> <p>Since the new surge in cases in a number of provinces, including Tehran, the president Hassan Rouhani cancelled Eid prayers led by Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. But he has permitted prayers to be held outside some mosques with physical distancing.</p> <p>Last week health minister Saeed Namaki appealed to Iranians to avoid travelling during Eid. \u201cSuch trips mean new cases of infection \u2026 people should not travel to and from high-risk areas,\u201d Namaki said.,.</p> <p>\u201cSome 90% of the population in many areas has not yet contracted the disease. In the case of a new outbreak, it will be very difficult for me and my colleagues to control it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In Pakistan, where more than 10% of the world\u2019s Muslim population live, there has also been an increase in the number of infectionsfollowing a recent lifting of lockdown. The government has urged people to act responsibly over the country\u2019s six-day Eid holiday, but has not announced any special precautions.</p> <p>Celebrations were expected to be muted anyway after a plane crash in Karachi on Friday which killed at least 97 people. Flight PK8303 had been carrying many families travelling for Eid when it plunged into a residential neighbourhood near Jinnah International airport.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has ordered a 24-hour curfew over Eid, an extension to the current overnight curfew between 5pm and 9am.

Last week health minister Saeed Namaki appealed to Iranians to avoid travelling during Eid. \u201cSuch trips mean new cases of infection \u2026 people should not travel to and from high-risk areas,\u201d Namaki said.,. \u201cSome 90% of the population in many areas has not yet contracted the disease. In the case of a new outbreak, it will be very difficult for me and my colleagues to control it,\u201d he said. In Pakistan, where more than 10% of the world\u2019s Muslim population live, there has also been an increase in the number of infectionsfollowing a recent lifting of lockdown. The government has urged people to act responsibly over the country\u2019s six-day Eid holiday, but has not announced any special precautions. Celebrations were expected to be muted anyway after a plane crash in Karachi on Friday which killed at least 97 people. Flight PK8303 had been carrying many families travelling for Eid when it plunged into a residential neighbourhood near Jinnah International airport. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has ordered a 24-hour curfew over Eid, an extension to the current overnight curfew between 5pm and 9am. Egypt is also implementing a longer overnight curfew during the festival, starting at 5pm instead of 9pm, and ending at 6am, and Turkey has ordered a nationwide lockdown starting on the eve of Eid. The Saudi grand mufti urged Muslims to pray at home. \u201cIt is permissible to perform the Eid al-Fitr prayer at home under exceptional circumstances similar to the current pandemic situation,\u201d said Sheikh Abdulaziz al-Sheikh The council of senior scholars at Al Azhar university in Cairo, Egypt\u2019s main religious authority, also said Eid prayers should be conducted at home in accordance with the Islamic injunction to preserve lives. Restaurants, cafes and parks will remain closed over the holiday. In Gaza, where there have only been 55 cases of Covid infection after the government ordered strict quarantine for those testing positive, mosques will be partially reopened for Eid prayers. Those praying inside mosques have been told to maintain distance from each other, bring their own prayer mats and wear face masks. Older people and children are urged to pray at home. In the UK, the Muslim Council of Britain and the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board have said Eid must be celebrated at home. Qari Asim, an imam in Leeds, said: \u201cThe Eid prayer is something that Muslims look forward to all year long. However, with mosques remaining closed in line with government guidance, no Eid prayer will take place in mosques or open spaces, public parks. \u201cThis is extremely challenging and distressing for us. There is a palpable sense of sadness in the community given that usually mosques are jam-packed with people. Not being able to be with our loved ones this Eid will be painful but we\u2019ve all got to just get through this in the best way we can.\u201d Additional reporting by Jassar Al-Tahat",

Justice and equality are \u201cthe fundamental basis of any state\u201d, and inequality, being a kind of injustice, is potent grounds for challenging that state. \u201cThe lesser rebel in order to be equal, the equal in order to be greater. These then are conditions predisposing to revolution,\u201d Aristotle declared.</p> <p>Amid epidemic uncertainty, two things are clear. First, the virus is universal and ubiquitous \u2013 a threat to all humankind.

JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, called the pandemic \u201ca wake-up call \u2026 for business and government to think, act and invest for the common good\u201d. This sounds almost socialistic.<br><br>A revolutionary agenda for the post-pandemic world also includes meaningful steps to address poverty and the north-south wealth gap, more urgent approaches to linked climate, energy, water and mass extinction crises and, for example, the adoption of so-called <a href=\"https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/\">doughnut </a><a href=\"https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/\">economics</a> that measures prosperity by counting shared social, health and environmental benefits, not GDP growth.<br><br>It may seem like pie in the sky. But so too did the idea of millions working from home, and halting road and air travel, until it happened almost overnight. Whether recognised as such or not, this is a revolutionary manifesto that, if it is pursued \u2013 as a growing body of opinion believes it must be \u2013 will demand the utter transformation of current political behaviour and organisation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/18/revolution-history-fight-back-coronavirus-policies-vulnerable\">There is revolution in the air now, but history shows the old order will fight back | Nesrine Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the US, the increasing lawlessness of the Trump plutocracy, coupled with its high-handed pandemic response, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/12/trump-electoral-college-2020-election-popular-vote\">exposed the inadequacy</a> of democratic checks and balances created more than 200 years ago. What\u2019s required now is a second American revolution \u2013 and a fresh constitutional convention that demolishes anachronisms such as the electoral college, makes democracy work for all, and refocuses on constructive global engagement.<br><br>In Britain, centralised, top-down mismanagement of the pandemic has underscored a crisis of representative governance and national cohesion. To survive as a United Kingdom, an insurgent moment akin to the Great Reform Act of 1832 is needed. In Europe, too, the EU <em>ancien regime</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/coronavirus-could-be-final-straw-for-eu-european-experts-warn\">must remake itself</a> or else risk overthrow by populist-nationalist <em>sans-culottes</em>.<br><br>Nor may authoritarian oligarchies such as China and Russia, weaned on violent rebellion, continue on their self-aggrandising, quasi-imperialist path if repeat conflagrations are to be avoided.

These then are conditions predisposing to revolution,\u201d Aristotle declared. Amid epidemic uncertainty, two things are clear. First, the virus is universal and ubiquitous \u2013 a threat to all humankind. Second, its impacts are deeply unequal, decisively determined by social class, race, ethnicity, income, nutrition, education, living conditions and geographical location as well as by gender and age. It follows that the large, unjust societal inequalities found both within and between wealthy and developing countries and ruthlessly exposed by the virus are just as powerfully insurrectionary in nature today as when Aristotle first pondered them or when Marie-Antoinette told starving peasants to eat cake. The danger that entrenched inequality poses to hopes of weathering the Covid storm without chaotic upheavals was recently debated by the tsars of modern American capitalism. \u201cThis is our chance to do the right thing,\u201d by reducing income disparities, said top investor Mark Cuban. Ray Dalio, a hedge-fund billionaire, described inequality as a national emergency. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a situation where people have opportunity, you\u2019re not only failing to tap all the potential that exists, which is uneconomic, you\u2019re threatening the existence of the system,\u201d Dalio said. JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, called the pandemic \u201ca wake-up call \u2026 for business and government to think, act and invest for the common good\u201d. This sounds almost socialistic. A revolutionary agenda for the post-pandemic world also includes meaningful steps to address poverty and the north-south wealth gap, more urgent approaches to linked climate, energy, water and mass extinction crises and, for example, the adoption of so-called doughnut economics that measures prosperity by counting shared social, health and environmental benefits, not GDP growth. It may seem like pie in the sky. But so too did the idea of millions working from home, and halting road and air travel, until it happened almost overnight. Whether recognised as such or not, this is a revolutionary manifesto that, if it is pursued \u2013 as a growing body of opinion believes it must be \u2013 will demand the utter transformation of current political behaviour and organisation. In the US, the increasing lawlessness of the Trump plutocracy, coupled with its high-handed pandemic response, has exposed the inadequacy of democratic checks and balances created more than 200 years ago. What\u2019s required now is a second American revolution \u2013 and a fresh constitutional convention that demolishes anachronisms such as the electoral college, makes democracy work for all, and refocuses on constructive global engagement. In Britain, centralised, top-down mismanagement of the pandemic has underscored a crisis of representative governance and national cohesion. To survive as a United Kingdom, an insurgent moment akin to the Great Reform Act of 1832 is needed. In Europe, too, the EU ancien regime must remake itself or else risk overthrow by populist-nationalist sans-culottes. Nor may authoritarian oligarchies such as China and Russia, weaned on violent rebellion, continue on their self-aggrandising, quasi-imperialist path if repeat conflagrations are to be avoided. To forge the necessary consensus for this born-again world, it\u2019s time to reboot the United Nations, revive the idealism of the 1945 San Francisco founding conference, and rekindle that transformative vision of humankind working in concert to defeat common evils. As Aristotle might have said, the revolution starts here.",

The episodes, which aired in prime time on ESPN before their next-day release internationally on Netflix, became weekly appointment television throughout the past month and a half,<a href=\"https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2020/05/espn-sees-the-last-dance-audience-skyrocket-with-time-shifted-on-demand-viewing-now-averaging-more-than-12-8-million-viewers-per-episode-up-128-from-premieres/\"> averaging 5.648 million viewers</a> (and<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-29/-the-last-dance-overtakes-tiger-king-as-world-s-top-documentary\"> reportedly unseating</a> <em>Tiger King </em>as the world\u2019s most in-demand documentary).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bebd130054d288bcb4bdd34610b6a92d7622610\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bebd130054d288bcb4bdd34610b6a92d7622610/0_0_3598_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Then NBA commissioner David Stern presents Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls the championship trophy after the Bulls defeated the Phoenix Suns in game six of the 1993 NBA finals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Then NBA commissioner David Stern presents Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls the championship trophy after the Bulls defeated the Phoenix Suns in game six of the 1993 NBA finals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew D Bernstein/NBAE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>The Last Dance</em> ostensibly tells the story of Jordan\u2019s titular, tumultuous final season with the Bulls and his monomaniacal pursuit of excellence on the hardwood, but the panoramic canvas allows for lengthy detours and richly drawn sidebars that never feel extraneous. Jordan\u2019s own trajectory from baby-faced amateur to larger-than-life symbol to latter-day myth is exhaustively retold through a stylish blend of archival footage, present-day interviews and spare-no-expense soundtrack.</p> <p>Lengthy segments are, however, devoted to the other principals in Jordan\u2019s orbit: Scottie Pippen, the famed wingman and lone constant aside from Jordan on all six of Chicago\u2019s title teams; Dennis Rodman, the free-spirited, hard-partying rebounding machine; Phil Jackson, the hippie-mystic head coach whose triangle offense helped unlock the team\u2019s potential.</p> <p>But the star of the piece is Jordan, who after all these years remains both overexposed and mysterious: at once the most prominent cultural reference point the United States has ever produced and something of a recluse who has spoken only sparingly about the Bulls\u2019 imperious reign and still-mystifying break-up at the height of their powers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s maddening because I felt like we could have won seven, I really believe that,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cWe may not have, but man, just not to be able to try, that\u2019s something that I just can\u2019t accept.\u201d</p> <p>Before what proved to be the team\u2019s last season together \u2013 a sixth and final championship run \u2013 Jordan allowed the NBA\u2019s in-house entertainment division to film what became more than 500 hours of behind-the-scenes footage of them with the condition that it could only be used with his explicit consent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdf06ef77a38c203b444006a88c8802606b9d0fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdf06ef77a38c203b444006a88c8802606b9d0fd/0_0_5353_3569/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Barack Obama presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Michael Jordan at the White House in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Barack Obama presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Michael Jordan at the White House in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It does bear mentioning that Jordan\u2019s own production company is among the co-producers behind the project and he retained final cut and editorial control. Even while introducing the less pleasant elements of Jordan\u2019s legacy \u2013 his bullying and tyrannical proclivities with teammates and well-documented gambling problem (or, as he puts it, a <em>competition</em> problem) \u2013 the warts are exposed in order to be smoothed over. We are left with the unshakeable sensation that we are seeing Jordan as he wants to be seen.</p> <p>But if history is written by the winners, then Jordan\u2019s participation in his own hagiography is fair play, especially if the alternative meant the unseen footage that comprises the narrative spine of <em>The Last Dance</em> would have remained locked away in the league\u2019s New Jersey vault.

Watching this 57-year-old man grapple with his legacy out loud, whiskey in hand, and<a href=\"https://streamable.com/uxvwy1\"> weigh in on decades-old scores</a> makes for compelling theatre \u2013 to say nothing of the countless<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCSBulls/status/1262211100701048833\"> memes</a> it has spawned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b39dc27d4803e73c525c36cb6486c67224ebeed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b39dc27d4803e73c525c36cb6486c67224ebeed/0_0_2048_1462/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Jordan smiles at a press conference in Chicago to announce his retirement in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Jordan smiles at a press conference in Chicago to announce his retirement in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sue Ogrocki/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jordan\u2019s peerless on-court performance is matched only by his business acumen, which <em>The Last Dance</em> unpacks by way of his influence on urban culture and effective launch of what has become sneaker culture. He earned a relatively modest $90m (\u00a374m) in salary over the course of his 15-year NBA career \u2013 with about $63m coming in his final two seasons with the Bulls \u2013 yet became the world\u2019s first billionaire athlete by selectively aligning himself with brands like Nike, Gatorade, Hanes, McDonald\u2019s and Upper Deck. He was ever conscious of the idea that his image became diluted the more it was used. In a time when the titans of sports and entertainment routinely bypass traditional channels to control the narrative through their own production companies or friendly platforms, Jordan was years ahead of the game.</p> <p>The film does make gestures toward placing Jordan\u2019s legacy in a broader context, relying on no less than a former president and fellow Chicago icon for authority. \u201cThere are great players who don\u2019t have an impact beyond their sport,\u201d Obama says. \u201cAnd then there are certain sports figures who become a larger cultural force. Michael Jordan helped to create a different way in which people thought about the African-American athlete. A different way in which people saw athletics as part of the entertainment business. He became an extraordinary ambassador, not just for basketball, but for the United States overseas as part of the American culture sweeping the globe. Michael Jordan and the Bulls changed the culture.\u201d</p> <p>But <em>The Last Dance</em> deftly resists the temptation to overreach and remains centred on Jordan\u2019s first and only concern: the pursuit of perfection and wholesale domination of his rivals. At a time when the games that bring us together have been put on indefinite hold, it\u2019s no surprise people flocked to the next best thing \u2013 even if they know how the story ends.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Last Dance, the wildly popular documentary series co-produced by ESPN and Netflix about Michael Jordan and the 1990s Chicago Bulls dynasty, concluded last week with the same delirious public reception it came in on \u2013 a reminder that Jordan\u2019s towering presence endures nearly two decades on from his playing days. The anticipation surrounding the ambitious 10-part docuseries, which was initially set to air in June on the off nights of this year\u2019s NBA finals, had been growing since the release of a glossy extended trailer at Christmas showing never-before-seen footage and a star-studded roster of interviewees replete with A-list celebrities, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and a who\u2019s who of basketball luminaries. Yet it arrived at a moment as singular as the sportsman it profiles: with the sports world at an unprecedented standstill amid the global coronavirus pandemic and millions of people desperate for the shared experience that the NBA playoffs would otherwise be offering right now. The episodes, which aired in prime time on ESPN before their next-day release internationally on Netflix, became weekly appointment television throughout the past month and a half, averaging 5.648 million viewers (and reportedly unseating Tiger King as the world\u2019s most in-demand documentary). The Last Dance ostensibly tells the story of Jordan\u2019s titular, tumultuous final season with the Bulls and his monomaniacal pursuit of excellence on the hardwood, but the panoramic canvas allows for lengthy detours and richly drawn sidebars that never feel extraneous. Jordan\u2019s own trajectory from baby-faced amateur to larger-than-life symbol to latter-day myth is exhaustively retold through a stylish blend of archival footage, present-day interviews and spare-no-expense soundtrack. Lengthy segments are, however, devoted to the other principals in Jordan\u2019s orbit: Scottie Pippen, the famed wingman and lone constant aside from Jordan on all six of Chicago\u2019s title teams; Dennis Rodman, the free-spirited, hard-partying rebounding machine; Phil Jackson, the hippie-mystic head coach whose triangle offense helped unlock the team\u2019s potential. But the star of the piece is Jordan, who after all these years remains both overexposed and mysterious: at once the most prominent cultural reference point the United States has ever produced and something of a recluse who has spoken only sparingly about the Bulls\u2019 imperious reign and still-mystifying break-up at the height of their powers. \u201cIt\u2019s maddening because I felt like we could have won seven, I really believe that,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cWe may not have, but man, just not to be able to try, that\u2019s something that I just can\u2019t accept.\u201d Before what proved to be the team\u2019s last season together \u2013 a sixth and final championship run \u2013 Jordan allowed the NBA\u2019s in-house entertainment division to film what became more than 500 hours of behind-the-scenes footage of them with the condition that it could only be used with his explicit consent. It does bear mentioning that Jordan\u2019s own production company is among the co-producers behind the project and he retained final cut and editorial control. Even while introducing the less pleasant elements of Jordan\u2019s legacy \u2013 his bullying and tyrannical proclivities with teammates and well-documented gambling problem (or, as he puts it, a competition problem) \u2013 the warts are exposed in order to be smoothed over. We are left with the unshakeable sensation that we are seeing Jordan as he wants to be seen. But if history is written by the winners, then Jordan\u2019s participation in his own hagiography is fair play, especially if the alternative meant the unseen footage that comprises the narrative spine of The Last Dance would have remained locked away in the league\u2019s New Jersey vault. No one won more or gave more of himself doing it \u2013 and not without the cost of personal relationships that is hinted at but is never far off. The very fact that Jordan, whose famously meticulous control of his likeness was years ahead of its time, finally consented to a long-form documentary seems improbable until you learn he gave the go-ahead only days after LeBron James\u2019s epochal comeback win over the Golden State Warriors in the 2016 NBA finals, which reignited the pan-cultural Jordan v LeBron debate in earnest. Indeed, Jordan\u2019s sheer charisma and force of personality, as he dismissively lays waste to would-be rivals like Gary Payton, Clyde Drexler and Isiah Thomas (whose brand may never recover), are enough to bury even the peskiest advertorial aftertaste. Watching this 57-year-old man grapple with his legacy out loud, whiskey in hand, and weigh in on decades-old scores makes for compelling theatre \u2013 to say nothing of the countless memes it has spawned. Jordan\u2019s peerless on-court performance is matched only by his business acumen, which The Last Dance unpacks by way of his influence on urban culture and effective launch of what has become sneaker culture. He earned a relatively modest $90m (\u00a374m) in salary over the course of his 15-year NBA career \u2013 with about $63m coming in his final two seasons with the Bulls \u2013 yet became the world\u2019s first billionaire athlete by selectively aligning himself with brands like Nike, Gatorade, Hanes, McDonald\u2019s and Upper Deck. He was ever conscious of the idea that his image became diluted the more it was used. In a time when the titans of sports and entertainment routinely bypass traditional channels to control the narrative through their own production companies or friendly platforms, Jordan was years ahead of the game. The film does make gestures toward placing Jordan\u2019s legacy in a broader context, relying on no less than a former president and fellow Chicago icon for authority. \u201cThere are great players who don\u2019t have an impact beyond their sport,\u201d Obama says. \u201cAnd then there are certain sports figures who become a larger cultural force. Michael Jordan helped to create a different way in which people thought about the African-American athlete. A different way in which people saw athletics as part of the entertainment business. He became an extraordinary ambassador, not just for basketball, but for the United States overseas as part of the American culture sweeping the globe. Michael Jordan and the Bulls changed the culture.\u201d But The Last Dance deftly resists the temptation to overreach and remains centred on Jordan\u2019s first and only concern: the pursuit of perfection and wholesale domination of his rivals. At a time when the games that bring us together have been put on indefinite hold, it\u2019s no surprise people flocked to the next best thing \u2013 even if they know how the story ends.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018To speak about the meaning and value of life may seem more necessary today than ever.\u201d It\u2019s a quote that might have been plucked from any number of op-eds over the past couple of months. It\u2019s in fact the opening sentence of a 1946 lecture by psychotherapist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl.</p> <p>The previous year, Frankl had still been incarcerated in Auschwitz. Now he was giving a series of talks in Vienna about what his experience of Nazi death camps had taught him about the human condition. Those lectures have just been published in English for the first time as <em><a href=\"https://www.penguin.com.au/books/yes-to-life-in-spite-of-everything-9781846046360\">Yes to Life in Spite of Everything</a></em>. Frankl\u2019s is a voice that seems as necessary now as it was in the shadow of the Holocaust.</p> <p>Shortly after the lectures, Frankl published the book for which he has become celebrated \u2013 <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/09/viktor-frankls-book-on-the-psychology-of-the-holocaust-to-be-made-into-a-film\">Man\u2019s Search for Meaning</a></em>. In it, he argues that in order to survive the concentration camps one had to be able \u2013 even in the most degrading of circumstances \u2013 to find meaning in life. \u201cEverything can be taken from a man but one thing,\u201d Frankl wrote, \u201cthe last of the human freedoms \u2013 to choose one\u2019s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\u2019s own way.\u201d</p> <p>Frankl\u2019s stress on the importance of one\u2019s attitude, whatever the circumstances, has turned him into a guru of positivity and self-help. At the heart of his philosophy, however, was not mindless optimism but responsibility. \u201cMan should not ask what the meaning of his life is,\u201d Frankl wrote, \u201cbut rather must recognise that it is he who is asked.\u201d</p> <p>Frankl was born into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1905. It was a city of intellectual and political ferment, graced by such towering figures as Freud and Wittgenstein, Popper and Schoenberg, Carnap and Klimt.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is humans, and humans alone, who imbue the world with meaning</p> <footer> <cite>Viktor Frankl</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The city was also deeply polarised, a seedbed for fascism and communism. In 1934, the far right seized control of Austria, shutting down parliament and banning the social democrats, of whom Frankl was one. Four years later came <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1938/mar/14/leadersandreply.mainsection\">Anschluss</a>,</em> the German annexation of Austria. In 1942, Frankl\u2019s entire family was transported to concentration camps. His parents, wife and brother all perished in the Holocaust.</p> <p>Frankl\u2019s philosophy was shaped by what came to be called \u201cexistentialism\u201d. For existentialists, humans do not possess an unchanging essence from which our capacities, personalities and values derive. Rather, humans create themselves, and their nature, by acting upon the world. Humans, the French existential philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/22/jean-paul-sartre-refuses-nobel-prize-literature-50-years-books\">Jean-Paul Sartre </a>wrote, are \u201ccondemned to be free\u201d; condemned because we have no choice but to make choices.</p> <p>Frankl\u2019s experience of the death camps reinforced his existentialist views. It was here, he insisted, when almost everything worthwhile had been torn from people, and everything done to dehumanise them, that it was most important to find value and meaning in life. Those who survived were the ones best able to do so.</p> <p>The significance of Frankl\u2019s work lies not in his positivity or optimism but in his insistence that it is humans, and humans alone, who imbue the world with meaning. There is no external authority to whom we can turn to help us decide notions of right and wrong, good and bad. We can rely only on ourselves.</p> <p>Yet, if existentialism\u2019s strength lies in its insistence on the importance of freedom and responsibility \u2013 and on the necessity of making choices \u2013 its weakness stems from its difficulties in relating individual agency to our existence as social beings. We all live as part of communities and societies. It is through the social bonds we make with others that our individuality emerges.</p> <p>Meaning, too, is social as much as it is individual; the very ideas of \u201cfreedom\u201d, \u201cresponsibility\u201d or \u201cthe individual\u201d make sense only in specific social contexts. Existential arguments often seem as if individual choice and responsibility have been unstitched from the rest of the architecture of our lives. It leaves them open to be purloined by both libertarian ideas of the market and psychologies that obsesses with the self.</p> <p>Difficulties in understanding the relationship between the individual and the social is an issue not just for existentialists. It is one of the key problems facing western societies today. Whether immigration or free speech, the pressing questions of recent years have been fundamentally about how individual rights and social needs can be reconciled. So, too, have many of the controversies over coronavirus policy, from the debate over lockdown to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/15/when-will-schools-reopen-uk-children-safe-coronavirus\">question of when schools should reopen</a>. It\u2019s a good time to engage with both the strengths and weaknesses of Frankl\u2019s existentialism and to rescue it from those who can see the individual but not the social.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018To speak about the meaning and value of life may seem more necessary today than ever.\u201d It\u2019s a quote that might have been plucked from any number of op-eds over the past couple of months. It\u2019s in fact the opening sentence of a 1946 lecture by psychotherapist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl. The previous year, Frankl had still been incarcerated in Auschwitz. Now he was giving a series of talks in Vienna about what his experience of Nazi death camps had taught him about the human condition. Those lectures have just been published in English for the first time as Yes to Life in Spite of Everything. Frankl\u2019s is a voice that seems as necessary now as it was in the shadow of the Holocaust. Shortly after the lectures, Frankl published the book for which he has become celebrated \u2013 Man\u2019s Search for Meaning. In it, he argues that in order to survive the concentration camps one had to be able \u2013 even in the most degrading of circumstances \u2013 to find meaning in life. \u201cEverything can be taken from a man but one thing,\u201d Frankl wrote, \u201cthe last of the human freedoms \u2013 to choose one\u2019s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\u2019s own way.\u201d Frankl\u2019s stress on the importance of one\u2019s attitude, whatever the circumstances, has turned him into a guru of positivity and self-help. At the heart of his philosophy, however, was not mindless optimism but responsibility. \u201cMan should not ask what the meaning of his life is,\u201d Frankl wrote, \u201cbut rather must recognise that it is he who is asked.\u201d Frankl was born into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1905. It was a city of intellectual and political ferment, graced by such towering figures as Freud and Wittgenstein, Popper and Schoenberg, Carnap and Klimt. The city was also deeply polarised, a seedbed for fascism and communism. In 1934, the far right seized control of Austria, shutting down parliament and banning the social democrats, of whom Frankl was one. Four years later came Anschluss, the German annexation of Austria. In 1942, Frankl\u2019s entire family was transported to concentration camps. His parents, wife and brother all perished in the Holocaust. Frankl\u2019s philosophy was shaped by what came to be called \u201cexistentialism\u201d. For existentialists, humans do not possess an unchanging essence from which our capacities, personalities and values derive. Rather, humans create themselves, and their nature, by acting upon the world. Humans, the French existential philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre wrote, are \u201ccondemned to be free\u201d; condemned because we have no choice but to make choices. Frankl\u2019s experience of the death camps reinforced his existentialist views. It was here, he insisted, when almost everything worthwhile had been torn from people, and everything done to dehumanise them, that it was most important to find value and meaning in life. Those who survived were the ones best able to do so. The significance of Frankl\u2019s work lies not in his positivity or optimism but in his insistence that it is humans, and humans alone, who imbue the world with meaning. There is no external authority to whom we can turn to help us decide notions of right and wrong, good and bad. We can rely only on ourselves. Yet, if existentialism\u2019s strength lies in its insistence on the importance of freedom and responsibility \u2013 and on the necessity of making choices \u2013 its weakness stems from its difficulties in relating individual agency to our existence as social beings. We all live as part of communities and societies. It is through the social bonds we make with others that our individuality emerges. Meaning, too, is social as much as it is individual; the very ideas of \u201cfreedom\u201d, \u201cresponsibility\u201d or \u201cthe individual\u201d make sense only in specific social contexts. Existential arguments often seem as if individual choice and responsibility have been unstitched from the rest of the architecture of our lives. It leaves them open to be purloined by both libertarian ideas of the market and psychologies that obsesses with the self. Difficulties in understanding the relationship between the individual and the social is an issue not just for existentialists. It is one of the key problems facing western societies today. Whether immigration or free speech, the pressing questions of recent years have been fundamentally about how individual rights and social needs can be reconciled. So, too, have many of the controversies over coronavirus policy, from the debate over lockdown to the question of when schools should reopen. It\u2019s a good time to engage with both the strengths and weaknesses of Frankl\u2019s existentialism and to rescue it from those who can see the individual but not the social. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

Lisa and Sarah Originally due to marry in August, the couple deferred their big day to April 2021 Lisa Barnish, 28, a Ladbrokes manager, and Sarah Johnstone, 35, marketplace manager for the same company, have been together for two-and-a-half years. \u201cWe got engaged on holiday in Barcelona,\u201d says Barnish. \u201cIt was me who asked Sarah on the beach.\u201d They were due to get married at the Shireburn Arms, Hurst Green, on 14 August. \u201cWe fell in love with the place as soon as we walked in and looked at the amazing scenery,\u201d says Barnish. The pandemic has forced them to postpone both their wedding and a planned honeymoon to Italy in September. \u201cFortunately, the Shireburn has been amazing and we\u2019ve been able to get a new date of 23 April 2021.\u201d Lisa would have happily kept the various gifts, signs and wedding cake toppers that carried the August date, arguing that \u201cit would be a story to tell, a memory to keep\u201d. But she was over-ruled. \u201cSarah insisted they would be out of date, so we\u2019re buying new.\u201d Both are \u201cvery relaxed\u201d and trying to take the upheaval in their stride. \u201cWe\u2019re just grateful that all our family and friends are safe and well.\u201d Lockdown rules permitting, they hope to get away for a few nights to mark their planned wedding date. And just to get them in the party mood, they intend to drink \u201clots of gin\u201d. Alex and Laura The couple had planned to marry in Italy on 30 May. Alex Mason, 27, a sales manager, and Laura McCartney, 24, a nurse, should have been getting married in the garden of an 8th-century monastery on Italy\u2019s Amalfi coast on Saturday. But now the whole event, along with a \u201cmini-moon\u201d in Sorrento and a full honeymoon in Santorini, has been put back to July 2021. Mason and McCartney, both from Wombourne, south Staffordshire, have been together for five years and got engaged in Dublin in December 2017. Laura recalled: \u201cAlex had planned it and stood up to propose in front of a restaurant full of people.\u201d The couple chose Italy for their wedding but then came the pandemic. So far they\u2019ve received a refund from Airbnb but are still pursuing British Airways over the cost of their flights. At the moment the airline is insisting on giving vouchers rather than a cash refund so they can buy fresh tickets \u2013 still with BA. McCartney finds it \u201chorrible\u201d to catch glimpses of her wedding paraphernalia bearing next Saturday\u2019s date, but is relieved that everyone on the couple\u2019s 35-strong guest list is still able to come to the wedding next year. \u201cIt\u2019s still our dream location, so we\u2019re more than happy to wait to have the day as we intended,\u201d says McCartney. \u201cWe are so very lucky to have our family fit and well, and for us to have our health during these scary times.\u201d The couple intend to spend their now-abandoned wedding date \u201cgetting some nice food in, cracking open a bottle of wine, watching some movies and having a romantic day together\u201d. McCartney adds: \u201cWe know it\u2019s important to remember there are people out there losing loved ones. We\u2019re very lucky to have one another and to be able to get married next year. \u201cIt was a blow at first, but we were the ones to actually make the decision to postpone. We didn\u2019t feel it right to get married with everything that was happening. We could have hung on longer, but it was clear from the start that weddings in May \u2013 especially the ones abroad \u2013 would not be going ahead this year. \u201cMy hen do had already been cancelled and it was making us both very stressed and upset. Once the wedding was postponed it felt like a weight had been lifted off our shoulders. \u201cWe now are both focusing on just getting through this lockdown, looking forward to seeing loved ones again and hoping everyone stays safe. We will have our special day and it will be perfect even if we have to wait another 14 months.\u201d",

Researchers at University College London tracked more than 350,000 people using official government data between 1971 and 2013. They found that the likelihood of dying earlier among those who had been in care increased over time, contrary to the general population which, during the same period, experienced a decline in mortality risk. The team at the UCL\u2019s institute of epidemiology and healthcare said the findings were \u201cshocking\u201d and called for a government response into why inequalities appeared to be widening. Throughout the 42-year period, they found that adults who spent time as children in the care system were 70% more likely to die prematurely than those who did not. However, within the more recent cohorts, the chances of dying early had increased to \u201cmore like twofold\u201d. Researchers believe that the impact of austerity may have worsened the situation since December 2013, the last date for which \u201call-cause mortality data\u201d was available. The majority of premature deaths were attributed to causes such as self-harm and accidents or were related to mental illness. The study, the first major research of its kind, suggests thousands have died prematurely. The number of children in care has steadily increased over the past decade, reaching almost 82,000 in England and Wales at the start of 2018. Professor Amanda Sacker, part of the UCL team, said: \u201cThe figures are really quite shocking and indicate that while the majority of us are living longer, healthier lives, this is far from the case for those who spent time as children in care. Rather, the inequalities have increased.\u201d Sacker said she was surprised to find that while there was a 40% increased risk for those in care compared with those living with parents in 1971, this had soared to 360% in 2001. The increase in the mortality rate could be partly explained by difficulties faced by former care children entering the labour market after the 2008 crash, the study suggests, an observation that will prompt concern when evaluating the current coronavirus-induced downturn. \u201cThere are concerns that reduced council funding due to austerity measures has resulted in reduced quality of care for looked-after children which could affect the mental health of these young people,\u201d said the study. Now the UCL team is calling on the government to act on the findings, paying particular attention to mental health. \u201cChildren in care are among the most vulnerable in our society, and our research indicates that we are failing them. We must do more to understand why,\u201d said Sacker.",

Earlier this month, the WHO issued a 19-page set of guidelines on how these trials might operate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/why-we-might-not-get-a-coronavirus-vaccine\">Why we might not get a coronavirus vaccine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, other UK scientists have reacted with horror at the proposal to implement human challenge trials for a Covid-19 vaccine on the grounds that these could cause serious illness and possibly deaths of volunteers who had been deliberately infected with the virus.</p> <p>The dilemma was summed up by Jonathan Ives of the Centre for Ethics in Medicine at Bristol University. \u201cIf we were to do this, we would be asking healthy people to put their wellbeing and their lives at risk for the good of society at large. On the other hand, taking that risk could speed up vaccine development and save many, many lives. So I think there could be grounds for going ahead with challenge trials, though it would be based on a very finely balanced argument.\u201d</p> <p>Figures released last week suggest about 7% of the UK population may have already been infected with Covid-19 virus, a relatively low level of infection that poses problems for testing vaccines. A sufficient number of volunteers has to be exposed to the virus to see if a vaccine protects them or not. But if their chances of being in contact with an infected person are low, it will take a long time to demonstrate the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/18/first-human-trial-results-raise-hopes-for-coronavirus-vaccine\">efficacy of a vaccine candidate</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e9adfd88441a7924380e00edd276de6a2db4156\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e9adfd88441a7924380e00edd276de6a2db4156/0_39_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Little bottles labelled vaccine Covid-19 and a syringe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO says the least risky group for trials comprises healthy volunteers aged 18-30.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dado Ruvi\u0107/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a result, scientists have proposed that human challenge trials could be introduced to test a vaccine quickly and so save thousands of lives by preventing future infections. \u201cLevels of infection in the community are already low, and if this virus behaves like other respiratory diseases and coronaviruses, there may be even lower levels over the summer,\u201d said Professor Lawrence Young of Warwick University Medical School. \u201cThere will not be enough people secreting the virus to be in contact with volunteers in vaccine projects. It is just not going to work.\u201d</p> <p>Young argues that human challenge trials should be considered \u201cvery seriously\u201d for the UK.

      "bodyText": "Scientists have warned there could be major delays in producing a Covid-19 vaccine if current UK infection rates remain low and lengthy waiting times are needed to show if candidate products are working. As a result, some researchers insist that ministers must now consider implementing radical alternative measures to speed up vaccine development. In particular, they argue that Britain should consider deliberately infecting volunteers involved in vaccine-testing projects \u2013 in line with World Health Organization proposals to set up such human challenge trials. Earlier this month, the WHO issued a 19-page set of guidelines on how these trials might operate. However, other UK scientists have reacted with horror at the proposal to implement human challenge trials for a Covid-19 vaccine on the grounds that these could cause serious illness and possibly deaths of volunteers who had been deliberately infected with the virus. The dilemma was summed up by Jonathan Ives of the Centre for Ethics in Medicine at Bristol University. \u201cIf we were to do this, we would be asking healthy people to put their wellbeing and their lives at risk for the good of society at large. On the other hand, taking that risk could speed up vaccine development and save many, many lives. So I think there could be grounds for going ahead with challenge trials, though it would be based on a very finely balanced argument.\u201d Figures released last week suggest about 7% of the UK population may have already been infected with Covid-19 virus, a relatively low level of infection that poses problems for testing vaccines. A sufficient number of volunteers has to be exposed to the virus to see if a vaccine protects them or not. But if their chances of being in contact with an infected person are low, it will take a long time to demonstrate the efficacy of a vaccine candidate. As a result, scientists have proposed that human challenge trials could be introduced to test a vaccine quickly and so save thousands of lives by preventing future infections. \u201cLevels of infection in the community are already low, and if this virus behaves like other respiratory diseases and coronaviruses, there may be even lower levels over the summer,\u201d said Professor Lawrence Young of Warwick University Medical School. \u201cThere will not be enough people secreting the virus to be in contact with volunteers in vaccine projects. It is just not going to work.\u201d Young argues that human challenge trials should be considered \u201cvery seriously\u201d for the UK. These would involve giving volunteers either a placebo or a vaccine, as is normally done in trials. But instead of waiting to find out how the two groups fare without interference, scientists would deliberately infect them with the Covid-19 virus. This would very quickly show if a vaccine works or not. \u201cOnly very healthy young people \u2013 around the age of 25 \u2013 who have given informed consent would be used,\u201d added Young, who points out that such trials have already been used to test the efficacy of vaccines for flu and the common cold. However, these ailments pose relatively low risks to volunteers. Covid-19 can have serious side-effects, mainly for the elderly but also in a few rare cases of young, apparently healthy people. This point is acknowledged by Young. \u201cBefore we went ahead with challenge trials, we would need to have developed some very effective therapy \u2013 an anti-viral drug perhaps \u2013 that could be used in the few cases where something went seriously wrong.\u201d This latter point has been stressed by WHO in its guidelines for human challenge trials.

      "body": "<p>Covid-19 has changed the way that towns and cities look. It has offered views of public places with fewer cars and cleaner air, roads you can stroll down, cycling without danger. It has made some things seem more precious, such as green spaces and parks. It has renewed appreciation of the social infrastructures of support and care. It has heightened awareness of the ways in which one person\u2019s actions can affect another\u2019s. It has made everyone more conscious of the ways they occupy space in relation to other people.</p> <p>It has also prompted the idea that big cities have taken a hit from which they won\u2019t fully recover. The virus first appeared in Wuhan, population 11 million, and some of its worst outbreaks have been in New York, London, Milan and S\u00e3o Paulo. Crowds and public transport, goes the theory, are bad for your health. Remote working, boosted by lockdowns, will be here to stay. Balaji Srinivasan, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist summed this view up in a pithy tweet: \u201cSell city, buy country.\u201d</p> <p>So cities appear both more and less attractive. It\u2019s a contradiction. To which the best response might not be a rush away from everything urban, but a less violent redistribution from one kind of city to another. For several decades wealth and population have been tending to concentrate in a few privileged urban centres, to the disadvantage both of other towns and cities \u2013 and of themselves. This has been particularly true in Britain, with its gross imbalance between London and its satellites and much of the rest of the country. What if there were a shift in intensity away from the biggest cities towards the others, such that the enjoyment of life was increased all round?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b26a7dd81f9daf60a3299bfe48329a5d26af626d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b26a7dd81f9daf60a3299bfe48329a5d26af626d/0_0_4134_2756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Four cyclists wearing protective masks ride along a new cycle path in Milan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A new cycle path has been built in Milan to encourage people to use alternative transport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Finizio/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much or most of the lockdown\u2019s changes are temporary. But what if this crisis were not allowed to go to waste? What if the glimpses of alternative realities became guides to the future? There have already been some rapid responses both in Britain and elsewhere, such as the closing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/15/large-areas-of-london-to-be-made-car-free-as-lockdown-eased\">several central London streets</a> to traffic by mayor Sadiq Khan, the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2020/05/15/parking-cull-and-pocket-parks-for-englands-finest-street-as-newcastle-plans-post-pandemic-future/\">pedestrianisation of Grey Street</a> in Newcastle and the permanent closure of <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/seattle-will-permanently-close-20-miles-of-residential-streets-to-most-vehicle-traffic/\">Seattle streets</a> that had been temporarily blocked.</p> <p>These initiatives are welcome attempts to make selected urban areas more sociable and pleasurable. There is also the chance to steer the decentralising effects of the pandemic towards towns and cities that already have most of what it takes to support successful communities, but could do with a bit more economic and social energy. This is surely preferable to a flight towards car-dependent detached houses, scattered around rural areas that would hardly welcome them.</p> <p>Some situations that were under strain before the virus have been revealed as all-but unsupportable. In the capital, there was scarce and expensive housing, air pollution, long commuting times on crowded public transport. Lockdown has made confined living conditions less tolerable while also removing the compensations of a metropolitan social life.</p> <p>Elsewhere there was a lack of investment and opportunity, alongside decaying buildings and public spaces. A three-bedroom Victorian terraced house in Fulham, to take property prices as a measure, goes for at least \u00a31m. An essentially identical house in Gateshead might sell for \u00a3100,000, in Portsmouth maybe \u00a3250,000. London is overcrowded, Doncaster is depopulated. Empty space is at a premium in the capital and in its south-eastern penumbra. In high streets across the country there is all too much of it.</p> <p>Meanwhile attempts to mitigate the London-centred housing crisis have foundered on familiar rocks. Residents of green belts don\u2019t want new homes near them. Almost any land inside London that is easy to develop has been built on by now. Property companies can\u2019t and won\u2019t build homes of the quantity and affordability that are needed. There are ways to confront these problems \u2013 good planning, state housebuilding, some determination \u2013 which shouldn\u2019t be abandoned, but contemporary Britain has so far proved sluggish to adopt them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be792a8829ae9d407fc98ce5c921ed4e16fe5a30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be792a8829ae9d407fc98ce5c921ed4e16fe5a30/0_999_5100_3062/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patients lie in beds in a tuberculosis ward in Istanbul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tuberculosis ward in Istanbul in the 1880s. The highly infectious disease made cities a killer and led to the creation of more green spaces.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal History Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another approach is to make best use of the already-there. Ease the pressure on London and on some other mostly southern hotspots and reflate the many towns and cities that often have good housing stock, handsome if neglected high streets, a legacy of past investment in public amenities like parks and libraries, and access to beautiful countryside. Places roughly answering this description include Preston, Walsall, Sheffield, Plymouth, Colchester, Derby, Dundee, Hull, Wakefield and Wrexham, to name but a few. Such a shift would have the added environmental benefit of reducing the large costs in energy and carbon of a mass housebuilding programme.</p> <p>It\u2019s been widely pointed out, especially since the pandemic started, that modern attitudes to cities have been closely linked to health. A century or so ago, for planning theorists from Ebenezer Howard to Le Corbusier, diseases such as tuberculosis made density a killer, and so cities had to be depopulated, their teeming streets replaced with green open spaces. Patrick Abercrombie\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2014/mar/22/london-county-plan-abercrombie-forshaw\">Greater London Plan of 1944</a> put these ideas into practice, directing that a large number of Londoners should be moved to healthy new towns.</p> <p>Once antibiotics had pushed back TB, the virtues of city life were reasserted. Jane Jacobs celebrated these virtues in <em><a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/08/17/reviews/jacobs.html?mcubz=0\">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</a></em><em> </em>of 1961, after which it became the creed of right-thinking urbanists that the density and vibrancy of cities were to be encouraged. Theory was eventually put into practice with spectacular success, at least in economically powerful and good-looking cities including London and New York.</p> <p>Populations started growing after decades of decline, money poured in, shops and restaurants boomed, property prices soared, derelict buildings were done up. The 1980s phrase \u201cinner-city deprivation\u201d gave way to the estate agents\u2019 buzz-term \u201curban lifestyle\u201d. The term \u201cworld cities\u201d came into use in the 1990s, to describe urban economies that were competing with rivals of a global scale for business and attractiveness. Cities were good. Big was good. Big cities were best.</p> <p>In the process something was lost. Supercharged property prices turned cities\u2019 best features into commodities.

      "bodyText": "Covid-19 has changed the way that towns and cities look. It has offered views of public places with fewer cars and cleaner air, roads you can stroll down, cycling without danger. It has made some things seem more precious, such as green spaces and parks. It has renewed appreciation of the social infrastructures of support and care. It has heightened awareness of the ways in which one person\u2019s actions can affect another\u2019s. It has made everyone more conscious of the ways they occupy space in relation to other people. It has also prompted the idea that big cities have taken a hit from which they won\u2019t fully recover. The virus first appeared in Wuhan, population 11 million, and some of its worst outbreaks have been in New York, London, Milan and S\u00e3o Paulo. Crowds and public transport, goes the theory, are bad for your health. Remote working, boosted by lockdowns, will be here to stay. Balaji Srinivasan, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist summed this view up in a pithy tweet: \u201cSell city, buy country.\u201d So cities appear both more and less attractive. It\u2019s a contradiction. To which the best response might not be a rush away from everything urban, but a less violent redistribution from one kind of city to another. For several decades wealth and population have been tending to concentrate in a few privileged urban centres, to the disadvantage both of other towns and cities \u2013 and of themselves. This has been particularly true in Britain, with its gross imbalance between London and its satellites and much of the rest of the country. What if there were a shift in intensity away from the biggest cities towards the others, such that the enjoyment of life was increased all round? Much or most of the lockdown\u2019s changes are temporary. But what if this crisis were not allowed to go to waste? What if the glimpses of alternative realities became guides to the future? There have already been some rapid responses both in Britain and elsewhere, such as the closing of several central London streets to traffic by mayor Sadiq Khan, the pedestrianisation of Grey Street in Newcastle and the permanent closure of Seattle streets that had been temporarily blocked. These initiatives are welcome attempts to make selected urban areas more sociable and pleasurable. There is also the chance to steer the decentralising effects of the pandemic towards towns and cities that already have most of what it takes to support successful communities, but could do with a bit more economic and social energy. This is surely preferable to a flight towards car-dependent detached houses, scattered around rural areas that would hardly welcome them. Some situations that were under strain before the virus have been revealed as all-but unsupportable. In the capital, there was scarce and expensive housing, air pollution, long commuting times on crowded public transport. Lockdown has made confined living conditions less tolerable while also removing the compensations of a metropolitan social life. Elsewhere there was a lack of investment and opportunity, alongside decaying buildings and public spaces. A three-bedroom Victorian terraced house in Fulham, to take property prices as a measure, goes for at least \u00a31m. An essentially identical house in Gateshead might sell for \u00a3100,000, in Portsmouth maybe \u00a3250,000. London is overcrowded, Doncaster is depopulated. Empty space is at a premium in the capital and in its south-eastern penumbra. In high streets across the country there is all too much of it. Meanwhile attempts to mitigate the London-centred housing crisis have foundered on familiar rocks. Residents of green belts don\u2019t want new homes near them. Almost any land inside London that is easy to develop has been built on by now. Property companies can\u2019t and won\u2019t build homes of the quantity and affordability that are needed. There are ways to confront these problems \u2013 good planning, state housebuilding, some determination \u2013 which shouldn\u2019t be abandoned, but contemporary Britain has so far proved sluggish to adopt them. Another approach is to make best use of the already-there. Ease the pressure on London and on some other mostly southern hotspots and reflate the many towns and cities that often have good housing stock, handsome if neglected high streets, a legacy of past investment in public amenities like parks and libraries, and access to beautiful countryside. Places roughly answering this description include Preston, Walsall, Sheffield, Plymouth, Colchester, Derby, Dundee, Hull, Wakefield and Wrexham, to name but a few. Such a shift would have the added environmental benefit of reducing the large costs in energy and carbon of a mass housebuilding programme. It\u2019s been widely pointed out, especially since the pandemic started, that modern attitudes to cities have been closely linked to health. A century or so ago, for planning theorists from Ebenezer Howard to Le Corbusier, diseases such as tuberculosis made density a killer, and so cities had to be depopulated, their teeming streets replaced with green open spaces. Patrick Abercrombie\u2019s Greater London Plan of 1944 put these ideas into practice, directing that a large number of Londoners should be moved to healthy new towns. Once antibiotics had pushed back TB, the virtues of city life were reasserted. Jane Jacobs celebrated these virtues in The Death and Life of Great American Cities of 1961, after which it became the creed of right-thinking urbanists that the density and vibrancy of cities were to be encouraged. Theory was eventually put into practice with spectacular success, at least in economically powerful and good-looking cities including London and New York. Populations started growing after decades of decline, money poured in, shops and restaurants boomed, property prices soared, derelict buildings were done up. The 1980s phrase \u201cinner-city deprivation\u201d gave way to the estate agents\u2019 buzz-term \u201curban lifestyle\u201d. The term \u201cworld cities\u201d came into use in the 1990s, to describe urban economies that were competing with rivals of a global scale for business and attractiveness. Cities were good. Big was good. Big cities were best. In the process something was lost. Supercharged property prices turned cities\u2019 best features into commodities. If Jacobs talked of the \u201cballet of the street\u201d \u2013 the choreography of people of different backgrounds and trades going about their lives in shared spaces \u2013 it became hard to find in the sealed glass towers of the world cities\u2019 newest real estate. It is more likely to be found in, well, streets, of which there are countless numbers across the country, not just in the most privileged metropolitan centres. So the proposition is not to rush from dense city to atomised exurb. Rather it is to encourage an adjustment of priorities towards towns and cities in general. It is not about mass internal migration but about incremental change. Most people will stay where they are. Most people\u2019s lives will not be transformed by remote working. But for at least some people, some of the time, the advantages of online interactions will outweigh the disadvantages. It might mean that you only need to visit a big-city office once a week, for example, rather than every day. It should be possible to imagine that Person A decides that the possibility of having a house and a garden outweighs the attractions of the big city. The development of remote working makes this a little more possible. Perhaps there are enough people like her to form a social network in her area, perhaps she persuades some friends to join her. Their choices might be influenced by the rediscovery, during the lockdown, of activities that don\u2019t require a sophisticated urban pleasure dome within easy reach: cooking, talking to family or friends, going to shops that are not supermarkets, tending a garden, online socialising and entertainment. They might be less driven than before by the prestige and desirability of a metropolis. Perhaps they work for companies who see the benefits of helping their employees live like this, or who spread their operations around regional bases more than they would have done previously. Perhaps they make an empty shop into a shared workspace and meeting place. A cafe, you could call it. Perhaps this helps to bring some life back to a high street. They would not be moving into a void, but into an existing set of businesses and activities, with which they could be mutually supportive. Such a shift won\u2019t happen all by itself. Successful high streets, as the Centre for Cities thinktank has shown, are symptoms of more general strengths in local economies. Brighton, York and Cambridge were doing just fine before the pandemic, and are the most likely places to bounce back; Newport, Bradford and Wigan less so. It will, as well as the resourcefulness of individuals and companies, require some positive contributions from government. Partly this would be a matter of supporting those things that support quality of life \u2013 parks, nurseries, street maintenance. Reversing austerity, you could call it. Partly it would be a case of investing in local transport systems and broadband. It would require creative use of the planning system \u2013 not just allowing individuals to convert shops into homes, which can create poor homes and inactive streets, but encouraging initiatives that work out new futures for whole streets at a time. Vacant shopping centres should be taken into public ownership so that, as happened with empty docklands in the 1980s, they can be made available to whoever might make the most of them. Versions of Tainan Spring in Taiwan, where an old shopping mall was made into a water garden, could be realised in Britain. The vast financial and environmental costs of projects like HS2 and Heathrow\u2019s third runway, together with the long time they will take to deliver any kind of return, now look \u2013 in a future that will definitely be poorer than expected \u2013 preposterous. Their main effect would be to bring more people from less-favoured parts of the country to the more favoured. It would be far better to spend the tens of billions they require on local and regional projects. Rather than bring people to where the work is, the plan should be to bring work to people, wherever they are. This is hardly a new idea.

      "bodyText": "The Care Quality Commission (CQC) has been accused of failing to alert ministers to the mounting death toll caused by the coronavirus crisis, despite having access to daily information about deaths. In a damning letter to the care homes regulator, the Relatives &amp; Residents Association (RRA) accused the CQC of multiple failures to protect people in care, their relatives and care home staff. Judy Downey, the chair of the RRA, which represents people in care and their families, said the CQC needed to speak up for social care, which has borne the brunt of the crisis. About half of all coronavirus deaths in the UK are believed to have been of care home residents. \u201cIt is a legal requirement for providers to immediately report deaths in care homes to CQC,\u201d Downey wrote on Friday. \u201cThis information, had it been made promptly available, would have helped to inform the national picture much sooner. However, the CQC\u2019s failure to produce these figures urgently for public use resulted in the government not being made aware of the true seriousness of the situation in care homes.\u201d During the initial phase of the crisis, ministers quoted ONS figures which relied on official death certificates where a doctor notes the cause of death. But those take about 11 days to process. It meant that the first official acknowledgement of the true scale of the care crisis came on 21 April \u2013 four weeks after lockdown began \u2013 when the ONS announced that the number of care home deaths had quadrupled from 217 to 1,043. The CQC said it had been sharing death notification data with the Department of Health \u201con a daily basis\u201d, but it changed its data collection methods on 10 April to make it easier to record Covid-19 deaths. Until this point, care providers had to describe each death by writing in a free text box but the resulting data \u201cdid not match what CQC was hearing anecdotally from providers\u201d. After the change, the CQC asked providers to tick boxes on the online form and that data is being used by ONS to create weekly reports. The latest ONS report shows that Covid-19 was linked to the deaths of 11,094 people living in English care homes between 10 April and 15 May, although researchers at the London School of Economics believe there may be more than 22,000 \u201cexcess deaths\u201d during the crisis so far. There are indications that some care residents have gone into decline after losing contact from relatives because of lockdown restrictions. In her letter to the CQC chief executive Ian Trenholm, the RRA chair also took aim at complacency about care homes at the start of the outbreak. \u201cIt was clear from the outset that care services would be in peril and yet when Public Health England stated that \u2018it was very unlikely that anyone receiving care in a care home or in the community will become infected\u2019, CQC failed to speak out immediately to refute this ill-judged view,\u201d she wrote. The commission eventually published detailed advice for care providers on 1 May, but this fell short of giving guidance on how homes should talk to worried families, Downey added, and \u201cmany remain anxious\u201d about the impact of lockdown and the possibility that vulnerable relatives may be at risk of abuse because of a \u201clack of oversight and scrutiny\u201d. \u201cIn addition, the regulator failed to openly represent the voice and needs of the sector for PPE, testing and tracing, and other much-needed resources,\u201d Downey said. She called on the CQC to represent the rights of people living in care homes and use its \u201cleadership voice\u201d to speak up for the needs of care providers, as well as identify those care settings with a poor track record. A CQC spokesman said it had been working with local authorities to source PPE for care homes and helped homes arrange online food deliveries when they had struggled to do so. In a statement, Trenholm said: \u201cThroughout the coronavirus pandemic our regulatory role and core purpose to keep people safe has been at the heart of all decisions we have made.

This much is common ground and undenied by Downing Street. He left his family home when his wife had coronavirus symptoms and he feared he had contracted the disease, which it turned out he had. They travelled a long way: London to Durham is not a trip to the local shops for essential items. His Durham-based parents, both in their seventies, are in a high-vulnerability age group. That was a breach of the rules on lockdown which the entire nation was expected to obey on penalty of being found in transgression of the law. The government instructions which he had a hand in drawing up were not vague, but crystal in their clarity. If any member of a household has symptoms, \u201cdo not leave your home for any reason\u201d.</p> <p>Number 10 has been trying to bat off the demands for his resignation by depicting this as a human story, deserving of our compassion, in which worried parents needed help with childcare. They took a suspiciously long time to weave together this defence. The official statement was only issued after 10am on Saturday. That was more than 12 hours after the story broke, which is a very long time to produce a response to such a major development in the age of 24/7 media. The statement says that he and his wife made the long road trip because, \u201cowing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for\u201d. </p> <p>I\u2019m not convinced that this defence will attract the public sympathy they hope for. Other Britons have faced similar agonies during a lockdown that has presented tough, sometimes heartbreaking dilemmas for many, many people. The rules are nevertheless clear. Anyone with reason to believe they have Covid-19 has to quarantine in their main family home for 14 days. The rules are clear for a reason. They don\u2019t work if people feel free to choose to make themselves exceptions, however much they may think they deserve to be. No infected household, however mighty or modest their status, was supposed to be making 264-mile trips to live somewhere else. The government\u2019s slogan was \u201cStay At Home, Save Lives, Protect The NHS.\u201d It was not \u201cStay At Home (Unless You Are Dom), Save Lives (Not Compulsory For The Prime Minister\u2019s Top Aide), Protect The NHS (At Your Own Discretion If You Work In Downing Street).\u201d</p> <p>The chief medical officer of Scotland was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/05/scotland-chief-medical-officer-seen-flouting-lockdown-advice-catherine-calderwood\">impelled to resign </a>for a lesser breach. Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College professor, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules\">forced to quit </a>the Sage advisory group when it was revealed that he had flouted the rules by having his lover visit him at home. \u201cThe right decision,\u201d said the health secretary, Matt Hancock. Public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the epidemic is badly corroded when key figures behave as if the rules apply to everyone but themselves. When trust, so absolutely essential to the handling of this crisis, is abused and diminished, the public loses faith in the calibre and integrity of decision-makers.</p> <p>Were we talking about anyone other than Mr Cummings \u2013 were we talking about a less powerful figure than the tea cosy-wearing Rasputin of Number 10 \u2013 he would be gone already. He survives only at the indulgence of his employer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Were we talking about anyone other than MrCummings, he would be gone already</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So what started as a significant revelation about the chief adviser is already evolving into an even more important story about Boris Johnson and his premiership.</p> <p>There was some surprise among Tories when Mr Cummings, a figure previously most closely associated with Michael Gove, was given such a sweeping role at Number 10. The explanation was that Mr Johnson had been impressed with the demotic energy and mendacious but effective messaging that he had brought to the Leave side of the Brexit referendum. He went up further in the prime minister\u2019s estimation by crafting the ultimately successful brinkmanship strategy that Number 10 employed during the bitter battles over Brexit during the last parliament. </p> <p>Since the Tories\u2019 majority-winning election result last December, Mr Cummings has amassed a vast amount of clout. Though he has not won every battle that he has started, he has made himself one of the most powerful unelected figures ever to work at Number 10. He instigated the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/sajid-javid-resigns-as-chancellor-amid-boris-johnson-reshuffle\">resignation of a chancellor </a>earlier in the year when Sajid Javid found his demands too humiliating to bear. One former cabinet minister recently complained to me: \u201cCummings has complete contempt for parliament and for the cabinet whom he regards as shit.\u201d He is the architect of a \u201chub and spokes\u201d design for government which is circulating within Whitehall and intended to make all ministers subordinate supplicants to an all-controlling centre run by him from Number 10 and by Mr Gove from the Cabinet Office.</p> <p>There was a hot controversy when it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/revealed-dominic-cummings-on-secret-scientific-advisory-group-for-covid-19\">revealed </a>that the chief adviser had been attending meetings of Sage, the body under the chairmanship of Sir Patrick Vallance, which is tasked with delivering dispassionate scientific counsel to the government. Some scientists on the committee actually welcomed his presence, on the basis that this was the only way to get their advice transformed into policy. They reported that only Mr Cummings could be guaranteed to seize the undivided attention of an easily distracted prime minister who is not renowned for his devotion to detail. That is a measure of his power. That is also an illustration of how dependent Mr Johnson has become on him.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s first reflex will be to try to brazen this out. He will be cross about the furious cyclone that is now raging around Mr Cummings, but he won\u2019t be personally mortified that his chief adviser didn\u2019t follow the government\u2019s instructions. The prime minister\u2019s own biography is littered with examples of a cavalier attitude towards norms of behaviour. Rules are for other people \u2013 not for Boris Johnson. That has been one of the guiding principles of a life not otherwise distinguished by many principles. His own biography is also rich with examples of blunders and scandals that he has survived simply by refusing to be shamed by them. So his first desire will be for the storm to blow itself out after 48 hours or so.</p> <p>But if it doesn\u2019t? This prime minister is also a ruthless calculator of where his personal advantage lies. He will be weighing how much damage this furore could do to him if it doesn\u2019t quickly subside. This story broke at the end of what was already the government\u2019s worst fortnight of the crisis. Number 10 has been forced to perform a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/johnson-forced-to-drop-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">U-turn</a> on imposing \u201cNHS surcharges\u201d on foreign-born health workers, a reverse more hateful to the prime minister because he was forced into it after the leader of the opposition pursued him on the issue. Plans for a partial reopening of schools have collided with resistance from teachers and parents. </p> <p>The grim death toll in care homes and fresh concerns about the government\u2019s ability to deliver on tracking and tracing have contributed to a febrile mood among Tory MPs. Many of them will celebrate if Mr Cummings is defenestrated from Number 10. They resent his swaggering power, they hate the ill-disguised disdain with which he treats them, and they would be delighted to see him gone. As we enter the delicate and perilous process of easing out of the lockdown without reigniting the epidemic, public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the emergency has turned negative for the first time since the crisis began. Confidence is not likely to be restored by the revelation that the prime minister\u2019s closest adviser has been breaking the rules.</p> <p>Another thing the life of Boris Johnson tells us is that his only core commitment is to himself. Journalistic colleagues, fellow politicians and wives have all found that there is no such thing as the undying loyalty of this prime minister. However important you may be to him for a time, you will become dispensable when he decides you have outlived your usefulness.</p> <p>Dominic Cummings will have the full support of Boris Johnson.

      "body": "<p>Many experts are warning that this pandemic will leave a legacy of mental health issues. But these warnings sometimes seem vague. If you want to know exactly what this might mean, your own family history could be the place to start. </p> <p>Mine is probably typical in showing how the psychological legacy of an epidemic can last for many generations. But my history also suggests that living with quarantine and lockdown has been much more a part of social experience than we perhaps realise.</p> <p>Like many under lockdown, I\u2019ve been doing a bit of idle digging and delving into family ancestry. Mainly, I was looking to clear up one or two little mysteries. As a child, I had been the repository of my grandmother\u2019s memories and had always wanted to see if I could put names and dates to her stories. There was, for example, the question of her youngest brother, Sidney, news of whose death in 1915 in the First World War was as vivid for her in her 90s as when she first heard it as a young woman. But had he really volunteered at 15 and his body never been found?</p> <p>Another question was about my grandmother\u2019s daughter, Constance, my father\u2019s baby sister. My grandmother had told me sadly how she\u2019d died of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/mar/31/lessons-from-the-1918-spanish-flu-pandemic-podcast\">Spanish flu</a>, but I didn\u2019t know at what age. All I knew was what my father told me. He\u2019d been playing with his toys outside her room when the doctor had emerged to tell them she\u2019d died. He said he\u2019d felt terrible guilt that he\u2019d been lost in his game and hadn\u2019t thought of her. I\u2019d always wondered whether this had been a factor in his own melancholy, his persistent guilt about things he hadn\u2019t done and his generalised anxiety. The ancestry research confirmed she died aged three, when my father was eight, a loss that would have been traumatic for a young boy. And it was certainly a loss that shaped the family dynamic. The next year, my grandmother gave birth to another daughter, my aunt, over whom she hovered, fussed and imbued with timidity until her dying day.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>My father\u2019s experience of his sister\u2019s death left him chronically anxious, fearful of where the next disaster would strike</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Had this background anxiety of pandemic been a factor when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/polio\">polio</a> epidemic struck in the 1950s? Was it the reason my father injected so much terror into the disease even though the epidemic was largely under control by the time I came along? I can remember as a small child, walking with my parents in areas that, to this day, I still think of involuntarily as \u201cthis is where you catch polio\u201d. Maybe we were passing these places when I was questioning my parents about the children with callipers at my primary school. Maybe he gave me details of what the disease did (infecting the spine and muscle wasting). I remember he said it was in the soil, but that was probably his euphemism for faeces. What he did give me was a pretty deep-rooted fear of contagion and a lifelong commitment to frequent hand-washing.</p> <p>Contagious diseases were pretty much the stuff of my childhood. Most of the big illnesses \u2013 German measles (now considered mild), measles and mumps \u2013 all required quarantine. Children were often away from school for long periods, kept at home for over a fortnight, so there was no risk of spreading to other children. Written at an earlier period, in the 1930s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/arthur-ransome\">Arthur Ransome</a>\u2019s <em>Winter Holiday</em> immortalised the issue of quarantine. The children are quarantined and unable to return to boarding school when their friend Nancy, \u201ccaptain of the Amazons\u201d, develops mumps and is confined to her bedroom. For the most part, anxiety was pretty palpable. I remember my mother considering it lucky that I\u2019d got away with a few spots for chicken pox while my siblings had been covered. \u201cNone of the marks and all of the immunity,\u201d she said triumphantly.</p> <p>Some might be inclined to interpret my experience as indicating how these epidemics are part of the natural cycle that we\u2019ve always lived with. Those people assume most children find ways to deal robustly with the pervasive anxiety. And it\u2019s true that many children, given reassurance, can emerge without psychological damage. Patrick Cockburn\u2019s remarkable <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n09/patrick-cockburn/diary\">account</a> (in the <em>London Review of Books</em>) of catching polio during the epidemic in Cork is a powerful evocation of the fears and uncertainties of that epidemic but also an account of a child overcoming anxiety. But my memories suggest that epidemics that leave vague but powerful anxieties can cast a long shadow. My father\u2019s experience of his sister\u2019s death left him chronically anxious, fearful of where the next disaster would strike, and this was particularly acute around his children. I wish I could say I shrugged it off. But the truth is I picked up a lot of his anxiety, as any child does with an anxious parent. This is why <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52295894\">mental health charities and psychiatrists</a> are saying there is an urgent need to monitor the \u201cprofound\u201d effect on people\u2019s mental health \u2013 now and in the future.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/italy-lockdown-mental-health-psychologists-coronavirus\">Italy's lockdown has taken heavy toll on mental health, say psychologists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s something particularly difficult about losing someone in an epidemic.

      "body": "<p>As Madrid and Barcelona prepare for the next phase of lockdown loosening, they have radically different visions for how best to return to that crucial part of Spanish life, sitting on a <em>terraza</em>, cup, glass or snack in hand.</p> \n<p>The two-month shutdown has given restaurateurs plenty of time to weigh up their options. But hopes that the reopening of outside tables will even begin to make up for the lost income appear wildly premature.</p> \n<p>When terraces reopen on Monday, they will have to operate at 50% capacity and tables will need to be spaced 2 metres from one another.</p> \n<p>Madrid city council has said the capital\u2019s 5,323 terraces will accordingly be able to extend along building fronts, across unpaved areas and even, in exceptional circumstances, into parking bays.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve sought to increase flexibility when it came to previous restrictions to contribute to the city\u2019s economic reactivation without reducing the rights of businesses or residents,\u201d it <a href=\"https://www.madrid.es/portales/munimadrid/es/Inicio/El-Ayuntamiento/Todas-las-noticias/El-Ayuntamiento-de-Madrid-establece-medidas-para-la-reapertura-de-terrazas-en-la-ciudad/?vgnextfmt=default&amp;vgnextoid=6ea5a90092722710VgnVCM2000001f4a900aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=e40362215c483510VgnVCM2000001f4a900aRCRD\">said in a statement</a>.</p> \n<p>But Juan Jos\u00e9 Blardony, the head of the capital\u2019s 138-year-old hospitality association, <a href=\"https://www.hosteleriamadrid.com/\">Hosteler\u00eda Madrid</a>, says that while his members are desperate to reopen, terrace-only operations simply won\u2019t be worth it for most of them.</p> \n<p>Although Madrid boasts some state-of-the-art terraces, complete with mists of cooling water in summer and industrial heaters in winter, the majority of them are far simpler and far smaller.</p> \n<p>\u201cMost places that have terraces only have small ones, so it\u2019s not really viable for them to open up just for two, three, or four tables,\u201d said Blardony.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe think there will be demand from people who live in Madrid, but most of the terraces are too small. You\u2019ve got the problem of having to take workers off temporary furloughs to do it. That all suggests to us that we won\u2019t see more than 5% of terraces opening.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In Barcelona, the city authorities have decreed that to compensate for losses incurred by social distancing, the 5,500 bars and restaurants that have licensed terraces may apply to extend the terrace to accommodate four more tables, each with four chairs.</p> \n<p>In exceptional circumstances, this could be extended to six. A further 3,500 establishments, including hotels and bakeries, that don\u2019t have terraces, may also apply.</p> \n<p>The catch, however, is they can only expand by occupying existing road space or parking areas. Under no circumstances can they take space away from pedestrians. In other words, pavement caf\u00e9s can\u2019t take up more pavement.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have a vision of a city that takes into account everyone\u2019s interests,\u201d Jaume Collboni, the deputy mayor told a press conference earlier this week.</p> \n<p>Bar and restaurant owners will have to apply if they want to occupy the street. Collboni gave an assurance that applications would be dealt with within a maximum of two weeks.</p> \n<p>However, in much of the city the stretch of road nearest the pavement is a bus or cycle lane, so many see the plan as unworkable.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn reality, the possibility of enlarging terraces is very limited and the process will be very slow,\u201d said Roger Pallarols, the president of the Barcelona Restaurant Association.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe pavement is the natural place for a terrace to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only are there often no alternatives, it\u2019s also quicker and cheaper to use the pavement.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nor is it clear how the rule would apply in squares or pedestrianised zones such as la Rambla where terraces can only occupy 15% of the total area.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlthough there is no consensus over the text, we could still arrive at a consensus on its application,\u201d Pallarols insisted.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt seems a good idea to let us have more tables but how are they going to make it work?\u201d asked Patrick Pescetto, who co-founded the Buenas Migas chain of caf\u00e9s in the city in 1988. \u201cWhen you phone the town hall, no one has a clue what to do about it.</p> \n<p>\u201cAda Colau, the mayor, got votes because people were fed up with tourism. Now there aren\u2019t any tourists, it\u2019s her chance to get votes by helping business to get back on its feet,\u201d Pescetto said. \u201cWe employ 150 local people. Having lots of terraces in Barcelona for the people of Barcelona to enjoy would be a wonderful thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Others are less philosophical.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey have no concept of what is happening to business in this city,\u201d said one anonymous restaurateur.</p> \n<p>\u201cMost restaurants will end up with half the number of tables \u2013 in most cases two to four \u2013 for months while having to pay rent and staff. It\u2019s impossible.

      "bodyText": "As Madrid and Barcelona prepare for the next phase of lockdown loosening, they have radically different visions for how best to return to that crucial part of Spanish life, sitting on a terraza, cup, glass or snack in hand. The two-month shutdown has given restaurateurs plenty of time to weigh up their options. But hopes that the reopening of outside tables will even begin to make up for the lost income appear wildly premature. When terraces reopen on Monday, they will have to operate at 50% capacity and tables will need to be spaced 2 metres from one another. Madrid city council has said the capital\u2019s 5,323 terraces will accordingly be able to extend along building fronts, across unpaved areas and even, in exceptional circumstances, into parking bays. \u201cWe\u2019ve sought to increase flexibility when it came to previous restrictions to contribute to the city\u2019s economic reactivation without reducing the rights of businesses or residents,\u201d it said in a statement. But Juan Jos\u00e9 Blardony, the head of the capital\u2019s 138-year-old hospitality association, Hosteler\u00eda Madrid, says that while his members are desperate to reopen, terrace-only operations simply won\u2019t be worth it for most of them. Although Madrid boasts some state-of-the-art terraces, complete with mists of cooling water in summer and industrial heaters in winter, the majority of them are far simpler and far smaller. \u201cMost places that have terraces only have small ones, so it\u2019s not really viable for them to open up just for two, three, or four tables,\u201d said Blardony. \u201cWe think there will be demand from people who live in Madrid, but most of the terraces are too small. You\u2019ve got the problem of having to take workers off temporary furloughs to do it. That all suggests to us that we won\u2019t see more than 5% of terraces opening.\u201d In Barcelona, the city authorities have decreed that to compensate for losses incurred by social distancing, the 5,500 bars and restaurants that have licensed terraces may apply to extend the terrace to accommodate four more tables, each with four chairs. In exceptional circumstances, this could be extended to six. A further 3,500 establishments, including hotels and bakeries, that don\u2019t have terraces, may also apply. The catch, however, is they can only expand by occupying existing road space or parking areas. Under no circumstances can they take space away from pedestrians. In other words, pavement caf\u00e9s can\u2019t take up more pavement. \u201cWe have a vision of a city that takes into account everyone\u2019s interests,\u201d Jaume Collboni, the deputy mayor told a press conference earlier this week. Bar and restaurant owners will have to apply if they want to occupy the street. Collboni gave an assurance that applications would be dealt with within a maximum of two weeks. However, in much of the city the stretch of road nearest the pavement is a bus or cycle lane, so many see the plan as unworkable. \u201cIn reality, the possibility of enlarging terraces is very limited and the process will be very slow,\u201d said Roger Pallarols, the president of the Barcelona Restaurant Association. \u201cThe pavement is the natural place for a terrace to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only are there often no alternatives, it\u2019s also quicker and cheaper to use the pavement.\u201d Nor is it clear how the rule would apply in squares or pedestrianised zones such as la Rambla where terraces can only occupy 15% of the total area. \u201cAlthough there is no consensus over the text, we could still arrive at a consensus on its application,\u201d Pallarols insisted. \u201cIt seems a good idea to let us have more tables but how are they going to make it work?\u201d asked Patrick Pescetto, who co-founded the Buenas Migas chain of caf\u00e9s in the city in 1988. \u201cWhen you phone the town hall, no one has a clue what to do about it. \u201cAda Colau, the mayor, got votes because people were fed up with tourism. Now there aren\u2019t any tourists, it\u2019s her chance to get votes by helping business to get back on its feet,\u201d Pescetto said. \u201cWe employ 150 local people. Having lots of terraces in Barcelona for the people of Barcelona to enjoy would be a wonderful thing.\u201d Others are less philosophical. \u201cThey have no concept of what is happening to business in this city,\u201d said one anonymous restaurateur. \u201cMost restaurants will end up with half the number of tables \u2013 in most cases two to four \u2013 for months while having to pay rent and staff. It\u2019s impossible. There\u2019s going to be an economic tsunami and politicians are letting it happen.\u201d The latest move is part of a long-running dispute between Barcelona council and the hospitality industry over terraces and public space. In recent years the council has reduced the number of tables permitted and imposed higher taxes on terraces. For example, the tax on a table with four chairs in the Rambla rose from \u20ac31,38 to \u20ac105,30 a month. These taxes are being waived during the state of emergency and will be reduced by 75% from June until the end of the year, a move that will cost the city \u20ac5m. On Saturday, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, announced Spain would reopen to its much-needed foreign tourists from July. Blardony says that most of his members aren\u2019t thinking about reopening until the end of June when, if all goes to plan, the capital \u2013 and the rest of Spain - will be in the final phase of de-escalation. Counter service will then resume and more people will be allowed to eat inside bars, restaurants and cafes. For the time being though, most of Madrid\u2019s tables and chairs will remain in their chains and solitary stacks. \u201cTerraces have become a big draw for lots of people,\u201d said Blardony. \u201cBoth Madrid residents and tourists want to be more in touch with their surroundings and with city life. They\u2019re a really big asset. Madrid is a very open, cosmopolitan city, and terraces help people socialise.\u201d",

They also have the highest rate of infection statewide, making up a quarter of Illinois\u2019 total confirmed coronavirus cases despite representing just 15% of its population. And, according to a new <a href=\"https://chiul.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY-w-Graphics-5.12.20.pdf\">study</a> from the Chicago Urban League, systemic racism is at the root of the overrepresentation.</p> <p>\u201cStructural racism plays a great role in the crisis,\u201d said Kathie Kane-Willis, director of policy and advocacy for the Chicago Urban League and the report\u2019s lead author. \u201cThis whole crisis has laid bare how unequal and inequitable our society is.\u201d</p> <p>The racial divide in coronavirus has played out nationwide, with some recent data indicating black Americans are dying from Covid-19 at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/black-americans-death-rate-covid-19-coronavirus\">three times the rate</a> of white Americans.

Racial discrimination in the healthcare system, environmental factors in predominantly black neighborhoods, and higher-than-average prevalence of preexisting conditions have also factored into the higher morbidity rates, according to the study.</p> <p>Local leaders, including Lori Lightfoot, the city\u2019s first African American mayor in three decades, have promised to address the disparities, both in the short term and at the structural level.</p> <p>\u201cThis can\u2019t just be temporary scaffolding,\u201d Lightfoot <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-chicago-african-american-population-20200420-c2nyvnq4vrcundwdfvhdldtlfe-story.html\">said</a> last month. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be laying a foundation for a permanent fix to many of the problems that for too long we have ignored or said they are too big to solve.\u201d</p> <p>Chicago and Illinois have implemented some measures aimed at blunting the virus\u2019 impact on the city\u2019s black community, as well as its Latinx population , which has also seen a <a href=\"https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/05/06/coronavirus-cases-more-than-double-in-chicagos-latinx-community/\">surge</a> in confirmed infections and now represents a quarter of the city\u2019s coronavirus deaths.</p> <p>Lightfoot has partnered with community groups in <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-chicago-african-american-population-20200420-c2nyvnq4vrcundwdfvhdldtlfe-story.html\">establishing</a> her Racial Equity Rapid Response Team aimed at addressing the crisis in black and brown communities, and Illinois governor J B Pritzker has ramped up testing in hard hit neighborhoods. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3a1f7b3b69f6534d84eebb79b419bbbfa0989b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3a1f7b3b69f6534d84eebb79b419bbbfa0989b4/0_0_4438_3154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man wears a protective face mask as he walks through the predominately black south side of Chicago.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man wears a protective face mask as he walks through the predominately black south side of Chicago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But black Chicagoans have expressed concern that the pandemic could exacerbate existing inequalities in America\u2019s third-largest city, and are calling for systemic changes.</p> <p>\u201cIs Chicago ready to have a reckoning with the true realities it has created?\u201d said Anton Seals Jr, whose group, South Shore Works, is part of the mayor\u2019s rapid response initiative. \u201cThat\u2019ll answer the question if it\u2019s going to get worse or it\u2019s going to get better.\u201d</p> <p>Seals praised the efforts to increase access to testing and other initiatives by the rapid response team, but said a larger push is needed, particularly among public officials and white citizens, to face up to the \u201cnasty truth\u201d of racism that resulted in the health and economic disparities in Chicago and the country as a whole in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to deal with this super-racialized society,\u201d Seals said, describing the way the pandemic has played out in Chicago as a \u201ctale of two cities\u201d.</p> <p>While some efforts have been made to address the disproportionate toll Covid-19 has taken on black Chicagoans, some here say more needs to be done.</p> <p>A coalition of organizations and progressive lawmakers at the state and municipal levels have launched the <a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/campaigns/right-to-recovery\">Right To Recovery</a> campaign, which is aimed at addressing the \u201cgaping holes in our public health and social safety net infrastructure, as well as the brutal inequality built into our economy\u201d.</p> <p>Amika Tendaji, the Right to Recovery lead for the group Southside Together Organizing for Power, which has been working on housing issues related to the crisis, praised progressive measures to provide relief to communities hard hit by the pandemic, including legislation <a href=\"https://news.wttw.com/2020/05/04/progressive-democrats-propose-bill-canceling-rent-mortgage-payments-180-days-after\">proposed</a> by state representative Delia Ramirez to temporarily cancel rent and mortgage payments in Illinois. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked really hard to put politicians in place that are responsive to their communities,\u201d Tendaji said.</p> <p>But Tendaji expressed concern that top officials aren\u2019t taking bold enough action, calling the image of Lightfoot as a progressive mayor a \u201cfallacy\u201d and calling for structural change. \u201cThis is systemic racial injustice,\u201d Tendaji said.</p>",

Though black residents make up 30% of the city\u2019s population, they account for 60% of its Covid-19 fatalities. They also have the highest rate of infection statewide, making up a quarter of Illinois\u2019 total confirmed coronavirus cases despite representing just 15% of its population. And, according to a new study from the Chicago Urban League, systemic racism is at the root of the overrepresentation. \u201cStructural racism plays a great role in the crisis,\u201d said Kathie Kane-Willis, director of policy and advocacy for the Chicago Urban League and the report\u2019s lead author. \u201cThis whole crisis has laid bare how unequal and inequitable our society is.\u201d The racial divide in coronavirus has played out nationwide, with some recent data indicating black Americans are dying from Covid-19 at three times the rate of white Americans. But according to the study from the Chicago Urban League, those disparities have been even more pronounced in highly-segregated areas like Chicago. Black Chicagoans, the study found, are both more likely than their white counterparts to be infected by the disease and more likely to die from it, thanks to a variety of factors including overrepresentation in service industries where social distancing is difficult or impossible; housing conditions in some predominantly black communities; and higher incarceration rates. The city\u2019s Covid-19 deaths, the study notes, have been concentrated in segregated, mostly black neighborhoods with high poverty rates. Racial discrimination in the healthcare system, environmental factors in predominantly black neighborhoods, and higher-than-average prevalence of preexisting conditions have also factored into the higher morbidity rates, according to the study. Local leaders, including Lori Lightfoot, the city\u2019s first African American mayor in three decades, have promised to address the disparities, both in the short term and at the structural level. \u201cThis can\u2019t just be temporary scaffolding,\u201d Lightfoot said last month. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be laying a foundation for a permanent fix to many of the problems that for too long we have ignored or said they are too big to solve.\u201d Chicago and Illinois have implemented some measures aimed at blunting the virus\u2019 impact on the city\u2019s black community, as well as its Latinx population , which has also seen a surge in confirmed infections and now represents a quarter of the city\u2019s coronavirus deaths. Lightfoot has partnered with community groups in establishing her Racial Equity Rapid Response Team aimed at addressing the crisis in black and brown communities, and Illinois governor J B Pritzker has ramped up testing in hard hit neighborhoods. But black Chicagoans have expressed concern that the pandemic could exacerbate existing inequalities in America\u2019s third-largest city, and are calling for systemic changes. \u201cIs Chicago ready to have a reckoning with the true realities it has created?\u201d said Anton Seals Jr, whose group, South Shore Works, is part of the mayor\u2019s rapid response initiative. \u201cThat\u2019ll answer the question if it\u2019s going to get worse or it\u2019s going to get better.\u201d Seals praised the efforts to increase access to testing and other initiatives by the rapid response team, but said a larger push is needed, particularly among public officials and white citizens, to face up to the \u201cnasty truth\u201d of racism that resulted in the health and economic disparities in Chicago and the country as a whole in the first place. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to deal with this super-racialized society,\u201d Seals said, describing the way the pandemic has played out in Chicago as a \u201ctale of two cities\u201d. While some efforts have been made to address the disproportionate toll Covid-19 has taken on black Chicagoans, some here say more needs to be done. A coalition of organizations and progressive lawmakers at the state and municipal levels have launched the Right To Recovery campaign, which is aimed at addressing the \u201cgaping holes in our public health and social safety net infrastructure, as well as the brutal inequality built into our economy\u201d. Amika Tendaji, the Right to Recovery lead for the group Southside Together Organizing for Power, which has been working on housing issues related to the crisis, praised progressive measures to provide relief to communities hard hit by the pandemic, including legislation proposed by state representative Delia Ramirez to temporarily cancel rent and mortgage payments in Illinois. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked really hard to put politicians in place that are responsive to their communities,\u201d Tendaji said. But Tendaji expressed concern that top officials aren\u2019t taking bold enough action, calling the image of Lightfoot as a progressive mayor a \u201cfallacy\u201d and calling for structural change. \u201cThis is systemic racial injustice,\u201d Tendaji said.",

Once it has the final g0-ahead from the government the developers hope to begin building the Cleve Hill solar farm from early next year, and begin generating clean electricity by 2023. Renewable energy is considered a crucial element in the UK\u2019s plans to end its contribution to the climate crisis by building a carbon neutral economy by 2050, and it could also help spur economic growth in the wake of the coronavirus. The UK\u2019s growing fleet of solar panels has produced record levels of clean electricity in recent weeks, reaching fresh highs of 9.68GW last month and helping the UK energy system to its longest stretch without coal-fired power since the Industrial Revolution. The renewables industry believes the UK\u2019s solar power capacity could rise to 27GW by 2030 after the UK government dropped a block which prevented solar farms and onshore wind projects from competing in subsidy contract auctions.

      "body": "<p>As the nation locked down in March, the staff of Loud and Quiet magazine knew they were in trouble. No gigs or festivals for the foreseeable future dissolved the live music advertising that props up the free monthly publication. \u201cIt was like a tap being turned off,\u201d says Stuart Stubbs, who founded the indie-minded publication in 2005.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s music magazines have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The closure of bars, venues and shops took with it the primary distribution network for the UK\u2019s raft of free music publications. Many suspended printing and went online onlyincluding In Stereo \u2013 which publishes editorialised listings magazines in London, Bristol and Berlin \u2013 the monthly indie-focused DIY Mag, Loud and Quiet, and Crack. In the paid sector, Kerrang!, Mixmag and DJ Mag halted publication as newsstands closed.</p> <p>Last week, Bauer Media announced it was reviewing the future of key brands, among them the monthly Q Magazine, and considering the possibility of digital-only formats, merger, divestment or closure. (Nobody from Bauer, which also publishes heritage music magazine Mojo, was available for comment during the 30-day review period.) The announcement provoked an outpouring of support for the music title, including from authors Irvine Welsh and Caitlin Moran \u2013 in addition to questions about whether the long-beleaguered medium has met its end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"195110af58c964b7042af6f3b77bee5c806ab1bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/195110af58c964b7042af6f3b77bee5c806ab1bb/0_10_768_960/400.jpg\" alt=\"A recent cover of Loud and Quiet magazine.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A recent cover of Loud and Quiet magazine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two freesheets recently sounded the alarm over their future: <a href=\"https://www.loudandquiet.com/short/a-statement-about-the-future-of-loud-and-quiet-and-how-you-can-save-it/\">Loud and Quiet</a> and <a href=\"https://shop.crackmagazine.net/pages/crack-magazine-supporter\">Crack</a> launched emergency subscription packages, stressing they would close without reader support. Stubbs says he had felt embarrassed to ask readers to pay for a free product, even after they upgraded from newsprint to a glossy magazine in 2018. \u201cWe undervalued ourselves quite a lot, which I regret.\u201d</p> <p>The edgy, Bristol-based Crack moved quickly to produce a \u201cdynamic\u201d digital version of their summer issue for subscribers. They don\u2019t know whether the print magazine will return this year. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have a flourishing events industry to support us with advertising,\u201d says publisher Luke Sutton. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a little way to go before we\u2019re out of the woods.\u201d</p> <p>Music magazines have \u201cbeen on the edge of sustainability\u201d for a long time, says Douglas McCabe, of the media research group Enders Analysis. Print advertising has dwindled. There are plentiful free online publications. Key titles have closed: in 2018, NME axed its 66-year print incarnation (the brand survives online). Every year brings headlines about shrinking sales figures.</p> <p>But many British music magazine editors and publishers say they were thriving in straitened times, at least before the pandemic. \u201cThe huge drop-off that most magazines experienced in the early 2010s has, relatively speaking, flattened out for many brands,\u201d says the editor of Metal Hammer, Merlin Alderslade. \u201cMost of our issues in 2019 were actually up year on year.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Geoghegan, the editor of global music magazine Songlines and managing director of Mark Allen Group music publications including Gramophone and Jazzwise, said the brand\u2019s titles were sustainable before March.

      "bodyText": "As the nation locked down in March, the staff of Loud and Quiet magazine knew they were in trouble. No gigs or festivals for the foreseeable future dissolved the live music advertising that props up the free monthly publication. \u201cIt was like a tap being turned off,\u201d says Stuart Stubbs, who founded the indie-minded publication in 2005. Britain\u2019s music magazines have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The closure of bars, venues and shops took with it the primary distribution network for the UK\u2019s raft of free music publications. Many suspended printing and went online onlyincluding In Stereo \u2013 which publishes editorialised listings magazines in London, Bristol and Berlin \u2013 the monthly indie-focused DIY Mag, Loud and Quiet, and Crack. In the paid sector, Kerrang!, Mixmag and DJ Mag halted publication as newsstands closed. Last week, Bauer Media announced it was reviewing the future of key brands, among them the monthly Q Magazine, and considering the possibility of digital-only formats, merger, divestment or closure. (Nobody from Bauer, which also publishes heritage music magazine Mojo, was available for comment during the 30-day review period.) The announcement provoked an outpouring of support for the music title, including from authors Irvine Welsh and Caitlin Moran \u2013 in addition to questions about whether the long-beleaguered medium has met its end. Two freesheets recently sounded the alarm over their future: Loud and Quiet and Crack launched emergency subscription packages, stressing they would close without reader support. Stubbs says he had felt embarrassed to ask readers to pay for a free product, even after they upgraded from newsprint to a glossy magazine in 2018. \u201cWe undervalued ourselves quite a lot, which I regret.\u201d The edgy, Bristol-based Crack moved quickly to produce a \u201cdynamic\u201d digital version of their summer issue for subscribers. They don\u2019t know whether the print magazine will return this year. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have a flourishing events industry to support us with advertising,\u201d says publisher Luke Sutton. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a little way to go before we\u2019re out of the woods.\u201d Music magazines have \u201cbeen on the edge of sustainability\u201d for a long time, says Douglas McCabe, of the media research group Enders Analysis. Print advertising has dwindled. There are plentiful free online publications. Key titles have closed: in 2018, NME axed its 66-year print incarnation (the brand survives online). Every year brings headlines about shrinking sales figures. But many British music magazine editors and publishers say they were thriving in straitened times, at least before the pandemic. \u201cThe huge drop-off that most magazines experienced in the early 2010s has, relatively speaking, flattened out for many brands,\u201d says the editor of Metal Hammer, Merlin Alderslade. \u201cMost of our issues in 2019 were actually up year on year.\u201d Paul Geoghegan, the editor of global music magazine Songlines and managing director of Mark Allen Group music publications including Gramophone and Jazzwise, said the brand\u2019s titles were sustainable before March. Stuart Williams, the publisher at Future Publishing \u2013 home to publications including Classic Rock and Metal Hammer \u2013 said its 13 music titles were profitable in April 2020, \u201cwhen half the shops in the UK were closed and the population was barely allowed out\u201d. Different titles reach their sustainability threshold at different volumes, says Enders\u2019 McCabe. Niche publications, especially, can thrive at smaller publishing companies. \u201cIt is easier for a tiny company to run a magazine at a small profit than it is within the framework of a corporate enterprise.\u201d The previously independent Rock Sound was bought by the small publishing company Syon Media earlier this year. The only difference it\u2019s made, says brand director Andy Biddulph, \u201cis that there\u2019s no bailout \u2013 we live and die by what we create and can monetise\u201d. Last year, the heritage monthly Uncut and the NME brand and website were sold by Time Inc to Singapore\u2019s BandLab. The editor of Uncut, Michael Bonner, describes \u201cthe liberation of working in a smaller, more responsive organisation versus being a relatively small cog in a bigger, non-responsive wheel\u201d. He says the publication had taken a hit during the pandemic, although its strong international subscriber base and online single issue sales had increased and it was otherwise doing well.

No wonder that throughout 2019 and early 2020 there was a sense of tectonic plates being shifted and prejudices being shattered. But then came the Covid\u201119 pandemic. And with it a clawing fear that what had been made could be rapidly unmade.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole industry has been totally rocked by this virus,\u201d says the Women\u2019s Sport Trust co-founder Tammy Parlour. \u201cWe have to acknowledge there is a very real threat to women\u2019s sport, especially as under pressure people often revert to the old ways of doing things.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1288080fb60a0aaca741d82b41a8ba955c6f999e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1288080fb60a0aaca741d82b41a8ba955c6f999e/0_208_3158_1895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leah Galton fires home Manchester United\u2019s first goal in their 3-2 win at Everton on 23 February, the last day of WSL matches before the league was postponed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leah Galton fires home Manchester United\u2019s first goal in their 3-2 win at Everton on 23 February, the last day of WSL matches before the league was postponed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Greenwood/BPI/ Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such evidence isn\u2019t hard to find. When McKinsey produced a report on coronavirus\u2019s impact on the sports industry it grouped women\u2019s football alongside youth and futsal in the sport\u2019s food chain.

      "bodyText": "The images come from a different time and place: before the sporting world became submerged in sepia and nostalgia, before the great stasis began. Dina Asher-Smith running a bend so geometrically perfect it could have been drawn by a compass before rocketing to the first global sprint title won by a British woman. The Melbourne Cricket Ground swollen with a record 86,174 crowd watching Australia win the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup. England\u2019s Lionesses attracting so many converts and casuals to their cause that unheard of numbers \u2013 11.8m people \u2013 tune in for their World Cup semi-final against USA. The most striking sporting photograph of the past 12 months \u2013 that of Megan Rapinoe with her arms wide and chin regally tilted in celebration \u2013 felt like a metaphor for women\u2019s sport itself: standing tall, oozing attitude, ready to take the fight to all-comers. No wonder that throughout 2019 and early 2020 there was a sense of tectonic plates being shifted and prejudices being shattered. But then came the Covid\u201119 pandemic. And with it a clawing fear that what had been made could be rapidly unmade. \u201cThe whole industry has been totally rocked by this virus,\u201d says the Women\u2019s Sport Trust co-founder Tammy Parlour. \u201cWe have to acknowledge there is a very real threat to women\u2019s sport, especially as under pressure people often revert to the old ways of doing things.\u201d Such evidence isn\u2019t hard to find. When McKinsey produced a report on coronavirus\u2019s impact on the sports industry it grouped women\u2019s football alongside youth and futsal in the sport\u2019s food chain. Meanwhile, the incessant chatter about sport\u2019s return focuses largely on men\u2019s sport \u2013 with little concern about the lengthier lockdown of women\u2019s sport. With the FA\u2019s Women\u2019s Super League about to be cancelled, the athletics and tennis seasons in limbo, and the prospects for women\u2019s cricket uncertain, it is entirely possible that professional sport could be female-free zone stretching into the autumn \u2013 aside, perhaps, from an occasional sighting of a female jockey. Contrast that with Germany, where the Frauen Bundesliga will start up again next week. \u201cWe can\u2019t just rush to get men\u2019s sport back and not think about women\u2019s sport,\u201d says Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson, one of Britain\u2019s greatest athletes. \u201cThere has to be a balance and diversity, otherwise some of the strides women have made could be lost.

      "body": "<p>In Hayr\u0131 G\u00fcl\u2019s house, there was a lot to do before the Eid al-Fitr, or <em>Bayram, </em>holiday marking the end of Ramadan began on Saturday. There were traditional sangza noodles to bake, then twist into ropes and pile into pyramids. Special occasion clothes needed to be washed and ironed.</p> <p>Celebrating the Muslim holiday is a freedom G\u00fcl and her four children did not have at home in the northwestern Chinese territory of Xinjiang, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/uighurs\">Uigh</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/uighurs\">ur</a> homeland, where over the last few years the authorities have suffocated the ethnic minority\u2019s cultural practices and turned the entire region into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/18/china-detains-uighurs-for-growing-beards-or-visiting-foreign-websites-leak-reveals\">police state</a> subject to strict surveillance even inside their homes. Up to 1 million people have disappeared into re-education camps in what China says is a necessary measure to stamp out extremism.</p> <p>When the family fled the crackdown in 2016, the 42-year-old was forced to leave her husband and youngest son behind because the state would not issue them passports. Contact with them stopped later that year, and she no longer knows if they are alive or dead. But here in Istanbul, G\u00fcl is grateful that at least some of the 12-million-strong Uighur population have found a place to keep their cultural heritage alive.</p> <p>\u201cI miss my homeland and my family every day. I cry a lot with the pain,\u201d she said at her home in Istanbul\u2019s Zeytinburnu neighbourhood. \u201cI love life in Istanbul. I wish they could be here too. My children have freedom here we could not imagine before.\u201d</p> <p>The relationship between Uighurs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a> stretches back centuries: once connected by the Silk Road, the peoples share a religion, cultural ties and similar Turkic languages. Uighur men who fought for the Ottoman empire rest in the vast second world war graveyards in \u00c7anakkale, or Gallipoli; during the Communist revolution in China in the 1940s, the Turkish republic recognised the breakaway Uighur state of East Turkestan and opened its doors to refugees.</p> <p>In the last few years, Istanbul has become the largest diaspora hub in the world for displaced Uighurs. The community in Turkey numbers approximately 50,000, the majority of which live in Istanbul\u2019s Sefakoy and Zeytinburnu neighbourhoods. About 11,000, like Gul\u2019s family, have arrived recently after fleeing the persecution at home.</p> <p>In exile, Uighur culture has flourished in a way that was impossible in Xinjiang: several publishing houses, bookshops and cultural centres that would have been banned in China have opened in Istanbul. Artists and intellectuals have platforms and audiences for their work; artisanal workshops, many run by women, sell colourful traditional clothing and homewares.</p> <p>At the <a href=\"https://en.nuzugum.org/\">Nuzugum Family and Culture Association</a>, named for a Uighur historical heroine, its founder, M\u00fcnevver \u00d6zuygur, cares for 210 families, giving children a chance to connect with their heritage in Uighur-language lessons after school while their mothers work at the neighbouring textile centre.</p> <p>\u201cAlmost all their husbands and fathers are missing in the camps,\u201d \u00d6zuygur said. \u201cHere we have a strong sense of community and help women become financially independent and look after themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Life in Turkey is not without difficulty \u2013 and an increasing sense of danger. While President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is the only Muslim world leader to publicly denounce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China\u2019s</a> clampdown on Muslim minorities as a \u201ccultural genocide\u201d, as Turkey has lurched into economic meltdown and alienated former allies his stance appears to have softened.</p> <p>Since 2018, Ankara has turned to Beijing for a $3.6bn (\u00a32.9bn) loan, along with Chinese investments in state infrastructure projects and credit swap lines to bolster Turkey\u2019s depleted foreign exchange reserves.</p> <p>Uighur activists say the financial help has come at the <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/turkey-uighurs-china-muslim-internment-camps\">cost of their safety</a>: dozens of people have been detained by Turkish authorities and threatened with deportation.</p> <p>Last year, a woman called Zinnetgul Tursun and her two young daughters were extradited to Tajikistan and then China. She has not been heard from since.</p> <p>Many Uighurs in Turkey report phone calls from Chinese police threatening family members still in Xinjiang if they did not stop campaigning against the ruling Communist party\u2019s policies. Residency paperwork is now harder to obtain, leaving about 2,000 people without the legal right to stay. Humanitarian protection papers promised by the Turkish interior ministry cover access to healthcare, but do not allow recipients to work.</p> <p>Even as China\u2019s long arm infiltrates their haven, some campaigners are buoyed by how the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 crisis</a> has refocused international scrutiny on the situation in Xinjiang.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad that it\u2019s taken deaths all over the world for people to wake up but in some ways coronavirus has been a blessing in disguise for Uighurs,\u201d said Arslan Hidayet, an Australian Uighur activist who now lives in Istanbul.</p> <p>\u201cEast Turkestan, Tibet, Hong Kong are all victims of China\u2019s destructive policies. What the world is learning now is that China will arrive on everyone\u2019s doorstep eventually. There is realistic talk now of sanctions and boycotts against Beijing. We have achieved maybe 20 years of advocacy in the space of a few months.\u201d</p>",

Up to 1 million people have disappeared into re-education camps in what China says is a necessary measure to stamp out extremism. When the family fled the crackdown in 2016, the 42-year-old was forced to leave her husband and youngest son behind because the state would not issue them passports. Contact with them stopped later that year, and she no longer knows if they are alive or dead. But here in Istanbul, G\u00fcl is grateful that at least some of the 12-million-strong Uighur population have found a place to keep their cultural heritage alive. \u201cI miss my homeland and my family every day. I cry a lot with the pain,\u201d she said at her home in Istanbul\u2019s Zeytinburnu neighbourhood. \u201cI love life in Istanbul. I wish they could be here too. My children have freedom here we could not imagine before.\u201d The relationship between Uighurs and Turkey stretches back centuries: once connected by the Silk Road, the peoples share a religion, cultural ties and similar Turkic languages. Uighur men who fought for the Ottoman empire rest in the vast second world war graveyards in \u00c7anakkale, or Gallipoli; during the Communist revolution in China in the 1940s, the Turkish republic recognised the breakaway Uighur state of East Turkestan and opened its doors to refugees. In the last few years, Istanbul has become the largest diaspora hub in the world for displaced Uighurs. The community in Turkey numbers approximately 50,000, the majority of which live in Istanbul\u2019s Sefakoy and Zeytinburnu neighbourhoods. About 11,000, like Gul\u2019s family, have arrived recently after fleeing the persecution at home. In exile, Uighur culture has flourished in a way that was impossible in Xinjiang: several publishing houses, bookshops and cultural centres that would have been banned in China have opened in Istanbul. Artists and intellectuals have platforms and audiences for their work; artisanal workshops, many run by women, sell colourful traditional clothing and homewares. At the Nuzugum Family and Culture Association, named for a Uighur historical heroine, its founder, M\u00fcnevver \u00d6zuygur, cares for 210 families, giving children a chance to connect with their heritage in Uighur-language lessons after school while their mothers work at the neighbouring textile centre. \u201cAlmost all their husbands and fathers are missing in the camps,\u201d \u00d6zuygur said. \u201cHere we have a strong sense of community and help women become financially independent and look after themselves.\u201d Life in Turkey is not without difficulty \u2013 and an increasing sense of danger. While President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is the only Muslim world leader to publicly denounce China\u2019s clampdown on Muslim minorities as a \u201ccultural genocide\u201d, as Turkey has lurched into economic meltdown and alienated former allies his stance appears to have softened. Since 2018, Ankara has turned to Beijing for a $3.6bn (\u00a32.9bn) loan, along with Chinese investments in state infrastructure projects and credit swap lines to bolster Turkey\u2019s depleted foreign exchange reserves. Uighur activists say the financial help has come at the cost of their safety: dozens of people have been detained by Turkish authorities and threatened with deportation. Last year, a woman called Zinnetgul Tursun and her two young daughters were extradited to Tajikistan and then China. She has not been heard from since. Many Uighurs in Turkey report phone calls from Chinese police threatening family members still in Xinjiang if they did not stop campaigning against the ruling Communist party\u2019s policies. Residency paperwork is now harder to obtain, leaving about 2,000 people without the legal right to stay. Humanitarian protection papers promised by the Turkish interior ministry cover access to healthcare, but do not allow recipients to work. Even as China\u2019s long arm infiltrates their haven, some campaigners are buoyed by how the Covid-19 crisis has refocused international scrutiny on the situation in Xinjiang. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that it\u2019s taken deaths all over the world for people to wake up but in some ways coronavirus has been a blessing in disguise for Uighurs,\u201d said Arslan Hidayet, an Australian Uighur activist who now lives in Istanbul. \u201cEast Turkestan, Tibet, Hong Kong are all victims of China\u2019s destructive policies. What the world is learning now is that China will arrive on everyone\u2019s doorstep eventually. There is realistic talk now of sanctions and boycotts against Beijing. We have achieved maybe 20 years of advocacy in the space of a few months.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The lockdown was a nationwide policy: everyone was expected to follow the same rules. It has nevertheless exposed some stark inequalities. Elites have been able to endure the period in comfort, often in remote, spacious holiday homes. Those with office jobs have found themselves stuck in their flats, juggling restless children and Zoom meetings. And at the lower end of the income scale, there are people still showing up for their essential jobs as cleaners, delivery drivers and nurses, with scant childcare support and constant worry about exposure to the virus.</p> <p>These are tense times, with millions of us making sacrifices, some large, some small. Whether\u2019s it\u2019s cobbling together a home-schooling programme while ill yourself, being deprived of the support of extended family or missing a loved one\u2019s funeral, the toll has been significant. It\u2019s no surprise then, that news the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser travelled from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-coronavirus-and-lockdown-a-timeline\">London to Durham</a> with his family while lockdown measures were in place has set off a wave of fury. While the British people have been remarkably forgiving of special privileges for senior members of the government \u2013 such as access to priority testing and tracing for themselves and their families, and early medical support upon diagnosis \u2013 extending this to an exemption from lockdown rules feels like a step too far.</p> <p>From a public health perspective, though, the situation with Cummings presents three problems. First, and most obviously, it undermines the core message to stay at home. This is vitally important because the purpose of lockdown is to buy time to drive down the number of cases to a level that would allow a package of interventions \u2013 including testing and tracing, and isolation \u2013 to take over the job of suppressing the outbreak. If lockdown is interpreted flexibly, or lifted too early, or seen as a symbolic gesture alone, it becomes pointless.</p> <p>Second, Cummings\u2019s actions give an unfortunate impression as far as exposing elderly people to the virus goes. According to Downing Street\u2019s statement on the affair, he remained with his wife and children in a house <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/dominic-cummings-no-10-accused-of-covering-up-lockdown-breach\">near, but separate to, his family</a>, including his mother and father. But to travel across the country to where his parents live inevitably erodes the strong message that precautions to protect older relatives are especially important, given that mortality increases with age.</p> <p>Third, Cummings travelled from London, an area that had a higher number of daily cases, and was ahead on the epidemic trajectory, to the north-east of England, which was less badly affected at the time, but which would soon become one of the hardest hits parts of the country. The lockdown measures were intended to prevent the spread of the virus from hotspots to less-exposed regions.</p> <p>Others advising on the pandemic response have had to resign for far less. This is not a left-right issue. Instead it is about right and wrong, and the government choosing to defend the actions of one of its leading figures over the public health message it has been pushing for the past eight weeks, and which is designed to save lives.</p> <p>Any undermining of that message could not come at a worse time: the UK is facing excess deaths of nearly 60,000, and has one of the highest death rates per capita in the world. There is no functioning test, trace and isolate system in place to take over the job of breaking chains of transmission and support the easing of lockdown. As other countries drive the virus to the margins and celebrate the reopening of shops, hairdressers, schools and businesses, the latest Office for National Statistics survey estimates <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19roundup/2020-03-26\">9,000 daily new cases</a> in the UK. People are suffering from an incoherent public health response, a late and consequently unnecessarily long lockdown, and leaders losing sight of those they\u2019re supposed to serve.</p> <p>While it might be psychologically appealing to believe the worst of the outbreak is behind us, early estimates from antibody tests, which provide a rough guide on what percentage of the population has been exposed, show most countries at under 10%, with cities slightly higher. The <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/05/21/17-londoners-5-rest-uk-have-coronavirus-antibodies-12739901/\">UK\u2019s estimate is 5%</a>, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/14/france-spain-say-large-scale-testing-coronavirus-shows-no-herd/\">Spain 5</a>% and Sweden 7%. This is nowhere near the level of exposure needed for population-wide natural \u201cherd\u201d immunity.

      "bodyText": "The lockdown was a nationwide policy: everyone was expected to follow the same rules. It has nevertheless exposed some stark inequalities. Elites have been able to endure the period in comfort, often in remote, spacious holiday homes. Those with office jobs have found themselves stuck in their flats, juggling restless children and Zoom meetings. And at the lower end of the income scale, there are people still showing up for their essential jobs as cleaners, delivery drivers and nurses, with scant childcare support and constant worry about exposure to the virus. These are tense times, with millions of us making sacrifices, some large, some small. Whether\u2019s it\u2019s cobbling together a home-schooling programme while ill yourself, being deprived of the support of extended family or missing a loved one\u2019s funeral, the toll has been significant. It\u2019s no surprise then, that news the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser travelled from London to Durham with his family while lockdown measures were in place has set off a wave of fury. While the British people have been remarkably forgiving of special privileges for senior members of the government \u2013 such as access to priority testing and tracing for themselves and their families, and early medical support upon diagnosis \u2013 extending this to an exemption from lockdown rules feels like a step too far. From a public health perspective, though, the situation with Cummings presents three problems. First, and most obviously, it undermines the core message to stay at home. This is vitally important because the purpose of lockdown is to buy time to drive down the number of cases to a level that would allow a package of interventions \u2013 including testing and tracing, and isolation \u2013 to take over the job of suppressing the outbreak. If lockdown is interpreted flexibly, or lifted too early, or seen as a symbolic gesture alone, it becomes pointless. Second, Cummings\u2019s actions give an unfortunate impression as far as exposing elderly people to the virus goes. According to Downing Street\u2019s statement on the affair, he remained with his wife and children in a house near, but separate to, his family, including his mother and father. But to travel across the country to where his parents live inevitably erodes the strong message that precautions to protect older relatives are especially important, given that mortality increases with age. Third, Cummings travelled from London, an area that had a higher number of daily cases, and was ahead on the epidemic trajectory, to the north-east of England, which was less badly affected at the time, but which would soon become one of the hardest hits parts of the country. The lockdown measures were intended to prevent the spread of the virus from hotspots to less-exposed regions. Others advising on the pandemic response have had to resign for far less. This is not a left-right issue. Instead it is about right and wrong, and the government choosing to defend the actions of one of its leading figures over the public health message it has been pushing for the past eight weeks, and which is designed to save lives. Any undermining of that message could not come at a worse time: the UK is facing excess deaths of nearly 60,000, and has one of the highest death rates per capita in the world. There is no functioning test, trace and isolate system in place to take over the job of breaking chains of transmission and support the easing of lockdown. As other countries drive the virus to the margins and celebrate the reopening of shops, hairdressers, schools and businesses, the latest Office for National Statistics survey estimates 9,000 daily new cases in the UK. People are suffering from an incoherent public health response, a late and consequently unnecessarily long lockdown, and leaders losing sight of those they\u2019re supposed to serve. While it might be psychologically appealing to believe the worst of the outbreak is behind us, early estimates from antibody tests, which provide a rough guide on what percentage of the population has been exposed, show most countries at under 10%, with cities slightly higher. The UK\u2019s estimate is 5%, Spain 5% and Sweden 7%. This is nowhere near the level of exposure needed for population-wide natural \u201cherd\u201d immunity. Last week saw the largest number of daily new cases in the world, at 106,000, with outbreaks starting to take off in many low- and middle-income countries. The summer months must be used to think ahead, since the winter poses additional challenges. How can a second lockdown be avoided? How can more deaths be prevented? The clear lessons from east Asia are a robust test, trace and isolate system, close monitoring of hotspots such as care homes and hospitals, the protection of health and social care workers, border control and working towards a \u201cnew normal\u201d involving face masks, temperature checks and distancing. Every single person in the world is now affected by this outbreak. How exactly they are affected has more to do with their government\u2019s handling of the virus than anything else. Successful responses have not been correlated with country wealth, but rather with decisive political will and a clear strategy. Just compare the situations in the United States and Brazil with South Korea, Kerala in India, Greece, Vietnam and Senegal.

      "bodyText": "Coach tourism operators have said 40,000 jobs will be put at risk because of the coronavirus lockdown unless their business is reclassified as part of the leisure industry. The body representing 300 coach tourist enterprises across the UK said that as they are not deemed to be part of the leisure sector, their firms are not entitled to benefits such as rates relief. The Coach Tourism Association (CTA) said its members, which run tours throughout Britain and Northern Ireland, generate an estimated \u00a36bn a year for the national economy. The warning comes as more than 2,000 jobs were lost after the collapse at the weekend of one of the largest coach tour operators in the UK, Shearings. Shearings, which is owned by the Specialist Leisure Group, announced the closure of the business on its website on Friday evening: \u201cAll tours, cruises, holidays and hotel breaks booked with the Specialist Leisure Group have been cancelled and will not be rescheduled.\u201d Other coach operators have told the Guardian they have lost hundreds of bookings since the lockdown. One tour guide on Merseyside has switched to driving delivery vans for Argos during the pandemic. John Wales, the chairman of the Coach Tourism Association, said his organisation wanted tour coaches to be treated the same as other leisure industries that have received state fiscal support like restaurants, hotels and pubs. \u201cThe key action we are looking for from government is to recognise coach tour operators as leisure businesses.

He added that coach tours could play a vital role in any \u201cstaycation\u201d surge in holidays in Britain after the lockdown. \u201cCoach operators are understandably aggrieved when they see billionaire airline owners go cap in hand for support from the government, when the largely family-owned coach tour sector delivering holidays for millions of customers is unrecognised and unsupported.\u201d Steve Barnes has been picking up tourists in Liverpool city centre for short-term and day trips around Merseyside for the last 30 years. Last year, Barnes said he sold 33,000 seats and was expecting a rise in demand for his tours this holiday season particularly because 2020 marks 80 years since the birth of John Lennon. During the lockdown Barnes has had to earn a living instead driving Argos vans around the city. He said he had been preparing for 220 coach tours in the first weeks of summer on his \u201cLiverpool Living Memories\u201d trips. These would have included visits to the original homes of the Beatles, The Cavern Club and other attractions connected with the band that two university studies estimate raises around \u00a389m for Liverpool. On a potential \u201cstaycation\u201d surge after lockdown, Barnes said: \u201cThere is the fear factor to consider here.

Consumer confidence after this lockdown will take a long time to build up and in the meantime this industry is going to need proper support. Because halving the numbers on coaches to say 25 to create social distancing on board will just not be economical.\u201d One suggestion to counter cross-infection fears has been to limit coach tours to open top, open air buses only. Across the Irish Sea in Belfast, the coach tour guide Billy Scott said the expected increase in tourist traffic due mainly to a record number of cruise ships visiting Northern Ireland has evaporated. Scott, who ran tours to beauty spots such as the Giant\u2019s Causeway and the set of Games of Thrones, said he knew of one tour operator who had invested \u00a3300,000 in one new coach to cope with the cruise ship surge. \u201cWe got Northern Ireland to be one of the most popular cruise ship destinations and that is why so many people invested heavily in the coach tour industry.

Which will mean 70-seater buses cut to about a quarter to maintain social distancing,\u201d he said. But the CTA insisted that open top buses were not a practical solution for the entire industry. \u201cThe open-top sector is a nice operation used particularly for city sightseeing and not easy to integrate into general day-tour work which needs an all-weather option,\u201d John Wales said. He added that coach tour companies would be ready to provide \u201crigorous cleaning regimes\u201d before and after journeys as well as strictly-imposed hand washing facilities onboard.",

      "body": "<p> \u201cStay at home. Protect the NHS. Drive 250 miles to Durham. Pretend you\u2019re still in London. Visit local beauty spot on Easter Day. Travel back to London. Travel back to Durham. Stay at home. Protect the prime minister. Protect his senior adviser.\u201d Somehow the government\u2019s lockdown slogans have got a lot less catchy over the past 36 hours. How much must Boris Johnson hate Grant Shapps?</p> <p>If it was a punishment beating to send Grant out to do the Downing Street press conference on Saturday, it was waterboarding to ask him to do the Sunday morning media round after, overnight, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/defence-of-dominic-cummings-is-shameful-says-ex-durham-police-chief\">further allegations about Dominic Cummings\u2019s cavalier approach to lockdown</a> \u2013 Classic Dom had morphed into Classic Classic Dom \u2013 were broken by the Guardian, Observer and Daily Mirror.</p> <p>At best, the transport secretary could claim he had a little more expertise in his departmental brief, having been involved in three car wrecks within a day. The question on most people\u2019s lips by the end of the morning was whether Shapps was being deliberately stupid or whether it came naturally to him. The more philosophically minded were also wondering if the two were mutually exclusive.</p> <p>As usual when there is a crisis in government, Boris was nowhere to be seen. His cowardice is rapidly becoming an even greater problem to him than his laziness, incompetence and lack of morality.</p> <p>The prime minister is paralysed with fear. Keep his senior adviser and lose the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/cummings-and-cabinet-cheerleaders-feel-heat-from-social-media-fury\">trust of the entire country</a> and rapidly growing numbers of his own MPs. Or sack Dom and revert to his natural state as a directionless, clueless, ball of ambition laced with need. The further complication is that Boris doesn\u2019t even know if he can sack Dom, as it\u2019s Dom who is effectively running the show.</p> <p>So it was left to the hapless Shapps to defend the indefensible. First on Sky\u2019s Ridge on Sunday and then on the BBC\u2019s Marr Show.</p> <p>\u201cCan we talk about the dualling of the A66,\u201d Grant pleaded, somehow hoping the subject of Classic Classic Dom wouldn\u2019t come up. \u2018Er, no,\u201d Sophy Ridge insisted. Was he still standing by the line taken by most members of the cabinet that it had been perfectly OK for Cummings to have taken his family on a moonlight flit at a time when he himself had no symptoms of the coronavirus and the official government guidelines were for people to stay where they were and put themselves in self isolation?</p> <p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Shapps confidently. The government had always been very clear that no one should really pay any attention to the lockdown regulations. They had really just been a series of vague suggestions and he couldn\u2019t understand why almost everyone had been so supine as to slavishly follow them in an effort not to spread the virus.</p> <p>In any case, it wasn\u2019t as if we were talking about some chav or single mother here: Dom\u2019s parents had their own private estate with a separate outhouse so everything was totally above board.</p> <p>It was all downhill from there. Even though Ridge pointed out that she had broken the habit of a lifetime in giving Shapps advance notice of the questions so he couldn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t know any of the answers, it still turned out that the transport secretary didn\u2019t know anything. In fact he had gone out of his way to know nothing. He couldn\u2019t say if Cummings had stopped for petrol or a pee on the 250-mile journey up north. He couldn\u2019t say if Boris knew Dom was in Durham. He couldn\u2019t say if Cummings had broken the 14-day isolation rule to go to Barnard Castle, though he could quite understand if he had because the town was a wonderful tourist attraction.</p> <p>\u201cCummings is a stickler for keeping to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/18/what-is-uk-government-advice-on-social-distancing-and-isolation-coronavirus\">rules</a>,\u201d Shapps said. A career-ending moment on live TV as Dom would be spitting blood to hear that. Grant would be toast. Cummings\u2019s whole persona has been based on his being a rule-breaker, the disruptor dedicated to breaking up cosy elites. Now here he was being firmly portrayed as a fully paid-up member of the establishment. Moreover, one who was deemed so important to government that the rules that applied to the little people didn\u2019t apply to him.</p> <p>Shapps begged for more time to be allowed to talk about the A66. \u201cIt really is very important,\u201d he said. Hell, if it helped he could even talk about a new cycle path in St Albans due to open in 2023. Or a new ferry service across the Ouse.</p> <p>But Ridge was having none of it. She went for Shapps forensically, and time and again all he could do was smile vacantly, just playing for time knowing that at some point his ordeal would come to an end.</p> <p>Except it was only just starting as Andrew Marr would be covering much the same ground little more than half an hour later. If anything the outing on Sky had only left Shapps more traumatised rather than better prepared as he became more and more sweaty and less and less coherent during the course of the interview. A low bar admittedly.</p> <p>The Durham police were basically a bunch of liars who had been caught out telling the truth. And even if Dom had been to Barnard Castle he definitely hadn\u2019t gone walking in a bluebell wood on a second visit to the north-east in April, because he had been assured Dom hated bluebells as they were the epitome of bourgeois remainer flowers.</p> <p>So if he and his family had been seen, it must have been one of the many teams of body doubles that have plagued the Cummings family for years now. In any case, even though he definitely hadn\u2019t talked to Dom or Boris over the past day, he knew for a fact that Dom hadn\u2019t done any of this because they had told him so directly. And if there was one thing Cummings and Boris could be relied on for it was their advocacy of the truth.</p> <p>\u201cPlease can we talk about the A66?\u201d Shapps sobbed again. It would save so many lives during the pandemic on the route between Penrith and Scotch Corner. Marr looked at him with something approaching pity. The transport secretary was just collateral damage in a battle No 10 was sure to lose anyway. There was no way for the government to retain credibility with Cummings still in post.</p> <p>As it was, the cabinet had as good as admitted that everyone was free to interpret the lockdown however they saw fit.

      "bodyText": "\u201cStay at home. Protect the NHS. Drive 250 miles to Durham. Pretend you\u2019re still in London. Visit local beauty spot on Easter Day. Travel back to London. Travel back to Durham. Stay at home. Protect the prime minister. Protect his senior adviser.\u201d Somehow the government\u2019s lockdown slogans have got a lot less catchy over the past 36 hours. How much must Boris Johnson hate Grant Shapps? If it was a punishment beating to send Grant out to do the Downing Street press conference on Saturday, it was waterboarding to ask him to do the Sunday morning media round after, overnight, further allegations about Dominic Cummings\u2019s cavalier approach to lockdown \u2013 Classic Dom had morphed into Classic Classic Dom \u2013 were broken by the Guardian, Observer and Daily Mirror. At best, the transport secretary could claim he had a little more expertise in his departmental brief, having been involved in three car wrecks within a day. The question on most people\u2019s lips by the end of the morning was whether Shapps was being deliberately stupid or whether it came naturally to him. The more philosophically minded were also wondering if the two were mutually exclusive. As usual when there is a crisis in government, Boris was nowhere to be seen. His cowardice is rapidly becoming an even greater problem to him than his laziness, incompetence and lack of morality. The prime minister is paralysed with fear. Keep his senior adviser and lose the trust of the entire country and rapidly growing numbers of his own MPs. Or sack Dom and revert to his natural state as a directionless, clueless, ball of ambition laced with need. The further complication is that Boris doesn\u2019t even know if he can sack Dom, as it\u2019s Dom who is effectively running the show. So it was left to the hapless Shapps to defend the indefensible. First on Sky\u2019s Ridge on Sunday and then on the BBC\u2019s Marr Show. \u201cCan we talk about the dualling of the A66,\u201d Grant pleaded, somehow hoping the subject of Classic Classic Dom wouldn\u2019t come up. \u2018Er, no,\u201d Sophy Ridge insisted. Was he still standing by the line taken by most members of the cabinet that it had been perfectly OK for Cummings to have taken his family on a moonlight flit at a time when he himself had no symptoms of the coronavirus and the official government guidelines were for people to stay where they were and put themselves in self isolation? \u201cOh yes,\u201d said Shapps confidently. The government had always been very clear that no one should really pay any attention to the lockdown regulations. They had really just been a series of vague suggestions and he couldn\u2019t understand why almost everyone had been so supine as to slavishly follow them in an effort not to spread the virus. In any case, it wasn\u2019t as if we were talking about some chav or single mother here: Dom\u2019s parents had their own private estate with a separate outhouse so everything was totally above board. It was all downhill from there. Even though Ridge pointed out that she had broken the habit of a lifetime in giving Shapps advance notice of the questions so he couldn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t know any of the answers, it still turned out that the transport secretary didn\u2019t know anything. In fact he had gone out of his way to know nothing. He couldn\u2019t say if Cummings had stopped for petrol or a pee on the 250-mile journey up north. He couldn\u2019t say if Boris knew Dom was in Durham. He couldn\u2019t say if Cummings had broken the 14-day isolation rule to go to Barnard Castle, though he could quite understand if he had because the town was a wonderful tourist attraction. \u201cCummings is a stickler for keeping to the rules,\u201d Shapps said. A career-ending moment on live TV as Dom would be spitting blood to hear that. Grant would be toast. Cummings\u2019s whole persona has been based on his being a rule-breaker, the disruptor dedicated to breaking up cosy elites. Now here he was being firmly portrayed as a fully paid-up member of the establishment. Moreover, one who was deemed so important to government that the rules that applied to the little people didn\u2019t apply to him. Shapps begged for more time to be allowed to talk about the A66. \u201cIt really is very important,\u201d he said. Hell, if it helped he could even talk about a new cycle path in St Albans due to open in 2023. Or a new ferry service across the Ouse. But Ridge was having none of it. She went for Shapps forensically, and time and again all he could do was smile vacantly, just playing for time knowing that at some point his ordeal would come to an end. Except it was only just starting as Andrew Marr would be covering much the same ground little more than half an hour later. If anything the outing on Sky had only left Shapps more traumatised rather than better prepared as he became more and more sweaty and less and less coherent during the course of the interview. A low bar admittedly. The Durham police were basically a bunch of liars who had been caught out telling the truth. And even if Dom had been to Barnard Castle he definitely hadn\u2019t gone walking in a bluebell wood on a second visit to the north-east in April, because he had been assured Dom hated bluebells as they were the epitome of bourgeois remainer flowers. So if he and his family had been seen, it must have been one of the many teams of body doubles that have plagued the Cummings family for years now. In any case, even though he definitely hadn\u2019t talked to Dom or Boris over the past day, he knew for a fact that Dom hadn\u2019t done any of this because they had told him so directly. And if there was one thing Cummings and Boris could be relied on for it was their advocacy of the truth. \u201cPlease can we talk about the A66?\u201d Shapps sobbed again. It would save so many lives during the pandemic on the route between Penrith and Scotch Corner. Marr looked at him with something approaching pity. The transport secretary was just collateral damage in a battle No 10 was sure to lose anyway. There was no way for the government to retain credibility with Cummings still in post. As it was, the cabinet had as good as admitted that everyone was free to interpret the lockdown however they saw fit. But on the plus side we had all learned more about the A66.",

But with no majority and a deeply divided party, he also knew he would need to fight a general election in short order \u2013 and Cummings is the consummate campaigner.</p> <p>For Cummings, the call to Johnson\u2019s side in Downing Street last July was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Not just to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, the ringing election slogan that party legend says was first uttered by a participant in one of his beloved focus groups, but to pursue his other intellectual preoccupation \u2013 reshaping the British state.</p> <p>So total was Cummings\u2019s commitment that he postponed elective surgery in order to take the job.</p> <p>The 2019 election manifesto was peppered with his obsessions, from ensuring government made better use of data science to rebalancing the economy away from London and shaking up \u201cthe broader aspects of our constitution\u201d after Brexit.</p> <p>Other aspects of the programme, including ditching austerity, reflected long-held preoccupations of the prime minister. But it is unclear even to close colleagues what a Johnson prospectus, shorn of Cummings\u2019s influence, would have looked like.</p> <p>So perhaps it is not surprising that, despite musing at last year\u2019s Tory conference that he might not return after the general election campaign, Cummings was back at No 10 in January, seeking applications from \u201cweirdos and misfits with odd skills\u201d to work with him in remaking Whitehall.</p> <p>With a comfortable majority, there was an opportunity to pursue some of his preoccupations \u2013 including boosting state investment in science and shaking up government departments.</p> <p>Johnson has not always gone along with Cummings\u2019s wilder schemes: many of the most radical plans for overhauling Whitehall were ditched in place of modest tweaks, for example.</p> <p>But Cummings is ever-present, and his ability to slice through the complexities of day-by-day challenges is highly prized by Johnson, who is not known for his attention to detail.</p> <p>And just as for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/10/nick-timothy-and-fiona-hill-unelected-advisers-who-acted-more-like-dpms\">Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy</a>, who served May before being ousted after the 2017 election, and indeed for Corbyn\u2019s chief aide, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/19/seumas-milne-quits-guardian-for-permanent-labour-position\">Seumas Milne</a>, too, the boss\u2019s confidence brings with it immense power.</p> <p>One former cabinet minister described Cummings\u2019s attention sweeping across their department like the Eye of Sauron, in The Lord of the Rings.</p> <p>When Boris Johnson carried out a ruthless reshuffle three months ago, it was an open secret that Sajid Javid, the chancellor, resigned more because he had fallen out with Cummings than over any beef with the prime minister.</p> <p>Javid was told he must sack his aides and instead employ a team hand-picked by Johnson (for which, read Cummings). Instead, he chose to resign. It was such an open secret, in fact, that he subsequently joked in his resignation speech about \u201cCummings and goings\u201d at the heart of government.</p> <p>More recently, it was Cummings who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/revealed-dominic-cummings-on-secret-scientific-advisory-group-for-covid-19\">sat on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage)</a> as the prime minister\u2019s eyes and ears (and sometimes, it appears, mouthpiece).</p> <p>And insiders say it was Cummings, above all, who persuaded the laissez-faire, anti-nanny state prime minister to go for an all-out lockdown \u2013 not least because his focus groups were telling him the public wanted clear instructions. That now looks ironic, to say the least.</p>",

As Paul Stephenson, Vote Leave\u2019s director of communications, who was present at the Downing Street party, tweeted the next day: \u201cTotal outsiders in a shell of an office took on the entire establishment and won \u2026 and now the gang are making history.\u201d The result vindicated the team\u2019s sense that they understood the concerns of rank-and-file British voters better than many slicker communicators \u2013 David Cameron, George Osborne \u2013 who believed themselves to be masters of the art of politics. Indeed, in temperament and mindset, the Vote Leavers had much in common with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s cadre of aides, as they took on Theresa May\u2019s government 12 months later. There was an us-against-the-world sense of camaraderie, an appetite for taking risks and an almost gleeful contempt for the political consensus of the past 40 years \u2013 including the tribal party loyalties that usually demarcate Westminster politics. Eton and Oxford-educated Johnson was the Conservative mayor of London when he resigned to join his fortunes with Vote Leave; Cummings too is an Oxford graduate, and his father-in-law owns a castle \u2013 but both believed themselves to be outside the \u201cpolitical elite\u201d. And after their victory in 2016, the Vote Leavers defined themselves and others by which side they had stood on in that torrid summer, and how hard they had fought. Cummings, whose contempt for MPs is legendary, retreated to the sidelines for much of the ensuing three years, as the details of the withdrawal agreement were worked out in negotiations, and then torn to pieces again by the Tory party. But after May resigned a year ago and Johnson took over, Cummings\u2019s appointment was one of the first he made \u2013 and sent a clear signal that his would be a Vote Leave government. With Brexit still hanging in the balance, Johnson valued Cummings\u2019s absolute commitment to the cause. But with no majority and a deeply divided party, he also knew he would need to fight a general election in short order \u2013 and Cummings is the consummate campaigner. For Cummings, the call to Johnson\u2019s side in Downing Street last July was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Not just to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, the ringing election slogan that party legend says was first uttered by a participant in one of his beloved focus groups, but to pursue his other intellectual preoccupation \u2013 reshaping the British state. So total was Cummings\u2019s commitment that he postponed elective surgery in order to take the job. The 2019 election manifesto was peppered with his obsessions, from ensuring government made better use of data science to rebalancing the economy away from London and shaking up \u201cthe broader aspects of our constitution\u201d after Brexit. Other aspects of the programme, including ditching austerity, reflected long-held preoccupations of the prime minister. But it is unclear even to close colleagues what a Johnson prospectus, shorn of Cummings\u2019s influence, would have looked like. So perhaps it is not surprising that, despite musing at last year\u2019s Tory conference that he might not return after the general election campaign, Cummings was back at No 10 in January, seeking applications from \u201cweirdos and misfits with odd skills\u201d to work with him in remaking Whitehall. With a comfortable majority, there was an opportunity to pursue some of his preoccupations \u2013 including boosting state investment in science and shaking up government departments. Johnson has not always gone along with Cummings\u2019s wilder schemes: many of the most radical plans for overhauling Whitehall were ditched in place of modest tweaks, for example. But Cummings is ever-present, and his ability to slice through the complexities of day-by-day challenges is highly prized by Johnson, who is not known for his attention to detail. And just as for Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, who served May before being ousted after the 2017 election, and indeed for Corbyn\u2019s chief aide, Seumas Milne, too, the boss\u2019s confidence brings with it immense power. One former cabinet minister described Cummings\u2019s attention sweeping across their department like the Eye of Sauron, in The Lord of the Rings. When Boris Johnson carried out a ruthless reshuffle three months ago, it was an open secret that Sajid Javid, the chancellor, resigned more because he had fallen out with Cummings than over any beef with the prime minister. Javid was told he must sack his aides and instead employ a team hand-picked by Johnson (for which, read Cummings). Instead, he chose to resign. It was such an open secret, in fact, that he subsequently joked in his resignation speech about \u201cCummings and goings\u201d at the heart of government. More recently, it was Cummings who sat on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) as the prime minister\u2019s eyes and ears (and sometimes, it appears, mouthpiece). And insiders say it was Cummings, above all, who persuaded the laissez-faire, anti-nanny state prime minister to go for an all-out lockdown \u2013 not least because his focus groups were telling him the public wanted clear instructions. That now looks ironic, to say the least.",

MPs including the former minister and 1922 Committee member, Steve Baker, and the chair of a select committee, Simon Hoare, said he should step aside to stop further damage to the government over its response to the coronavirus outbreak.

      "bodyText": "Network Rail has urged potential passengers who do not need to travel to work or for emergencies to avoid taking trains during the bank holiday. The already drastically reduced national train service is undergoing a major overhaul over the long weekend with 490 upgrading projects taking place, it said. Line closures and disruptions include maintenance work on switches and rail crossings between London Victoria and Herne Hill/Peckham Rye. As a result, no Southern or Thameslink trains will be running into Victoria over the bank holiday weekend, Network Rail said. Meanwhile, the company said services between Manchester airport and Liverpool Lime Street to Preston will be affected due to renewal work of the rail track near Carlisle. Other routes affected by this weekend\u2019s national rail upgrade projects include Leeds to Wakefield, where there will no direct service on Sunday or Monday. Andrew Haines, the Network Rail chief executive, urged travellers to plan their bank holiday journeys ahead. \u201cWhile Britain tackles the coronavirus and social distancing is in place, the railway can carry a fraction of the usual number of passengers.

That means some journeys may be different, so if you have to travel please check your journey before leaving home,\u201d he said. The head of tourism on Brighton and Hove council has also urged those living beyond the seaside resort to avoid the city on bank holiday Monday. Councillor Carmen Appich said stewards would be used to direct people to less busy parts of the seafront if the area becomes too busy on Monday. The city council also pointed out that its seasonal lifeguard service will not be operating on Monday. Covid-19 social distancing restrictions interrupted the council\u2019s usual recruitment drive for lifeguards and as a result will start later in the summer. The lifeguards normally patrol Brighton and Hove\u2019s beaches from the end of May until the end of the school holidays in September. Brighton will be one of the hottest places across the UK on the bank holiday with temperatures expected to reach more than 20C on the south coast. Most of the country should enjoy a fine day with spells of warm sunshine according to the BBC Weather Centre. However, in north-west Scotland there will be south-westerly winds bringing in cloud and rain later in the day. The chances of a heavier volume of cross-border traffic bank holiday from Northern Ireland into the Irish Republic, meanwhile, may have increased after the partial easing of restrictions on pubs in the south. According to reports in Dublin, pubs in the Republic can now deliver drinks and sell takeaway alcohol at their premises. The partial easing of the clampdown on Irish bars came about after the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na took legal advice on what pubs can and cannot sell during the lockdown. As long as drinks including poured pints are paid for on licensed premises they can be delivered to customers. However, takeaways from the bars can only be permitted if they are consumed more than 100 metres away from the pub and not drunk in any public place. Some bars in border areas have been running takeaway services, such as O\u2019Flahery\u2019s pub in Buncrana, which is a short drive from Derry in Northern Ireland. Until last week, O\u2019Flaherty\u2019s was operating a \u201cGuinness Express\u201d with poured pints of stout being delivered wrapped in cling film.

But in a reflection of rising public anger, footage shared on social media showed others banging pots and pans in protest. Insults hurled at Bolsonaro as he grappled with his fast food dinner included: \u201cassassino\u201d (killer), garbage and fascist. One female dissenter can be heard screaming: \u201cGet to work, you bum!\u201d The president\u2019s son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, took a similarly provocative stance to his father\u2019s on Friday, reportedly attending a party at a luxury beachfront property in S\u00e3o Paulo state owned by one of the wealthy founders of a laser hair removal company. S\u00e3o Paulo, where 6,045 people have died, is governed by Jo\u00e3o Doria, a prominent rival to Bolsonaro who has been battling to convince its 44 million residents to stay at home. Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Costa, a social activist and pastor in Rio, where 3,905 people have died, said he blamed Bolsonaro for the scale of the tragedy unfolding. \u201cHis behaviour is surreal,\u201d Costa said. \u201cWe are in the midst of a pandemic. People are dying in packed hospitals and you don\u2019t see him shed a single tear. He expresses no regret.\u201d Some saw Bolsonaro\u2019s frankfurter trip as an attempt to divert attention from a snowballing political scandal. The crisis intensified last month when Bolsonaro\u2019s justice minister resigned, accusing the president of meddling in the federal police, apparently in order to shield relatives from police inquiries. An excruciating two-hour video of an expletive-ridden cabinet meeting was broadcast on Friday as part of a supreme court investigation into those allegations. At one point in the session, Bolsonaro attacks critics of his decision to roam Brazil\u2019s streets at a time of coronavirus, snapping: \u201cA bad example my arse\u201d. Costa, a Christian activist, said: \u201cNobody knows where the country is heading. It is chaos \u2013 complete chaos.\u201d",

The scale of the challenge to the justice system posed by the coronavirus pandemic is becoming apparent, as virtual hearings transform business in the higher civil courts but trigger alarms about the fairness of remote proceedings in the family and lower courts.

      "body": "<p>When Dominic Cummings was photographed sprinting out of Downing Street on the same day the prime minister and the health secretary were reported to have developed symptoms of coronavirus, observers might have assumed he was racing to attend to vital matters of state. In retrospect, many will ask whether he was just trying to beat the traffic.</p> \n<p>Over the last 72 hours, Downing Street officials, unnamed sources and ministers have attempted to cast doubt on parts of the timeline of Cummings\u2019s travels.</p> \n<p>But an examination of the public record, placed alongside the Guardian and Daily Mirror\u2019s reporting, means that it is possible to lay out the significant claims and counter-claims of the period in question \u2013 and where questions still remain.</p> \n<h2><strong>Friday 27 March: Downing Street</strong></h2> \n<p>On the day Cummings ran out of No 10, his wife, Mary Wakefield, appears to have been already ill, according to her Spectator article about the experience, in which she says: \u201cMy husband did rush home to look after me.\u201d The article did not mention that soon after he rushed home, the family went to the other end of the country.</p> \n<p>The government has briefed that Cummings travelled north before developing symptoms of the virus, which is said to have struck him over the weekend of 28-29 March.</p> \n<p>Wakefield wrote that Cummings said \u201cI feel weird\u201d and collapsed 24 hours after he came home to look after her, placing their journey north on Friday \u2013 perhaps trying to beat the weekend getaway \u2013 or Saturday at the latest.</p> \n<p>The details of the journey from London remain unclear.</p> \n<p>Did he drive or take the train? On Sunday, the cabinet minister Grant Shapps didn\u2019t know. He was asked whether Cummings had stopped for a break at any point on the four-hour journey accompanied by a small child and a sick wife.</p> \n<p>Despite being given notice of the question by Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge the evening before, and having been in contact with Cummings, Shapps was caught flat-footed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have detail to the point of what time of day, and how many stops,\u201d he said, adding that he was \u201cexpert\u201d in transport matters and would prefer to talk about the A66.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902CjKMcUVtJoty/\" data-alt=\"Dominic Cummings map\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902CjKMcUVtJoty/\">Dominic Cummings map</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In its defence of Cummings, No 10 said the couple had had to travel north in search of childcare from Cummings\u2019s sister and nieces at the property owned by his parents.</p> \n<p>The former Downing Street director of communications Alastair Campbell, among others, described this as guff. He said it was unbelievable that Cummings had to travel 264 miles to get help with childcare.</p> \n<p>But, in the end, Cummings and his wife did not need childcare, No 10 have said, instead relying on the family to deliver food to their door.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tuesday 31 March: Durham</strong></h2> \n<p>The police have said that on 31 March they were \u201cmade aware of reports\u201d of Cummings\u2019s presence in the area.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Durham Constabulary told the Guardian and Daily Mirror that they had then contacted the family to \u201creiterate the appropriate advice around essential travel\u201d.</p> \n<p>The statement confirmed \u2013 for the first time \u2013 that Cummings had left London for the north-east.</p> \n<p>But on Saturday, Downing Street insisted the police were wrong. No 10 said that \u201cat no stage was Cummings or his family spoken to by the police about this matter\u201d.</p> \n<p>This version is now under intense scrutiny. Under pressure to explain the differing accounts, police issued a new statement on Saturday and stood by by the original claim.</p> \n<p>Not just that, it seems the police might have been alerted to Cummings\u2019s presence in Durham by \u2013 his father. And that it was during this conversation that police had \u201creiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel\u201d. </p> \n<p>By Sunday morning, Shapps was disputing a subtly different point. He told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr: \u201cFor one thing the father contacted the police, not the other way round\u201d and claiming that security was the \u201ckey thing\u201d in the conversation.</p> \n<h2><strong>Sunday 5 April</strong><strong>: The \u2018Abba\u2019 sighting</strong></h2> \n<p>The following days, by Wakefield\u2019s account, were a mixture of family idyll and health nightmare, as she made a \u201cpalace out of polystyrene packaging\u201d with their son even as Cummings\u2019s breathing got so bad that she feared he should be in hospital.</p> \n<p>But 10 days after her husband first fell ill, she said, he began to feel better \u2013 just as Boris Johnson went into hospital. That would place the improvement in his condition around Sunday 5 April, although 10 days after the 28th \u2013 the earliest point at which Cummings was said to have been symptomatic \u2013 was 7 April.</p> \n<p>That Sunday, a passerby told the Guardian, they spotted Cummings by sheer chance.

      "bodyText": "When Dominic Cummings was photographed sprinting out of Downing Street on the same day the prime minister and the health secretary were reported to have developed symptoms of coronavirus, observers might have assumed he was racing to attend to vital matters of state. In retrospect, many will ask whether he was just trying to beat the traffic. Over the last 72 hours, Downing Street officials, unnamed sources and ministers have attempted to cast doubt on parts of the timeline of Cummings\u2019s travels. But an examination of the public record, placed alongside the Guardian and Daily Mirror\u2019s reporting, means that it is possible to lay out the significant claims and counter-claims of the period in question \u2013 and where questions still remain. Friday 27 March: Downing Street On the day Cummings ran out of No 10, his wife, Mary Wakefield, appears to have been already ill, according to her Spectator article about the experience, in which she says: \u201cMy husband did rush home to look after me.\u201d The article did not mention that soon after he rushed home, the family went to the other end of the country. The government has briefed that Cummings travelled north before developing symptoms of the virus, which is said to have struck him over the weekend of 28-29 March. Wakefield wrote that Cummings said \u201cI feel weird\u201d and collapsed 24 hours after he came home to look after her, placing their journey north on Friday \u2013 perhaps trying to beat the weekend getaway \u2013 or Saturday at the latest. The details of the journey from London remain unclear. Did he drive or take the train? On Sunday, the cabinet minister Grant Shapps didn\u2019t know. He was asked whether Cummings had stopped for a break at any point on the four-hour journey accompanied by a small child and a sick wife. Despite being given notice of the question by Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge the evening before, and having been in contact with Cummings, Shapps was caught flat-footed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have detail to the point of what time of day, and how many stops,\u201d he said, adding that he was \u201cexpert\u201d in transport matters and would prefer to talk about the A66. In its defence of Cummings, No 10 said the couple had had to travel north in search of childcare from Cummings\u2019s sister and nieces at the property owned by his parents. The former Downing Street director of communications Alastair Campbell, among others, described this as guff. He said it was unbelievable that Cummings had to travel 264 miles to get help with childcare. But, in the end, Cummings and his wife did not need childcare, No 10 have said, instead relying on the family to deliver food to their door. Tuesday 31 March: Durham The police have said that on 31 March they were \u201cmade aware of reports\u201d of Cummings\u2019s presence in the area. On Friday, Durham Constabulary told the Guardian and Daily Mirror that they had then contacted the family to \u201creiterate the appropriate advice around essential travel\u201d. The statement confirmed \u2013 for the first time \u2013 that Cummings had left London for the north-east. But on Saturday, Downing Street insisted the police were wrong. No 10 said that \u201cat no stage was Cummings or his family spoken to by the police about this matter\u201d. This version is now under intense scrutiny. Under pressure to explain the differing accounts, police issued a new statement on Saturday and stood by by the original claim. Not just that, it seems the police might have been alerted to Cummings\u2019s presence in Durham by \u2013 his father. And that it was during this conversation that police had \u201creiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel\u201d. By Sunday morning, Shapps was disputing a subtly different point. He told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr: \u201cFor one thing the father contacted the police, not the other way round\u201d and claiming that security was the \u201ckey thing\u201d in the conversation. Sunday 5 April: The \u2018Abba\u2019 sighting The following days, by Wakefield\u2019s account, were a mixture of family idyll and health nightmare, as she made a \u201cpalace out of polystyrene packaging\u201d with their son even as Cummings\u2019s breathing got so bad that she feared he should be in hospital. But 10 days after her husband first fell ill, she said, he began to feel better \u2013 just as Boris Johnson went into hospital. That would place the improvement in his condition around Sunday 5 April, although 10 days after the 28th \u2013 the earliest point at which Cummings was said to have been symptomatic \u2013 was 7 April. That Sunday, a passerby told the Guardian, they spotted Cummings by sheer chance. The encounter was fleeting but memorable: Cummings was standing outside with his little boy, in \u201cdark coat and thick tartan scarf\u201d, and Abba was playing at full blast. On the same day, the Guardian asked Downing Street about the claims. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a \u2018no comment\u2019 on that one,\u201d an official responded. On the Friday of the same week, after establishing further details, the Guardian asked again. Again, the response was no comment. Sunday 12 April: Barnard Castle Wakefield did not mention that on 12 April \u2013 her birthday, according to Companies House records \u2013 they allegedly made a trip to Barnard Castle, a charming town 30 miles from the Cummings\u2019s family property, described on the English Heritage website as having \u201cfantastic views\u201d and \u201cplenty to do for families on a day out\u201d. That detail emerged in an interview with Robin Lees, a retired chemistry teacher who lives in the town. Lees, who says he has a photographic memory, told the Guardian he was \u201ca bit gobsmacked\u201d to see Cummings, and then was so incensed that he made a note of the family car\u2019s numberplate and checked it online when he got home. While government officials spent weeks refusing to talk about Cummings\u2019s whereabouts, and have since Saturday sought to dismiss the joint investigation as \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201ca stream of false allegations \u2026 from campaigning newspapers\u201d, they have not disputed Lees\u2019s account. His account is awkward for No 10. On Saturday, Shapps \u2013 like other Conservatives who defended the prime minister\u2019s most senior aide \u2013 repeatedly emphasised that after the Cummings family had made their journey across the country, they had \u201cstayed put\u201d. Not according to Lees, they hadn\u2019t. On Sunday, Shapps appeared to change tack. He seemed to say that this trip would have come at the end of the quarantine period. No mention, however, of the fact this trip would seem to be a clear breach of the strict lockdown rules in place at the time. Would a journey to a popular day-trip destination on a loved one\u2019s birthday, 30 miles from the lockdown location, constitute essential travel or compliance with the government\u2019s \u201cstay home\u201d instruction? That Easter weekend, a new government campaign reminded people that even at a time when people might wish to spend time together, the rules still applied. \u201cThe new campaign reinforces the importance of staying at home over Easter,\u201d it said, reiterating the importance of \u201conly leaving your house to buy essentials, to do one form of exercise a day, to travel into work, but only where you cannot work from home, and for any medical or social care need\u201d. Tuesday 14 April: London The 14-day period of Cummings\u2019s isolation would have expired on 10 April, assuming it is counted from when Wakefield appears to have first fallen ill on 27 March. . In a piece for the Spectator, the magazine she works for, Wakefield wrote: \u201cWe emerged from quarantine into the almost comical uncertainty of London lockdown.\u201d No clarification, however, that they had actually emerged into the capital from Durham. The Guardian asked Wakefield to confirm whether the family had been in London throughout the lockdown period, but received no reply. Cummings was photographed back in Downing Street on 14 April, clutching a bag containing a carton of soup, a tangerine and a carrot. Sunday 19 April: \u2018bluebell\u2019 woods Could Cummings have then gone back to the north-east from London? Downing Street is emphatic that he did not. The denial came after another witness claimed to the Guardian and Sunday Mirror that they had seen Cummings and Wakefield on a country walk in Houghall Woods, a beauty spot near his parents\u2019 property in Durham. According to this account, Cummings said: \u201cAren\u2019t the bluebells lovely?\u201d While Downing Street would give no on-the-record comment before publication of the new stories on Saturday, it then issued a statement. It accused the Guardian and the Mirror of writing \u201cinaccurate stories \u2026 including claims that Mr Cummings returned to Durham after returning to work in Downing Street on 14 April.

      "body": "<p>Luton borough council is drawing up drastic cuts to services to avoid bankruptcy after after a coronavirus-related collapse in passenger numbers at Luton airport blew an estimated \u00a349m hole in its budget.</p> <p>The council described the impact of the projected drop in revenue from the airport as a \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d. As the owner of the airport, it was receiving a \u00a320m annual dividend, which has helped it maintain local services despite \u00a3130m of funding cuts since 2010.</p> <p>It has been forced to plan a July emergency budget that will cut \u00a322m, or 16% of its annual spending. \u201cThe airport has held back the tide of austerity in Luton, but coronavirus has broken those defences,\u201d said Andy Malcolm, the council\u2019s cabinet member for finance. \u201cWe are now going to feel the full force of austerity in council services.\u201d</p> <p>Local authority leaders called for a long-term stability plan for councils after figures suggested that continuing income losses from coronavirus-related shortfalls in council tax, business rates and commercial investments would run into several billions over the next few months.</p> <p>Estimates based on the latest monthly government survey of councils\u2019 financial projections suggest that local authorities remain on course for a \u00a39bn-\u00a310bn net shortfall this year, as the extra costs of meeting Covid-19 pressures in areas such as social care and homelessness continue to mount.</p> <p>But there is growing concern that even if cost pressures start to reduce as the lockdown eases, many councils will face long-term structural deficits as record job losses and a faltering economy reduce income from local taxes, rates and business investments.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of residents have already either defaulted on council tax payments or will seek council tax support after losing their jobs. Business rates income is precarious, and some council investments in local infrastructure affected by Covid restrictions, such as sports stadiums and conference centres, look shaky.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has got to understand that much of that income is not coming back overnight and in some cases, not at all,\u201d said Sir Stephen Houghton, leader of Barnsley borough council and chair of the Special Interest Group of Metropolitan Authorities (Sigoma), a network that includes many of England\u2019s biggest cities.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe government has got to decide: is it going to provide money to the places that need it or not?

      "bodyText": "Luton borough council is drawing up drastic cuts to services to avoid bankruptcy after after a coronavirus-related collapse in passenger numbers at Luton airport blew an estimated \u00a349m hole in its budget. The council described the impact of the projected drop in revenue from the airport as a \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d. As the owner of the airport, it was receiving a \u00a320m annual dividend, which has helped it maintain local services despite \u00a3130m of funding cuts since 2010. It has been forced to plan a July emergency budget that will cut \u00a322m, or 16% of its annual spending. \u201cThe airport has held back the tide of austerity in Luton, but coronavirus has broken those defences,\u201d said Andy Malcolm, the council\u2019s cabinet member for finance. \u201cWe are now going to feel the full force of austerity in council services.\u201d Local authority leaders called for a long-term stability plan for councils after figures suggested that continuing income losses from coronavirus-related shortfalls in council tax, business rates and commercial investments would run into several billions over the next few months. Estimates based on the latest monthly government survey of councils\u2019 financial projections suggest that local authorities remain on course for a \u00a39bn-\u00a310bn net shortfall this year, as the extra costs of meeting Covid-19 pressures in areas such as social care and homelessness continue to mount. But there is growing concern that even if cost pressures start to reduce as the lockdown eases, many councils will face long-term structural deficits as record job losses and a faltering economy reduce income from local taxes, rates and business investments. Hundreds of thousands of residents have already either defaulted on council tax payments or will seek council tax support after losing their jobs. Business rates income is precarious, and some council investments in local infrastructure affected by Covid restrictions, such as sports stadiums and conference centres, look shaky. \u201cThe government has got to understand that much of that income is not coming back overnight and in some cases, not at all,\u201d said Sir Stephen Houghton, leader of Barnsley borough council and chair of the Special Interest Group of Metropolitan Authorities (Sigoma), a network that includes many of England\u2019s biggest cities. He added: \u201cThe government has got to decide: is it going to provide money to the places that need it or not? There\u2019s a real possibility that some councils could fall over as a result of this. We need assurances that we are not going to have to go through austerity all over again.\u201d Luton, which spends about \u00a3135m a year on social care, housing, education, refuse collection and roads, said that without government help, it faced \u201cpainful solutions which will drastically affect services\u201d. The proportion of its income from commercial revenue is the second highest in the country after the City of London. The growth of the international airport in recent years \u2013 it directly provides 13,000 jobs locally \u2013 has helped socially deprived Luton grow economically. But just 14,000 passengers passed though the airport in April compared with 1,535,000 over the same period last year, and there is little sign of a quick recovery. The National Audit Office warned in February \u2013 a month before the UK went into lockdown \u2013 that an unprecedented spending spree on commercial property, funded by cheap Treasury loans and aimed at offsetting central government cuts, had left many local authorities \u201cpotentially badly exposed in the event of an economic recession or a property crash\u201d. The Treasury last week indicated that the loans were no longer available. The government provided two cash bailouts for English councils totalling \u00a33.2bn in March and April to help them weather the extra costs of coronavirus, as well as \u00a3600m earmarked for adult social care. But local authorities say in some councils this money will run out in early June, and a longer-term approach is needed. A spokesperson for the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said it was working with councils to understand the costs they are facing. \u201cBy providing councils with over \u00a33.2bn in the fairest way possible, we\u2019re working with them to tackle the immediate pressures they have told us they are facing.\u201d",

A harrowing Facebook post in the name of a 19-year-old from Barrow-in-Furness went viral last week, alleging she had been trafficked for sex across the north of England for years. The post said the latest assault had taken place last Tuesday, in which the woman was allegedly raped by three men and beaten as a punishment for not attending their \u201cparties\u201d during the coronavirus lockdown. Two days later she was in court being remanded in custody. She was sent to jail to await trial after Barrow magistrates found she had broken bail conditions imposed after she was charged with perverting the course of justice earlier this year. She is accused of making false allegations about five men and falsifying evidence about rape and sexual assault between October 2017 and October 2019. On Saturday protesters gathered in Barrow\u2019s Hollywood retail park, beeping their horns and handing out leaflets in support of her case. The woman is being supported by Maggie Oliver, a former detective at Greater Manchester police who blew the whistle about grooming gangs in Rochdale. By Sunday afternoon almost \u00a310,000 had been raised online to help her family fund new lawyers to fight her case. More than 10,000 people had signed a petition demanding the Independent Office for Police Conduct and the National Crime Agency take over the investigation. Det Ch Supt Dean Holden of Cumbria police insisted in a video message last week that officers had conducted a year-long investigation alongside the National Crime Agency and found no evidence of sex grooming gangs in Barrow. The officer\u2019s remarks fell on deaf ears as graphic photographs purporting to show the woman\u2019s injuries were widely shared online as supporters demanded action. The owners of several Indian takeaways in Barrow received death threats after being linked with the woman\u2019s claims. They maintain their innocence, and one said they felt \u201csick to the stomach\u201d about the allegations. Much anger was directed toward the local newspaper, the Mail, and there were allegations journalists had colluded in a cover-up. This was robustly denied by the newspaper group editor, Vanessa Sims, who on Saturday published a defence of their reporting. \u201cSerious allegations of sexual and physical abuse have been made against local businessmen and the community is angry and demanding action.

There is no conspiracy between the press and the police to cover up crimes \u2013 in fact that could not be further from the truth,\u201d she wrote. In relation to the death threats made against takeaway owners in Barrow, Cumbria police said: \u201cA 30-year-old man, from Barrow, was arrested on suspicion of threats to kill following an incident in the early hours of 20 May. He has been interviewed by officers and he has been released under investigation.\u201d The force said it was also investigating the recent abuse claims made in a Facebook post \u201cconcerning reports of physical and sexual abuse committed against a woman, aged in her late teens\u201d. Simon Fell, Barrow\u2019s MP, asked people to contact police if they had information about the case rather than airing it on social media. \u201cBe kind,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in a tinder box, in many cases locked in at home. There is at least one victim in this case. But there are also families and friends who are affected too. What you write online, what you share, and what you say will have consequences. Words matter a great deal. \u201cRemember that there is an ongoing police investigation into these matters. That very fact means that not every piece of information is in the public domain. It is your right to ask questions, but please do not do anything which may jeopardise that investigation. \u201cI am closely monitoring this case and will do everything in my power to ensure that victims are protected, and that justice is done \u2026 Right now, when tensions are high, it is easy to scapegoat. But to do that would be wrong. Doing that risks tarring innocent people and opening a box which is very difficult to close. So, please \u2013 no matter how hard it may be \u2013 I urge you to exercise calm.\u201d",

Peter Varghese, the chancellor of the University of Queensland, told Guardian Australia that universities across the sector would face severe funding shortfalls if lucrative international student markets cannot be quickly revived. Universities have proposed a \u201csafe corridor\u201d plan in an attempt to partially revive the stream of foreign students that funds an estimated 27% of spending by Australian universities. The federal government has indicated it would welcome proposals for \u201csupervised, stringent quarantine\u201d arrangements that would allow students to come to Australia next year. However the success of any plan would remain susceptible to any development in the public health crisis, both in Australia and in source countries for students. Varghese said the uncertainty about when students could return meant it was not possible to yet understand the extent of the financial impact of the coronavirus on universities. \u201cIt is going to depend on when international students will be able to come back into Australia,\u201d Varghese said. \u201cThe University of Queensland can get through this year, but if the borders remain shut next year we\u2019ll be in a different world of pain financially. \u201cMy view is that if we enter next year with our borders closed to international students, then a large number of universities will be in very severe financial difficulty.\u201d Queensland University has come under increased scrutiny over its relationships with China and with has come the suggestion it is over-reliant on Chinese students.

The polling, commissioned by the progressive activist group GetUp, also illustrates the far-reaching impact of the summer of bushfires across the key New South Wales electorate, with nearly six in seven people surveyed saying they were affected in some way. The Liberals fired the starting gun on their campaign on Sunday as their newly preselected candidate, Dr Fiona Kotvojs, sought to emphasise her green credentials by saying she had solar panels on her house and believed \u201cthat humans contribute to that changing climate\u201d. Kotvojs \u2013 who narrowly fell short of winning the seat at the 2019 election \u2013 has been criticised in the past for playing down the central role of humans in contributing to the climate crisis. At a media conference in the town of Murrumbateman, Scott Morrison said the government was committed to lowering emissions and that Kotvojs \u201cknows how to get things done\u201d. She will be facing off against Labor candidate Kristy McBain, the former Bega Valley mayor, who has been campaigning without a major rival candidate for the past three weeks. McBain has sought to highlight gaps in the federal government\u2019s support for local communities during the drought, fire and coronavirus crises. A byelection date is expected to be confirmed in the coming days, with speculation it could be set for 27 June or 4 July \u2013 just before the NSW school holidays. The survey, conducted by uComms on behalf of GetUp, polled 879 residents across Eden-Monaro last Wednesday night. It found 59% of the sample agreed with the statement that \u201cthe government is not doing enough to address climate change\u201d \u2013 including 48% who strongly agreed. About 27% of the sample disagreed with the statement \u2013 including 12% strongly. Roughly 59% of the sample said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supported publicly-funded renewable energy projects to create secure, full-time jobs in the local area, while 17% said they would be less likely to support such a candidate. Of the 85% of the respondents who said they were affected by the recent bushfire events, about 7% said they were affected severely, 21% significantly, 31% moderately and 27% slightly. However, the sample was evenly divided on whether they were satisfied with the federal government\u2019s response and support during the bushfire crisis. The poll\u2019s margin of error was about 4 percentage points. The national director of GetUp, Paul Oosting, said the poll showed people \u201coverwhelmingly want real, urgent action on climate change\u201d. \u201cPeople in Eden-Monaro won\u2019t let politicians forget how their community was devastated by the bushfire crisis,\u201d he said. Oosting said GetUp had more than 6,000 members who lived in Eden-Monaro and they would be \u201ctalking to their community about how we can recover better from the bushfires and create a safer climate future and sustainable jobs with investment in clean renewable energy\u201d. Robynne Burchell, a GetUp member from the southern NSW town of Delegate which was evacuated three times during the bushfire crisis, said the fires were still front of mind for most people as they saw it everyday when they drove somewhere. The federal government has resisted calls to commit to net zero emissions by 2050, even though every Australian state has signed up to the goal and scientists say the world must reach it around the middle of the century to achieve the Paris agreement aspiration of limiting global warming to 1.5C. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, told Sky News on Sunday gas and coal would \u201ccontinue to play a really important role in our system for many years\u201d. Guardian Australia revealed last week that a group advising the government on the Covid-19 recovery argued Australian taxpayers should underwrite a massive expansion of the domestic gas industry. On Sunday, McBain congratulated Kotvojs and said she hoped all candidates would \u201crun a clean campaign, free of dirty tricks, focused on the issues that actually matter to people in Eden-Monaro\u201d. Declaring her central focus would be on jobs, McBain seized on the revelation the jobkeeper program would cost $60bn less than originally forecast to call on the government to expand its eligibility, including to short-term casuals. It is unclear whether the Nationals will preselect their own candidate for the seat after John Barilaro, the NSW deputy premier, pulled out of the race a few weeks ago amid tensions with the federal Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, and the Liberal state minister Andrew Constance, who also abandoned plans to run.",

Headspace is great,\u201d Vine says.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut Headspace looks after people with a spectrum of need that doesn\u2019t extend into when they are very acute or very high risk and at that point they need to go to the state system. It\u2019s not always a seamless transition.\u201d</p> \n<p>In an interview with the Guardian, Vine, a consultant psychiatrist with more than 25 years\u2019 experience, says the usual punter might face \u201cthree different routes of access to what might be providing similar or overlapping services\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is a risk in some duplication,\u201d she says. \u201cCertainly some people get sick of saying, when I go to a new provider I have to give the same story all over again.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Leanne Beagley, the chief executive of Mental Health Australia, told the Guardian duplication is a real concern but adds \u201cI think the problem of lack of services is more of a problem\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe point of having doctors \u2026 to lead the decision making around healthcare has not been brought up more powerfully than the chief medical officer Brendan Murphy\u2019s work around the pandemic,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s exciting in Ruth\u2019s appointment is having that kind of medical leadership around mental health to match what\u2019s been there for health.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Financial stress a risk factor for mental health</h2> \n<p>Collie is part of a team of academics tracking the impact of job losses during the pandemic. The team has already garnered <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20093773v1\">some preliminary findings from interviews with around 1,000 people</a> who have lost work hours or their jobs.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe main findings are really high levels of psychological distress, 31% of people we\u2019ve surveyed so far are telling us on a standardised scale they have severe psychological distress,\u201d Collie told the Guardian. \u201cOver 40% reported moderate psychological distress.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to look at why that\u2019s occurring and one of the main causes is financial distress. We\u2019ve got millions of people in Australia who\u2019ve gone from having an income and having money, to having no income or very little almost overnight.</p> \n<p>\u201cHappily, we are finding people who are maintaining social connections, which is quite difficult, are less likely to be impacted by this psychological distress.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Collie notes that others, about 30%, are drinking more alcohol to cope with their new situation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hickie\u2019s research, meanwhile, suggests a link between the increase in the number of suicides and the unemployment rate.</p> \n<p>Collie and Beagley both hope Vine will go beyond the usual bounds of advice around service delivery in health care, and advocate on issues such as an adequate rate of the jobseeker payment.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe do know the things that predict the onset of poor mental health.

Asked for her view on the research, which predicted suicides could spike by between 750 and 1,500 deaths per year, Vine says: \u201cI\u2019m not aware how they factored in mitigating issues like some of the improved service in reach or consideration of people, particularly high-risk groups, accessing services. \u201cAnd the whole emphasis on some of the broader community things like schools and allowing family groups to get back together and allowing some greater movement. \u201cI\u2019m aware of it, I think it\u2019s interesting, but I just think it\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d High-profile mental health advocates Prof Patrick McGorry and Sydney University\u2019s Prof Ian Hickie, who led the suicide research released by the Brain and Mind Centre, were behind the push to create the new role filled by Vine, who is Victoria\u2019s former chief psychiatrist. Hickie, a former national mental health commissioner, told the Guardian he is \u201cvery surprised\u201d by Vine\u2019s comments. He notes the health minister, Greg Hunt, confirmed he would consider the study as part of the government\u2019s response to the pandemic. Hickie says the \u201cassumptions built into the model (notably on employment, social disconnection, health services capability) are all in the public domain\u201d and says these services generally have \u201cnegligible additional effects\u201d while some \u201cmay actually make the situation worse\u201d. \u201cThe models are place-based, detailed and increasingly supported by similar modelling exercises in USA and reviews of past economic impacts on suicide rates.\u201d \u2018$40-odd-million isn\u2019t really going to do a lot\u2019 The government last week announced a $48m mental funding package that included extra money for services including Kids Helpline and Lifeline, a new \u201cIt\u2019s okay not to be okay\u201d awareness campaign, and other measures. It also appointed Vine to the powerful Australian Health Protection Principal Committee and released the National Mental Health and Wellbeing Pandemic Response Plan, which was led by the NSW and Victorian governments. Some, like Hickie and the Monash University researcher Alex Collie, were not blown away by the scale of investment. \u201cIt seems small compared to the scale of what we\u2019re seeing in the community,\u201d Collie says. \u201cInvestment of $40-odd-million isn\u2019t really going to do a lot.\u201d Experts have long warned about gaps in services for people whose mental health had significant impact on their day-to-day lives but who did not need hospital care. Vine cites this as a concern, as well as the integration of services between the commonwealth and state systems. \u201cThe commonwealth has funded Headspace. Headspace is great,\u201d Vine says. \u201cBut Headspace looks after people with a spectrum of need that doesn\u2019t extend into when they are very acute or very high risk and at that point they need to go to the state system. It\u2019s not always a seamless transition.\u201d In an interview with the Guardian, Vine, a consultant psychiatrist with more than 25 years\u2019 experience, says the usual punter might face \u201cthree different routes of access to what might be providing similar or overlapping services\u201d. \u201cThere is a risk in some duplication,\u201d she says. \u201cCertainly some people get sick of saying, when I go to a new provider I have to give the same story all over again.\u201d Dr Leanne Beagley, the chief executive of Mental Health Australia, told the Guardian duplication is a real concern but adds \u201cI think the problem of lack of services is more of a problem\u201d. \u201cThe point of having doctors \u2026 to lead the decision making around healthcare has not been brought up more powerfully than the chief medical officer Brendan Murphy\u2019s work around the pandemic,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2019s exciting in Ruth\u2019s appointment is having that kind of medical leadership around mental health to match what\u2019s been there for health.\u201d Financial stress a risk factor for mental health Collie is part of a team of academics tracking the impact of job losses during the pandemic. The team has already garnered some preliminary findings from interviews with around 1,000 people who have lost work hours or their jobs. \u201cThe main findings are really high levels of psychological distress, 31% of people we\u2019ve surveyed so far are telling us on a standardised scale they have severe psychological distress,\u201d Collie told the Guardian. \u201cOver 40% reported moderate psychological distress.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to look at why that\u2019s occurring and one of the main causes is financial distress. We\u2019ve got millions of people in Australia who\u2019ve gone from having an income and having money, to having no income or very little almost overnight. \u201cHappily, we are finding people who are maintaining social connections, which is quite difficult, are less likely to be impacted by this psychological distress.\u201d But Collie notes that others, about 30%, are drinking more alcohol to cope with their new situation. Hickie\u2019s research, meanwhile, suggests a link between the increase in the number of suicides and the unemployment rate. Collie and Beagley both hope Vine will go beyond the usual bounds of advice around service delivery in health care, and advocate on issues such as an adequate rate of the jobseeker payment. \u201cWe do know the things that predict the onset of poor mental health. People\u2019s financial circumstances is one of those,\u201d Collie says. \u201cUnemployment is a risk factor but there is a set of reasons, it\u2019s financial stress.\u201d Vine is guarded when asked if she has concerns about the withdrawal of income supports such as the boosted rate of the jobseeker payment. \u201cThose decisions are, of course, complicated ones,\u201d Vine says. \u201cI think it\u2019s simplistic to say that that is, if you like, the only element. My big concern is more about the social connectedness and people\u2019s engagement with their families and communities. \u201cOf course there will be an impact if people lose financial advantage or if people are unable to sustain their tenancy or their rent or their mortgage repayments. \u201cThose things have much broader implications and some of those implications are around mental health.\u201d Asked what she thinks the impact of the pandemic has been on Australians\u2019 mental health so far, Vine suggests it might be too early to say for sure. \u201cWe know there has been increased demand on help lines, but also know a lot of those calls are around loneliness or social connection. Loneliness is not a mental illness, but it is a very unpleasant emotion. \u201cWe can say people are more worried, because there are so many uncertainties. By and large, we love to know stuff, we love to feel we are being fully informed. We don\u2019t like surprises. That\u2019s been a real problem during the pandemic. \u201cThere has been that uncertainty about when things will shift back, what the impact on employment will be in the longer term. \u201cI think we\u2019re still living with that uncertainty, although probably a bit less.\u201d In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. Other international suicide helplines can be found at befrienders.org",

Its cities are separated from the smaller centres and each other by long stretches of empty space.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s epidemic may also have looked different if we did not have to ourselves an island at the bottom of the world, on the way to nowhere except New Zealand, which has been similarly fortunate in having no land borders.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A persistent Australian trait is to be absent-minded about its location in the world, or to imagine it is owed something by other nations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The government may finally have started listening to advice towards the end of Q1, but it cannot take credit for geography.</p> <p>Perhaps this is not all blind luck. Australia, after all, has a health system that mostly functions and is in theory universally accessible.</p> <p>Had there been sick people in January or February, there would have been no obstacle to them seeking care, and maybe the illness would have been detected.</p> <p>However, many of the worst-affected countries in Europe \u2013 such as Italy and France \u2013 have health systems that on some measures best Australia\u2019s. And recall that the public health system is one that the Liberal party temperamentally loathes. While it has become politically risky to launch frontal assaults on Medicare, the Liberal party has spent a quarter of a century eroding to the extent possible.</p> <p>If Morrison has found it within himself to get us to this point, it\u2019s no thanks to his party\u2019s record on matters of public health.</p> <p>Another persistent Australian trait is the tendency to be absent-minded about the country\u2019s location in the world, or to imagine that we are owed something by other nations.</p> <p>The US has been the guarantor of Australia\u2019s security and that of the trade routes it depends on. To the extent that America will not be preoccupied with its own internal chaos, it will be moving to a more confrontational stance with China, Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner.</p> <p>Throughout this virus, many Australian eyes have fixed on America. I can understand why. The scale of the disaster in my country of residence compels attention; the Trump administration has screwed the pooch. The course of events has offered Australia its sweetest guilty pleasure: the assertion that as bad, as unequal, as racist as our society may be, at least we are not America.</p> <p>But in our media, Australia\u2019s closest neighbours, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, have been almost forgotten. They seem on the surface to be managing well, but there are questions about the extent of testing in both. Any threat to their stability is a threat to Australia\u2019s. As our neighbours, they deserve our assistance. All of this has mostly been ignored.</p> <p>In matters foreign and domestic, the biggest danger now is complacency.</p> <p>Many of those urging us to open up all at once appear to believe that they are dealing with a known quantity with which they can conclude a deal.</p> <p>But as the Chinese president Xi Jinping, memorably asserted: \u201cThis epidemic is a demon, and we cannot allow this demon to hide.\u201d Covid-19 is as protean as it is malevolent; each day seems to bring news of it taking on a new shape.</p> <p>In Britain, children have been affected by a strange rash which may be related to the pandemic. In the US, children have come down with a Kawasaki-like syndrome which may also be associated with Covid-19. The virus has been found lingering on cardboard and other hard surfaces for days. It has been detected in the semen of men who have appeared to recover from it. The death toll is likely to be in the millions; there is emerging evidence that many whose lives are spared suffer lasting pulmonary and neurological damage.</p> <p>We simply do not know what it might do, what its final shape may be, or whether there will ever be a vaccine.</p> <p>If you take all of this seriously \u2013 and accept that the disease has precisely benefited from a liberalised regime of global trade that Australia has optimised its policy settings to exploit \u2013 the idea that we can ever go back to business as usual seems fanciful.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t take it seriously, these problems disappear. This is what many conservative commentators have opted for.</p> <p>But this virus does not make deals. It is changing the world. It will change Australia, too. There is no reason to think that those changes will be comfortable. And we have no idea what it may do next.</p> <p>Australians need to keep their heads on straight. We are not yet safe. Australia\u2019s luck may not hold out.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jason Wilson is a columnist for Guardian Australia</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",

If the authoritarianism of the Chinese government played a part in concealing the virus\u2019s initial spread, and even the fact of person-to-person transmission, it also has foreclosed on any possibility of a US-style mass protest against confinement. Even though there are indications that in some states, at least, the US is obfuscating figures, it\u2019s not yet able to reproduce a coercive Huubei-style lockdown. Importantly, though, China and neighbours like South Korea and Vietnam have had recent experience with similar viral outbreaks. After Sars and Mers, from masks, to fever clinics, to social isolation, people in this region know the drill. They understand that epidemics can happen, and that they frequently demand personal sacrifices. When it reached the United States, coronavirus revealed the country\u2019s pronounced racial and economic inequalities. It has disproportionately affected the working class and the racial minorities that comprise it. The meat packing plants, prisons and nursing homes it has torn through do not only demand close quarter work: in the US they are patchily unionised and frequently staffed with recent migrants who often have little or no access to healthcare. It is a terrible irony that in the world\u2019s wealthiest economy the food supply has been stuttering. (I live in the US. On my last visit to the supermarket I was restricted to two items of meat.) The food workers that white Americans generally have the luxury of ignoring are not protected from the ravages of this demonic pathogen. The response in America is also being hindered by American polarisation and irrationalism: many of those protesting against coronavirus lockdowns have been present at Trump rallies throughout the president\u2019s tenure. Australia\u2019s experience has also been shaped by some enduring national attributes. One is the tendency to misrecognise miraculous good fortune as good management, and an associated weakness for self-congratulation. After Australia\u2019s belated start on measures like social distancing, many subsequent decisions were good. But Australia was fortunate in that, unlike the US and much of Europe and Asia, it did not have any undetected community transmissions in February or earlier. In that month, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, was still encouraging people to attend sporting events. Had Australia had community transmissions in February or earlier, as did California, Lombardy, or \u00cele-de-France, this would all look very different. Australia is also laid out in a providential manner. It has just two population centres of a size and density comparable to badly affected metros like Seattle or Milan. It has none comparable to London, New York or Los Angeles. Its cities are separated from the smaller centres and each other by long stretches of empty space. Australia\u2019s epidemic may also have looked different if we did not have to ourselves an island at the bottom of the world, on the way to nowhere except New Zealand, which has been similarly fortunate in having no land borders. The government may finally have started listening to advice towards the end of Q1, but it cannot take credit for geography. Perhaps this is not all blind luck. Australia, after all, has a health system that mostly functions and is in theory universally accessible. Had there been sick people in January or February, there would have been no obstacle to them seeking care, and maybe the illness would have been detected. However, many of the worst-affected countries in Europe \u2013 such as Italy and France \u2013 have health systems that on some measures best Australia\u2019s. And recall that the public health system is one that the Liberal party temperamentally loathes. While it has become politically risky to launch frontal assaults on Medicare, the Liberal party has spent a quarter of a century eroding to the extent possible. If Morrison has found it within himself to get us to this point, it\u2019s no thanks to his party\u2019s record on matters of public health. Another persistent Australian trait is the tendency to be absent-minded about the country\u2019s location in the world, or to imagine that we are owed something by other nations. The US has been the guarantor of Australia\u2019s security and that of the trade routes it depends on. To the extent that America will not be preoccupied with its own internal chaos, it will be moving to a more confrontational stance with China, Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner. Throughout this virus, many Australian eyes have fixed on America. I can understand why. The scale of the disaster in my country of residence compels attention; the Trump administration has screwed the pooch. The course of events has offered Australia its sweetest guilty pleasure: the assertion that as bad, as unequal, as racist as our society may be, at least we are not America. But in our media, Australia\u2019s closest neighbours, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, have been almost forgotten. They seem on the surface to be managing well, but there are questions about the extent of testing in both. Any threat to their stability is a threat to Australia\u2019s. As our neighbours, they deserve our assistance. All of this has mostly been ignored. In matters foreign and domestic, the biggest danger now is complacency. Many of those urging us to open up all at once appear to believe that they are dealing with a known quantity with which they can conclude a deal. But as the Chinese president Xi Jinping, memorably asserted: \u201cThis epidemic is a demon, and we cannot allow this demon to hide.\u201d Covid-19 is as protean as it is malevolent; each day seems to bring news of it taking on a new shape. In Britain, children have been affected by a strange rash which may be related to the pandemic. In the US, children have come down with a Kawasaki-like syndrome which may also be associated with Covid-19. The virus has been found lingering on cardboard and other hard surfaces for days. It has been detected in the semen of men who have appeared to recover from it. The death toll is likely to be in the millions; there is emerging evidence that many whose lives are spared suffer lasting pulmonary and neurological damage. We simply do not know what it might do, what its final shape may be, or whether there will ever be a vaccine. If you take all of this seriously \u2013 and accept that the disease has precisely benefited from a liberalised regime of global trade that Australia has optimised its policy settings to exploit \u2013 the idea that we can ever go back to business as usual seems fanciful. If you don\u2019t take it seriously, these problems disappear. This is what many conservative commentators have opted for. But this virus does not make deals. It is changing the world. It will change Australia, too. There is no reason to think that those changes will be comfortable. And we have no idea what it may do next. Australians need to keep their heads on straight. We are not yet safe. Australia\u2019s luck may not hold out. Jason Wilson is a columnist for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "The White House on Sunday accused China of a cover-up that will \u201cgo down in history along with Chernobyl\u201d, ramping up efforts to deflect attention from a Covid-19 death toll in the US fast closing on 100,000. Robert O\u2019Brien, Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, made the claim on two political talk shows, saying Beijing gave \u201cfalse information\u201d to the World Health Organization (WHO) at the start of the year and alleging that stonewalling of an investigation into the origins of the pandemic has cost \u201cmany, many thousands of lives in America and around the world\u201d. On Saturday Mike Pence, the vice-president, told Breitbart News that China had \u201clet the world down\u201d and insisted the WHO was \u201ctheir willing partner in withholding from the US and wider world vital information about the coronavirus\u201d. The Trump administration has become increasingly keen to move attention away from its handling of the pandemic, which has seen more deaths in the US than any other nation and a broken economy including soaring unemployment that another senior adviser told CNN would still be \u201cin double digits\u201d by the 3 November presidential election. O\u2019Brien dampened speculation that the administration might seek to delay that election. But as China warned that Washington\u2019s \u201clies\u201d were \u201cpushing our two countries to the brink of a new cold war\u201d, he went firmly on the attack. Speaking to CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, he claimed Beijing knew of the looming crisis as early as November but chose to keep it quiet. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who in the Chinese government did it, but it doesn\u2019t matter if it was the local Chinese government or the Communist party of China,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, this was a virus that was unleashed by China.

But Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other senior US figures have repeatedly said they suspect the coronavirus was somehow released from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a claim China has strenuously denied. O\u2019Brien claimed China\u2019s alleged skulduggery was continuing. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance, and it\u2019s been reported, that the Chinese have been engaged in espionage to try and find the research and the technologies that we\u2019re working on both for a vaccine and a therapy,\u201d he told CBS. \u201cSo look, they\u2019ve got a many, many year history of stealing American intellectual property and knocking off American technology.

The company, famous for making James Bond\u2019s favourite car, is expected to announce on Tuesday that it is replacing Palmer, who has served as Aston Martin\u2019s CEO since 2014, with an executive from Mercedes. Palmer told the Financial Times, which first reported the news, that he was unaware he was due to be sacked and declined to comment further. An Aston Martin spokesman said on Sunday: \u201cThe company confirms that it is reviewing its management team and a further announcement will be made as and when appropriate.\u201d Palmer is expected to be replaced by Tobias Moers, the CEO of Mercedes-AMG, the high-performance division of the German car maker. Aston Martin\u2019s shares have collapsed from \u00a319 a share when the company floated in October 2018 to 35p on Friday. That pushes its market value to \u00a3562m, compared with more than \u00a34bn on flotation. Earlier in May, the company reported that losses had ballooned to \u00a3119m in the first three months of the year as the coronavirus pandemic caused the already struggling British car maker\u2019s sales to plunge across the world. The company sold only 578 cars to dealers in the first quarter, down 45% from the same period in 2019.

has condemned a lack of transparency from both the UK and Scottish governments as the further impact of coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh came to light. <br></p> \n  <p>More than 70 employees from around the world attended the event at the Hilton Carlton Hotel on 26-27 February, PA Media reports.</p> \n  <p>My colleagues <strong>Andrew Sparrow</strong> and <strong>Mattha Busby </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates\">reported on Wednesday</a> that <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> had denied the Scottish government tried to cover up coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February. <br></p> \n  <p>In angry exchanges at first minister questions, Sturgeon accused the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, <strong>Jackson Carlaw</strong>, of unfairly impugning her integrity and that of health officials by suggesting this early outbreak was hushed up. <br></p> \n  <p>Investigations found that at least 25 people linked to the event contracted Covid-19, including eight in Scotland, but the incident was not made public until it was revealed in a television documentary earlier this month. <br></p> \n  <p>The first coronavirus case in Scotland was announced on 1 March and was a Tayside resident unrelated to the conference. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>But the Sunday Times says it has been reported locally that the north-east of England\u2019s \u201cpatient zero\u201d attended the conference in February and the infection was passed to a second person in Newcastle at a child\u2019s birthday party. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>The Chronicle newspaper also states that a church in Newcastle closed after a member tested positive for coronavirus, with it being \u201cunderstood the patient works for Nike in Sunderland and contracted the virus after attending a conference in Edinburgh\u201d - although this was unconfirmed at the time. <br></p> \n  <p>In a further report on Sunday, the Scottish Sun said one staff member at the Sunderland base contracted the virus after the Edinburgh conference. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>Murray, Labour\u2019s only MP in Scotland, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> The Scottish government has fresh questions to answer about its cover-up of the ground-zero coronavirus outbreak. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n   <p>Not only were people in Edinburgh kept in the dark, the decision to keep the information secret means people in north-east England were also unaware of how the virus could easily spread to their region. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n   <p>There are questions too for the UK government, which should have acted when the Scottish government failed to be transparent. </p> \n   <p>The lack of transparency from both governments is harming public confidence at a vital time for the country as we move towards the easing of lockdown measures. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T12:00:29.907Z\">at 1.00pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from our UK live blog today. Here is a summary of the major developments from this afternoon: Boris Johnson has backed his chief aide Dominic Cummings over his decision to travel 260 miles to Durham during the lockdown. The PM said Cummings acted \u201cresponsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said \u201cit is an insult to sacrifices made by the British people that Boris Johnson has chosen to take no action against Dominic Cummings\u201d. He said the PM\u2019s actions have \u201cundermined confidence in his own public health message at this crucial time\u201d. Johnson confirmed that the government will press ahead with the phased re-opened of schools in England from June 1. He added that he intends for secondary schools to provide \u201csome contact\u201d for year 10 and year 12 students from June 15 to help them to prepare for exams next year \u2013 with up to a quarter of these students in at any point. The government has vowed to make 3,300 homes available within 12 months to prevent rough sleepers housed in emergency pandemic accommodation in England returning to the streets. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) will bring forward \u00a3160m of its \u00a3381m, four-year rough sleeping services budget to be spent this year. My colleague Peter Walker has the full report on today\u2019s biggest story. If you want to continue following the latest in the coronavirus crisis, pop over to our global live blog. Here\u2019s is Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s response to the PM\u2019s decision to back Dominic Cummings: By backing Cummings, Johnson has laid bare his disdain for the British public The prime minister\u2019s self-centred endorsement of his overmighty adviser is an outrageous snub to the rest of us, writes my colleague Martin Kettle: The poison in Cummings\u2019s journey to Durham is the taint of hypocrisy it injects into the public bloodstream at precisely the time when public confidence in the handling of the crisis is already beginning to fray. One rule for him, another for us. It\u2019s an absolutely lethal tag for any government project, but it\u2019s doubly, triply so in a pandemic. The arrogance and ineptitude are staggering. Read his full piece here: The UK Civil Service has issued a surprisingly honest and direct tweet following today\u2019s Downing Street press briefing on the coronavirus crisis. It has now been deleted but my colleague Claire Phipps had the foresight to take a screenshot for posterity: Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has issued a clarification that Johnson\u2019s announcement on the lockdown and the phased re-opening of schools applies to England. She said that the situation in Scotland is set out in the following thread: Johnson is asked whether he knew at the time that Dominic Cummings was making the trip to Durham and whether he approved it. He is also asked whether it is true Cummings made a trip to Barnard Castle in April. Johnson avoids answering the questions directly. \u201cWhat I can tell you is, when you look at the guidance and the childcare needs, it was reasonable to self-isolate for 14 days or more where he did,\u201d he said. He said that he has looked at the allegations carefully and is content that \u201con both sides\u201d of that period he behaved \u201cresponsibly and correctly\u201d. Johnson is asked whether his support for Cummings means that other people are completely at liberty to do as his chief aide did. \u201cI think what they did was totally understandable,\u201d Johnson replied. \u201cI think any father, any parent would understand what he did.\u201d Johnson also confirmed that the government will press ahead with the phased reopening of schools from June 1. \u201cThe education of children is crucial for their welfare, for their long-term future and for social justice,\u201d he said. \u201cIn line with the approach being taken in many other countries, we want to start getting our children back into the classroom in a way that is as manageable and as safe as possible. \u201cWe said we would begin with early years\u2019 settings and reception, year 1, and year 6 in primary schools.\u201d He added that he intends for secondary schools to provide \u201csome contact\u201d for year 10 and year 12 students from 15 June to help them to prepare for exams next year \u2013 with up to a quarter of these students in at any point. Johnson also told the Downing Street press conference that \u201csome\u201d of the allegations about Dominic Cummings\u2019 behaviour during self-isolation were \u201cpalpably false\u201d. \u201cThough there have been many other allegations about what happened when he was in self-isolation and thereafter, some of them palpably false, I believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly and legally and with integrity and with the overwhelming aim of stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives.\u201d The reactions to Johnson\u2019s announcement that Cummings will stay, apparently without any sanction or Cabinet Office investigation, have begun to pour in: Johnson backed his chief strategist, saying that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare at the moment when \u201cboth he and his wife were about to be incapacitated\u201d Cummings \u201cfollowed the instincts of every father and every parent and I do not mark him down for that\u201d. Boris Johnson has said that Dominic Cummings acted \u201cresponsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d. Silkie Carlo, director of civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, has this take on the Cummings saga: With all eyes on the latest developments regarding the PM\u2019s chief strategist, this more positive news story may have slipped under the radar: The government has vowed to make 3,300 homes available within 12 months to prevent rough sleepers housed in emergency pandemic accommodation in England returning to the streets. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) will bring forward \u00a3160m of its \u00a3381m, four-year rough sleeping services budget to be spent this year. Six thousand \u201chousing units\u201d will be built using the money and rough sleepers housed through the scheme will be provided support for mental health or substance abuse issues. Read our full report here: Guy Verhofstadt, the Belgian member of European parliament, has weighed into the Dominic Cummings saga by tweeting his approval of the following Sunday Times cartoon: Network Rail has urged potential passengers who do not need to travel to work or for emergencies to avoid taking trains during the bank holiday. The already drastically reduced national train service is undergoing a major overhaul over the long weekend with 490 upgrading projects taking place, it said. Find out more in this report from my colleague Henry McDonald: UK faces backlog of 40,000 criminal cases due to coronavirus Barristers have warned that the UK\u2019s criminal justice system is facing a backlog of 40,000 cases due to the coronavirus crisis, Owen Bowcott reports: The scale of the challenge to the justice system posed by the coronavirus pandemic is becoming apparent, as virtual hearings transform business in the higher civil courts but trigger alarms about the fairness of remote proceedings in the family and lower courts. Reliance on video technology is accelerating the government\u2019s pre-existing \u00a31bn court modernisation programme but also throwing up questions about where it is appropriate: many unrepresented claimants do not have super-fast broadband or are among those categorised as \u201cdigitally excluded\u201d. Here is the full report: This post has been amended \u2013 the earlier version had an incorrect figure in the headline An arson investigation has been launched after a 5G mobile phone mast was torched, PA Media reports. Derbyshire police appealed for witnesses after the fire brigade were called to the blaze off Scarborough Drive in the Chaddesden area of Derby at 2am on Sunday. In a statement, the force said: We believe the fire was started deliberately and we are investigating. It follows more than 50 incidents nationwide, believed to be linked to false claims the 5G network is spreading coronavirus. The attacks prompted action from Twitter and Facebook to crack down on accounts pushing \u201cunverified claims\u201d. One MP, who launched a fact-checking service, also called for a law to be introduced to stop persistent spreaders of disinformation online. The Conservative MP Damian Collins, who set up Infotagion to combat falsehoods during the pandemic, said: It\u2019s not good enough that we just have to remove certain posts that are wrong. Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted the following in connection with growing calls for Dominic Cummings to step down as chief strategist. This is Aaron Walawalkar, taking over from my colleague Jedidajah Otte, as the clock ticks down to the daily coronavirus press briefing at 5pm today. As always, please message me any of your UK coronavirus updates on Twitter @AaronWala. Here\u2019s is a selection of health workers\u2019 reactions to the Dominic Cummings scandal on Twitter. From cardiology registrar Dr Dominic Pimenta: From consultant and emergency medicine lecturer Dr Farbod: From anaesthetic registrar Natalie Silvey: From palliative care doctor Rachel Clarke: Downing Street has confirmed that Boris Johnson will be leading the government\u2019s press conference today at 5pm, instead of housing minister Robert Jenrick, who had been previously announced. I am now handing over to my colleage Aaron Walawalkar. This from Joe Pike from Sky News: Here a clip featuring the former chief constable of Durham police Mike Barton during a BBC interview this afternoon, in which he calls out Cummings\u2019 behaviour as a clear breach of the rules. My colleague Vikram Dodd spoke to Barton earlier. This from my colleague Toby Helm: British people will be able to access a coronavirus vaccine from September, the chief executive of drug maker AstraZeneca has said, despite concerns it will not be ready. Pascal Soriot told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that British people will get first access to the vaccine from autumn. The pharmaceutical firm, which is working with Oxford University, had previously said it has secured the first agreements for at least 400 million doses of the vaccine, PA Media reports. But a leading member of the project told the Sunday Telegraph the lower transmission of Covid-19 in the community leaves the trial with only a 50% chance of success. Asked if people in Britain would be among the first to get the vaccine, Soriot said: \u201cYes, we have actually received an order from the British government to supply 100 million doses of vaccine, and those will go to the British people. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no doubt, starting in September, we will start delivering these doses of vaccine to the British government for vaccination.\u201d But Soriot went on to say the possibility of the vaccine being rolled out in autumn depended on if an Oxford University trial worked before the transmission rate lowers further. He added: \u201cThe vaccine has to work and that\u2019s one question, and the other question is, even if it works, we have to be able to demonstrate it. \u201cWe have to run as fast as possible before the disease disappears so we can demonstrate that the vaccine is effective.\u201d Oxford University\u2019s Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group began development on a vaccine in January, using a virus taken from chimpanzees. The government\u2019s daily press conference has been delayed by an hour and will now start at 5pm. This from the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley: This from the Telegraph\u2019s Tony Diver: This from the Sunday Times\u2019s Tim Shipman: My colleague Katherine Butler just spoke to Ben, 31, a marketing manager in the music industry who\u2019s cycled from Leytonstone to Islington to demonstrate outside Dominic Cummings\u2019s house. He said: I\u2019m not with any organisation or campaign, just a member of the public. I\u2019ve been furloughed and I was just sat at home angry and frustrated. I think it\u2019s disgusting. It\u2019s one rule for him and the rest of us. It\u2019s disgraceful how the government is protecting him. I\u2019ve been at home with my wife for two months. But thinking of all the people who\u2019ve made big sacrifices and not seen their loved ones. Freeman told the BBC: \u201cIf I had known everything I know now... we may have made different decisions\u201d, as she reacts to claims it was \u201cirresponsible\u201d to send 921 untested hospital patients into care homes in March. Scotland\u2019s health secretary Jeane Freeman issued a reminder to everyone in Scotland about the rules around self-isolation, saying the \u201cmessage may have become confused in the last 24 hours because of events in other parts of the UK\u201d. Speaking at the Scottish government\u2019s latest coronavirus briefing in Edinburgh, she said self-isolating is not the same as lockdown and means \u201cyou should not leave the house for any reason\u201d, the PA reports. \u201cSo let me be clear what we mean here in Scotland. Self-isolation means the following: if you think you have the virus, if you have a persistent cough, or a fever, or loss of taste and/or smell, you should self-isolate at home for a minimum of seven days, \u201c Freeman said. \u201cIn that time you should get tested if you can, bearing in mind that testing is now open to anyone over the age of five who has symptoms. \u201cAt the same time anyone in your household should self-isolate for 14 days to see if they develop virus, and if they do, they should self-isolate for seven days from that point. \u201cFrom the eighth day, if you do not have any more symptoms you can go back, back to the lockdown measures that apply across the country.\u201d Here is a video showing Dominic Cummings leaving his north London home earlier this morning and denying that he had travelled to Durham a second time when he was asked by reporters. This from the Telegraph\u2019s Tony Diver: This just in from the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley: The number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Northern Ireland has risen to 506 after one more death was reported by the Department of Health. The number of patients in Scotland who have died after testing positive for Covid-19 has risen by nine to 2,270, according to the latest statistics. Figures published by the Scottish government show the rise in the past 24 hours. The statistics indicate 15,101 people have tested positive for Covid-19, up of 60 from 15,041 the previous day. There are 845 patients in hospital who have tested positive for Covid-19, up four from 841 on Saturday. A further 147 people, who tested positive for coronavirus have died, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 25,691. Patients were aged between 43 and 98 years old, according to NHS England. Five of the 147 patients, aged between 46 and 84, had no known underlying health condition. Former Labour MP for Bishop Auckland Helen Goodman, whose father died in a care home, said she found the behaviour of Dominic Cummings \u201cincredible\u201d. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s The World This Weekend, she said: \u201cWhat was the point of the sacrifice that we all made? What was the point of the miserable, lonely death that my father had? I just find it utterly repellent.\u201d Asked if she was tempted to break the lockdown to see her gravely ill father, she said: \u201cYes of course, of course, everybody was just wresting with these intolerable dilemmas. \u201cI think the cabinet ministers are utterly craven to excuse and exonerate him. Asked if Cummings should stay, she said: \u201cOf course he shouldn\u2019t, there\u2019s no question that he shouldn\u2019t. He\u2019s undermined the public health campaign that they\u2019ve been running \u2013 trying to run \u2013 for the last two months. \u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly destructive \u2013 not just the act in itself, but the defence of the act, I think it\u2019s incredibly destructive.\u201d This from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston: A protest group has appeared outside Dominic Cummings\u2019 north London home, PA Media reports. Political campaign group Led by Donkeys drove to Cummings\u2019s home in a van displaying a video of Boris Johnson\u2019s speech to the country, warning the public to stay at home. Boris Johnson offered his \u201cfull support\u201d to his chief adviser after the news emerged. Led by Donkeys also put up a separate installation on Westminster Bridge Road on Friday. Posting a photo of the billboard, which reads \u201cStay alert, Government incompetence costs lives\u201d, the group said: \u201cWhen the PM\u2019s top adviser is criss-crossing the country with coronavirus, it\u2019s definitely time to stay alert.\u201d My colleague Heather Stewart explains why the question of whether or not to sack Dominic Cummings is so agonising for the prime minister. This from Tim Montgomerie, the founder of Conservative Home. He previously described defences of Cummings\u2019 behaviour ventured by Tory MPs and cabinet ministers as \u201cembarrassing\u201d. Did Dominic Cummings break lockdown rules that were enshrined in law? My colleague Helen Pidd on today\u2019s biggest question in the UK. Piers Morgan has announced he is barring cabinet ministers from making appearances on Good Morning Britain, after allegations were broken by the Observer and the Mirror that Dominic Cummings broke lockdown rules. Morgan said the only cabinet ministers who would be allowed on his ITV show are those who did not defend Cummings\u2019s alleged infringement of lockdown. Morgan also tweeted that he believes the PM\u2019s own position might be weakened if he doesn\u2019t sack his top adviser. The Labour MP for the city of Durham, Mary Kelly Foy, has told Sky her inbox is full of messages from \u201cangry and upset\u201d constituents, who had been in similar positions but didn\u2019t break lockdown rules. \u201cDominic Cummings has acted so irresponsibly,\u201d she said. This from the FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne on the unfolding Cummings saga: And this from earlier: This is Jedidajah Otte, taking back over from my colleague Aaron Walawalkar. In all the furore about Dominic Cummings, a key announcement on 6,000 homes for rough sleepers by housing minister Robert Jenrick has gone largely unnoticed. Barrister Matthew Ryder QC has this to say on attempts to explain Cummings\u2019s cross-country lockdown trip: Unite calls for renewed HSE spot checks to reduce Covid-19 risk The Unite trade union has urged ministers to rip up laws that were designed to reduce red tape but which are putting workers and their families at risk of Covid-19 infection, Rob Davies reports: The UK\u2019s largest union called on the government on Sunday to restore the power of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to perform spot-checks on social care institutions, shops and pubs. The coalition government introduced measures in 2012 to outlaw proactive inspections in such workplaces because they were deemed to present minimal danger to workers\u2019 safety. Unite, however, has written to the business secretary, Alok Sharma, and the work and pensions secretary, Therese Coffey, saying that the same places are among the most risky during the coronavirus pandemic and pointing out that many had been to forced to close. Read the full report here: Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has called for a full explanation of the Cummings affair, adding that what \u201cwe\u2019ve had so far has had more holes in it than a block of Swiss cheese\u201d. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s The World This Weekend: This is a deadly, deadly virus which spreads with speed, which is why we went into a lockdown and it\u2019s why the government told us and put into law a rule that we should stay at home, a rule that Dominic Cummings helped design with Boris Johnson. His behaviour is utterly irresponsible. He has undermined that rule, as have a whole chorus of cabinet ministers including the health secretary, extraordinarily, undermined that public health rule which is about keeping people safe. Johnson, he said, should \u201cnot hide away, should come out today at the press conference and give us a full explanation as to Mr Cummings\u2019 behaviour\u201d. He added: I\u2019m afraid, at the moment, it rather looks like double standards, it looks like there\u2019s one rule for the privileged elite who happen to be friends with Boris Johnson, and another rule for the rest of us who have had to make huge sacrifices, not seeing our elderly relatives, staying at home. This is difficult for so many people and yet Mr Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s right-hand man, has completely disregarded that rule. This is Aaron Walawalkar in London here \u2013 taking over while my colleague Jedidajah Otte has a quick break and the Cummings saga continues to unfold. Please DM me any updates you have on Twitter at @AaronWala. Conservative MP Robert Halfon has apologised for tweeting his support of Dominic Cummings on Saturday and said the PM\u2019s aide should \u201cface the consequences of breaking the law\u201d. In a statement on his Facebook page, the MP for Harlow said: I would first like to make it clear to residents that I regret writing the tweet yesterday in the way I did about the Number 10 political adviser and his movements. I am really sorry for it. I do not support or condone anyone who has broken the law or regulations. Anyone who has done so should face the consequences. Here is the tweet which Halfon is apologising for: His statement on Sunday added: The tweet was wrong because many thousands of people in Harlow and across the country have suffered and struggled enormously during the coronavirus. It has caused significant pain and hardship. My tweet did not recognise that. I am sorry. My original tweet was aimed at the four-year-old child because I thought at the time that both parents had been ill with coronavirus, genuinely had no one to look after the infant \u2013 and for this reason had taken the child to their extended family to be looked after. I thought that to do this was within the regulations. London mayor Sadiq Khan has reminded people in the capital not to forget that lockdown has not ben lifted over the bank holiday weekend, and has asked them to \u201cstay at home as much as possible\u201d. The petition calling for the sacking of Dominic Cummings has garnered nearly 55,000 signatures, most of these just over the past few hours. The hashtag #sackcummings is trending on Twitter. But so far, there is no sign from No 10 that anything like this will happen. A former chief constable of Durham police has meanwhile launched a strident attack on Cummings and the government defending him, branding them self-privileged hypocrites who have damaged the fight against coronavirus at a time of national emergency. Mike Barton, who stepped down as chief constable last year, said that the government\u2019s defence of Cummings was causing extensive damage as police try to get the public to obey lockdown rules. My colleague Vikram Dodd has more. This from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston: The Labour party has just gone on the offensive and tweeted this: From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand: This from the Telegraph\u2019s Tony Diver: The Conservative MP Roger Gale had told Sky he thinks Cummings is \u201cdead in the water\u201d if his second trip to Durham can be confirmed. He said it was \u201cabout trust\u201d, and that he\u2019d like to see the prime minister announcing Cummings\u2019s resignation at the government\u2019s presser this afternoon. \u201cMr Cummings broke his own rules, [\u2026] and there are thousands and thousands of families in similar situations,\u201d he said. Gale said he could understand why other MPs and cabinet ministers had initially defended Cummings, as they had understood he was merely trying to make arrangements to care for his young child. \u201cI think an honourable man would fall on his sword at this point,\u201d Gale said. \u201cThe prime minister has got to deal with this. I don\u2019t think Mr Cummings is doing him any favours.\u201d A British man has been detained in an Indian prison after being accused of breaching the country\u2019s strict coronavirus lockdown rules, my colleague Nazia Parveen reports. Sohail Hughes, 29, had been on an extended holiday to visit family in the Gujarat region before undertaking a pilgrimage of mosques when he was detained last month. His family, who have a launched a petition to have him freed, have claimed he is being unlawfully held by Indian officials. An emergency medicine consultant has joined the scores of people venting their anger and disbelief about Dominic Cummings\u2019 ignoring of lockdown rules, and has just tweeted this: This just in from my colleague Richard Adams, the Guardian\u2019s education editor. Labour\u2019s Ian Murray has condemned a lack of transparency from both the UK and Scottish governments as the further impact of coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh came to light. More than 70 employees from around the world attended the event at the Hilton Carlton Hotel on 26-27 February, PA Media reports. My colleagues Andrew Sparrow and Mattha Busby reported on Wednesday that Nicola Sturgeon had denied the Scottish government tried to cover up coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February. In angry exchanges at first minister questions, Sturgeon accused the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Jackson Carlaw, of unfairly impugning her integrity and that of health officials by suggesting this early outbreak was hushed up. Investigations found that at least 25 people linked to the event contracted Covid-19, including eight in Scotland, but the incident was not made public until it was revealed in a television documentary earlier this month. The first coronavirus case in Scotland was announced on 1 March and was a Tayside resident unrelated to the conference. But the Sunday Times says it has been reported locally that the north-east of England\u2019s \u201cpatient zero\u201d attended the conference in February and the infection was passed to a second person in Newcastle at a child\u2019s birthday party. The Chronicle newspaper also states that a church in Newcastle closed after a member tested positive for coronavirus, with it being \u201cunderstood the patient works for Nike in Sunderland and contracted the virus after attending a conference in Edinburgh\u201d - although this was unconfirmed at the time. In a further report on Sunday, the Scottish Sun said one staff member at the Sunderland base contracted the virus after the Edinburgh conference. Murray, Labour\u2019s only MP in Scotland, said: The Scottish government has fresh questions to answer about its cover-up of the ground-zero coronavirus outbreak. Not only were people in Edinburgh kept in the dark, the decision to keep the information secret means people in north-east England were also unaware of how the virus could easily spread to their region. There are questions too for the UK government, which should have acted when the Scottish government failed to be transparent. The lack of transparency from both governments is harming public confidence at a vital time for the country as we move towards the easing of lockdown measures. An unnamed Bournemouth player has tested positive for Covid-19, the Premier League club announced on Sunday, becoming the eighth case involving an English top-flight club. Bournemouth added the player\u2019s identity would not be disclosed due to \u201cmedical confidentiality\u201d and that he would self-isolate for seven day, according to AFP. \u201cFollowing strict adherence to the Premier League\u2019s return to training regulations, the club\u2019s training ground remains a safe working environment for players and backroom staff, who will continue to be tested for Covid-19 twice per week,\u201d Bournemouth said in a club statement. The Premier League announced on Saturday that there were positive tests at two clubs out of 996 tests conducted on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. The other positive was at a different club that has not been named. That followed a first round of testing that produced six positive findings announced on 19 May at three Premier League clubs from a total of 748 players and staff tested, Those positives included Watford\u2019s Adrian Mariappa and Burnley assistant manager Ian Woan. The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, told Sky: \u201c[Cummings] has to go and the prime minister has to sack him.\u201d Cummings had broken lockdown regulations, he said, and broken advice everyone had been given by the government. \u201cHe is the architect of much of what the prime minister says and delivers,\u201d Blackford said, adding it would be \u201ca failure of leadership and a failure of judgment\u201d if Boris Johnson does not ask for Dominic Cummings\u2019 resignation. The Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood has called on Boris Johnson to show personal leadership in a \u201cformal address\u201d. Simon Hoare, the Conservative MP for North Dorset, told Sky there is now \u201cgrowing disquiet amongst ministers at all levels\u201d over Cummings\u2019 rule breaching. This just in from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand: This from the Times\u2019 head of news, Katherine Faulkner: This is an interesting point by Sky News\u2019s Joe Pike: A Belfast hospital is ready to contend with a potential second surge of the coronavirus pandemic, a senior official told PA Media. The Mater hospital is caring for a number of patients as they recover from Covid-19, a process that can take weeks to months. There have been 4,469 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Northern Ireland so far, with numbers of patients in hospitals dropping at the end of the first surge. According to Department of Health figures on Saturday, there have been 505 deaths of patients with Covid-19. As lockdown measures begin to be relaxed, Liz McAlea, interim co-director of unscheduled care at the Belfast trust, said officials are prepared for a second surge if it comes. \u201cNow that everything has calmed down quite a bit as in numbers wise, we are still in preparedness for a second wave if another surge was to come,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough we have turned some of our wards into non-Covid wards, within the Mater we\u2019re still prepared in case there is a second surge. \u201cI think we did really well, we had up to 105 patients with Covid-19 within the Mater Hospital, with 16 ventilated, and coped very well. Those numbers have gone down but we\u2019re reassured that we\u2019re prepared and the Nightingale is ready to step up again.\u201d The Mater was the first centre in Northern Ireland for coronavirus patients before the Nightingale facility at the City hospital opened with access to more than 200 ventilators. McAlea said \u201cthankfully\u201d that level of capacity was not needed. Steve Baker just retweeted remarks Dominic Cummings made about him previously in a blogpost, in which he described Baker as \u201can honest man\u201d. Here a video of Grant Shapps on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show this morning, where he said he didn\u2019t speak to Cummings about details of his 260-mile trip from London to Durham. This from the FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne: This from my colleague Claire Phipps: ITV\u2019s Robert Peston says ministers have told him Cummings\u2019 resignation or sacking is only \u201conly a matter of time\u201d. Dominic Cummings has entered No 10 Downing Street a short while ago, reportedly without answering questions about his alleged second trip to north-east England and his attitude towards resigning. This from the BBC\u2019s Rob Powell: One particular statement made by transport secretary Grant Shapps this morning is attracting quite a bit of attention. Shapps told Marr: \u201cWe\u2019ve never told people specifically where to locate themselves.\u201d The government\u2019s key message in the weeks between the beginning of the lockdown and 10 May was, as you may recall, \u201cStay home. Protect the NHS. Save lives.\u201d This from my colleague John Harris: This from HuffPost UK\u2019s Paul Waugh: This from political writer and campaigner Femi Oluwole: It\u2019s worth noting that although at least seven Tory MPs have called for Cummings\u2019 resignation, at least 51 have either defended him so far or at least retweeted defences from other MPs, which has been nicely documented in one place by the political writer Edwin Hayward. Dominic Cummings left his home in north London with his wife and son shortly after 11am this morning, PA Media reports. After one journalist asked if he had returned to Durham in April, Cummings said: \u201cNo, I did not.\u201d Cummings, who was wearing a lanyard with an ID card, was carrying a notepad and what appeared to be a black bin bag. The family then got in the car and drove away. A petition campaigning for Dominic Cummings\u2019 resignation is gaining momentum and has reached over 33,000 signatures. While the pressure on Cummings and Boris Johnson keeps building, the government\u2019s daily press conference is expected to start at 4pm, and to be fronted by the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick. Labour has called on the prime minister to make an appearance himself and answer questions about Cummings\u2019 behaviour. It\u2019s interesting timing from the Telegraph, whose chief political correspondent, Christopher Hope, has written a piece in today\u2019s paper about calls from the Countryside Alliance to allow visits to second homes, as well as the reopening of self-catering cottages, camp sites and other tourism businesses, so rural businesses can benefit financially from the influx of visitors. Cummings\u2019 alleged trip to Barnard Castle is what looks likely to be the most problematic issue for him. This from HuffPost UK\u2019s Paul Waugh: This from the journalist Neil Macfarlane: This from my colleague David Conn: This from the BBC\u2019s James Clayton: And this from the Manchester Evening News\u2019 Jennifer Williams: A \u201cbig debate\u201d is needed about the future of funding the BBC after the coronavirus crisis proved it can bring the nation together, its outgoing director general said. Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, Lord Tony Hall said the broadcaster had been able to bring the country together and cited the work of its local radio stations as an example. He said: I think what the Covid crisis has proved is that people in their droves \u2013 94% of the population of the UK \u2013 have turned to the BBC for either information, education or entertainment during this crisis. So the question is, and by the way it\u2019s not a question that needs to be answered until 2027 when the charter comes to an end, the question is what\u2019s the best way of funding that universally so that everybody, this great democratic idea, gets something we can all share. I hope that there will be a big debate about the best way of funding the BBC. I hope even when I\u2019ve left I can take part in that debate and we should look at the easiest way to pay, learn from what happens in other countries, are there fairer ways to pay, but the underpinning for all that is the idea of a BBC which is providing something for everyone. Hall said 92% of the organisation was working from home during the pandemic and the broadcaster had launched its biggest ever educational programme, as well as working with arts organisations on programmes. He added that plans to stop free TV licences for over-75s had been delayed until August and would be reviewed by the BBC\u2019s board nearer the time. Tens of thousands of low income households are being denied extra support designed to ease the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, after being hit by the government\u2019s benefit cap, my colleague Michael Savage writes in the Observer today. Particularly hard-hit are private renters with children, he reports. This from the Conservative MP Craig Whittaker: Sky News\u2019 Joe Pike has counted seven Tory MPs who want Cummings to step down. This from the Conservative MP for Romsey and Southampton North, Caroline Nokes, who seems to be saying that she was pressing for Cummings\u2019 resignation yesterday. Anyone in public spaces \u201cshould wear a mask\u201d, according to Venki Ramakrishnan, the president of the Royal Society who also sits on the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Ramakrishnan told the Andrew Marr Show that face coverings help to reduce transmission. \u201cI think anyone in public spaces should wear a mask because it\u2019s simply another tool to reduce the possibility of infections,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think masks are the be all end all, you have to think of it as one leg in a multi-legged stool that holds up prevention of transmission.\u201d Asked if teachers should wear masks, Ramakrishnan said: \u201cIf they are socially distanced and there are all these other measures in place, where their use is not necessary. That is a policy decision, that\u2019s not for a scientist like me to say. \u201cMy view is that wherever social distancing is not possible, we must regularly wash our hands and I think it would be a good idea to wear masks.\u201d Peter Bone, the Conservative MP for Wellingborough, has become the fifth Tory MP saying Cummings should go. In an interview with Nigel Farage on LBC he said Cummings \u201chas to go\u201d because he broke the rules and has not apologised. \u201cWhen an adviser becomes the story, the adviser has to go,\u201d he said. \u201cBoris Johnson can carry on without Dominic Cummings if he goes but it will be hard if he stays.\u201d My colleague Rajeev Syal has written up a story about Steve Baker\u2019s efforts this morning: Just a quick reminder that it\u2019s worth refreshing the blog every once in a while, as some posts are being added to as we go along, and some typos magically disappear over time. Here a video of Steve Baker speaking on the Sophy Ridge show. The MP led calls from Conservative ranks for Cummings\u2019 resignation this morning. The allegation that Dominic Cummings made more than one journey between London and Durham \u201cis now an issue of Boris Johnson\u2019s judgment and integrity\u201d, according to the SNP\u2019s Westminster deputy leader, Kirsty Blackman, PA Media reports. She said: Despite having eight weeks to get their story straight, the excuses are just not credible and do not stack up. A mounting rebellion of Tory MPs have joined calls for Dominic Cummings to go. They understand the lasting damage this is doing to public confidence in the Tory government and its Covid-19 response. The longer Mr Cummings stays in place, the more he will undermine the Tory government\u2019s credibility and the more people will question the prime minister\u2019s judgment. The SNP will continue to press for a Cabinet Office inquiry into the breaking of the rules and the Downing Street cover-up, which left the public in the dark for so long. Polling shows the majority of the public think Mr Cummings should go. Boris Johnson must come out of hiding and show Mr Cummings the door. Marr presses him on how the government can expect the public to make huge sacrifices if Cummings keeps his job after these breaches of rules. Shapps reiterates that the guidance allowed for arrangements such as the one Cummings made, and that he does not think he needs to resign. Says it is important to \u201cremain locked down, particularly if you have the symptoms\u201d. Asked whether Cummings will resign, Shapps replies: \u201cNo.\u201d Shapps says his \u201cunderstanding\u201d is that Cummings did not go up and down between Durham and London \u201cthree times\u201d. \u201cSome of these stories are trying to suggest that he went up, he came back, he went up - three times I\u2019ve seen suggested - and again my understanding is that\u2019s not the case,\u201d he said. Shapps added there were \u201cmassive issues which will matter to people even more than where one family spent time isolating during this, including how we build our way out of this crisis\u201d. Marr presses Shapps on No 10\u2019s denial from yesterday that Cummings had been speaking to police, which was contradicted by Durham police. Shapps states repeatedly the denial had only been in relation to the claim that police contacted Cummings, when it was his father who made contact himself. Asked about Barnard Castle, and whether he persoanlly had stated untruthful things in relation to claims Cummings was spotted there on 12 April, Shapps says he\u2019s not sure about the date, and that it\u2019s his understanding that Cummings did stay put while he needed to be in isolation. He refuses to confirm that Cummings moved around outside the home of his parents in Durham. Are you absolutely sure he was not seen wandering around in Durham on 19 April, Marr asks. Shapps answers evasively and says because something is reported in newspapers doesn\u2019t mean it is true, says he goes by statements from No 10. Marr asks why Shapps has not spoken to Cummings about details of the journeys to Durham. Shapps says he is the transport secretary. \u201cI\u2019ve communicated but I haven\u2019t spoken to him directly,\u201d he said. \u201cI assume he would have taken every possible measure to ensure he was not infecting anybody,\u201d Shapps says, but admits he doesn\u2019t know. Grant Shapps is now on the Marr show. He says the lockdown rules apply to everyone, buty says not all theses measures \u201cwill be possible\u201d to follow in certain circumstances. He mentions Cummings\u2019 childcare issues again. Marr reads out the governement\u2019s guidance to him, which asks people not to leave their homes if they have symptoms \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d, unless there is \u201can extreme risk to life\u201d. He asks whether there was an extreme risk to life in Cummings\u2019 situation. \u201cThey would have felt they had to put some measures in place,\u201d Shapps said, stressing that Cummings\u2019 four-year-old would not have been able to feed and bathe himself. A fourth Conservative MP, Roger Gale, has called on Cummings to step down. This from HuffPost UK\u2019s Paul Waugh: And this from my colleague Rafael Behr: This from my colleague Dan Sabbagh: The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, told BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show that Labour was calling for an urgent investigation into Cummings\u2019 behaviour. \u201cWhat we\u2019re asking for, for two things: firstly for there to be an urgent investigation by the Cabinet Office, and second for the prime minister today to take the press conference, the daily press conference, himself to provide answers, because this is an extraordinarily serious situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe British people have made sacrifices, extraordinary sacrifices, to get through this crisis by following the guidelines. \u201cWe know of grandparents, for example, who\u2019ve not seen their grandchildren for months, sometimes newborn grandchildren, people who\u2019ve died alone without families by their side, people who\u2019ve not been able to attend funerals, and that\u2019s happened because people have followed the guidelines.\u201d This from the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson: Another Tory MP, Damian Collins, has joined those calling for Cummings\u2019 resignation. This from the journalist Joe Lo: Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at Edinburgh University, has also called for Cummings to resign. Speaking on the Ridge show, she said: \u201cHe undermined the core public health message which was to stay home, to make sure that children are not left with elderly relatives and also going from an area that was ahead of the country \u2013 London \u2013 to an area that was a bit behind, north-east England. \u201cNorth-east England is now one of the hardest hit parts of the country. So the clear thing is, yes, he needs to resign, but we also need to move on and bring focus to the key issues facing the UK. \u201cThe UK now has close to 60,000 excess deaths, one of the worst death rates per capita in the world, we are in a lockdown. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a good way out of this lockdown because there is no testing and tracing infrastructure to let us safely lift the lockdown, and we have a lot of people suffering because of a lack of clear strategy of how we are going to move forward and get out of the deep hole that we are in.\u201d This from the FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne: Ridge asks Shapps about Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab again, and whether it\u2019s right for Cummings to be able to see family when the boy died without his by his side. Shapps is evasive in his answer, and reiterates that Cummings acted reasonably. \u201cThis is somebody who followed the guidelines by going to \u2018lock down\u2019 in order to be in the best place to ensure provision was made for a four-year-old,\u201d he says of Cummings. Shapps refuses to comment on allegations that Cummings went to Barnard Castle on 12 April, and says claims he went back to Durham after 14 April are \u201ccompletely untrue\u201d. \u201cI certainly know that the first one you mention, of travelling back up [to Durham], I know that is not true,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know [about Barnard Castle] but if that date was true that would have been outside the 14-day period. But I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have the information on that. \u201cBut I do know it is not the case that he has travelled backwards and forwards, which seemed to be a major part of the stories I saw in the paper today.\u201d Shapps said the latest allegations, that Cummings returned to Durham and was spotted on 19 April, were untrue. \u201cI think there are more stories today that I\u2019m seeing that he travelled backwards and forwards, accusations he then went back up to Durham again further times - I understand it is completely untrue. \u201cWhen he came back to London, which was on April 14 I see, he has remained in London since and hasn\u2019t been back to Durham. \u201cThere are all kinds of things that are being said here that are completely untrue. \u201cThe basic story is actually pretty straightforward. Husband and wife were ill, they hunker down, they look after their four-year-old and they don\u2019t move until they are better. \u201cAnd coming back down to London afterwards, they would have been travelling for essential work which is always allowed as well.\u201d The Conservative MP Simon Hoare has joined Steve Baker in calling for Cummings\u2019 resignation. \u201cI don\u2019t have all the times and dates for you but I understand he will have travelled up there towards the end of March and stayed there, remained there for 14 days, didn\u2019t leave the property and isolation, as per the rules and guidance,\u201d Shapps told Ridge, adding he was sure Cummings obeyed social distancing rules. He said: \u201cYou\u2019ll appreciate I wasn\u2019t with them so I can\u2019t tell you exactly what that journey was like, but what I do know is that Dominic Cummings - I saw a clip yesterday of him asking journalists to be spaced two metres apart, so I know he is a stickler for those rules about what to do to make sure you are following the two-metre rule and the like, so I\u2019m sure that they took all the necessary precautions.\u201d Ridge asks about police reports confirming that Cummings had been in contact with police, which had been denied by the government. Shapps said the police was contacted by Cummings\u2019 father, not the other way around. Ridge says Cummings didn\u2019t stay in the same place, as Shapps just said, and that they first travelled 260 miles. Shapps said the guidance was clear in advising people to take appropriate steps. \u201cHe went back up to Durham further times,\u201d Shapps says, but stayed in London after he returned. He says several times that parts of the story reported are \u201cnot true\u201d, says the \u201cbasic\u201d story is husband and wife were hunkered down and organised for someone to look after their child. The most important thing about the government\u2019s guidance is \u201ccommon sense practical solutions\u201d, particularly when looking after children, Shapps says. Both parents were concerned about being ill, with Cummings\u2019 wife already ill when they travelled, he believes. \u201cThey took perfectly sensible, rational steps,\u201d Shapps says. Asked when Cummings first had symptoms, Shapps says he doesn\u2019t know, but believes Cummings travelled to Durham at the end of March. He also doesn\u2019t know whether the family stopped during their car journey to Durham. Ridge says she is disappointed he doesn\u2019t have these details, as the show put these questions to him in advance of the show. The transport minister, Grant Shapps, is now on Ridge. \u201cThis comes down to somebody trying to do their best by their child,\u201d he says about Cummings\u2019 rule-breaking. \u201cI\u2019d much rather talk to you about transport,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is very clear that Dominic travelled when everybody else understood Dominic\u2019s slogans to mean \u2018stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives\u2019,\u201d Baker told Ridge. \u201cAnd I think mums and dads who very much care about their children and who have been forgoing the childcare of their extended family will wonder why he has been allowed to do this. \u201cI really just don\u2019t see, as we approach the Prime Minister (appearing) at the liaison committee on Wednesday, how this is going to go away unless Dominic goes.\u201d His \u201ctactics\u201d are out of place, Baker adds. Steve Baker is now on Sky. Cummings will keep burning through PM\u2019s political capital if he doesn\u2019t resign, Baker says. Ridge asks what he thinks of Cummings\u2019 childcare defence. Baker says he represents tens of thousands of people who had similar problems, and the lockdown has been really tough on them. He is diverting from the real issues. \u201cNo one is indispensable\u201d, Baker says, and repeats that he believes Cummings should go. \u201cHe creates an awful lot of collateral damage,\u201d Baker says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to win, but not at any cost,\u201d he says, and adds that Cummings has techniques he personally is not a fan of. \u201cHe holds in contempt any effort to hold him to account,\u201d Baker says. \u201cThe only person he respects in politics is Michael Gove,\u201d he says. Cummings has always been good at taking over organisations he works for, Baker adds. Steve Baker has told BBC Breakfast that Boris Johnson \u201chas what it takes\u201d to sack Cummings, and he will have to accept \u201cquite a large number of resignations\u201d if he sacks him, but that he will have to deal with that. Cummings should go today, he says. Ridge asks about whether Ofsted should be appraising schools on their virtual teaching measures, Wilshaw says yes it should. He mentions children who have no access to laptops, which needs to be followed up so that government can take correct measures. Should the summer holidays be cancelled, Ridge asks. Wilshaw responds it is clear that a lot of pupils have lost a lot of time and have \u201cregressed\u201d, and stresses that it\u2019s vital they don\u2019t fall behind other year groups. A recovery programme is necessary, he says, which might have to involve summer school teaching. It\u2019s important this cohort doesn\u2019t become \u201ca lost generation of youngsters\u201d, he says. Michael Wilshaw, the ex-Ofsted chief, is now on Ridge, and says about the reopening of schools that parents need clearer evidence that it\u2019s safe to send their children back to the class room. Social distancing for five-year-olds will be difficult, he says. The government needs to get the confidence of parents and teachers, he says. In some schools, the right measures might be implemented, while in others they might not be, he adds. \u201cSocial distancing with five-year-olds is a bit like herding cats,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is really important that the Government get the confidence of parents and teachers and they should lay down very clear guidance and rules under which schools should operate. \u201cIt is no good saying we are going to let schools do what they want because some schools will do it extremely well and other schools won\u2019t. \u201cSome schools will ensure there is a triage system in place, there is temperature testing and classrooms are intensively cleaned and so on. \u201cOther schools might not be doing that so it is really important that the government is very prescriptive in what they would expect schools to do.\u201d Ridge asked Jones whether she thinks children should be going back to school in 8 days\u2019 time. Jones said the government needs to fill a leadership vacuum and provide clearer answers on the track and trace programme. Jones mentions Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, the 13-year-old from Brixton who died and was buried without his family present because of lockdown rules. \u201cIf everybody had decided to break the rules, we wouldn\u2019t have brought the infection rate down,\u201d Jones says. 52% of people now think Cumming\u2019s should resign, according to a new poll, Ridge says. The Labour MP Sarah Jones is on Ridge now. \u201cMillions of people have put their lives on hold, have made huge sacrifices,\u201d she says about Dominic Cumming\u2019s rule breaches, adds people are rightly feeling that different rules apply for the population and Cummings. The UK had the highest death rates in Europe, she says, and that Cummings has \u201cundermined\u201d the police. She is calling on the government to provide more answers. Asked if it was a good enough defence that Cummings had travelled 260 miles to seek childcare, she said: \u201cWe all have sympathy with everyone in this situation because it has been really stressful and really difficult. \u201cI know single mums who had Covid when their child had to stay with them and we had to chip in food to make sure they could eat - everyone has made incredible sacrifices. \u201cIf everybody had decided to break the rules then we wouldn\u2019t have brought this infection rate down. \u201cAnd when we heard the prime minister, we heard him say \u2018stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives\u2019 - he didn\u2019t say \u2018or drive 260 miles to Durham if you think that\u2019s the right thing to do\u2019. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t what we heard and that wasn\u2019t what was said and that wasn\u2019t what everybody else did, and that\u2019s why we need answers.\u201d This from the Sunday Times\u2019 political editor Tim Shipman: The Conservative MP Steve Baker has just called for Cummings\u2019 resignation. Sophy Ridge has tweeted a video saying her show has sent Grant Shapps some of the questions he will have to answer in regard to allegations against Dominic Cummings, first reported by The Observer and the Mirror on Sunday. He will be asked when Dominic Cummings first had coronavirus symptoms, when did he travel to Durham, did he stop on the journey, and so on. Good morning, I am going to steer our coronavirus UK live coverage through the next few hours. Today\u2019s front pages are dominated by Dominic Cummings\u2019 breaking of lockdown rules, and transport minister Grant Shapps will be on Ridge on Sunday and Andrew Marr this morning to defend Boris Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser.

The prime minister said he was drawing up plans to reduce the Chinese company\u2019s involvement to zero by 2023.</p> <p>Over the weekend, a series of well-known Conservative MPs added their voices to the debate by either writing or tweeting newspaper articles about the UK distancing itself from China. The MPs included former leader Iain Duncan Smith, former defence secretary Liam Fox and Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee.</p> <p>Writing in the Sun on Sunday, Fox said: \u201cChina is at a crossroads and needs to decide whether it truly wants to become a partner in the global community or take the path to becoming a pariah state.\u201d</p> <p>Tugendhat argued in the Financial Times that \u201ctime is running out\u201d to accelerate new legislation designed to make it harder for state-owned companies from countries such as China to take over struggling UK firms.</p> <p>\u201cBritain needs to bring its laws on foreign ownership in line with partners,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States provides one model that gives the government discretion and dissuades many inappropriate buyers before a veto is required.\u201d</p> <p>The issue of Huawei\u2019s involvement in the UK\u2019s 5G network has long been controversial in the US as well as Britain.</p> <p>Excluding Huawei from the UK\u2019s 5G network would amount to a hasty reversal of a policy announced by ministers in January to limit Huawei to 35% of 5G network supply, and risks irritating China and adding hundreds of millions in costs for BT and other phone companies.</p> <p>The debate in the UK came as Wang told a press conference on the sidelines of National People\u2019s Congress meetings in Beijing: \u201cRegretfully, in addition to the raging coronavirus, a political virus is also spreading in the United States. This political virus is using every opportunity to attack and smear China.\u201d</p> <p>The debate over trade has intensified as the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic becomes clearer.</p> <p>According to a paper published by the World Economic Forum on Sunday, the value of Chinese exports fell by 17.2% year on year in the first two months of 2020, while imports slowed by 4%.</p> <p>The research added: \u201cMajor industries have suffered at the hands of Covid-19, with nuclear reactors, electrical machinery and equipment, plastics and organic chemicals among the worst affected \u2026 Globalisation will work best through the adoption of a strong international cooperation network.\u201d</p> <p>The battles over world trade were further complicated by China\u2019s proposed national security legislation for Hong Kong, which could prompt US sanctions and threaten the city\u2019s status as a financial hub, the White House national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, said on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks like, with this national security law, they\u2019re going to basically take over Hong Kong, and if they do \u2026 Secretary [of State Mike] Pompeo will likely be unable to certify that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy, and if that happens, there will be sanctions that will be imposed on Hong Kong and China,\u201d O\u2019Brien said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.</p>",

The MPs included former leader Iain Duncan Smith, former defence secretary Liam Fox and Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee. Writing in the Sun on Sunday, Fox said: \u201cChina is at a crossroads and needs to decide whether it truly wants to become a partner in the global community or take the path to becoming a pariah state.\u201d Tugendhat argued in the Financial Times that \u201ctime is running out\u201d to accelerate new legislation designed to make it harder for state-owned companies from countries such as China to take over struggling UK firms. \u201cBritain needs to bring its laws on foreign ownership in line with partners,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States provides one model that gives the government discretion and dissuades many inappropriate buyers before a veto is required.\u201d The issue of Huawei\u2019s involvement in the UK\u2019s 5G network has long been controversial in the US as well as Britain. Excluding Huawei from the UK\u2019s 5G network would amount to a hasty reversal of a policy announced by ministers in January to limit Huawei to 35% of 5G network supply, and risks irritating China and adding hundreds of millions in costs for BT and other phone companies. The debate in the UK came as Wang told a press conference on the sidelines of National People\u2019s Congress meetings in Beijing: \u201cRegretfully, in addition to the raging coronavirus, a political virus is also spreading in the United States. This political virus is using every opportunity to attack and smear China.\u201d The debate over trade has intensified as the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic becomes clearer. According to a paper published by the World Economic Forum on Sunday, the value of Chinese exports fell by 17.2% year on year in the first two months of 2020, while imports slowed by 4%. The research added: \u201cMajor industries have suffered at the hands of Covid-19, with nuclear reactors, electrical machinery and equipment, plastics and organic chemicals among the worst affected \u2026 Globalisation will work best through the adoption of a strong international cooperation network.\u201d The battles over world trade were further complicated by China\u2019s proposed national security legislation for Hong Kong, which could prompt US sanctions and threaten the city\u2019s status as a financial hub, the White House national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, said on Sunday. \u201cIt looks like, with this national security law, they\u2019re going to basically take over Hong Kong, and if they do \u2026 Secretary [of State Mike] Pompeo will likely be unable to certify that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy, and if that happens, there will be sanctions that will be imposed on Hong Kong and China,\u201d O\u2019Brien said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.",

A government spokesman said: \u201cFollowing the US announcement of additional sanctions against Huawei, the NCSC is looking carefully at any impact they could have to the UK\u2019s networks.\u201d In early May, the US said it would impose fresh sanctions against Huawei as part of a long-running campaign against the company, whose technology, the White House claims, could be exploited by China to conduct surveillance against the west.

      "body": "<p>Look on the bright side: at least we\u2019ve had it confirmed who is actually running the country these days. And it isn\u2019t the prime minister. Boris Johnson is no more than Dominic Cummings\u2019s sock-puppet. A fairly shabby one at that. The reality is that without Classic Dom, there could be no Boris. All that Boris really amounts to is a parasitical ball of compromised ambition fuelled by a viral overload of neediness and cowardice. There is no substance or dignity left within the prime minister. His only instinct is his own survival.</p> <p>The equation was quite simple. If Dom was to be fired, then Boris would have to fire himself, because it is inconceivable that the ersatz prime minister didn\u2019t know the de facto prime minister had broken the lockdown rules by doing a runner to Durham. But just in case Boris had been in any doubt, Dom had arrived at Downing Street four hours before the daily coronavirus press conference to remind him who was boss. There were to be no sackings and no resignations. Not yet anyway. There may be in the days to come.</p> <p>Not that Boris had actually wanted to front up the No 10 briefing. It was just that every other cabinet minister had phoned in to say they were self-isolating in their second homes. Or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/cabinet-minister-robert-jenrick-visited-his-parents-during-covid-19-lockdown\">in Robert Jenrick\u2019s case, his third home</a>. </p> <p>Right from the off, Boris had looked rattled. The self-styled great communicator has lost the power of language and can now only talk in staccato bursts of incomprehensible Morse code. Even more disastrously, he is the populist politician who has lost track of the mood of the people. His survival skills have deserted him. The country is spitting blood at the arrogance of one rule for the elite and another for the rest, and Boris is totally oblivious.</p> <p>Breathless and pasty-faced, his eyes still bloodshot after his talking-to by Dom, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/boris-johnson-backs-dominic-cummings-in-face-of-tory-calls-for-chief-aide-to-resign\">Boris leapt to his boss\u2019s defence</a>. He hadn\u2019t been able to throw a protective ring around care homes, but he sure as hell was going to throw one round Cummings. Classic Dom had done nothing wrong at all. In fact, he had done what any father would do and drive to his second home. Mostly because he was so short of friends that he had no one within a 260-mile radius who could leave food parcels for his child. Oddly, that was one of the few statements that sounded vaguely convincing.</p> <p>The rest of his opening remarks were incoherent drivel. Dom had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/dominic-cummings-timeline-what-we-know-about-his-movements\">driven the length of the country to escape the virus</a>. Even though he was taking it with him in the car and almost certainly contracted it during the enclosed proximity to his wife. It was as though Boris thought the virus could only travel at 50 mph, so if Dom drove at 70mph up the M1, then he could outrun it.</p> <p>Dom had had no alternative. Indeed, if the de facto prime minister had a fault, it was that he loved his family too much. All those single mothers and workshy parents without second homes were basically heartless and uncaring for staying put and obeying the government advice on self-isolation. Dom: the man who loved too much.</p> <p>Boris then wittered on a bit about schools \u2013 mysteriously, he seemed to forget the dualling of the A66 that Grant Shapps had been so desperate to talk about during the morning media round \u2013 but all the questions concentrated on how and how often Dom had chosen to arbitrarily break the rules. Here Boris started to get sweaty and petulant. He was standing by Dom and that was that. He didn\u2019t have to give a credible reason because he was the World King who wrote all the rules.</p> <p>Bizarrely, he even described Dom as responsible. Cummings won\u2019t be at all happy about that. His whole self-image is based upon him being the great anti-establishment disruptor; the person to whom rules don\u2019t apply. Not some establishment posh boy who toed the line at all times. God save the Queen! Her fascist regime.</p> <p>Then Boris was unwittingly making sure that both he and Dom had no future. The press conference he had hoped would draw a line under Dom\u2019s midnight \u2013 no toilet or snack breaks \u2013 flits to his hideout merely served to ensure they would dominate the news agenda for weeks. Boris had had a chance to show genuine leadership and completely flunked it.</p> <p>He refused to answer any questions about whether he knew Dom had done a runner \u2013 just imagine Boris working from Downing Street imagining his host body was holed up in north London \u2013 or when he discovered that Dom was in Durham. Not because he didn\u2019t know, but because he genuinely thought it didn\u2019t matter. Boris is a true believer in his own exceptionalism, a trait that he graciously extends to those who are close to him. He genuinely doesn\u2019t see a problem with not obeying a rule himself that he has asked the rest of the country to follow. So what if Dom and his family might have risked infecting a few dozen inconsequential little people? Sacrifice is what other, lesser people do. Nor was there even an attempt to answer the allegations about Dom\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/witness-complains-to-police-about-dominic-cummings-as-pressure-mounts\">other alleged extracurricular outings to Barnard Castle or the bluebell woods</a>.</p> <p>In saving Dom \u2013 for the time being at least \u2013 Boris had tossed away the credibility of his own government. He has been stripped bare and exposed as not very bright, lacking in judgment and completely amoral. Within an hour, he had not only defended the indefensible, he had basically told the nation they were free to do as they please. If there is a second coronavirus peak, Boris will have even more blood on his hands. He\u2019d even made Shapps\u2019s TV appearances look vaguely statesmanlike. <em>That</em> bad. At a time of national crisis, we have a prime minister who makes Henry Kissinger look worthy of a Nobel peace prize. Satire is now dead.</p>",

Right from the off, Boris had looked rattled. The self-styled great communicator has lost the power of language and can now only talk in staccato bursts of incomprehensible Morse code. Even more disastrously, he is the populist politician who has lost track of the mood of the people. His survival skills have deserted him. The country is spitting blood at the arrogance of one rule for the elite and another for the rest, and Boris is totally oblivious. Breathless and pasty-faced, his eyes still bloodshot after his talking-to by Dom, Boris leapt to his boss\u2019s defence. He hadn\u2019t been able to throw a protective ring around care homes, but he sure as hell was going to throw one round Cummings. Classic Dom had done nothing wrong at all. In fact, he had done what any father would do and drive to his second home. Mostly because he was so short of friends that he had no one within a 260-mile radius who could leave food parcels for his child. Oddly, that was one of the few statements that sounded vaguely convincing. The rest of his opening remarks were incoherent drivel. Dom had driven the length of the country to escape the virus. Even though he was taking it with him in the car and almost certainly contracted it during the enclosed proximity to his wife. It was as though Boris thought the virus could only travel at 50 mph, so if Dom drove at 70mph up the M1, then he could outrun it. Dom had had no alternative. Indeed, if the de facto prime minister had a fault, it was that he loved his family too much. All those single mothers and workshy parents without second homes were basically heartless and uncaring for staying put and obeying the government advice on self-isolation. Dom: the man who loved too much. Boris then wittered on a bit about schools \u2013 mysteriously, he seemed to forget the dualling of the A66 that Grant Shapps had been so desperate to talk about during the morning media round \u2013 but all the questions concentrated on how and how often Dom had chosen to arbitrarily break the rules. Here Boris started to get sweaty and petulant. He was standing by Dom and that was that. He didn\u2019t have to give a credible reason because he was the World King who wrote all the rules. Bizarrely, he even described Dom as responsible. Cummings won\u2019t be at all happy about that. His whole self-image is based upon him being the great anti-establishment disruptor; the person to whom rules don\u2019t apply. Not some establishment posh boy who toed the line at all times. God save the Queen! Her fascist regime. Then Boris was unwittingly making sure that both he and Dom had no future. The press conference he had hoped would draw a line under Dom\u2019s midnight \u2013 no toilet or snack breaks \u2013 flits to his hideout merely served to ensure they would dominate the news agenda for weeks. Boris had had a chance to show genuine leadership and completely flunked it. He refused to answer any questions about whether he knew Dom had done a runner \u2013 just imagine Boris working from Downing Street imagining his host body was holed up in north London \u2013 or when he discovered that Dom was in Durham. Not because he didn\u2019t know, but because he genuinely thought it didn\u2019t matter. Boris is a true believer in his own exceptionalism, a trait that he graciously extends to those who are close to him. He genuinely doesn\u2019t see a problem with not obeying a rule himself that he has asked the rest of the country to follow. So what if Dom and his family might have risked infecting a few dozen inconsequential little people? Sacrifice is what other, lesser people do. Nor was there even an attempt to answer the allegations about Dom\u2019s other alleged extracurricular outings to Barnard Castle or the bluebell woods. In saving Dom \u2013 for the time being at least \u2013 Boris had tossed away the credibility of his own government. He has been stripped bare and exposed as not very bright, lacking in judgment and completely amoral. Within an hour, he had not only defended the indefensible, he had basically told the nation they were free to do as they please. If there is a second coronavirus peak, Boris will have even more blood on his hands. He\u2019d even made Shapps\u2019s TV appearances look vaguely statesmanlike. That bad. At a time of national crisis, we have a prime minister who makes Henry Kissinger look worthy of a Nobel peace prize. Satire is now dead.",

Now it emerges that the rules are optional for the prime minister\u2019s friends. The stated message was: \u201cStay at home\u201d. The unstated: \u201cDo as we say, and not as we do\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-durham-trip-coronavirus-lockdown\">breach of rules</a> by Mr Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings, revealed by the Guardian and the Mirror, is not an abstruse Westminster affair involving complicated financial dealings, or arcane parliamentary regulations.

You can continue to follow the latest on Covid-19 in our global liveblog: The Associated Press has reported on concerns that insufficient or faulty data is hampering the US\u2019s efforts to contain Covid-19. Here\u2019s the report: Elected officials, businesses and others are depending on coronavirus testing and infection-rate data as states reopen so that they will know if a second wave of contagion is coming and whether another round of stay-at-home orders or closings might be needed. But states are reporting those figures in different ways, and that can lead to frustration and confusion about what the numbers mean. In some places, there have been data gaps that leave local leaders wondering whether they should loosen or tighten restrictions. In others, officials are accused of spinning the numbers to make their states look better and justify reopening. In a continuing theme for the outbreak in the United States, a lack of federal leadership persists. Even the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been lumping together tests that measure different things. Such errors render the CDC numbers about how many Americans are infected \u201cuninterpretable,\u201d creating a misleading picture for people trying to make decisions based on the data, said Ashish Jha, director of Harvard\u2019s Global Health Institute, \u201cIt is incumbent on health departments and the CDC to make sure they\u2019re presenting information that\u2019s accurate. And if they can\u2019t get it, then don\u2019t show the data at all,\u201d Jha said. \u201cFaulty data is much, much worse than no data.\u201d The press secretary for Ralph Northam, the Democratic governor of Virginia, has admitted the governor should have worn a facemask during a public appearance this weekend. Ralph Northam, who is also a qualified physician, said last week that \u201cwearing a mask could literally save someone else\u2019s life\u201d. However, during a visit to Virginia Beach Oceanfront on Saturday he was seen without a mask. \u201cHe was outside yesterday and not expecting to be within six feet of anyone,\u201d Northam\u2019s press secretary, Alena Yarmosky, said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cThis is an important reminder to always have face coverings in case situations change we are all learning how to operate in this new normal, and it\u2019s important to be prepared.\u201d Todd Gilbert, a Virginia Republican, tweeted a photo of Northam without a mask with the message \u201cPhysician, heal thyself\u201d. Deaths from Covid-19 in Virginia were at 1,135 as of Sunday. Fox News\u2019s Chris Wallace is not popular on Twitter with supporters of the president after he criticised White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Fox News Sunday. Last week, McEnany questioned the religious beliefs of reporters. McEnany made the comments after Trump said places of worship should count as essential services during the pandemic. She said she found it \u201cinteresting to be in a room that desperately wants to seem to see these churches and houses of worship stay closed.\u201d On Sunday, Wallace said that \u201c[former ABC White House correspondent] Sam Donaldson and me in the Reagan White House, we were pretty tough on the White House press secretaries and we never had our religious beliefs questioned or were lectured on what we should ask.\u201d Wallace\u2019s comments are sure to irk Trump, who has complained of Wallace\u2019s coverage of his administration. In an interview with Full Measure, Donald Trump has once again blamed the Covid-19 pandemic on China and praised his own handling of the crisis. \u201cIt came out of China, whether we like it or not, it came out of China. It could have been stopped. It came all over the world, but it didn\u2019t really go to China,\u201d said the president. \u201cThey stopped their planes going into China, but they didn\u2019t stop their planes and their traffic going into the rest of the world, including the United States and Europe, and Europe is decimated. And you look at what happened all over the world, 186 countries. So now it\u2019s a very terrible thing and they could have stopped it if they wanted to, they could have stopped it. Either it was incompetent or they didn\u2019t want to, both are not very acceptable, by the way.\u201d Trump was then asked how he felt when he first heard the virus could kill millions of people. As has been his habit, he praised his own response to the pandemic rather than express any sympathy towards those who have died or lost relatives. \u201cSo I was hearing millions of people, and it would have been millions of people if we didn\u2019t shut down,\u201d said Trump. \u201c... I did a ban and nobody thought I should do it. I mean, literally I don\u2019t think anybody thought I should do it. I made that decision by myself and it turned out to be a great decision. Hundreds of thousands of lives are saved.\u201d The president also confirmed he had completed a two-week course of hydroxychloroquine to prevent Covid-19, despite scientists cautioning against taking the drug to treat the virus. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve heard tremendous reports about it,\u201d said Trump. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019ve heard tremendous reports. Many people think it saved their lives.\u201d My colleague Richard Luscombe has news on Joe Biden\u2019s holiday weekend activities... The latest installment of Sincerely, Joe, the digital letter series launched earlier this month by the Democratic presumptive presidential candidate Joe Biden to showcase his correspondence with the American people during the coronavirus pandemic, includes the revelation that his favorite flavor of ice cream is, wait for it, chocolate chip. The detail comes in the former vice-president\u2019s reply to a young letter writer called Jack Cooney, who sent a colorful drawing of himself with Biden and a request to know: \u201cWhat was your favorite part of working with President Obama?\u201d alongside the ice cream question. \u201cKids like you, our future leaders, give me hope,\u201d Biden replied. \u201cYour curiosity and your empathy underscore the idea that as Americans, we have the power to uplift one another and improve our communities for future generations. \u201cIt is no coincidence; this was also my favorite part about working with President Obama. His hope is eternal, his friendship is true, and he has a heart as big as they come. Our friends inspire, encourage, and support us, especially on our toughest days. Often, it\u2019s as simple as being there for one another.\u201d As for the ice cream, Biden urges Jack to: \u201ccontinue to devote yourself to your studies, work hard every day, develop a genuine, life-long love of learning, and treat yourself to a little chocolate chip ice cream, my favorite flavor, every once in a while.\u201d Aides have dismissed concerns that Biden\u2019s campaign has suffered through his self-isolation at his Delaware home. He retains a 5.5% lead over Donald Trump in the Real Clear Politics national poll average for November\u2019s election. New York is making its first steps towards reopening, a fact demonstrated when Governor Andrew Cuomo gave his daily press briefing from Long Island\u2019s Jones Beach on Sunday. Cuomo said professional sports teams in New York will now be allowed to reopen their training camps and the governor said it was a sign of a \u201creturn to normalcy.\u201d While New York City has been noticeably busier in the last week, the city\u2019s beaches are still closed and many residents are expected to head to Long Island over the holiday weekend, where restrictions are less severe and beaches are open. Cuomo said that New Yorkers must still be vigilant, despite the easing however. The state recorded 109 deaths from Covid-19 over the last 24 hours, a slight rise from the previous day. \u201cWhat do we really think, this is the last time we are going to have a public health emergency?\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure we are better for what we have gone through.\u201d Temperatures in much of New York were cool on Sunday, but many people still wanted to be outside. \u201cPeople still make the best out of it. It doesn\u2019t matter. I guess during this pandemic they\u2019ve been practicing staying home, staying safe, so now they see an opportunity and they just want to get out,\u201d one New Yorker, Jessica M Lopez, told the Associated Press. Much of the focus on Covid-19 layoffs has understandably been on workers in the private sector. But New Jersey governor Phil Murphy today warned that state and federal workers could be at risk too. In an appearance on CNN, the Democratic governor said that some of the state\u2019s teachers, police and health workers could be laid off if New Jersey does not receive more federal assistance. \u201cWe announced a budget on Friday for the next four months and we had to cut or defer over $5bn of expenditures,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cAnd this includes potentially laying off educators, firefighters, police, EMS, health care workers. This is not abstract. This is real. It\u2019s not a blue state issue. It\u2019s an American issue.\u201d New Jersey has the second-most deaths of any US state from Covid-19. Murphy said 52 deaths from the virus had been reported in the last 24 hours, bring the state\u2019s death toll to 11,133. UK prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s top adviser, Dominic Cummings, was revealed by the Guardian to have made a 264-mile trip to his parents\u2019 home while the country was in lockdown. Many expected Cummings to resign - or be fired - for contravening the lockdown. Instead, today Johnson has backed his adviser saying he was right to take the trip, which Cummings said was in the interest of his son\u2019s health after Cummings\u2019 wife fell ill. An editorial in the Guardian echoes the feeling of many in the UK: Ever get the feeling you\u2019ve been cheated? Boris Johnson has previously lauded the effort and sacrifice of the British people, who for nine weeks of lockdown have endured not only inconvenience and discomfort, but hardship and in many cases real sacrifice: of desperately needed income, of the opportunity to support struggling relatives, see dying family members, or attend the funerals of loved ones. Now it emerges that the rules are optional for the prime minister\u2019s friends. The stated message was: \u201cStay at home\u201d. The unstated: \u201cDo as we say, and not as we do\u201d. The breach of rules by Mr Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings, revealed by the Guardian and the Mirror, is not an abstruse Westminster affair involving complicated financial dealings, or arcane parliamentary regulations. It is a matter that everyone understands and in which everyone has a stake, because everyone has given up something they valued and many have paid dearly. People feel not just indignation, but rage. Many in the UK\u2019s civil service appear to be angry with Johnson and Cummings too. A since deleted tweet from the civil service\u2019s official account went straight to the point. \u201cArrogant and offensive,\u201d read the tweet from the @UKCivilService Twitter account, which has just over 250,000 followers. \u201cCan you imagine having to work with these truth twisters?\u201d There fears that the holiday weekend may lead to people heading to public spaces and ignoring social distancing. That certainly appears to be the case in Missouri, where video emerged of a pool party at the Lake of the Ozarks packed with people who are separated by six inches rather than the recommended six feet. A pool party may be the source of an outbreak in another state, Arkansas. The state\u2019s governor, Asa Hutchinson, said this weekend that Arkansas faces a \u201csecond peak\u201d of cases and some of those could be linked back to a high school party. \u201cA high school swim party that I\u2019m sure everybody thought was harmless,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThey\u2019re young, they\u2019re swimming, they\u2019re just having activity, and positive cases resulted from that.\u201d Arkansas has recently lifted some Covid-19 related restrictions but Hutchinson, a Republican, said he did not necessarily believes a rise in cases was due to the easing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to think about next fall,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be cloistered in our homes. That\u2019s contrary to the American spirit.\u201d After playing golf yesterday, Donald Trump was back on the fairways at his course in Virginia today. According to CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, this is the president\u2019s 266th trip to one of his golf clubs since he took office. Photos from Saturday, showed the president failing to observe social distancing and shaking hands during his round as the number of deaths from Covid-19 in the US approaches 100,000. Trump\u2019s own public health experts said that golf is an acceptable activity but that players should still be cautious when playing. \u201cWe\u2019re asking continuously for you all to be outside, to enjoy your Memorial Day weekend, to play golf, to hike, as Dr [Anthony] Fauci said, to play tennis with marked balls and to be out with your families that you have been in the household with and to even consider sharing social distance space,\u201d said coronavirus taskforce member Dr Deborah Birx on Friday. Birx also said golfers should not touch flags on greens and added: \u201cremember that that is your space, and that\u2019s a space that you need to protect and ensure that you social distance for others.\u201d Anyone playing with Trump today may want to keep an eye on the president\u2019s scorecard too. Because, as Rick Reilly, has detailed the president does not always play by golf\u2019s rules: Donald Trump has tweeted that Covid-19 \u201ccases, numbers and deaths are going down all over the Country!\u201d. While cases and deaths from the virus are declining across as the US as a whole, individual states have reported upticks. Deaths in New York were up over the last 24 hours, while rises have been reported in Florida, South Carolina, Arkansas and Washington DC. Public health experts are also urging Americans to remain at home, and there is a fear that the reopening of many states risks a second wave of deaths from Covid-19. Mike DeWine, Ohio\u2019s Republican governor, decried the politicization of wearing masks in public to help contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThis is not about politics, this is not about whether you\u2019re liberal or conservative, left or right, Republican, Democrat,\u201d DeWine said in an appearance on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday. \u201cWe wear the mask, and it\u2019s been very clear what the studies have shown, you wear the mask not to protect yourself so much as to protect others. And this is one time when we truly are all in this together. What we do directly impacts others.\u201d DeWine\u2019s remarks were in response to North Dakota governor Doug Burgum\u2019s emotional address on Friday decrying the \u201csenseless dividing line\u201d between US citizens over whether masks should be worn in public. With many states like Ohio beginning to relax stay-at-home restrictions, DeWine stressed the importance of doing it carefully. \u201cOur order does say that every employee in every business unless there is some reason that they can\u2019t wear that mask, every employee\u2019s wearing a mask today,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a fundamental change in Ohio. As we go out, you know, a lot of stores you\u2019ll see 90% of the people who do, the customers are wearing masks. But we want to continue to up that throughout the state because it is really what we need as we open up the economy. \u201cLook, Chuck, this is a risk. But it\u2019s also a risk if we don\u2019t open up the economy, all the downsides of not opening the economy. We can do both these things.\u201d It\u2019s a familiar internet thing \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I can use the word meme here or not, because Richard Dawkins lost me on it years ago and I never caught up \u2013 to express comic bewilderment at the things 2020 has decided to throw at us: a pandemic, floods, murder hornets, celebrities singing Imagine in lockdown. We\u2019ve already had warnings about starving, cannibalistic rats, so perhaps new federal warnings about aggressive rats are actually only worth a side note. But, y\u2019know, Winston Smith, Orwell, Room 101, worst fears, etc. So: According to new advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \u201csome jurisdictions have reported an increase in rodent activity as rodents search for new sources of food. Environmental health and rodent control programs may see an increase in service requests related to rodents and reports of unusual or aggressive rodent behavior.\u201d As the Washington Post puts it, this is bad because \u201crats can transmit food-borne illnesses such as salmonella, and their urine can also worsen allergies and asthma, especially in children\u201d. So that\u2019s nice. Richard Luscombe writes\u2026 A (little) more detail on the revelations from Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, on Fox News Sunday that Donald Trump does indeed wear a mask when he\u2019s not socially distancing. It turns out to be more of an assumption on her part, in place of any hard and fast evidence. \u201cI\u2019m not with him every day and every moment so I don\u2019t know if he can maintain social distance. I\u2019ve asked everybody independently to really make sure you wear a mask if you can\u2019t maintain the six feet,\u201d Birx said. \u201cI\u2019m assuming that in a majority of cases he\u2019s able to maintain that six feet distance.\u201d Pressed by host Chris Wallace if she felt Trump should be setting an example to the country by wearing one in public, Birx said: \u201cThe president did wear a mask while he was less than six feet\u2026 where that was important, while he was travelling last week.\u201d Birx was presumably referring to his visit to a Ford plant in Michigan during which he told reporters he had worn one \u201cbackstage\u201d but removed it for his public appearance because \u201cI didn\u2019t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.\u201d More generally, Birx said: \u201cThere\u2019s clear scientific evidence to show that a mask does prevent droplets from reaching others. Out of respect for each other, as Americans that care for each other, we need to be wearing masks in public when we cannot socially distance.\u201d She said she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d at images of people enjoying the Memorial Day weekend on beaches and parks, in close proximity and without masks. \u201cWe know being outside does help, we know the sun does help in killing the virus, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that people need to be responsible and maintain that distance,\u201d she said. \u201cI was hoping to convey this very clear message to the American people. Across the country there is a virus out there.\u201d Birx faced similar questions from Martha Raddatz on ABC\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos, who questioned whether her comments on Friday that people should get outside for Memorial Day was the right call. \u201cWe have to communicate through different venues, making sure that our generation sees and our Millennials can help us get that message out there, of how to be together socially yet distant,\u201d she said. \u201cAmericans are amazingly innovative. And I think we really just need to have better continuous communication on how important that is.\u201d One big question from Raddatz as numbers continue to spike in some areas\u2026 will the nation need a prolonged, or second lockdown? \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tell and I really am data-driven, so I\u2019m collecting data right now about whether governors and whether states and whether communities are able to open safely,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of this proactive testing needs to be in place and needs to continue to be in place because that will determine safely remaining open in the fall.\u201d Val Demings, a Democratic representative from Florida who is among contenders to be Joe Biden\u2019s running mate in the presidential election, has castigated Donald Trump for having the \u201cgall and nerve\u201d to use a gaffe by Biden as a weapon on the campaign trail. Biden apologised after saying if African Americans \u201chave a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black\u201d, a remark which prompted fierce attacks from supporters of the president and criticism from Biden\u2019s own backers. \u201cThe vice-president shouldn\u2019t have said it, he apologised for it,\u201d Demings told CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday. \u201cBut I really think the gall and the nerve of President Trump to try to use this in his campaign, he who has since day one done everything in his power, supported by his enablers, to divide this country, particularly along racial lines \u2026 \u201cLook, let\u2019s talk about race because we definitely need to, we see it in housing, we see it in voting rights, we see it in healthcare, we see it in education. Mr President, let\u2019s do have a serious conversation about race in America and how about working for all people that you are supposed to represent, not just the privileged few.\u201d It was the kind of fiery defence one would expect from someone talked about as a possible running mate. Biden has committed to choosing a woman and many \u2013 including the interviewer who elicited the gaffe on Friday, radio host Charlamagne tha God \u2013 think it should be an African American woman. California senator Kamala Harris and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams \u2013 a target of retweets in dubious taste from Trump on Saturday night \u2013 are generally thought to be the most likely picks. But Demings, a former Orlando police chief, delivered a decent mini-audition for a traditional running mate role: going on the offensive. Asked about expressions of outrage from the Republican South Carolina senator Tim Scott and former Utah representative Mia Love, Demings said: \u201cI think it\u2019s interesting that the president searched high and low to find [an] African American member of the Senate and a former member of Congress to speak out on this issue. It\u2019d be nice to hear other Republicans, male or female, speak out.\u201d CNN host Dana Bash asked directly if Demings wants to be vice-president. She did not answer directly, but made it clear she would serve if asked. National security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien has also appeared on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, to accuse China of a \u201ccover-up that they did of the virus [that] is going to go down in history along with Chernobyl\u201d. Most scientists say the pathogen that has infected 5.3m and killed more than 342,000 worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University, was passed from bats to humans via an intermediary species likely sold at a wet market in Wuhan late last year. But Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other senior US figures have repeatedly said they suspect the coronavirus was somehow released from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The Trump administration is seeking a scapegoat for a US death toll near 100,000, criticism of the president\u2019s handling of the outbreak and a cratering economy. Vice-President Mike Pence kept up the charge on Saturday, telling Breitbart News: \u201cChina let the world down and the World Health Organization was their willing partner in withholding from the United States and the wider world vital information about the coronavirus that would have made it possible to stand up a national response sooner. \u201c... Make no mistake about it that China will be held accountable for what the world has gone through because of their lack of transparency.\u201d On Sunday, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cWe want good relations with China and with the Chinese people, but unfortunately, we\u2019re seeing just action after action by the Chinese Communist Party that makes it difficult \u2026 we\u2019re dealing in a new world now with corona. \u201cThey unleashed a virus on the world that\u2019s destroyed trillions of dollars in American economic wealth that we\u2019re having to spend to keep our economy alive, to keep Americans afloat during this virus. So we\u2019re in a, we\u2019re in a very different world. \u201cThe cover-up that they did of the virus is going to go down in history along with Chernobyl. We\u2019ll see an HBO special about 10 or 15 years from now, and so we\u2019re in a different place with China as we speak today.\u201d The Associated Press, meanwhile, reported comments from the director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology about US claims the lab is to blame for the virus. Such claims are a \u201cpure fabrication\u201d, Wang Yanyi was quoted by state media as saying, adding that the institute did not have \u201cany knowledge before that nor had we ever met, researched or kept the virus. We didn\u2019t even know about the existence of the virus, so how could it be leaked from our lab when we didn\u2019t have it?\u201d The AP also said the coronavirus toll continues to ebb in Asia and other parts of the world, with China on Sunday reporting three new cases and just 79 people remaining in treatment for Covid-19. Here\u2019s an op ed about such comparisons, from a more sober standpoint: The United States will on Sunday impose a lockdown on travelers from Brazil, according to Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser. Covid-19 deaths have soared in Brazil as the country\u2019s foul-mouthed president, Jair Bolsonaro, continues to deflect from the crisis. It seems the Trump administration has heard enough. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have a decision today with respect to Brazil, just like we did with the UK and Europe and China, and we hope it will be temporary,\u201d Robert O\u2019Brien told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the people of the southern hemisphere,\u201d O\u2019Brien continued, \u201cthe people of Brazil, they\u2019ve had a rough go of it. But because of the situation in Brazil, we\u2019re going to take every step necessary to protect the American people. \u201cAs of now I\u2019d say Brazil, and we\u2019ll take a look at the other countries on a country by country basis.\u201d O\u2019Brien did not divulge details of any such lockdown. But the conversation did allow him to pick up the White House narrative of painting China as the bogeyman of the Covid-19 crisis. \u201cThey allowed those folks to travel from China to Europe, and to seed the disease in Europe and have it come through a backdoor into the United States,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cIn perfect hindsight, when we realized the Europeans hadn\u2019t cut off travel, sure it would have been better to cut off earlier.\u201d O\u2019Brien claimed \u201cliterally hundreds of thousands or millions of lives were saved\u201d by Trump\u2019s travel bans, and that the president\u2019s move was \u201ca profile in courage\u201d. The Washington Post reported on Saturday on how Trump\u2019s restriction on flights from Europe backfired badly. O\u2019Brien also said he expected an in-person G7 gathering of world leaders to take place in Washington in late June. \u201cWe\u2019re getting very close to the peak [of the pandemic] if we\u2019re not already, in Washington and if the situation permits it, and we think it will, we\u2019d love to have the G7 in person,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure everybody\u2019s tested, we\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s a safe environment. The leaders would love to get out of their offices and meet in person to plan the post-Covid world.\u201d Two other notable footnotes: the US presidential election will take place as planned on 3 November, \u201cno question about it\u201d O\u2019Brien says, despite speculation fuelled by comments from Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner that the administration might be looking at a postponement. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what happens with the virus, but we want to make sure that we have a free and fair election. That election\u2019s going to take place on election day, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, declaring that stockpiles of PPE, especially masks, were being built for election workers. O\u2019Brien also insisted there was no security risk posed by Trump, the nation\u2019s commander in chief, continuing to take hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that the Food and Drug Administration says could have life-threatening side effects. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re doing the right regimen for President Trump \u2026 he\u2019s under great medical care,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing the right thing that he and his physician believe is good for the president. The guy\u2019s got more energy than anyone I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he added, claiming improbably that the golf-loving president was working \u201c16, 18 hours a day.\u201d Florida senator, and former governor, Rick Scott is up on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, struggling to explain why he thinks Floridians should wear masks and socially distance while the state reopens and beaches fill over Memorial Day weekend, but doesn\u2019t think there should be official mandates to do so. \u201cI trust the American public to make good decisions,\u201d Scott says. But he thinks \u201cif you\u2019re close to somebody you oughta wear a mask. We have to social distance safely \u2026 we have to do it.\u201d Asked about comments to Fox News earlier this week which were much more skeptical and, well, Trumpy, Scott insists people should not be told what to do by the president, governors, senators and other figures in authority. But should heed advice, such as that he, a senator, is giving now. Scott defends Trump\u2019s attempt to order states to open houses of worship on the same lines: people will do it safely but the government shouldn\u2019t order them to do so. \u201cI don\u2019t think it matters what the president or a governor says,\u201d says the former governor and current senator. In a sense, of course, it doesn\u2019t matter what Trump says on the churches issue, because he doesn\u2019t have the constitutional power to order governors to open churches. Speaking of America\u2019s beaches, here\u2019s Ankita Rao on the subject: White House public health adviser Dr Deborah Birx is appearing on Fox News Sunday and according to Fox News Sunday, she says: \u201cPresident Trump does wear a mask when he is unable to social distance from others.\u201d Trump\u2019s reluctance to wear a mask in public or apparently in private has become a running theme of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly since cases were confirmed in the White House, close to the president himself. This week, at a Ford plant in Michigan, Trump was pictured wearing one. Not without connection to Trump\u2019s stance, the wearing of masks in public, or not, has become a new front line in America\u2019s culture war. Federal guidelines recommend it, some states demand it, and some do not. Some rightwing protesters have decried the wearing of masks. On Saturday, video spread showing North Dakota governor Doug Burgum moved to tears while pleading for people not to \u201cmask shame\u201d those who choose to cover their noses and mouths in public. North Dakota does not mandate the wearing of masks. Also from Fox News Sunday about its interview with Birx (which airs at 10am ET in New York): \u201cDr Deborah Birx says on Fox News Sunday she is still concerned with people going outside and not social distancing.\u201d Here\u2019s a picture of Donald Trump shaking hands with a golfing partner in Virginia on Saturday: Talk shows up. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett tells CNN\u2019s State of the Union he expects unemployment to go \u201cnorth of 20%\u201d before any correction, which means figures will be higher in June. Nearly 40m Americans have filed for unemployment under the pandemic, after all. Is it possible unemployment will still be in double digits in November when the country goes to the polls, Hassett is asked. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. National security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien has told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation the election won\u2019t be delayed, by the way. Trump hopes an election held in an economic hole does not happen, to put it mildly, as he gears up for his election campaign against Joe Biden. Unemployment will move back slowly, Hassett says, adding: \u201cIf there were a vaccine in July I would be way more optimistic about it.\u201d There won\u2019t be. Hassett is also pressed on the prospects for the stimulus bill passed by the House but stalled in front of the Senate and the White House. He hedges but it\u2019s clear there\u2019s no significant movement. Checking in on the catchweight bout of the century \u2013 or, well, today \u2013 between Donald Trump and Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, better known as Jeff Sessions, the attorney general Trump tormented and fired over his recusal from overseeing the Russia investigation who is now running for his old Senate seat in Alabama while Trump torments him some more. Sessions, on Saturday: \u201cMr President. Alabama can and does trust me, as do conservatives across the country. Perhaps you\u2019ve forgotten. They trusted me when I stepped out and put that trust on the line for you. You and I fight for the same agenda. Tommy Tuberville [his Senate opponent, ahead in the polls, endorsed by Trump] is so weak he won\u2019t debate me and too weak for Alabama. \u201cAlabama will vote for you this fall, but Alabama will not take orders from Washington on who to send to the Senate.\u201d Trump, in reply: \u201cJeff, you had your chance and you blew it. Recused yourself ON DAY ONE (you never told me of a problem), and ran for the hills. You had no courage, and ruined many lives. The dirty cops, and others, got caught by better and stronger people than you. Hopefully this slime will pay a big price. \u201cYou should drop out of the race and pray that super liberal Doug Jones, a weak and pathetic puppet for Crazy Nancy Pelosi &amp; Cryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer, gets beaten badly. He voted for impeachment based on \u201cZERO\u201d. Disgraced Alabama. Coach Tuberville will be a GREAT Senator!\u201d So there\u2019s that: Donald Trump has no public events scheduled today. It\u2019s the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, the traditional start of the American summer, and the weather forecast for Washington DC is, if not spectacular, not wet. One would think it\u2019s a toss-up whether the president stays in to rage tweet the morning shows \u2013 Dr Deborah Birx is up on a couple and seems sure to be asked about the president\u2019s choice of activity on Saturday as the coronavirus death toll neared 100,000 \u2013 or heads back to Trump National in Sterling, Virginia. While we wait \u2013 on the edges of our seats, I\u2019m sure \u2013 to find out, here\u2019s some further reading from our columnist Robert Reich, once labor secretary under Bill Clinton, on the great question of whether it\u2019s safe for states to reopen their economies (or indeed their churches, as Trump demanded they do today): \u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in the US, and of course the politics around it. According to Johns Hopkins University, there have been 1,613,302 confirmed cases in the US and 96,657 deaths. Around 1,000 of those deaths, and a few details about the person behind each one, are featured on a New York Times front page which is making headlines of its own this morning. Also making headlines, Donald Trump\u2019s decision to spend Saturday playing golf at his course in Virginia. On Saturday night, the conservative never-Trumper, Lincoln Project member and husband of a senior Trump aide George Conway spliced the two images together on Twitter. It was a powerful juxtaposition. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign released an ad on the subject. Public health experts including the White House\u2019s own Dr Deborah Birx say golf is OK, with social distancing and other measures observed \u2013 Trump, not wearing a mask, was filmed shaking hands with a playing partner \u2013 as the country looks to open up its battered economy. So, like so much in politics, this is all about the optics. It\u2019s also all about the hypocrisy, of course, as all politics is. In this case, Trump used to batter Barack Obama for playing too much golf. In office, Trump has played more than 200 times \u2013 more than Obama did in his first term. Also, as the president played during a public health crisis it turned out, of course it did, that There Was A Tweet For That: Trump did turn away from golf in the evening, though only to deliver a characteristic tweet storm from the confines of the White House. Among his targets for caustic comments and retweets in highly questionable taste: Nancy Pelosi, Stacey Abrams, Jeff Sessions and of course Biden. Trump also once again insinuated, disgracefully, that former Republican congressman and MSNBC host Joe Scarborough might be guilty of murder. About the veracity or otherwise of that vicious claim, the Washington Post fact checker awards it its top rating of four Pinnochios and says: \u201cWe wish we had more to give.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has staked his political reputation on saving the career of Dominic Cummings, amid growing anger among Conservative MPs that the No 10 chief adviser has not been forced out for breaking lockdown rules. Under intense pressure to explain why Cummings drove his wife, who was suffering coronavirus symptoms, and son 264 miles to his parents\u2019 farm in Durham, the prime minister said on Sunday that Cummings had \u201cacted responsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d. \u201cI think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent, and I do not mark him down for that,\u201d Johnson told the daily Downing Street press briefing. But within hours of Johnson\u2019s defence of Cummings, the Guardian and Daily Mirror revealed the aide faces a possible police investigation into allegedly breaking self-isolation and lockdown rules by travelling a further 30 miles to the beauty spot of Barnard Castle. The alleged visit was reported to Durham police by retired chemistry teacher Robin Lees, it can be revealed, and is the latest in a series of Guardian disclosures that have rocked the government and left the Tory party in turmoil It comes as: The prime minister did not deny that Cummings travelled from his parents\u2019 farm to Barnard Castle at a time when non-essential journeys were banned, insisting only that he had self-isolated for 14 days. A second passerby came forward to claim that they saw Cummings in bluebell woods on 19 April, five days after Downing Street says he returned to London and remained in the capital. Nine Tory MPs publicly called on him to go, while three members of a government scientific advisory committee criticised ministers for \u201ctrashing\u201d their advice, eroding trust and reducing compliance with lockdown. After spending several hours with Cummings in Downing Street on Sunday, the prime minister told the briefing that his aide had travelled to \u201ctry to find the right kind of childcare\u201d and claimed he wanted to reduce the spread of the virus. \u201cI have had extensive face-to-face conversations with Dominic Cummings and I have concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare, at the moment when both he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus - and when he had no alternative - I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent,\u201d Johnson said. Describing some of the allegations against Cummings as \u201cpalpably false\u201d \u2013 but not saying which \u2013 the prime minister continued: \u201cI believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly, legally and with integrity, and with the overriding aim to stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives.\u201d Three members of SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee providing advice from behavioural scientists to government on how the public might respond to lockdown measures, reacted with disdain to Johnson\u2019s defence of Cummings. Prof Stephen Reicher, of St Andrews University, tweeted: \u201cI can say that in a few short minutes tonight, Boris Johnson has trashed all the advice we have given on how to build trust and secure adherence to the measures necessary to control Covid-19. \u201cBe open and honest, we said. Trashed. Respect the public, we said. Trashed. Ensure equity, so everyone is treated the same, we said. Trashed. Be consistent we said. Trashed. Make clear \u2018we are all in it together\u2019. Trashed. \u201cIt is very hard to provide scientific advice to a government which doesn\u2019t want to listen to science. I hope, however, that the public will read our papers \u2026 and continue to make up for this bad government with their own good sense.\u201d He was backed by Prof Susan Michie and Prof Robert West. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said Johnson\u2019s decision to take no action against Cummings was \u201can insult to sacrifices made by the British people\u201d. The Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon, who accepted the resignation of the country\u2019s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, after she visited a second home during lockdown, said Johnson should follow this example. \u201cI know it is tough to lose a trusted adviser at the height of crisis, but when it\u2019s a choice of that or integrity of vital public health advice, the latter must come first,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the judgment I and, to her credit, Catherine Calderwood reached. PM and Cummings should do likewise.\u201d Johnson\u2019s unexpected appearance at the press briefing on Sunday \u2013 his first in nearly two weeks - was seen by his own MPs as an attempt to protect Cummings following revelations that the adviser had broken the lockdown rules he had helped to write. Johnson did not respond to a series of detailed questions including whether Cummings stopped during the four-hour journey and whether the prime minister had known of Cummings\u2019s trip at the time. Senior Tory MPs said that the prime minister\u2019s decision to attend the press conference and his inability to answer detailed questions will fuel the furore and will damage his premiership. \u201cThe PM is losing his instinct, he might be losing the plot and we could lose the country over this virus,\u201d said one. Reacting to the prime minister\u2019s comments, Sir Roger Gale MP said it was an \u201cextraordinary position\u201d for Johnson to take. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the prime minister to exercise judgment about who he has around him,\u201d he told BBC Radio 5 Live. Tim Montgomerie, a former Johnson adviser, tweeted: \u201cTonight, I\u2019m really embarrassed to have ever backed Boris Johnson for high office.\u201d MPs including the former minister and 1922 Committee member, Steve Baker, and the chair of the Northern Ireland select committee, Simon Hoare, said Cummings should step aside to stop further damage to the government. Hoare said: \u201cWith the damage Mr Cummings is doing to the government\u2019s reputation, he must consider his position.

Vine strikes a cautionary note when asked about a study that warned of a 25% increase in suicide linked to Covid-19. \u201cI\u2019m aware of it, I think it\u2019s interesting, but I just think it\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d She suggests it is too early to say what impact the pandemic will have on Australians\u2019 mental health. \u201cWe can say people are more worried, because there are so many uncertainties. We love to know stuff, we love to feel we are being fully informed. We don\u2019t like surprises. That\u2019s been a real problem during the pandemic.\u201d \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. The Covidsafe app was touted as a vital part of the Covid-19 response but has only identified one infected person using its data. \u201cThis is an important protection for a Covid-safe Australia,\u201d the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said in late April. \u201cI would liken it to the fact that if you want to go outside when the sun is shining, you have got to put sunscreen on.\u201d Josh Taylor asks how the app went from being the key to allowing Australians to get back to the footy to being barely relevant. Listen In today\u2019s episode of the Full Story podcast Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor, Katharine Murphy, talks to our environment editor, Adam Morton, about Australia\u2019s muddled energy policy. It\u2019s a huge week for the future of renewables and Murphy asks why Australia appears to be making an energy roadmap without a destination. Full Story is Guardian Australia\u2019s news podcast.

Doctors and hospital bosses have told the Guardian that about 25% of those carried out during the pandemic wrongly said that a carrier was not infected. Medical research has found that as many as 29% yield a false negative.</p> \n<p>The HCSA, which represents thousands of frontline medics, is worried that staff wrongly declared to be virus-free after being tested could lead to patients becoming infected while in hospital.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson recently told MPs that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/hospital-patients-england-coronavirus-covid-19\">hospital-acquired Covid-19</a> was leading to an \u201cepidemic\u201d of patient deaths. A PHE study last week found that as many as 20% of inpatients and 90% of healthcare workers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/fifth-of-patients-with-covid-19-may-have-caught-it-in-hospital-study-finds\">contracted the virus while in hospital</a>.</p> \n<p>In a strongly worded letter to PHE, the HCSA\u2019s general secretary, Dr Paul Donaldson, a consultant microbiologist, said: \u201cStatements by PHE offcials and others place the incidence of false negatives somewhere between 20% and 30%. If confirmed, this is a worryingly high rate which raises the prospect of many infected individuals, possibly without symptoms, being passed fit to return to healthcare settings where they will transmit SARS-CoV-2 to colleagues and patients.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/hospital-patients-england-coronavirus-covid-19\">Up to 20% of hospital patients with Covid-19 caught it at hospital</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Doctors feel \u201cdeep concern and frustration\u201d at PHE\u2019s \u201csystematic lack of information\u201d about the different types of coronavirus tests and say a \u201cwall of silence seems to have been erected around the issue\u201d.</p> \n<p>The HCSA is also angry that the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has refused to fully answer parliamentary questions which Labour has tabled to find out more about the tests.</p> \n<p>Justin Madders, a shadow health minister, asked the DHSC what recent estimate it had made of the false-negative rate of each of the Covid-19 tests in use. In reply Nadine Dorries, the health minister, said only that \u201cviral detection tests have high levels of clinical sensitivity at close to 100%\u201d. The staff of NHS laboratories do everything they can to minimise false positives, she said.</p> \n<p>Asked by Madders to name all the Covid-19 tests in use, Dorries declined to do so. She simply replied: \u201cThere are eight key testing platforms which deliver the majority of testing. All these tests are clinically validated and have high levels of performance.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-testing\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-testing&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus-testing</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Nor would Dorries tell Madders which tests for Covid-19 the NHS had stopped using and why. Instead she reiterated that eight clinically validated tests were being used.</p> \n<p>Recent research <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1808\">published in the British Medical Journal</a> found that between 2% and 29% of Covid-19 tests produced false negatives.

      "bodyText": "Doctors\u2019 leaders have condemned ministers and Public Health England (PHE) for throwing a \u201cshroud of secrecy\u201d over how many coronavirus tests on NHS staff and patients produce wrong results. The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) has demanded an end to \u201cevasion\u201d and the \u201cwall of silence\u201d around how many swab tests result in false negative readings. The tests, in which samples are taken from someone\u2019s throat and nose, are vital in controlling the spread of Covid-19 in hospitals because they are used to check whether NHS personnel and inpatients have the virus and might unwittingly pass it on. Swab tests are known to be unreliable. Doctors and hospital bosses have told the Guardian that about 25% of those carried out during the pandemic wrongly said that a carrier was not infected. Medical research has found that as many as 29% yield a false negative. The HCSA, which represents thousands of frontline medics, is worried that staff wrongly declared to be virus-free after being tested could lead to patients becoming infected while in hospital. Boris Johnson recently told MPs that hospital-acquired Covid-19 was leading to an \u201cepidemic\u201d of patient deaths. A PHE study last week found that as many as 20% of inpatients and 90% of healthcare workers contracted the virus while in hospital. In a strongly worded letter to PHE, the HCSA\u2019s general secretary, Dr Paul Donaldson, a consultant microbiologist, said: \u201cStatements by PHE offcials and others place the incidence of false negatives somewhere between 20% and 30%. If confirmed, this is a worryingly high rate which raises the prospect of many infected individuals, possibly without symptoms, being passed fit to return to healthcare settings where they will transmit SARS-CoV-2 to colleagues and patients.\u201d Doctors feel \u201cdeep concern and frustration\u201d at PHE\u2019s \u201csystematic lack of information\u201d about the different types of coronavirus tests and say a \u201cwall of silence seems to have been erected around the issue\u201d. The HCSA is also angry that the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has refused to fully answer parliamentary questions which Labour has tabled to find out more about the tests. Justin Madders, a shadow health minister, asked the DHSC what recent estimate it had made of the false-negative rate of each of the Covid-19 tests in use. In reply Nadine Dorries, the health minister, said only that \u201cviral detection tests have high levels of clinical sensitivity at close to 100%\u201d. The staff of NHS laboratories do everything they can to minimise false positives, she said. Asked by Madders to name all the Covid-19 tests in use, Dorries declined to do so. She simply replied: \u201cThere are eight key testing platforms which deliver the majority of testing. All these tests are clinically validated and have high levels of performance.\u201d Nor would Dorries tell Madders which tests for Covid-19 the NHS had stopped using and why. Instead she reiterated that eight clinically validated tests were being used. Recent research published in the British Medical Journal found that between 2% and 29% of Covid-19 tests produced false negatives. The number of \u201ctrue positive\u201d results from nasal swabs was as low as 63% and from throat swabs just 32%, the lead author, Dr Jessica Watson, reported. Prof Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: \u201cThe main issue from the perspective of physicians has been, until recently, the lack of access to testing as shown by our survey. Even though the test is far from perfect the inability for healthcare and social care workers to access the test for themselves, their patients and their families has hampered our ability to respond to the pandemic and control its spread within hospitals and care homes.\u201d Dr Nick Phin, PHE\u2019s incident director, declined to respond directly to the HCSA\u2019s concerns. He said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s national testing system is built on strong foundations using the latest scientific evidence and expert advice.

Thanks as always for following along. </p> \n  <p>Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Wuhan lab had bat coronaviruses \u2013 but not Covid-19.</strong> The Chinese virology institute in Wuhan, the city in China at the heart of the coronavirus pandemic, has three live strains of bat coronavirus on-site, but none match the Covid-19 strain, its director has said. The director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology told state broadcaster CGTN that claims by US president Donald Trump that the virus could have leaked from the facility were \u201cpure fabrication\u201d. In an interview filmed on 13 May but broadcast on Saturday night, Wang Yanyi said the centre had \u201cisolated and obtained some coronaviruses from bats. Now we have three strains of live viruses \u2026 But their highest similarity to Sars-CoV-2 only reaches 79.8%.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>US opens up for summer. </strong>There are fears the US will suffer a second wave of coronavirus infections as it opens up for summer, just days away from the grim milestone of 100,000 Covid-19 deaths. Every state has relaxed restrictions to some extent, with many flocking to beaches and outdoor areas. The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/new-york-times-front-page-1000-covid-19-death-notices\">filled the entire front page</a> of Sunday\u2019s paper with the death notices of victims from across the country as the country recorded more than 97,000 deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Argentina extends lockdown. </strong>Argentina has extended the mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires until 7 June and tightened some movement restrictions, after a steady increase in the city\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases in recent days. Officials will tighten traffic controls between the capital and Buenos Aires province, the area with the second highest concentration of cases. The country recorded 704 new infections on Saturday, one of the highest single-day increases since the pandemic began.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil cases near 350,000. </strong>Brazil registered 965 new coronavirus deaths on Saturday, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,013, the health ministry said. The country now has 347,398 confirmed cases, according to the ministry, up 16,508 from Friday, when it surpassed Russia to become the world\u2019s virus hot spot behind the US. The actual number of cases and deaths is believed to be higher than the official figures disclosed by the government, as the testing capacity of Latin America\u2019s largest country still lags.</li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand reports no new cases. </strong>New Zealand\u2019s health ministry has announced there were zero new coronavirus cases confirmed in the last 24 hours. According to NewsHub, there are now only 27 active cases left in New Zealand, with one more patient recovered, bringing the country\u2019s total to 1,154, with 21 deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Australian states ease restrictions. </strong>In Australia, Victorian state premier, Daniel Andrews, has said Victorians will be allowed to have 20 people in their homes as well as overnight stays in hotels from 1 June. In New South Wales, Australia\u2019s most populous state, health minister Brad Hazzard announced that beauty, tanning, nail and waxing salons would all be open from 1 June.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pompeo threatens Australia over Belt and Road projects. </strong>The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has implied information sharing with Australia may be at risk if the Victoria proceeds with any Belt and Road projects that jeopardise communications networks. Issuing the highly qualified warning during an interview with Sky News Australia, the News Corp-owned channel, Pompeo urged Victoria to scrutinise any proposals \u201cincredibly closely\u201d because Belt and Road projects could \u201cbuild up the capacity of the Chinese Communist party to do harm\u201d. Victoria has attracted domestic political criticism for signing an agreement that would allow for it be part of the Belt and Road Initiative.</li> \n   <li><strong>French churches to hold first masses since lockdown started. </strong>French churches were preparing to hold their first Sunday masses in more than two months after the government bowed to a ruling that they should be reopened. Nearly two weeks into the relaxation of its shutdown, the government finally allowed churches, mosques and synagogues to reopen. Worshippers will have to wear masks, there will have to be disinfectant gel on hand and the seating will need to be organised to ensure people keep a safe distance from each other.</li> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser under pressure as second trip emerges. </strong>In the UK, prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, faces renewed pressure to resign after new witnesses reported <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/new-witnesses-cast-doubt-on-dominic-cummingss-lockdown-claims\">seeing him making a fresh trip</a> hundreds of miles to Durham.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/coronavirus-latest-24-may-at-a-glance\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T07:11:22.294Z\">at 8.11am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eca19d58f0886ce4f5d951e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T06:56:05.370Z\">7.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In Australia, a Darwin pub has been fined more than AU$5,000 (US$3,270) for repeatedly failing to adhere to strict coronavirus laws.</p> \n  <p>Police and environmental health officers issued a caution to Lola\u2019s Pergola on 15 May for failing to serve separate meals to people consuming liquor, patrons not being seated while drinking and social distancing not being implemented.<br><br>One week later, further observations confirmed reports from concerned patrons that alcohol was being served without meals.</p> \n  <p>Advice about the chief health officer\u2019s directions was provided to the owner at the time.<br><br>But the next day, the venue had to be cautioned again and the following day the infringement notice was issued.<br><br>More than 11,000 compliance checks have been completed and 57 fines issued.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T06:58:26.951Z\">at 7.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eca10b58f08a1782fa807f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/michael-savage\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T06:47:27.642Z\">7.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>UK low-income households denied coronavirus support by benefit cap</h2> \n  <p>Tens of thousands of poor households are being denied extra support designed to ease the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, after being hit by the government\u2019s benefit cap.</p> \n  <p>The number of low-income households affected by the cap in London has doubled since the crisis started, according to analysis seen by the <em>Observer</em>. Households already at the cap when the crisis hit have been missing out on \u00a3320 a month in additional support. For private renters with children, this is \u00a3532 a month.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve launched a new blog at the link below - head there for the latest coronavirus news from around the world: UK Doctors condemn secrecy over false negative Covid-19 tests Doctors\u2019 leaders have condemned ministers and Public Health England (PHE) for throwing a \u201cshroud of secrecy\u201d over how many coronavirus tests on NHS staff and patients produce wrong results. The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) has demanded an end to \u201cevasion\u201d and the \u201cwall of silence\u201d around how many swab tests result in false negative readings. The tests, in which samples are taken from someone\u2019s throat and nose, are vital in controlling the spread of Covid-19 in hospitals because they are used to check whether NHS personnel and inpatients have the virus and might unwittingly pass it on. A top White House official on Sunday likened China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak to the Soviet Union\u2019s cover-up of the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986, Reuters reports. National security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien said Beijing knew what was happening with the virus, which originated in Wuhan, from November but lied to the World Health Organization and prevented outside experts from accessing information. \u201cThey unleashed a virus on the world that\u2019s destroyed trillions of dollars in American economic wealth that we\u2019re having to spend to keep our economy alive, to keep Americans afloat during this virus,\u201d O\u2019Brien said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d French authorities reported the smallest daily rise in new coronavirus cases and deaths on Sunday since before a lockdown began on 17 March, raising hopes that the worst of the epidemic is over in France. The number of confirmed cases rose by 115 to 144,921, health ministry data showed, and the death toll increased by 35 to 28,367 - an increase of just 0.1% for both tallies. The weekend totals for new cases and deaths were also both the lowest since France began easing its strict coronavirus restrictions on 11 May. Epidemiologist Laurent Toubiana, director of the IRSAN health data institute, suggested the worst of the epidemic had passed and said the coronavirus may not come back, unlike previous pandemics such as the 1918 Spanish flu. \u201cIf we do not see a quick resurgence of the epidemic, we might get a break for a few weeks,\u201d he said on BFM TV. Despite the easing of restrictions, social distancing rules remain in place in France and Environment Minister Elisabeth Borne told France Inter radio the government did not want people to travel abroad this summer. She also said Paris parks must remain closed for now as the capital is still a \u201cred zone\u201d for circulation of the coronavirus. Hi, Helen Sullivan joining you on the blog now. I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest updates from around the world. It\u2019s always good to hear from you \u2013 get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. The Daily Mail - usually one of Boris Johnson\u2019s supporters in the press - has called on the prime minister to sack Dominic Cummings, trailing its headline with the following: In the clearest way, Dominic Cummings has violated the spirit and letter of the lockdown. Boris Johnson says he \u2018totally gets\u2019 how the public feels about this. Clearly he totally doesn\u2019t. Neither man has displayed a scintilla of contrition for this breach of trust. Do they think we are fools? For the good of the government and the nation, Mr Cummings must resign. Or the prime minister must sack him. No ifs. No buts. The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world No. 2 hot spot for coronavirus cases. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the new restrictions would help ensure foreign nationals do not bring additional infections to the US, but would not apply to the flow of commerce between the new countries. Brazil became the No. 2 hot spot for cases on Friday, second only to the US. Brazil has recorded over 347,000 infections, while the US has over 1.6 million. The decision follows comments by the national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, to CBS. \u201cWe hope that\u2019ll be temporary, but because of the situation in Brazil, we\u2019re going to take every step necessary to protect the American people,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. It\u2019s safe to say Dominic Cummings has received a rather... mixed reception across tomorrow\u2019s front pages. In the US, discrepancies in how different states are reporting testing and infection figures is causing \u201cfrustration and confusion\u201d, AP reports. Elected officials, businesses and others are depending on coronavirus testing and infection-rate data as states reopen so that they will know if a second wave of contagion is coming and whether another round of stay-at-home orders or closings might be needed. But states are reporting those figures in different ways, and that can lead to frustration and confusion about what the numbers mean. In some places, there have been data gaps that leave local leaders wondering whether they should loosen or tighten restrictions. In others, officials are accused of spinning the numbers to make their states look better and justify reopening. In a continuing theme for the outbreak in the United States, a lack of federal leadership persists. Even the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been lumping together tests that measure different things. Such errors render the CDC numbers about how many Americans are infected uninterpretable, creating a misleading picture for people trying to make decisions based on the data, said Ashish Jha, director of Harvards Global Health Institute. \u201cIt is incumbent on health departments and the CDC to make sure they\u2019re presenting information thats accurate. And if they cant get it, then don\u2019t show the data at all,\u201d Jha said. \u201cFaulty data is much, much worse than no data.\u201d \u201cEid is not Eid with the atmosphere of coronavirus - people feel a sense of fear,\u201d worshipper Akram Taher said in Gaza. Muslims around the world have been marking a sombre Eid al-Fitr, as coronavirus lockdowns worldwide restrict celebrations. Mass prayer gatherings have been banned in many countries including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey and Syria. Saudi Arabia, home to Islam\u2019s holiest sites, began a five-day round-the-clock curfew from Saturday after infections more than quadrupled since the start of Ramadan to over 72,000 - the highest in the Gulf. In Afghanistan, the Taliban announced a three-day ceasefire to mark Eid al-Fitr in a surprise move following months of bloody fighting with Afghan forces after the signing of a landmark agreement with the United States. In Somalia, at least five people were killed and more than 20 wounded in a blast during Eid festivities, police said. New York recorded 109 deaths from Covid-19 over the last 24 hours, which represents a slight increase on the previous day. State governor Andrew Cuomo called on New Yorkers to remain vigilant. \u201cWhat do we really think, this is the last time we are going to have a public health emergency?\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure we are better for what we have gone through.\u201d Over on the UK side, the Guardian\u2019s Carole Cadwalladr and Paul Lewis tally the dissenting advisors: Domestic flights will resume across India on Monday, the federal civil aviation minister has said, despite a 24-hour record increase in new cases on Sunday. The announcement follows a day of \u201chard negotiations\u201d, the minister said, after some states sought to limit the number of flights. Flights will restart under an easing of restrictions, despite the 6,767 new cases that brought India\u2019s total to over 131,000. Airlines are preparing to resume about a third of their domestic flight operations from Monday, even without clarity over what quarantine rules may apply to passengers. The western state of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu in the south and West Bengal in the east - business hubs and home to India\u2019s busiest airports - had said they were not prepared to open for flights as coronavirus cases rose, state government officials said. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu agreed to operate limited flights from Monday, while southern state of Andhra Pradesh would allow flights from Tuesday, India\u2019s civil aviation minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, said on Twitter. \u201cIt has been a long day of hard negotiations with various state government to recommence civil aviation operations in the country ... Domestic flights will recommence across the country from tomorrow,\u201d he said. West Bengal urged the central government to postpone the resumption of passenger flights to Kolkata as it focuses on rescue work after Cyclone Amphan hit the city. Limited aviation operations in West Bengal will commence from Thursday, Puri said. India\u2019s federal structure gives its 28 states flexibility to set their own rules, complicating government efforts to kickstart the economy. Just a reminder that you can reach me on Twitter @cleaskopeliti, with any hot tips, feedback, funny videos etc. Your contributions are really appreciated, even if I don\u2019t manage to reply to everyone! Chile\u2019s healthcare system is \u201cvery close to the limit,\u201d President Sebastian Pinera has said, following a rapid rise in infections in recent days that has brought the country\u2019s total close to 70,000. The Ministry of Health reported 3,709 new cases in the last day, bringing the total to 69,102. The death toll is at 718. \u201cWe are very close to the limit because we have had a very large increase in the needs and demands for medical care, and for intensive care unit beds and ventilators,\u201d Pinera said during a visit to a hospital in Santiago, which has the highest concentration of cases. Here\u2019s the latest sticky development to the Dominic Cummings story. Dominic Cummings is facing a possible police investigation under health laws over a claim that he breached self-isolation rules in north-east England, after a weekend of mounting pressure on the prime minister to sack his chief adviser. Retired chemistry teacher Robin Lees has made a complaint to the police after reporting that he saw Cummings and his family on 12 April walking in the town of Barnard Castle before getting into a car, a joint investigation by the Guardian and Mirror can reveal. (For those who\u2019ve missed an episode or two in the saga, here\u2019s a run-through of the chief advisor\u2019s movements.) Up to speed? Read Matthew Weaver and Vikram Dodd\u2019s report on the latest. More details on South Africa\u2019s plans for easing the lockdown easing have just come through. President Cyril Ramaphosa has said the controversial ban on the sale of alcohol would be lifted for home consumption when the country moves into level three of a five-tier coronavirus lockdown next month. South Africans were prohibited from buying alcohol and cigarettes when the country locked down at the end of March, in an attempt to prevent a surge in violence and ease pressure on hospitals\u2019 emergency wards. Alcohol will be sold for home consumption under strict conditions, on certain days and within limited hours. The ban on tobacco products, however, will remain in place \u201cdue to the health risks associated with smoking\u201d, the president said. In what has become a regular fixture of recent weeks, Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has once more encouraged a rally in the country\u2019s capital to back his administration, days after Brazil passed Russia to become the world\u2019s No 2 coronavirus hotspot after the US. Surrounded by security guards wearing masks, but not wearing one himself, Bolsonaro was shown in a livestreaming video on his Facebook page greeting protesters waving Brazilian flags. The rally came as the US president, Donald Trump \u2013 a close ally of the far-right Brazilian leader \u2013 considers a ban on travel from Brazil amid the worsening outbreak there. The pro-Bolsonaro demonstration also follows a brewing political scandal revolving around an accusation by former justice minister Sergio Moro, a popular anti-graft crusader, that Bolsonaro aimed to interfere in police investigations. Brazil\u2019s federal supreme court released a video last week of an April 22 ministerial meeting in which Bolsonaro said he wanted to change security officials, their bosses or even ministers to stop his family and friends from getting \u201cscrewed\u201d. Brazil\u2019s health ministry announced on Sunday 16,508 new cases were recorded in the past 24 hours, bringing the total above 347,000, while the death toll increased by 965 to 22,013. Austrian president Alexander Van der Bellen has apologised after staying at a restaurant past the 11 pm closing time mandated by the government as part of its anti-coronavirus measures. \u201cI went out for the first time since the lockdown with two friends and my wife,\u201d Van der Bellen tweeted on Sunday, adding: \u201cWe then lost track of time while chatting. I\u2019m sincerely sorry. It was a mistake.\u201d The president linked to an article in the Kurier newspaper according to which a police patrol found the president and his wife on the terrace of an Italian restaurant in central Vienna shortly after midnight on Sunday morning. Restaurants and cafes were allowed to re-open last week on the condition they adhere to a number of rules, including the 11 pm closing time. The restaurant\u2019s owner told the Krone newspaper that he thought he had followed the rules by stopping service at 11 pm, believing customers were allowed to stay on the terrace past that time. The restaurant could potentially be fined for a breach of the new restrictions and Van der Bellen says he will \u201ctake responsibility\u201d if the restaurant owner suffers any losses as result of the incident. South Africa will further relax coronavirus lockdown restrictions from 1 June, President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced, allowing large areas of the economy to fully reopen. \u201cCabinet has determined that the alert level for the whole country should be lowered from level four to level three,\u201d he said in an address broadcast on television, describing the move as a significant shift in approach to the pandemic. France has said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases rose to 144,921 from 144,806 on Saturday. The number of people in hospital rose to 17,185 from 17,178, while the number of people in intensive care fell to 1,655 from 1,665. Israel\u2019s cabinet has curtailed the involvement of its internal security agency, Shin Bet, in the cellphone tracking of people infected by the coronavirus, saying the measure would be a last resort. The cabinet had circumvented parliament in March and approved emergency regulations to allow the use of the technology, usually deployed for anti-terrorism. Privacy watchdog groups have challenged the practice in court. In light of falling contagion rates in Israel, phone tracking is now warranted \u201cin specific and special cases only, where location \u2026 cannot be completed with epidemiological investigation using other methods\u201d. This may be reviewed if infections surge. Global toll passes 340,000 The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases stands at 5,344,539, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. There have been 342,695 deaths officially linked to coronavirus around the world. Boris Johnson has backed Dominic Cummings, following reports his chief strategist broke lockdown rules on more than one occasion. Boris Johnson described Cummings as acting \u201cresponsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d. The US is likely to impose travel restrictions on Brazil on Sunday, the White House national security adviser has said, after the South American country became the nation with the second most coronavirus cases. The country became the No 2 hot spot for cases on Friday, second only to the US. Brazil has recorded over 347,000 infections, while the US has over 1.6 million. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Canada has risen to 84,081 from 82,892. There have been 103 more deaths, bringing the country\u2019s toll up to 6,380. German authorities are trying to trace the people who attended a church service in Frankfurt after 107 tested positive for the coronavirus. The service took place at a Baptist church on 10 May, and it is not clear whether all the 107 attended the service, or whether the figure includes those who were infected by those who did. The French government has discouraged citizens from travelling abroad this summer, recommending they holiday in France, the environment minister Elisabeth Borne has said. This follows Emmanuel Macron saying it was unlikely that French people would be able to undertake major foreign trips this summer. South Africa\u2019s AngloGold Ashanti has suspended operations at its Mponeng mine after at least 164 employees tested positive for coronavirus. The mining company said it had tested 650 workers at the gold mining site in Merafong, Gauteng province, after a first case was detected last week. Contact tracing and sanitisation processes are under way. China\u2019s top diplomat Wang Yi has said the US should stop wasting time in its fight against the coronavirus and work with China to combat it, instead of smearing the country. State councillor Wang\u2019s comments came as he expressed his sympathy to the US for the pandemic, where the death toll is approaching 100,000. Thousands of pro-democracy protesters assembled in Hong Kong against a controversial security law proposed by China, defying a coronavirus measure banning gatherings of more than eight people. The planned legislation is expected to ban treason, subversion and sedition, and the clashes between police and demonstrators were the most intense seen in months. Italy has recorded 50 new deaths \u2013 but worst-hit Lombardy\u2019s figures are missing due to late reporting. The number of new infections rose by 531, down from 669 on Saturday. There have been 32, 785 deaths and 140,479 people have recovered. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has backed his chief strategist, Dominic Cummings, amid pressure for his resignation after it was revealed he broke lockdown rules on multiple occasions. Here are some of the key points from the UK briefing for those who missed it. Johnson described Cummings as having acted \u201cresponsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d. He said the adviser had \u201cfollowed the instincts of every father and every parent\u201d in travelling to find the right kind of childcare at the moment when \u201cboth he and his wife were about to be incapacitated\u201d and he does not \u201cmark him down for that\u201d. The PM avoided directly answering whether he was aware at the time that Cummings was travelling to Durham, and if he approved it. There were 50 new coronavirus deaths in Italy on Sunday. However, the civil protection authority said the latest figures did not include deaths in the worst-hit Lombardy region due to late reporting. New cases rose by 531, down from 669 on Saturday. There have been 32, 785 deaths and 140,479 people have recovered. Gyms and swimming pools will reopen in all regions apart from Lombardy on Monday as part of Italy\u2019s phased easing of restrictions. South Africa\u2019s AngloGold Ashanti said on Sunday it had suspended operations at its Mponeng mine after at least 164 employees tested positive for coronavirus. This follows the news that 53 employees at the world\u2019s deepest mine had tested positive. AngloGold Ashanti said it had tested 650 workers at the gold mining site in Merafong, Gauteng province, after a first case was detected last week. \u201cThis process has indicated 164 positive cases with only a handful of tests left to process,\u201d the company said in a statement, adding that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of cases were asymptomatic. Operations at Mponeng mine have been \u201ctemporarily halted\u201d to complete contact tracing and \u201csanitise the workplace\u201d. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing has started, led by Boris Johnson. It comes as several Conservative MPs have called for Dominic Cummings to resign following reports that he breached the lockdown on more than one occasion. My colleague Aaron Walawalkar will steer you through it here: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Canada has risen to 84,081 from 82,892. There have been 103 more deaths, bringing the country\u2019s toll up to 6,380. The US is likely to impose travel restrictions on Brazil on Sunday, the White House national security adviser has said, after the South American country became the nation with the second most coronavirus cases. Robert O\u2019Brien told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation he believed there would be a decision on Sunday about suspending entry for those coming from Brazil. The country became the No 2 hot spot for cases on Friday, second only to the US. Brazil has recorded over 347,000 infections, while the US has over 1.6 million. \u201cWe hope that\u2019ll be temporary, but because of the situation in Brazil, we\u2019re going to take every step necessary to protect the American people,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. He said restrictions for other countries in the southern hemisphere would be considered on a country-by-country basis. The national security adviser\u2019s comments follow Donald Trump saying on Tuesday he was considering imposing a travel ban. \u201cI don\u2019t want people coming over here and infecting our people. I don\u2019t want people over there sick either. We\u2019re helping Brazil with ventilators \u2026 Brazil is having some trouble, no question about it,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. The US imposed travel restrictions on China in January, and on Europe in early March. German authorities are trying to trace the people who attended a church service in Frankfurt after 107 tested positive for the coronavirus. Services have been allowed in Hesse, the state Frankfurt is in, since 1 May, under the condition they follow strict distancing and hygiene rules. The service in question took place at a Baptist church on 10 May, and it is not clear whether all the 107 attended the service, or whether the figure includes those who were infected by those who did. \u201cThis situation shows how important it is that all of us stay alert and avoid becoming careless, especially now during the easing of restrictions. The virus is still there and will spread,\u201d Hesse state health minister Kai Klose said. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany has risen to 178,281, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Sunday. The reported death toll rose by 31 to 8,247. Hello, I\u2019m Clea Skopeliti and I\u2019ll be running the blog for the next few hours. Please do get in touch on Twitter or by email with any tips and comments. I won\u2019t always be able to reply but will do my best to read everything. Thanks in advance. I\u2019m now handing this blog over to my colleague Clea Skopeliti, who will take you through the next few hours. Thanks for your company, emails and tweets throughout the day. The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, was branded a \u201ckiller\u201d by his opponents after he popped out for a Saturday night hot dog on the day a further 965 of his citizens were reported to have died from Covid-19, Tom Phillips reports. Insults hurled at Bolsonaro as he grappled with his fast food dinner included: \u201cassassino\u201d (killer), garbage and fascist. One female dissenter can be heard screaming: \u201cGet to work, you bum!\u201d Here is the report in full: Spain has recorded 70 new Covid-19 deaths, bringing its toll to 28,752, the country\u2019s health ministry says. The number of diagnosed cases rose to 235,772 from 235,290. On top of that, here is some very welcome artistic succour. The Venice Film Festival will go ahead as scheduled at the beginning of September, according to Luca Zaia, the governor of the region around the Italian city. Organised by the Biennale di Venezia company, Venice is the world\u2019s longest-running film festival, Reuters reports. In January it announced that Cate Blanchett would preside over its 77th edition. Due to the lockdowns imposed on the film industry across the world to limit the spread of the virus, the festival will probably be attended by fewer productions, said Zaia, who is also a board member of the Biennale di Venezia. The Cannes Film Festival, the world\u2019s largest, was forced to postpone its latest edition in May due to the virus epidemic. Italy plans to lift all travel curbs from 3 June and travellers from European Union countries will be able to enter without going into quarantine. The country recorded 119 new deaths from the Covid-19 epidemic on Saturday, bringing the death toll in Italy from the outbreak to 32,735, the third-highest total in the world after the United States and the United Kingdom. Anyone looking for sporting relief during what, here in London at least, is a pleasant Sunday afternoon might enjoy our live football blog from Mainz v RB Leipzig in Germany\u2019s Bundesliga. Rob Smyth has all the action: Here\u2019s a useful video for anyone wondering what has been happening with the Dominic Cummings lockdown breach story in the UK. This morning he said he did not travel to Durham a second time when he was asked by reporters on his doorstep, before going to Downing Street \u2013 from where he appears not to have emerged as yet. Staying in Jerusalem, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre reopened to visitors today after a two-month closure due to the coronavirus pandemic. The church, situated in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, is the site where many Christians believe Jesus was crucified, entombed, and resurrected. The Christian authorities managing the site closed it to visitors in March to prevent the spread of coronavirus, but clerics maintained prayers inside the shuttered church throughout its closure. Upon its reopening, church authorities limited entrance to 50 people at a time, and required that those entering the cavernous site maintain social distance and avoid touching any of the church\u2019s stones, icons or other religious items. A typical day before the Covid-19 outbreak would bring thousands of faithful who kissed or placed their hands along the church\u2019s surfaces. As priests from the various Christian sects entered the church, a handful of faithful waited outside for the basilica\u2019s church to open for the public, AP reports. Authorities in Israel have gradually reopened schools, houses of worship and markets as the spread of coronavirus has slowed. The country\u2019s health ministry has reported over 16,700 confirmed cases of the disease and 279 deaths. More than 14,000 have recovered. Here is Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israel prime minister, wearing a face mask inside court as his high-profile corruption trial opens. Oliver Holmes reports here: Istanbul has become the world\u2019s largest diaspora hub for Uighurs fleeing Chinese persecution. They are celebrating Eid, but for many the pain of being away from their homeland is acute. Bethan McKernan has this report. Celebrating the Muslim holiday is a freedom G\u00fcl and her four children did not have at home in China\u2019s western Xinjiang province, the Uighur homeland, where over the last few years the authorities have suffocated the ethnic minority\u2019s cultural practices and turned the entire region into a police state subject to strict surveillance even inside their homes. Up to 1 million people have disappeared into re-education camps in what China says is a necessary measure to stamp out extremism. \u201cI miss my homeland and my family every day. I cry a lot with the pain,\u201d she said at her home in Istanbul\u2019s Zeytinburnu neighbourhood. \u201cI love life in Istanbul. I wish they could be here too. My children have freedom here we could not imagine before.\u201d Full piece: The French government does not want its citizens to travel abroad this summer and recommends they take their holidays in France, the environment minister Elisabeth Borne says. Earlier this month, president Emmanuel Macron said it was unlikely that French people would be able to undertake major foreign trips this summer and that even trips within Europe may have to be limited to reduce the risk of a resurgence of the coronavirus epidemic. Borne, in an interview with France Inter radio, also said that next week the government would decide on possibly loosening rules on French domestic travel, currently limited to a maximum 100 kilometres from home. She said Paris parks had to remain closed for now, as the capital was still a \u201cred zone\u201d for virus circulation, Reuters reports. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has repeatedly called on the government to reopen parks as Parisians, who mostly live in apartments without gardens, tend to congregate around the closed parks where it is difficult to respect social distancing rules. Our US coronavirus live blog, which will include reaction to the controversy over Donald Trump\u2019s golf trip, is now up and being steered by Martin Pengelly. The city of Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in China, conducted 1,146,156 nucleic acid tests \u2013 which are used to identify the virus \u2013 on 23 May, the local health authority has confirmed. This compares with 1,470,950 tests a day earlier. Wuhan began a campaign on 14 May to look for asymptomatic carriers \u2013 infected people who show no outward sign of illness \u2013 after confirming on 9-10 May its first cluster of Covid-19 infections since the city\u2019s release from a virtual lockdown on 8 April. I\u2019m back with you for the next couple of hours \u2013 do email nick.ames@theguardian.com or tweet @NickAmes82 if you\u2019d like to get in touch. Underground production at AngloGold Ashanti\u2019s Mponeng mine in South Africa will remain closed until further notice after 53 employees tested positive for coronavirus, health authorities have announced. The mine, the deepest in the world, restarted operations on 22 April after closing entirely during a nationwide lockdown, and was operating at 50% capacity. The department of health in Gauteng, the province where the mine is located, said on Twitter that 53 employees at the mine had so far tested positive for the virus, and that a further 104 tests were still being processed. \u201cThe management of the mine has indicated that the underground production will remain closed until further notice,\u201d the statement said. The company did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment outside of business hours, Reuters reports. In the US, president Donald Trump is making headlines for his decision to spend Saturday playing at his golf course in Virginia. Public health experts, including the White House\u2019s own Dr Deborah Birx, have said that golf is OK with social distancing and other measures observed. But Trump, not wearing a mask, was filmed shaking hands with a playing partner. You can read more about this from my colleagues in the US on their live blog: Thousands of pro-democracy protesters assembled in Hong Kong against a controversial security law proposed by China, defying a coronavirus-linked ban on gatherings of more than eight people. Police fired tear gas and water cannon at the pro-democracy protesters who gathered on Sunday in the most intense clashes for months, AFP reports. As the demonstrators and police were facing off in the semi-autonomous financial hub, the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, insisted in Beijing that the proposed law must be imposed \u201cwithout the slightest delay\u201d. The planned legislation \u2013 expected to ban treason, subversion and sedition \u2013 comes after Hong Kong was shaken last year by months of massive, often-violent protests, and repeated warnings from Beijing that it would not tolerate dissent. With campaigners warning the proposal could spell the end of the city\u2019s treasured freedoms, thousands gathered and chanted slogans in the busy Causeway Bay and Wan Chai districts, while some masked protesters set up makeshift barricades to stop police vehicles. Vincent, a 25-year-old protester, told AFP: People may be criminalised only for words they say or publish opposing the government. I think Hong Kongers are very frustrated because we didn\u2019t expect this to come so fast and so rough. But... we won\u2019t be as naive as to believe that Beijing will simply sit back and do nothing. Things will only get worse here. At least 120 people were arrested, police said, as attempts to clear the roads in the area continued into the evening. In the UK, a former English Football Association chief executive has warned that clubs could face \u201cinsolvency\u201d amid the pandemic. Former English Football Association chief executive Mark Palios has warned the cost of the coronavirus to lower-league clubs could be even larger than the \u00a3200m forecast by officials. Rick Parry, the chairman of the English Football League, which governs the three divisions below the Premier League, estimated the cost of lockdown earlier this month. But Palios, the chairman of third-tier Tranmere, believes the financial damage could be worse. Palios told Sky News: Whilst you may look at the \u2018hole\u2019 which has been articulated as \u00a3200m to September \u2013 I think it\u2019s bigger than that. There is a real financial maelstrom coming towards the league at this point in time. I personally believe we haven\u2019t seen the worst of it yet, and during the course of the summer you\u2019ll see a lot more financial stress on the clubs as we move onwards and continue to pay wages. I think what you\u2019ll see is a lot of clubs will stumble down the road to insolvency. Teams in third-division League One have still to agree on how to end their season, with Palios \u2013 whose club sit in the relegation zone \u2013 calling for relegation to be scrapped. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have a decision foisted upon us that is going to affect us financially,\u201d said Palios. \u201cWhy would you \u2026 in terms of certain clubs, foist on them an even worse position?\u201d Palios said the impact of the coronavirus meant EFL rules that hit insolvent clubs with points penalties should be relaxed. Although points deductions can be appealed against on the grounds of \u201cforce majeure\u201d events, Palios also called for a clarification of rules regarding clubs which entered administration. \u201cThis is a consequence of a pandemic, so I think they need to be considering that clubs may need to go to the protection of administration,\u201d he said. I\u2019m taking a lunch break now but my colleague, Aaron Walawalkar, will steer you through the next hour or so. What do we now know about Covid-19 \u2013 and can you get it twice? Nicola Davis has answers to your questions, based on current knowledge and the latest research from scientists. Dominic Cummings, the under-fire adviser to Boris Johnson, has been seen entering 10 Downing Street. Significant? We don\u2019t yet know, but our UK coronavirus blog will keep you firmly up to date as this story continues to pan out. The United States should stop wasting time in its fight against the coronavirus and work with China to combat it, rather than spreading lies and attacking the country, the Chinese government\u2019s top diplomat Wang Yi says. Sino-US ties have nosedived since the outbreak of the new coronavirus, with the administrations of president Donald Trump and president Xi Jinping repeatedly trading barbs over issues related to the pandemic, reports Reuters, especially US accusations of cover-ups and lack of transparency. The two top economies have also clashed over Hong Kong, human rights, trade and US support for Chinese-claimed Taiwan. State councillor Wang, speaking at his annual press conference on the sidelines of China\u2019s parliament, expressed his deep sympathies to the United States for the pandemic, where the death toll is expected to surpass 100,000 in the coming days, the highest number of any country. \u201cRegretfully, in addition to the raging coronavirus, a political virus is also spreading in the United States. This political virus is using every opportunity to attack and smear China,\u201d said Wang, who is also China\u2019s foreign minister. \u201cSome politicians have ignored the most basic facts and concocted too many lies about China and plotted too many conspiracies. I want to say here: Don\u2019t waste precious time any longer, and don\u2019t ignore lives. \u201cWhat China and the United States need to do the most is to first learn from each other and share their experience in fighting against the epidemic, and help each country fight it.\u201d In Germany, there are more football matches in the country\u2019s top division \u2013 the Bundesliga \u2013 today. It restarted last week behind closed doors amid intense scrutiny and, thus far, things appear to have gone relatively smoothly. This picture, showing medics in protective suits checking the body temperature of a person about to enter Schalke 04\u2019s stadium before their match with Augsburg, gives a flavour of the strict measures being taken to ensure it takes place safely. A British man has been detained in an Indian prison after being accused of breaching the country\u2019s strict coronavirus lockdown rules, reports Nazia Parveen. Sohail Hughes, 29, had been on an extended holiday to visit family in the Gujarat region before undertaking a pilgrimage of mosques when he was detained last month. His family, who have a launched a petition to have him freed, have claimed he is being unlawfully held by Indian officials. Hughes\u2019 sister, Aatika, said he was forced to take refuge in a mosque in Bhopal after being caught out by the swiftly implemented lockdown laws requiring people to stay off the streets. Aatika, 35, says her brother, alongside dozens of other men, had his passport seized before being kept in quarantine for more than a month inside a hostel. While in quarantine Hughes has been repeatedly tested for Covid-19 and has always been negative. Here is the full report: The key stories from the last few hours ... Conservative MPs are among those calling for Dominic Cummings, adviser to the UK prime minister Boris Johnson, to resign. Cummings is under fire from all ends of the political spectrum after the Guardian reported claims he breached government lockdown guidance on more than one occasion. Eid al-Fitr celebrations are under way across the world but there are concerns that a surge in Covid-19 cases could result. Festivities have been constrained in many places as a result of the pandemic. Russia has reported its highest daily Covid-19 death toll. The country recorded 153 coronavirus deaths over most recent 24-hour period measured, its highest daily toll during the pandemic, raising total fatalities to 3,541. Sweden has run the least-restrictive lockdown of any developed country but that strategy is coming under fire. Anneka Linde, the predecessor of the country\u2019s state epidemiologist, has told the Observer that tougher measures should have been put in place earlier in the pandemic. The number of confirmed coronavirus case in Afghanistan has topped 10,000, while the Taliban has announced a ceasefire over Eid. Concerns are high as, despite the government-mandated lockdown, people continue to break the regulations. First indications of the effectiveness of a potential vaccine against coronavirus may be available in the autumn. That is according to the head of the GAVI vaccine alliance, Seth Berkley, who cautioned in a Swiss newspaper that it would be a long road from there to broad availability. If you are just joining today\u2019s global coronavirus news blog, remember you can email me at nick.ames@theguardian.com or direct message me @NickAmes82 with any tips, feedback or observations. Your input is valued enormously. Meanwhile, in Spain, preparations are afoot for the next phase of lockdown loosening \u2013 but there are significant differences in vision between Madrid and Barcelona when it comes to bringing back the national staple of sitting on a terraza for food and drink. Stephen Burgen and Sam Jones have this report. Leaders of Italian towns and cities are struggling to get citizens to comply with social distancing rules after the reopening of bars led to group gatherings on streets and squares. Italians had some of their civil liberties restored last Monday alongside the reopening of bars, restaurants and all other retailers, and many have taken advantage of the fine weather to socialise outside or go to parks and beaches. But with the pandemic far from over, leaders of some towns and cities have had to reimpose restrictions following scenes of people mixing closely together and without face masks. In Brescia, one of the areas in Lombardy hardest hit by coronavirus, bars will now have to close by 9.30pm, while in Verona, in Veneto, bar customers must be seated at a table. Bars will also have to close by 9pm in Perugia, Umbria. According to police data, 20% more Italians ventured outside on Saturday compared with Friday, with a rise in the number of people using public transport. Six hundred and 51 fines were issued nationally on Friday, 10% of them in Rome. Two people infected with Covid-19 were charged for breaking the quarantine. Luciana Lamorgese, the interior minister, called for people to act more responsibly. \u201cBefore this reopening Italians demonstrated much responsibility, but today the difficulties with nightlife are arising: young people, after so long indoors, have lost their limits,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope the sense of responsibility returns and that they adapt to the new conditions as, more than ever, we need to stay attentive as going backwards would harm everyone.\u201d People also flocked to Italy\u2019s beaches over the weekend \u2013 at least those that have reopened. The civil protection authority reported 119 new deaths from coronavirus on Saturday and 669 new infections, of which 441 were in Lombardy. Today, Italians can celebrate mass in church with the community for the first time since 8 March. In this picture, chairs are sanitised before mass is celebrated by the parish priest Don Carlo Chiomento, of Candiolo near Turin. First indications of the effectiveness of a potential vaccine against coronavirus may be available in the autumn, the head of the GAVI vaccine alliance has told a Swiss newspaper, forecasting a long road from there to broad availability. \u201cUnfortunately, we really do not know which vaccine will work and whether there will be one at all. If we\u2019re lucky, we\u2019ll receive indications in autumn as to [a potential vaccine\u2019s] effectiveness,\u201d the GAVI head Seth Berkley told NZZ am Sonntag in an interview published today. \u201cBut there will still be a long way to go from there until an approved active substance becomes available in large quantities for the global population.\u201d Calling for globally coordinated efforts both to produce and share an eventual vaccine, Berkley said international agreement was needed to build up manufacturing capacity to rapidly produce a vaccine once one is found. \u201c[Countries] should work together in order to share in each other\u2019s vaccines in case one\u2019s own are not good,\u201d he said, adding it was possible some vaccines would work better for younger people and others for older age groups. He urged the World Health Organization to issue clear guidelines on a vaccine\u2019s use and distribution to prevent a vaccine first being made available to the rich at the expense of the people most in need, Reuters reports. Should an effective vaccine become available in an initially limited supply, it should first be used to immunise health personnel, he said. The number of confirmed coronavirus case in Afghanistan has topped 10,000 amid continued surges of transmission in the capital, Kabul, and Herat \u2013 while the country woke up to a rare period of calm after recent violence. Around half of the tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive across the country. The health ministry tested 1,206 suspected patients, of whom 584 came out positive. Two patients also died overnight, taking the total number of confirmed infections to 10,582 and the death toll to 218. There have been 1,075 recoveries. Most of the new infections were reported in Kabul, with 324 cases coming back positive from 571 tests. Kabul is the country\u2019s worst-affected area for transmissions, with 3,784 confirmed cases and 29 deaths. The eastern province of Nangarhar and western province of Herat, which have both seen surges in the number of new infections in recent days, recorded 135 new cases combined. Herat is the country\u2019s worst-affected area for deaths, with 35 patients losing their lives to Covid-19. Sunday is the first day of Eid in Afghanistan and concerns are high as, despite the government-mandated lockdown, people continue to break the regulations. According to a Guardian tally, Afghanistan recorded 3,920 new cases in the seven days before Eid \u2013 a record high. Wahid Majroh, the country\u2019s deputy health minister, warned the nation on Saturday that the \u201ccatastrophe\u201d of coronavirus is spreading across the country and said the nation has only two options for Eid: \u201cYou either stay at home and safe, or go out to visit your relatives and friends \u2013 which [can] cause everyone in your family [to become] infected\u201d. He said the ministry is concerned about people breaking lockdown rules. \u201cWhen people were heeding, the daily number of infections was was just about 250 \u2013 but now, as the people continue to break the rules and we test more, the number is rising.\u201d Majroh, who escaped an assassination attempt unharmed on Saturday, said the ministry is preparing more hospital beds for Covid-19 patients. Early last week, he said the country had run out of hospital beds for them in most areas. Meanwhile, Afghans woke up to a rare period of calm as the Taliban announced a ceasefire for the three days of Eid. Its leadership instructed fellow fighters to stop their \u201coffensive operations against the enemy \u2026 and defend only if attacked\u201d. The Taliban\u2019s move is only second ceasefire in around 19 years of war; they made a similar announcement in 2018. \u201cAll Mujahedeen should be aware that nobody can go the enemy\u2019s control areas and from the opposite side, nobody is allowed to get into Mujahedeen\u2019s areas,\u201d the Taliban said in a statement. The Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, welcomed the move and said he has instructed Afghan forces to \u201ccomply with the three-day truce and to defend only if attacked\u201d. Moving on to Indonesia, which has reported 21 new coronavirus deaths and 526 new infections in the most recent 24-hour count. That means the country has recorded 1,372 deaths and 22,271 infections. More daily Covid-19 figures are coming through from south-east Asia. Malaysia has reported 60 new coronavirus cases, bringing its total number of known infections to 7,245. The country\u2019s health ministry said the number of fatalities remained unchanged at 115. Here is a very thought-provoking piece from Simon Tisdall, arguing that an age of revolution in the post-coronavirus world is inevitable \u2013 and the biggest question is what form it takes. JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, called the pandemic \u201ca wake-up call \u2026 for business and government to think, act and invest for the common good\u201d. This sounds almost socialistic. A revolutionary agenda for the post-pandemic world also includes meaningful steps to address poverty and the north-south wealth gap, more urgent approaches to linked climate, energy, water and mass extinction crises and, for example, the adoption of so-called doughnut economics that measures prosperity by counting shared social, health and environmental benefits, not GDP growth. It may seem like pie in the sky. But so too did the idea of millions working from home, and halting road and air travel, until it happened almost overnight. Whether recognised as such or not, this is a revolutionary manifesto that, if it is pursued \u2013 as a growing body of opinion believes it must be \u2013 will demand the utter transformation of current political behaviour and organisation. The whole article is here, and well worth a few minutes of your time: Russia this morning reported 153 coronavirus deaths over the previous 24 hours, its highest daily toll during the pandemic, raising total fatalities to 3,541. The country\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre also said 8,599 new cases had been documented, a reduction of 835 on the previous day \u2013 pushing the nationwide tally of infections to 344,481. Sweden has run the least-restrictive lockdown of any developed country but, with its overall Covid-19 death toll expected to pass 4,000 this weekend, that strategy is coming under fire. Anneka Linde, the predecessor of the country\u2019s state epidemiologist, has told the Observer that tougher restrictions should have been put in place earlier in the pandemic. Linde, who oversaw Sweden\u2019s response to swine flu and Sars as state epidemiologist from 2005 to 2013, had until now expressed support for her country\u2019s approach under her successor, Anders Tegnell. But she has now become the first member of the public health establishment to break ranks, saying she has changed her mind as a result of Sweden\u2019s relatively high death toll compared with that of its neighbours, Denmark, Norway, and Finland. \u201cI think that we needed more time for preparedness. If we had shut down very early \u2026 we would have been able, during that time, to make sure that we had what was necessary to protect the vulnerable,\u201d Linde told the Observer. Here is the full story, from Richard Orange: Socially distanced Eid al-Fitr prayers are taking place across the world \u2013 as seen here at a mosque in Zagreb, Croatia. A 107-year-old Iranian woman who was infected with coronavirus has recovered, according to Iran\u2019s semi-official Fars news agency. The woman, Saltanat Akbari, was admitted to the Khansari hospital in the central city of Arak. She was released from the hospital after spending \u201csome time\u201d in isolation. \u201cShe defeated the virus with the help of doctors and nurses at the hospital,\u201d Fars said. Iran is one of the most affected countries in the Middle East with a total of 133,521 infected cases and 7,359 deaths. Our UK coronavirus live blog is now up, running and in the hands of Jedidajah Otte. It will be well worth keeping an eye on, as trailed two posts ago. Singapore has confirmed 548 more coronavirus cases, taking its tally to 31,616. The vast majority of the newly infected people are migrant workers living in dormitories, the health ministry said. Three are permanent residents. To date there have been 23 deaths from Covid-19 in the country. Just in case you missed it, the big story in the UK involves Dominic Cummings, the most senior adviser to prime minister Boris Johnson. Last night, we reported claims that, further to Friday evening\u2019s exclusive that he breached lockdown rules, he has done so on other occasions. It is a story that will dominate the British news agenda today. Matthew Weaver\u2019s piece is here: The festival of Eid al-Fitr, which ends the fasting month of Ramadan, began at dawn today. It is a time of joy and celebration, but there are concerns in the Middle East that those festivities could bring about a surge in coronavirus cases \u2013 so they have been constrained in many places. Michael Safi, in Amman, and Harriet Sherwood have reported this story for us. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, it hurts,\u201d said Mohammad, who runs a sugarcane juice stall. \u201cNormally we\u2019d wake up, take our kids to pray, and visit family and friends. It was cheerful, we felt joy.\u201d This year? \u201cWe\u2019ll eat, drink and sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll hang around annoying our wives,\u201d said his father, grinning behind him. Contact with family and friends is part of the festival. \u201cWe\u2019ll visit them,\u201d said Abdul Kareem, queuing outside a bakery. \u201cBut it\u2019ll be on WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook.\u201d The owner of a nearby shoe shop, Wissam, watched the bustle from his door. \u201cThis isn\u2019t right,\u201d he says of the busy scene. \u201cThere\u2019s a virus out there.\u201d Full story: Good morning, afternoon or evening, wherever you are. I\u2019ll be taking you through the next eight hours, more or less, of live Covid-19 news and updates from around the world. As always, it would be good to hear from you. Send any news tips, observations, comments or feedback to nick.ames@theguardian.com, or by all means drop me a direct message on Twitter @NickAmes82. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. Thanks as always for following along. Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: Wuhan lab had bat coronaviruses \u2013 but not Covid-19. The Chinese virology institute in Wuhan, the city in China at the heart of the coronavirus pandemic, has three live strains of bat coronavirus on-site, but none match the Covid-19 strain, its director has said. The director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology told state broadcaster CGTN that claims by US president Donald Trump that the virus could have leaked from the facility were \u201cpure fabrication\u201d. In an interview filmed on 13 May but broadcast on Saturday night, Wang Yanyi said the centre had \u201cisolated and obtained some coronaviruses from bats. Now we have three strains of live viruses \u2026 But their highest similarity to Sars-CoV-2 only reaches 79.8%.\u201d US opens up for summer. There are fears the US will suffer a second wave of coronavirus infections as it opens up for summer, just days away from the grim milestone of 100,000 Covid-19 deaths. Every state has relaxed restrictions to some extent, with many flocking to beaches and outdoor areas. The New York Times filled the entire front page of Sunday\u2019s paper with the death notices of victims from across the country as the country recorded more than 97,000 deaths. Argentina extends lockdown. Argentina has extended the mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires until 7 June and tightened some movement restrictions, after a steady increase in the city\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases in recent days. Officials will tighten traffic controls between the capital and Buenos Aires province, the area with the second highest concentration of cases. The country recorded 704 new infections on Saturday, one of the highest single-day increases since the pandemic began. Brazil cases near 350,000. Brazil registered 965 new coronavirus deaths on Saturday, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,013, the health ministry said. The country now has 347,398 confirmed cases, according to the ministry, up 16,508 from Friday, when it surpassed Russia to become the world\u2019s virus hot spot behind the US. The actual number of cases and deaths is believed to be higher than the official figures disclosed by the government, as the testing capacity of Latin America\u2019s largest country still lags. New Zealand reports no new cases. New Zealand\u2019s health ministry has announced there were zero new coronavirus cases confirmed in the last 24 hours. According to NewsHub, there are now only 27 active cases left in New Zealand, with one more patient recovered, bringing the country\u2019s total to 1,154, with 21 deaths. Australian states ease restrictions. In Australia, Victorian state premier, Daniel Andrews, has said Victorians will be allowed to have 20 people in their homes as well as overnight stays in hotels from 1 June. In New South Wales, Australia\u2019s most populous state, health minister Brad Hazzard announced that beauty, tanning, nail and waxing salons would all be open from 1 June. Pompeo threatens Australia over Belt and Road projects. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has implied information sharing with Australia may be at risk if the Victoria proceeds with any Belt and Road projects that jeopardise communications networks. Issuing the highly qualified warning during an interview with Sky News Australia, the News Corp-owned channel, Pompeo urged Victoria to scrutinise any proposals \u201cincredibly closely\u201d because Belt and Road projects could \u201cbuild up the capacity of the Chinese Communist party to do harm\u201d. Victoria has attracted domestic political criticism for signing an agreement that would allow for it be part of the Belt and Road Initiative. French churches to hold first masses since lockdown started. French churches were preparing to hold their first Sunday masses in more than two months after the government bowed to a ruling that they should be reopened. Nearly two weeks into the relaxation of its shutdown, the government finally allowed churches, mosques and synagogues to reopen. Worshippers will have to wear masks, there will have to be disinfectant gel on hand and the seating will need to be organised to ensure people keep a safe distance from each other. Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser under pressure as second trip emerges. In the UK, prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, faces renewed pressure to resign after new witnesses reported seeing him making a fresh trip hundreds of miles to Durham. In Australia, a Darwin pub has been fined more than AU$5,000 (US$3,270) for repeatedly failing to adhere to strict coronavirus laws. Police and environmental health officers issued a caution to Lola\u2019s Pergola on 15 May for failing to serve separate meals to people consuming liquor, patrons not being seated while drinking and social distancing not being implemented. One week later, further observations confirmed reports from concerned patrons that alcohol was being served without meals. Advice about the chief health officer\u2019s directions was provided to the owner at the time. But the next day, the venue had to be cautioned again and the following day the infringement notice was issued. More than 11,000 compliance checks have been completed and 57 fines issued. UK low-income households denied coronavirus support by benefit cap Tens of thousands of poor households are being denied extra support designed to ease the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, after being hit by the government\u2019s benefit cap. The number of low-income households affected by the cap in London has doubled since the crisis started, according to analysis seen by the Observer. Households already at the cap when the crisis hit have been missing out on \u00a3320 a month in additional support. For private renters with children, this is \u00a3532 a month. A further 22,000 households are now at the cap and are missing out on an average of \u00a3185 a month. It has led to an outcry that there is now a two-tier system, in which workers on the government\u2019s furlough scheme have access to far more support than some of those reliant on welfare. Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, is calling for the cap to be increased during the pandemic.

The virology lab in Wuhan, the city at the heart of the outbreak, was working on three live strains of bat coronavirus, but none of them match the one that has caused the Covid-19 pandemic, its director has said. Wang Yanyi told Chinese state broadcaster CGTN that the closest genetic match to the virus spreading around the world was only 79.8%, adding that claims made by US president Donald Trump and others that the virus could have leaked from the facility were \u201cpure fabrication\u201d. She said: \u201cOur institute first received the clinical sample of the unknown pneumonia on December 30 last year \u2026 We didn\u2019t have any knowledge before that, nor had we ever encountered, researched or kept the virus. In fact, like everyone else, we didn\u2019t even know the virus existed. How could it have leaked from our lab when we never had it?\u201d The attempt by the laboratory to refute the claims is nevertheless likely to add more fuel to the conspiracy rumours. The interview came amid fears the US will suffer a second wave of coronavirus infections as it opens up for summer, just days away from the grim milestone of 100,000 Covid-19 deaths. The New York Times marked the looming threshold with a front page listing nearly 1,000 Covid-19 death notices, gleaned from hundreds of US papers. The headline spoke of an \u201cincalculable loss\u201d. Charities call for new youth corps to tackle UK virus jobs crisis A coalition of British youth charities is urging the government to back a \u201cnational youth corps\u201d to create opportunities for school and university leavers facing the toughest labour market for decades. The alliance of 12 organisations argues that decisive intervention can \u201cturn this looming disaster into an opportunity\u201d. The new youth corps would guarantee at least the minimum wage for 16- to 25-year-olds in a range of work and training opportunities until the end of 2021. There have been at least nine separate shootings in the United States linked to conflicts over coronavirus public health restrictions, from mask-wearing to social distancing rules, according to The Trace, a nonprofit news outlet focused on gun violence. At least four people have died and seven have been wounded in the shootings, The Trace found, looking at data from the Gun Violence Archive, which assembles real-time data on shootings based on news reports. The coronavirus-linked incidents include arguments over mask-wearing on public transit and in businesses, including a man in Colorado who reportedly shot and wounded a Waffle House employee who confronted him over not wearing a mask, and a man in Texas who reportedly shot a bus passenger after being told he could not board the bus without a mask. Thailand on Sunday reported no new coronavirus cases and no new deaths, with a total of 3,040 confirmed cases and 56 fatalities since the outbreak began in January. Sunday was the fourth day in this month that there were no new daily cases, said Panprapa Yongtrakul, a spokeswoman for the government\u2019s coronavirus task force. There are 2,921 patients who have recovered and returned home since the outbreak started. Verna Yu reports for the Guardian: In Hong Kong, small groups of activists and pro-democracy politicians have begun marching to China\u2019s liaison office, arranging themselves in groups of eight in order not to breach the government\u2019s social distancing rules. \u201cA characteristic of a dictatorial country is that they use national security as a pretext to suppress freedom of speech,\u201d Roy Tam, a district councillor shouted through a loud hailer. Eight activists from another group, League of Social Democrats, arrived to demonstrate in front of the office minutes later. \u201cHong Kong people defending our human rights,\u201d they chanted. \u201cDon\u2019t forget the June 4 massacre! Human rights are higher than the regime! Down with Communist Party dictatorship!\u201d You can read the full report here: Get in touch with me directly on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. Questions, comments, good tweets and news tips from your part of the world all welcome. Australian mining magnate Clive Palmer will lodge documents with the country\u2019s high court this week, arguing Western Australia\u2019s border closure is unconstitutional, as the state again recorded no new cases of Covid-19, AAP reports. Palmer wanted to visit WA for meetings with businesspeople, senator Mathias Cormann and potential 2021 state election candidates for his United Australia party, but was rejected due to coronavirus restrictions. \u201cClosing down the border is not only an act of stupidity by WA premier Mark McGowan, but it is against the Australian constitution and I am confident the high court will see it that way as well,\u201d Palmer said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cThe WA premier needs to act now to ensure a successful future beyond Covid-19 by opening his borders to allow trade and travel from Australian states into WA. It is a matter of national importance that the borders be open.\u201d Palmer said he would lodge the legal documents on Monday and hoped to have a directions hearing in the high court by the end of the week. McGowan said on Friday that he endorsed the WA police commissioner\u2019s decision not to grant Palmer an exemption from the travel ban. The premier has continued to insist WA\u2019s interstate borders will remain closed for months, despite criticism from some, including NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian. WA\u2019s coronavirus tally remains at 560, including just two active cases. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has dismissed calls for his treasurer to face questioning before a Senate inquiry over the AU$60bn (US$39bn) reduction in the estimated cost of the government\u2019s jobkeeper wage subsidy program. In a press conference, Morrison denied the revision - along with the new estimate only 3.5 million workers will be covered by the scheme, not 6.5 million - raised any issue with the government\u2019s overall economic competence. He said when the Treasury had calculated its original estimate that the program would cost $130bn over six months, they were very uncertain economic times, and the government had moved very quickly to launch the scheme. \u201cOn the day it was a big gulp for the government to understand what we needed to do but we didn\u2019t flinch. We knew this was necessary and we responded quickly. We made the estimates based on the best information we had available to us and that provided to be overly cautious.\u201d He said there had been no loss to the taxpayer - \u201cin fact it\u2019s been the reverse\u201d. Morrison said the move by Labor senator Katy Gallagher to call the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, to appear before the Senate Select Committee on Covid-19 was \u201ca political stunt\u201d. A government spokesperson said the arrangements for the Covid-19 committee were for ministers who served in the lower house to be represented by their Senate representative ministers, akin to Senate estimates hearings. Here are the most important developments in the pandemic in Australia so far today: Scott Morrison urges state leaders to justify economic damage from ongoing border restrictions. In Australia, Scott Morrison has urged several state leaders who are still maintaining domestic border restrictions to justify the potential economic damage. The prime minister did not go as far as some of his Coalition colleagues in calling for premiers such as Annastacia Palaszczuk in Queensland to swiftly lift border restrictions, but he emphasised that the national cabinet had never agreed to internal border closures and leaders should be accountable to their voters. Pompeo implies Belt and Road projects may threaten US info sharing with Australia. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has implied information sharing with Australia may be put at risk if the Australian state of Victoria proceeds with any Belt and Road projects that jeopardise communications networks. Issuing the highly qualified warning during an interview with Sky News Australia, the News Corp-owned channel, Pompeo urged Victoria to scrutinise any proposals \u201cincredibly closely\u201d because Belt and Road projects could \u201cbuild up the capacity of the Chinese Communist party to do harm\u201d. Beauty salons to reopen in New South Wales from 1 June. State health minister, Brad Hazzard, has announced that beauty, tanning, nail and waxing salons will all be open from 1 June. \u201cOf all of the requests I\u2019ve had as health minister in the last three months, this has been the one that I think has topped the barrel ... I didn\u2019t even know there was such a thing as acrylic nails, but I\u2019m very pleased to say that they are now open,\u201d Hazzard said. He said salon operators would have to have a Covid-safe plan and stick to physical distancing measures. Six million Australians download tracing app. Six million Australians have now downloaded the Covidsafe app, less than a month after it was launched to help health authorities trace coronavirus infections. In Australia, Victorian state premier, Daniel Andrews, has announced Victorians will be allowed to have 20 people in homes and outdoors as well as overnight stays in hotels from next month, AAP reports. Victoria will further ease restrictions by the end of May, as schools and some outdoor facilities go back to a new normal from Tuesday. The total number of coronavirus cases in Victoria is 1,603. Global cases pass 5.3 million. According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, there are 5,311,089 confirmed infections. At least 342,104 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far. Both figures are likely to be significantly higher, however, due to underreporting and differing definitions and testing rates. Wuhan lab had three live bat coronaviruses: Chinese state media. The Chinese virology institute in Wuhan, the city where Covid-19 first emerged, has three live strains of bat coronavirus on-site, but none match the new contagion wreaking chaos across the world, its director has said, AFP reports. The director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology told state broadcaster CGTN that claims made by US President Donald Trump and others the virus could have leaked from the facility were \u201cpure fabrication\u201d. Brazil cases near 350,000. Brazil registered 965 new coronavirus deaths on Saturday, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,013, the Health Ministry said. The country now has 347,398 confirmed cases, according to the ministry, up 16,508 from Friday, when it surpassed Russia to become the world\u2019s virus hot spot behind the United States. The actual number of cases and deaths is believed to be higher than the official figures disclosed by the government, as the testing capacity of Latin America\u2019s largest country still lags. US records 1,127 new deaths in 24 hours. The US has recorded 1,127 deaths from coronavirus in the last 24 hours, according to AFP, citing Johns Hopkins figures.The current US total is 97,048, according to the Johns Hopkins Universitytracker. The US is likely to record 100,000 deaths before 1 June, the date at which the Centers for Disease Control predicted the country would mark that many deaths.The US toll is far higher than any other country. The UK, with the next worst number of deaths, has lost 36,757 lives. New York Times covers front page with 1,000 Covid-19 death notices. The New York Times has filled the entire front page of Sunday\u2019s paper with the death notices of victims from across the country. The entire list, which continues inside, numbers nearly 1,000 names \u2013 a fraction of the total loss of life in the US during the outbreak so far. Argentina extends lockdown to 7 June. Argentina extended until 7 June a mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires on Saturday and tightened some movement restrictions, after a steady increase in the city\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases in recent days, Reuters reports. The coronavirus pandemic \u201cappears to be taking a different pathway in Africa,\u201d the World Health Organization said, after it took 14 weeks for the continent to reach 100,000 cases and 3,100 deaths. \u201cCase numbers have not grown at the same exponential rate as in other regions and so far Africa has not experienced the high mortality seen in some parts of the world,\u201d the agency said. Downing Street is facing accusations of a cover-up over a 264-mile journey by Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, at the height of the national lockdown. There were reports that No 10 knew Cummings had made the trip to Durham, a northern city, after developing coronavirus symptoms. New York\u2019s daily death toll falls below 100 for first time since March, as Trump causes controversy with golfing trip. 84 deaths were recorded in New York \u2013 62 in hospitals and 22 in nursing homes. It\u2019s \u201cstill a tragedy\u201d, said state governor, Andrew Cuomo, but the figure had been over 100 for the past five days, so this is a significant drop. Donald Trump teed up fresh controversy by leaving the White House for his golf course in Virginia. Secret Service agents accompanying the president were photographed wearing masks. Trump was not seen to cover his face. Zoos, reptile parks and aquariums across the state will reopen from 1 June, with some restrictions. New South Wales treasurer Dominic Perrottet: \u201c[Taronga] zoo as we know employs hundreds of people here in Sydney, but also right across the state, aquariums and reptile parks employ many people. There are many mums and dads and kids who are animal lovers and I want them to enjoy these great institutions.\u201d At Taronga and Western Plains zoo in Dubbo, physical distancing measures will apply, with tickets available online only, and a limited number of visitors at any one time. Shows, such as the seals and bird shows, will continue but must be pre-booked. There will be no live keeper talks or animal interactions, such as giraffe feeding. Taronga\u2019s sky safari is closed. There will hand sanitiser stations throughout the zoo and the cafes will be takeaway only. According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, there are 5,311,089 confirmed coronavirus infections worldwide. At least 342,104 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far. Both figures are likely to be significantly higher, however, due to underreporting and differing definitions and testing rates. Conspiracy rumours that the biosafety lab was involved in the outbreak swirled online for months before Trump and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brought the theory into the mainstream by claiming that there is evidence the pathogen came from the institute, AFP reports. The lab has said it received samples of the then-unknown virus on 30 December, determined the viral genome sequence on 2 January and submitted information on the pathogen to the WHO on 11 January. Wang said in the interview that before it received samples in December, their team had never \u201cencountered, researched or kept the virus.\u201d \u201cIn fact, like everyone else, we didn\u2019t even know the virus existed,\u201d she said. \u201cHow could it have leaked from our lab when we never had it?\u201d The Chinese virology institute in Wuhan, the city where Covid-19 first emerged, has three live strains of bat coronavirus on-site, but none match the new contagion wreaking chaos across the world, its director has said, AFP reports. Scientists think Covid-19 - which first emerged in Wuhan and has killed some 340,000 people worldwide - originated in bats and could have been transmitted to people via another mammal. But the director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology told state broadcaster CGTN that claims made by US President Donald Trump and others the virus could have leaked from the facility were \u201cpure fabrication\u201d. The attempt by the laboratory to refute the claims is likely to add more fuel to the conspiracy rumours promoted by Trump and others. In an interview filmed on 13 May but broadcast Saturday night, Wang Yanyi said the centre has \u201cisolated and obtained some coronaviruses from bats.\u201d \u201cNow we have three strains of live viruses... But their highest similarity to SARS-CoV-2 only reaches 79.8%,\u201d she said, referring to the coronavirus strain that causes Covid-19. One of their research teams, led by Professor Shi Zhengli, has been researching bat coronaviruses since 2004 and focused on the \u201csource tracing of SARS\u201d, the strain behind another virus outbreak nearly two decades ago. In Australia, Scott Morrison has urged several state leaders who are still maintaining domestic border restrictions to justify the potential economic damage. The prime minister did not go as far as some of his Coalition colleagues in calling for premiers such as Annastacia Palaszczuk in Queensland swiftly lift border restrictions, but he emphasised that the national cabinet had never agreed to internal border closures, and leaders should be accountable to their voters. Morrison said border restrictions were in place in some form in Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland, but he said this was never part of the national health panel\u2019s advice. \u201cThe states and territories where they\u2019re making those unilateral decisions, they are accountable to the people in their own states for those decisions, and justifying why they need to be there, and the health protection they believe it may offer and indeed the economic damage that it can create. So it is very much an onus on those premiers to be able to justify those decisions, which was not a decision of the national cabinet, as to why that is the right thing to do for those states.\u201d Morrison said the focus now needed to be on creating as many jobs as possible and \u201cI\u2019d be urging all premiers to do just that.\u201d France\u2019s mosques nevertheless called on Muslims to stay at home to mark the Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. They said they would gradually resume services from 3 June. France\u2019s Jewish community took a similarly cautious line. Chief Rabbi Haim Korsia stressed that believers should not \u201crush towards the reopening of the synagogues\u201d. The latest figures for those seriously ill from the virus fell Saturday, with 1,665 patients still in intensive care for the coronavirus: 36 fewer than 24 hours ago. But the government has had to fight a series of legal and battles to control the pace of the gradual loosening of France\u2019s two-month lockdown. It has refused Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo\u2019s call to reopen the capital\u2019s parks and gardens, over fears this could accelerate infections in the city, already hard-hit by the virus. Heavily criticised for what critics say was their inadequate preparation in the run-up to the coronavirus crisis, the authorities have taken a cautious line in handling the exit from the lockdown. Many of its experts judge that it is too soon to say that the virus has been brought under control in France. French churches were preparing to hold their first Sunday masses in more than two months after the government bowed to a ruling that they should be reopened \u2013 provided proper precautions were taken, AFP reports. Nearly two weeks into the relaxation of its shutdown, the government finally allowed churches, mosques and synagogues to reopen. Last Monday, the France\u2019s Council of State, which instructs the government on legal issues, ordered it to lift its sweeping ban on all religious services, in place since the lockdown. The ruling said that such a ban on freedom of worship caused \u201cdamage that is serious and manifestly illegal\u201d, ordering the government to lift the ban within eight days. But priests, pastors, rabbis and imams will still have to ensure that the correct safety measures are in force. Worshippers will have to wear masks, there will have to be disinfectant gel on hand and the seating will need to be organised to ensure people keep a safe distance from each other. \u201cMy cell phone is crackling with messages!\u201d Father Pierre Amar, a priest in Versailles, told AFP. At one church in Neuilly-sur-Seine, just outside Paris, some worshippers turned up at short notice on Saturday morning, having heard that mass would be celebrated. \u201cWe knew 30 minutes in advance, we ran to come,\u201d said Eliane Nsom, who went with her three daughters. Around 40 people attended the service. More on Australia\u2019s Covidsafe app, which has been downloaded by 6 million people. But is it actually useful? Nearly a month since launch, the contact tracing app has barely been used \u2013 just one person has been reported to have been identified using data from it. It set a target of 40% of the Australian population using the app for it to be effective. While close to 6 million Australians now have the app, the number of new downloads has declined in the past few weeks. No actual number was tied to the 40% figure, but based on estimations of the number of Australians with smartphones, it is now about 1.5m under that target. And the language from public officials has been toned down. No longer is it the key to freedoms, but an add-on to existing contact tracing methods, to work in concert with social distancing rules and continued testing to keep a lid on outbreaks. So how did it go from being the key to allowing Australians to get back to the footy to being barely relevant? In Australia, New South Wales health minister Brad Hazzard also said a secondary school student in NSW may have tested positive to Covid-19. He said the student went back to school on Tuesday and on Wednesday developed mild symptoms and got tested. He said the student was now well and further information would be announced later. He warned that there is \u201cno room for complacency\u201d as numbers of new Covid-19 infections in the state remain low. \u201cIf you have the slightest sore throat, itchy throat, temperature, cough, a cold, runny nose, go and get tested. You may be saving yourself but you may be saving your family and others in the community.\u201d He said while there may be a temptation in the winter period to dismiss cold and flu-like symptoms, people should not. \u201cNo, it is winter and Covid-19 season, so go and get tested,\u201d he said. Back to Australia now: New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, has announced that beauty, tanning, nail and waxing salons will all be open from 1 June. \u201cOf all of the requests I\u2019ve had as health minister in the last three months, this has been the one that I think has topped the barrel ... I\u2019ve even had text messages in the middle of the other meetings, telling me how bad acrylic nails were. I didn\u2019t even know there was such a thing as acrylic nails, but I\u2019m very pleased to say that they are now open,\u201d Hazzard said. He said salon operators would have to have a Covid-safe plan and stick to physical distancing measures. US president Donald Trump is tweeting about hydroxychloroquine again: Here is a recent article about the dangers of the drug by my colleage Sarah Boseley, the Guardian\u2019s health editor: Hydroxychloroquine: Trump\u2019s Covid-19 \u2018cure\u2019 increases deaths, global study finds Hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial drug Donald Trump is taking to prevent Covid-19, has increased deaths in patients treated with it in hospitals around the world, a study has shown. A major study of the way hydroxychloroquine and its older version, chloroquine, have been used on six continents \u2013 without clinical trials \u2013 reveals a sobering picture. Scientists said the results meant the drug should no longer be given to Covid-19 patients except in proper research settings: The China Daily reports that there have been three new coronavirus cases in China in the last 24 hours. The day before, China recorded no new confirmed cases for the first time since the outbreak began. Beijing\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday there were only two suspected cases in mainland China: in Shanghai and in the north-eastern Jilin province. New asymptomatic cases fell to 28, from 35 a day earlier, it said. More from that interview with Mike Pompeo: He said every nation had a sovereign right to make decisions for itself and Victoria also had \u201csome rights\u201d but he added that BRI projects needed to be looked at closely. Some projects \u201cmay just be straight-up commercial transactions\u201d and that would be \u201cfine\u201d, but nearly every one had costs and risks attached to it. Pompeo said the US would do the right thing to defend and keep America safe and work with \u201cgreat partners like Australia\u201d. He added, however, that the US \u201cwill not take any risk to our telecommunications infrastructure, any risk to the national security elements of what we need to do with our Five Eyes partners\u201d. We\u2019re going to protect and preserve the security of those institutions, so I don\u2019t know the nature of those projects precisely, but to the extent they have an adverse impact on our ability to protect telecommunications from our private citizens, or security networks for our defence and intelligence communities, we will simply disconnect, we will simply separate. We\u2019re going to preserve trust in networks for important information. We hope our friends and partners and allies across the world, especially our Five Eyes partners like Australia, will do the same.\u201d The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has implied information sharing with Australia may be put at risk if the Australian state of Victoria proceeds with any Belt and Road projects that jeopardise communications networks. Issuing the highly qualified warning during an interview with Sky News Australia, the News Corp-owned channel, Pompeo urged Victoria to scrutinise any proposals \u201cincredibly closely\u201d because Belt and Road projects could \u201cbuild up the capacity of the Chinese Communist Party to do harm\u201d. The Victorian state government has attracted domestic political criticism for signing an agreement with Beijing that would allow for cooperation under President Xi Jinping\u2019s signature infrastructure program known as the Belt and Road Initiative. But that deal is still in its early stages with no projects locked in, and the state government has promised to \u201cconsider both Victoria\u2019s and the national interest before agreeing to any specific activity\u201d. The New York Times has filled the entire front page of Sunday\u2019s paper with the death notices of victims from across the country. The US death toll stands at more than 97,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, by far the highest in the world, and the Times said it had been considering how to mark expected milestone of 100,000 deaths. The entire list, which continues inside, numbers nearly 1,000 names \u2013 a fraction of the total loss of life in the US during the outbreak so far. In an article for Times Insider, assistant graphics editor Simone Landon explained the treatment was a way of personalising the tragedy as readers and staff developed data fatigue from the constant reporting of the pandemic. Landon led a team of researchers in searching obituaries in hundreds of US newspapers that listed Covid-19 as the cause of death and extracting names and key personal details \u201cthat depicted the uniqueness of each life lost\u201d, such as: \u201cAlan Lund, 81, Washington, conductor with \u2018the most amazing ear\u201d. Tom Bodkin, its chief creative officer, said the all-text treatment referenced early newspaper designs, but that he could not remember another front page without an image in his 40 years at the paper. \u201cThis is certainly a first in modern times,\u201d Bodkin said.

New York Stock Exchange traders hope to prove they are still a big noise A line from the 1983 movie Trading Places is being used to trail the partial return to open outcry trading on the New York Stock Exchange this week, after the physical floor (but not the electronic market) was closed in March as part of the coronavirus lockdown. \u201cWe\u2019re back, Mortimer,\u201d was how veteran floor trader Peter \u201cEinstein of Wall Street\u201d Tuchman put it. Tuchman, who is sometimes called the \u201cmost photographed trader on Wall Street\u201d, is recovering from a nasty bout of the virus himself, so it is difficult to begrudge him his enthusiasm. But is this week\u2019s return of open outcry trading at the NYSE \u2013 where safety concerns will only permit about 25% of the normal numbers of brokers back \u2013 really such a big deal? Mexican health authorities registered 3,329 new cases of the novel coronavirus in the country and 190 new deaths, a health official said on Saturday, bringing the total number to 65,856 cases and 7,179 deaths. Argentina extended until 7 June a mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires on Saturday and tightened some movement restrictions, after a steady increase in the city\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases in recent days, Reuters reports. Officials will tighten traffic controls between the capital and Buenos Aires province, the area with the second highest concentration of cases, President Alberto Fernandez said in a televised press conference. Commercial activity in some of the city\u2019s more populated neighbourhoods and access to public transportation will also be rolled back. Some businesses had been allowed to reopen under a previous lockdown extension. The lockdown, due to expire on Sunday, has been in place since March 20, though officials have relaxed restrictions in some areas of the country. Argentina has a commercial flight ban until September 1, one of the world\u2019s strictest travel measures during the pandemic. The country recorded 704 new infections on Saturday, one of the highest single-day increases since the pandemic began. The country has 11,353 cases, mostly in Buenos Aires, where the city\u2019s low-income neighbourhoods have been particularly hard hit, government data showed. The death toll is at 445. Brazil registered 965 new coronavirus deaths on Saturday, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,013, the Health Ministry said. The country now has 347,398 confirmed cases, according to the ministry, up 16,508 from Friday, when it surpassed Russia to become the world\u2019s virus hot spot behind the United States. The actual number of cases and deaths is believed to be higher than the official figures disclosed by the government, as the testing capacity of Latin America\u2019s largest country still lags. Brazil\u2019s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has been fiercely criticized for his handling of the outbreak, which has led to the exit of two health ministers amid his insistence in opposing social distancing measures while advocating the use of unproven drugs for treatment. The former army captain has seen his opinion poll ratings drop as an unfolding political crisis adds to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. New Zealand\u2019s health ministry has announced there were zero new coronavirus cases confirmed in the last 24 hours. According to NewsHub: There are now only 27 active cases left in New Zealand, with one more patient recovered. The total number of confirmed cases remains 1,154, and the total \u2013 including probable \u2013 at 1504. There are no new deaths to report, so the death toll remains at 21. One person remains in hospital \u2013 they are not in ICU. There have been another 3,302 tests completed, for a total of 259,152. Staying with the latest from Australia for a moment, the opposition is urging the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to call Donald Trump to clarify whether Australian exporters are being disadvantaged by the US-China trade deal. Growing trade tensions with China have been one of the biggest concerns in Australian political and business circles over the last couple of weeks, as Beijing has imposed tariffs of around 80% on Australian barley imports and suspended beef imports from four abattoirs on technical grounds. China announced recently it would immediately allow barley imports from the US, which was seen as a measure to meet commitments in the first phase of Xi\u2019s trade deal with Trump. In January, China pledged to buy an extra $US200bn of American farm products and other goods and services over two years. The moves come after China railed against Australia for early and vocal calls for an independent inquiry into the origins and handling of coronavirus - a watered down version of which won broad support at last week\u2019s World Health Assembly, including from Beijing. Penny Wong, the Labor opposition\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, said it would have been better for the government to have followed \u201cthe usual diplomatic practice\u201d of trying to secure some support from other countries before publicly announcing the inquiry push. But in an interview with the ABC\u2019s Insiders program this morning, she also called on Morrison to check in with Trump \u201cto ensure that our interests are not affected and not undermined by that [trade] deal between President Trump and President Xi [Jinping]\u201d. Wong said: \u201cScott Morrison is always very keen to tell us when he has spoken to President Trump. Well, I think it is time for him to pick up the phone and speak to him now and ensure that the US-China trade deal does not come at the expense of Australian exporters and Australian jobs.\u201d In Australia, Victorian state premier, Daniel Andrews, has announced Victorians will be allowed to have 20 people in homes and outdoors as well as overnight stays in hotels from next month, AAP reports. Victoria will further ease restrictions by the end of May, as schools and some outdoor facilities go back to a new normal from Tuesday. The total number of coronavirus cases in Victoria is 1,603 \u2013 a net increase of one since yesterday \u2013 two new cases were confirmed, according to the state\u2019s health department, but a duplicate case was removed from the total, too. There were no new deaths, which leaves the total for the state at 19. The state will loosen its grip on social distancing restrictions from 1 June, allowing gatherings of up to 20 people at homes and outdoors, overnight stays in hotels as well as the opening of campgrounds. Twenty people will be allowed at weddings, while up to 50 people will be able to attend funerals. The same number of people, 20, will be able to visit libraries and other community facilities, entertainment and cultural venues, as well as beauty and personal care services. The US has recorded 1,127 deaths from coronavirus in the last 24 hours, according to AFP, citing Johns Hopkins figures. The current US total is 97,048, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The US is likely to record 100,000 deaths before 1 June, the date at which the Centers for Disease Control predicted the country would mark that many deaths. The US toll is far higher than any other country. The UK, with the next worst number of deaths, has lost 36,757 lives. More on the wage subsidy scheme in Australia. So far, the government has not given any indication it is planning to extend the scheme to excluded workers, such as casuals employed for less than a year, university and local government staff, temporary visa holders and employees of foreign-owned companies. However, a scheduled review in June may look at tweaks to the scheme, including the potential to extend targeted support to the worst-affected sectors beyond the expiry in September. The government has been spinning the updated figures as good news. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, told Sky News this morning that the original forecast was never \u201can objective or a target\u201d. \u201cIt does mean that we\u2019re in a better position as we work our way towards recovery and that is fantastic news,\u201d Taylor said, adding that \u201cwe\u2019ll see what comes out of\u201d the review in June. In Australia, the government is facing sustained pressure to widen its wage subsidy scheme to cover a broader group of workers, after revelations on Friday that the six-month \u201cjobkeeper\u201d program is now expected to cost the budget AU$70bn (US$46bn) rather than AU$130bn. The Labor opposition\u2019s Senate leader, Penny Wong, described the news as \u201ca $60bn black hole in the economic credibility of the Morrison government\u201d and she reinforced calls for the $1500 fortnightly payment to be extended to a more of the workforce, including short-term casuals. Speaking on the ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday morning, Wong said the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, should have \u201cthe courage\u201d to accept a forthcoming invitation to appear before the Senate\u2019s Covid-19 inquiry to explain the error. \u201cWe\u2019d say to Josh, when you\u2019ve got a budget blunder of this size, I reckon it is about time you fronted up and explained it.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Amanda Holpuch and Nina Lakhani report from New York, with Khushbu Shah in Atlanta: In case you missed this story: In the US, Monday is Memorial Day \u2013 the traditional start of the American summer. Shutters are going up, doors are being unlocked, barriers removed. Every state is relaxing quarantine rules to some extent, betting that the country finally has Covid-19 under control. There are signs that for some Americans quarantine fatigue is overcoming fear of infection. With the economy reeling, others have dismissed the pandemic as a political plot \u2013 for them relaxing quarantine rules can\u2019t come soon enough. But people on the front line are worried, and experts warn the outbreak has proved a \u201ctrust-destroying disaster\u201d that could have devastating consequences. On Friday, White House coronavirus taskforce member Dr Anthony Fauci said new localized outbreaks were \u201cinevitable\u201d as mitigation measures are relaxed. He said a full-blown second wave could be avoided if the holy grail of containment measures \u2013 testing, quarantine and contact tracing \u2013 continued to be adhered to. Fauci said he was hopeful that the US would be ready, though a recent study by Harvard University found that only nine states were conducting, or near to conducting, the minimum recommended testing. Hours after Fauci spoke, Donald Trump ignored health guidance and ordered houses of worship to open for in-person services at the weekend. These disparate responses to the pandemic are not just happening in the White House, but across America. Six million Australians have now downloaded the COVIDSafe app, less than a month after it was launched to help health authorities trace coronavirus infections, AAP reports. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the app is playing a significant role in Australia\u2019s response to the pandemic and several countries have expressed interest in learning from its positive impacts. \u201cAustralia continues to be a world leader in testing, tracing, and containing the coronavirus and I would encourage all Australians to contribute to that effort and download the COVIDSafe app today,\u201d Mr Hunt said in a statement on Sunday. Only state and territory health officials have access to contact information from the app which is triggered when people come in close contact with someone who has the virus - that is 1.5 metres or less for a duration of 15 minutes or more. Government Services Minister Stuart Robert said the take up of the COVIDSafe app was downloaded faster than any other Australian government app and has consistently remained in the top three apps in Australian app stores. \u201cMillions of Australians are doing their bit as part of our health response,\u201d he said. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live global coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. I\u2019m Helen Sullivan and I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours.

In Australia, 6 million people have downloaded the government\u2019s COVIDSafe tracing app in under a month. The app is able to tell when a person has come into close contact - 1.5m - of an infected person (or a person later found to be infected) for 15 minutes and more, allowing authorities to contact people who may have been exposed to the virus. Meanwhile in the US, experts and frontline workers fear the country is not ready to ease restrictions for the summer \u2013 and warn there could be a disastrous second wave of infections. On Friday, White House coronavirus taskforce member Dr Anthony Fauci said a full-blown second wave could be avoided if the holy grail of containment measures \u2013 testing, quarantine and contact tracing \u2013 continued to be adhered to. Global deaths pass 340,000. According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, at least 340,805 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far. There are 5,288,392 confirmed infections. Both figures are likely to be significantly higher, however, due to underreporting and differing definitions and testing rates. The coronavirus pandemic \u201cappears to be taking a different pathway in Africa,\u201d the World Health Organization said, after it took 14 weeks for the continent to reach 100,000 cases and 3,100 deaths. \u201cCase numbers have not grown at the same exponential rate as in other regions and so far Africa has not experienced the high mortality seen in some parts of the world,\u201d the agency said. Downing Street is facing accusations of a cover-up over a 264-mile journey by Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, at the height of the national lockdown. There were reports that No 10 knew Cummings had made the trip to Durham, a northern city, after developing coronavirus symptoms. New York\u2019s daily death toll falls below 100 for first time since March, as Trump causes controversy with golfing trip. 84 deaths were recorded in New York \u2013 62 in hospitals and 22 in nursing homes. It\u2019s \u201cstill a tragedy\u201d, said state governor, Andrew Cuomo, but the figure had been over 100 for the past five days, so this is a significant drop. Donald Trump teed up fresh controversy by leaving the White House for his golf course in Virginia. Early on a fine morning in Washington DC, the president was seen by reporters \u201cin his typical golf wear of white polo shirt and white baseball cap \u2026 before he departed the White House\u201d for an undisclosed location. Secret Service agents accompanying the president were photographed wearing masks. Trump was not seen to cover his face. He later arrived at his golf club in Sterling, Virginia, where he was pictured playing a round. India to organise special trains for migrant workers to get at least 3.6 million people who have been stranded in the cities, often walking hundreds of miles, home. More than 40 infected a German religious gathering after reopening. Six were hospitalised after the service, which was was held on May 10, a few days after the reopening of places of worship in Germany. France has announced it will bring in a reciprocal 14-day quarantine for all visitors from the UK from 8 June, the same day that the UK imposes quarantine on all those coming into the country from abroad. However, unlike in Britain, visitors will be asked to voluntarily self-quarantine at home. Spain will reopen to overseas tourists from July, the prime minister announced on Saturday afternoon, adding that the government would guarantee the safety of visitors and locals as the country emerges from one of Europe\u2019s strictest coronavirus lockdowns. The prime minister said central and regional governments had been planning and coordinating the return to tourism for weeks. Cyprus beaches reopen, but with social distancing measures in place and limits on water sports, as country records first day of zero new infections. Thailand begins vaccine tests on monkeys. Thailand has begun testing a coronavirus vaccine on monkeys after a positive trial in mice, the country\u2019s minister of higher education, science and research and innovation has said.Suvit Maesincee said researchers hoped to have a \u201cclearer outcome\u201d of the effectiveness of the vaccine by September. China has recorded no new confirmed cases for the first time since the outbreak began. Beijing\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday there were only two suspected cases in mainland China: in Shanghai and in the north-eastern Jilin province. New asymptomatic cases fell to 28, from 35 a day earlier, it said. The 102-year-old firm Hertz has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US after its business all but vanished during the pandemic.Hertz said in a US court filing on Friday it had voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 reorganisation. Its international operating regions including Europe, Australia and New Zealand were not included in the proceedings.",
