      "body": "<p>A prominent Chinese intellectual has become the first high-profile public figure to lay the blame for the coronavirus crisis at the feet of the country\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, saying the spread of the deadly virus has \u201crevealed the rotten core of Chinese governance\u201d.</p> <p>As the crisis expands across the country, Xu Zhangrun, a law professor from one of the country\u2019s top universities, lambasted the government under Xi in an essay titled: <a href=\"http://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/viewpoint/viral-alarm-when-fury-overcomes-fear\">Viral Alarm, When Fury Overcomes Fear. </a>In it, Xu blamed the current national crisis on a culture of suppression and \u201csystemic impotence\u201d that Xi has created. The virus has now killed more than 1,000 people inside China.</p> <p>\u201cThe cause of all of this lies with The Axelrod and the cabal that surrounds him,\u201d Xu writes, referring to Xi, according to a translation of the article by historian Geremie Barm\u00e9 published on Monday by the website <a href=\"http://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/viewpoint/viral-alarm-when-fury-overcomes-fear\">ChinaFile</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-live-updates-deaths-infections-symptoms-transmission-wuhan-china-cruise-ship-quarantine-cases-hong-kong\">Coronavirus live updates: two senior Hubei officials sacked as deaths pass 1,000 \u2013 latest news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt is a system that turns every natural disaster into an even greater man-made catastrophe. The coronavirus epidemic has revealed the rotten core of Chinese governance; the fragile and vacuous heart of the jittering edifice of state has thereby shown up as never before.\u201d</p> <p>Xu describes the outbreak as a \u201cnational calamity\u201d that involves politics, the economy and \u201cnation\u2019s ethical fabric\u201d making it \u201cmore perilous than total war itself\u201d.</p> <p>The rare open rebuke of Xi comes as the country attempts to return to some form of normalcy with businesses and factories slowly going back to work after weeks of quarantine measures. On Tuesday, China\u2019s National Health Commission reported another 108 new deaths from the virus, bringing the total number of casualties to 1,016.</p> <p>Officials reported 2,478 new cases of infection on Monday, down from 3,062 the day before, prompting some optimism that measures to contain the virus are working after more than 40,000 people have been infected. There have been more than 300 cases in 24 other countries and territories.</p> <p>After weeks of disappearing from public view, Xi on Monday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/coronavirus-who-warns-spread-by-people-who-had-not-visited-china-could-be-tip-of-the-iceberg\">visited a neighbourhood and hospital in Beijing</a> where he held a video call with health workers in Wuhan. Coverage of his appearance filled the front page of the official People\u2019s Daily on Tuesday.</p> <p>Xu\u2019s essay captures growing public anger at the government, which has reached a new peak after the death of a doctor and whistleblower last week. Officials have tried to blame lower-level bureaucrats, but top bosses have not escaped. On Tuesday, the party secretary of health commission of Hubei province and the director of the Hubei provincial health commission were both fired.</p> <p>A group of Chinese academics, including Xu, have signed an open letter calling for the government to issue an apology to the deceased doctor, Li Wenliang, and for freedom of speech and rights guaranteed by the constitution to be protected. Over the weekend, a woman was photographed in Shanghai holding a sign calling for freedom of speech.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/what-are-super-spreaders-coronavirus\">What are super-spreaders and how are they transmitting coronavirus?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Xu, who was suspended from his position last year after publishing a similarly critical essay of Xi, does not refer to the leader by name but uses other terms to refer to him. In his essay he urges citizens to call for \u201cfive demands\u201d, a reference to anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.</p> <p>The demands he lists relate to freedom of speech and assembly, as well as the right to vote in open elections and an independent body to investigate the response to the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThe ancients observed that \u2018it\u2019s easier to dam a river than it is to silence the voice of the people\u2019. Regardless of how good they are at controlling the internet, they can\u2019t keep all 1.4 billion mouths in China shut. Yet again, our ancestors will be proved right,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Quoting the poet Dylan Thomas, Xu wrote in closing: \u201cI join my compatriots \u2013 the 1.4 billion men and women, brothers and sisters of China, the countless multitudes who have no way of fleeing this land \u2013 and I call on them: rage against this injustice; let your lives burn with a flame of decency; break through the stultifying darkness and welcome the dawn.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A prominent Chinese intellectual has become the first high-profile public figure to lay the blame for the coronavirus crisis at the feet of the country\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, saying the spread of the deadly virus has \u201crevealed the rotten core of Chinese governance\u201d. As the crisis expands across the country, Xu Zhangrun, a law professor from one of the country\u2019s top universities, lambasted the government under Xi in an essay titled: Viral Alarm, When Fury Overcomes Fear. In it, Xu blamed the current national crisis on a culture of suppression and \u201csystemic impotence\u201d that Xi has created. The virus has now killed more than 1,000 people inside China. \u201cThe cause of all of this lies with The Axelrod and the cabal that surrounds him,\u201d Xu writes, referring to Xi, according to a translation of the article by historian Geremie Barm\u00e9 published on Monday by the website ChinaFile. \u201cIt is a system that turns every natural disaster into an even greater man-made catastrophe. The coronavirus epidemic has revealed the rotten core of Chinese governance; the fragile and vacuous heart of the jittering edifice of state has thereby shown up as never before.\u201d Xu describes the outbreak as a \u201cnational calamity\u201d that involves politics, the economy and \u201cnation\u2019s ethical fabric\u201d making it \u201cmore perilous than total war itself\u201d. The rare open rebuke of Xi comes as the country attempts to return to some form of normalcy with businesses and factories slowly going back to work after weeks of quarantine measures. On Tuesday, China\u2019s National Health Commission reported another 108 new deaths from the virus, bringing the total number of casualties to 1,016. Officials reported 2,478 new cases of infection on Monday, down from 3,062 the day before, prompting some optimism that measures to contain the virus are working after more than 40,000 people have been infected. There have been more than 300 cases in 24 other countries and territories. After weeks of disappearing from public view, Xi on Monday visited a neighbourhood and hospital in Beijing where he held a video call with health workers in Wuhan. Coverage of his appearance filled the front page of the official People\u2019s Daily on Tuesday. Xu\u2019s essay captures growing public anger at the government, which has reached a new peak after the death of a doctor and whistleblower last week. Officials have tried to blame lower-level bureaucrats, but top bosses have not escaped. On Tuesday, the party secretary of health commission of Hubei province and the director of the Hubei provincial health commission were both fired. A group of Chinese academics, including Xu, have signed an open letter calling for the government to issue an apology to the deceased doctor, Li Wenliang, and for freedom of speech and rights guaranteed by the constitution to be protected. Over the weekend, a woman was photographed in Shanghai holding a sign calling for freedom of speech. Xu, who was suspended from his position last year after publishing a similarly critical essay of Xi, does not refer to the leader by name but uses other terms to refer to him. In his essay he urges citizens to call for \u201cfive demands\u201d, a reference to anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. The demands he lists relate to freedom of speech and assembly, as well as the right to vote in open elections and an independent body to investigate the response to the coronavirus crisis. \u201cThe ancients observed that \u2018it\u2019s easier to dam a river than it is to silence the voice of the people\u2019. Regardless of how good they are at controlling the internet, they can\u2019t keep all 1.4 billion mouths in China shut. Yet again, our ancestors will be proved right,\u201d he wrote. Quoting the poet Dylan Thomas, Xu wrote in closing: \u201cI join my compatriots \u2013 the 1.4 billion men and women, brothers and sisters of China, the countless multitudes who have no way of fleeing this land \u2013 and I call on them: rage against this injustice; let your lives burn with a flame of decency; break through the stultifying darkness and welcome the dawn.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Virus has \u2018attack rate\u2019 of up to 80%</h2> <p>Hello, Warren Murray here with an open sandwich of news for your morning table.</p> <p>The novel coronavirus epidemic could spread to two-thirds of the world\u2019s population if it cannot be controlled, according to Hong Kong\u2019s leading public health epidemiologist. The number of confirmed cases in the UK has doubled from four to eight \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/coronavirus-uk-declares-outbreak-serious-threat-to-health\">two healthcare workers are among them</a> \u2013 as the government announced new powers to detain people suspected of having the virus.</p> <p>Prof Gabriel Leung, the Hong Kong expert, said that if the drastic containment measures adopted by China proved successful, other countries should consider adopting them \u2013 but questions remained to be answered. \u201cHave these massive public health interventions, social distancing, and mobility restrictions worked in China?\u201d said Leung, en route to an expert meeting at the WHO in Geneva. \u201cIf so, how can we roll them out, or is it not possible?\u201d Most experts thought that each person infected would go on to transmit the virus to around 2.5 other people. That gave a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-expert-warns-infection-could-reach-60-of-worlds-population\">potential \u201cattack rate\u201d of 60 to 80%</a>. \u201cIs 60-80% of the world\u2019s population going to get infected? Maybe not. Maybe this will come in waves. Maybe the virus is going to attenuate its lethality because it certainly doesn\u2019t help it if it kills everybody in its path, because it will get killed as well,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The death toll in China has exceeded 1,000 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-live-updates-deaths-infections-symptoms-transmission-wuhan-china-cruise-ship-quarantine-cases-hong-kong\">more updates at our live blog</a>.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>50 terror prisoners face longer jail stay \u2013 </strong>Emergency legislation will be introduced today to prevent about 50 prisoners convicted of terror offences being automatically freed halfway through their sentences. The move follows the London Bridge knife attacks by Usman Khan in November 2019 and the Streatham stabbings by Sudesh Amman this month. Both men were convicted terrorists released mid-term from prison on licence. Instead of being freed automatically halfway through their sentence, inmates will have to spend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/11/emergency-legislation-prisoners-terror-offences\">at least two-thirds of their term behind bars</a> before being referred to the Parole Board, which will consider their release. Those receiving sentences as offenders of particular concern (SOPCs) will also be affected.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>All aboard \u2013 </strong>The PM is expected to give the go-ahead today for the HS2 rail project. Ministers are promising an additional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/10/johnson-plans-5bn-boost-for-bus-services-and-cycle-routes\">\u00a35bn for buses and cycle routes </a>to head off critics who fear the \u00a3100bn high-speed train line will suck cash from other priorities. Johnson\u2019s decision has been keenly anticipated though he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/31/boris-johnson-hs2-keep-digging\">appeared to let slip his intentions to a 10-year-old schoolboy</a> who interviewed him last month, telling him: \u201cIn a hole the size of HS2, the only thing to do is keep digging.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: \u201cHS2 has been appallingly mismanaged by the Conservative party, which has failed to deliver a single major infrastructure project on time or within budget. If HS2 is going to get back on track, the project has to be integrated with Crossrail for the North, it needs to be managed as part of an advanced rail network, and it must eventually extend into Scotland so that we remove the need for domestic flights.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>University course rankings feared \u2013 </strong>Academics are sounding the alarm over government plans to label university courses as failing if their graduates earn lower salaries. Senior academics close to Westminster say the Conservatives are pressing on with their manifesto plan to use Ofsted-style rankings in universities. Higher education experts warn that in the arts and humanities starting salaries are typically much lower than in disciplines such as medicine or law; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/feb/11/alarm-at-ofsted-style-plan-to-rank-universities-by-graduate-earnings\">universities outside London will lose out</a> because of graduates who stay on and work locally rather than going to the capital for a higher salary. Universities fear the government might refuse to provide student loans for \u201clow-quality\u201d courses, threaten universities with removal from the Office for Students\u2019 register if they do not improve, or shut down courses.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Maldives bikini arrest \u2013 </strong>The speaker of the Maldives parliament has apologised to a British tourist after she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/maldives-apologises-to-british-tourist-arrested-for-wearing-a-bikini\">bundled off the street by police for wearing a bikini</a>. Police said the woman, who was walking on a main road on the island of Maafushi, was \u201cinappropriately\u201d dressed and allegedly unruly and drunk when she was detained after refusing to comply with requests to cover up. The Maldives once confined tourists to resort islets separate from the local Muslim population but in recent years has allowed foreigners to stay on inhabited islands. The Maldives police service commissioner, Mohamed Hameed, wrote after footage was shared online that the incident \u201cseems to be badly handled \u2026 I apologise to the tourist and the public for this\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Bum note \u2013 </strong>An irreplaceable piano that was treasured by the Canadian virtuoso Angela Hewitt has been broken beyond repair when it was dropped by specialist instrument movers after a recording session in Berlin.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Virus has \u2018attack rate\u2019 of up to 80% Hello, Warren Murray here with an open sandwich of news for your morning table. The novel coronavirus epidemic could spread to two-thirds of the world\u2019s population if it cannot be controlled, according to Hong Kong\u2019s leading public health epidemiologist. The number of confirmed cases in the UK has doubled from four to eight \u2013 two healthcare workers are among them \u2013 as the government announced new powers to detain people suspected of having the virus. Prof Gabriel Leung, the Hong Kong expert, said that if the drastic containment measures adopted by China proved successful, other countries should consider adopting them \u2013 but questions remained to be answered. \u201cHave these massive public health interventions, social distancing, and mobility restrictions worked in China?\u201d said Leung, en route to an expert meeting at the WHO in Geneva. \u201cIf so, how can we roll them out, or is it not possible?\u201d Most experts thought that each person infected would go on to transmit the virus to around 2.5 other people. That gave a potential \u201cattack rate\u201d of 60 to 80%. \u201cIs 60-80% of the world\u2019s population going to get infected? Maybe not. Maybe this will come in waves. Maybe the virus is going to attenuate its lethality because it certainly doesn\u2019t help it if it kills everybody in its path, because it will get killed as well,\u201d he said. The death toll in China has exceeded 1,000 \u2013 more updates at our live blog. * * * 50 terror prisoners face longer jail stay \u2013 Emergency legislation will be introduced today to prevent about 50 prisoners convicted of terror offences being automatically freed halfway through their sentences. The move follows the London Bridge knife attacks by Usman Khan in November 2019 and the Streatham stabbings by Sudesh Amman this month. Both men were convicted terrorists released mid-term from prison on licence. Instead of being freed automatically halfway through their sentence, inmates will have to spend at least two-thirds of their term behind bars before being referred to the Parole Board, which will consider their release. Those receiving sentences as offenders of particular concern (SOPCs) will also be affected. * * * All aboard \u2013 The PM is expected to give the go-ahead today for the HS2 rail project. Ministers are promising an additional \u00a35bn for buses and cycle routes to head off critics who fear the \u00a3100bn high-speed train line will suck cash from other priorities. Johnson\u2019s decision has been keenly anticipated though he appeared to let slip his intentions to a 10-year-old schoolboy who interviewed him last month, telling him: \u201cIn a hole the size of HS2, the only thing to do is keep digging.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: \u201cHS2 has been appallingly mismanaged by the Conservative party, which has failed to deliver a single major infrastructure project on time or within budget. If HS2 is going to get back on track, the project has to be integrated with Crossrail for the North, it needs to be managed as part of an advanced rail network, and it must eventually extend into Scotland so that we remove the need for domestic flights.\u201d * * * University course rankings feared \u2013 Academics are sounding the alarm over government plans to label university courses as failing if their graduates earn lower salaries. Senior academics close to Westminster say the Conservatives are pressing on with their manifesto plan to use Ofsted-style rankings in universities. Higher education experts warn that in the arts and humanities starting salaries are typically much lower than in disciplines such as medicine or law; and universities outside London will lose out because of graduates who stay on and work locally rather than going to the capital for a higher salary. Universities fear the government might refuse to provide student loans for \u201clow-quality\u201d courses, threaten universities with removal from the Office for Students\u2019 register if they do not improve, or shut down courses. * * * Maldives bikini arrest \u2013 The speaker of the Maldives parliament has apologised to a British tourist after she was bundled off the street by police for wearing a bikini. Police said the woman, who was walking on a main road on the island of Maafushi, was \u201cinappropriately\u201d dressed and allegedly unruly and drunk when she was detained after refusing to comply with requests to cover up. The Maldives once confined tourists to resort islets separate from the local Muslim population but in recent years has allowed foreigners to stay on inhabited islands. The Maldives police service commissioner, Mohamed Hameed, wrote after footage was shared online that the incident \u201cseems to be badly handled \u2026 I apologise to the tourist and the public for this\u201d. * * * Bum note \u2013 An irreplaceable piano that was treasured by the Canadian virtuoso Angela Hewitt has been broken beyond repair when it was dropped by specialist instrument movers after a recording session in Berlin. Hewitt said her F278 Fazioli \u2013 the only one in the world fitted with four pedals, and worth at least \u00a3150,000 \u2013 was \u201ckaputt \u2026 I hope my piano will be happy in piano heaven.\u201d The instrument was inspected by its Italian maker, Paolo Fazioli, who declared it \u201cunsalvageable\u201d. The 590kg instrument was dropped so heavily that its lid split in two. Terence Lewis, co-owner of London\u2019s Jaques Samuel Pianos, said: \u201cPaolo [Fazioli] says he will never fit four pedals ever again to it [a F278] because it was such a pain in the arse.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Life on Lesbos Harriet Grant travelled to the Greek island to report on the crisis playing out in its refugee camps. Plus: Lisa O\u2019Carroll on Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s election success. (We have a separate read on the UN calling for the evacuation of the Moria camp on Lesbos amid desperately overcrowded an unsanitary conditions.) Lunchtime read: Australia\u2019s summer of dread Australia\u2019s catastrophic bushfire season has taken 33 lives, destroyed thousands of homes and devastated the country\u2019s unique wildlife. Guardian Australia surveys the damage. Sport Chris Silverwood has conceded for the first time he may look at managing Jofra Archer differently in Test cricket. Cricket may finally have solved its no-ball problem after confirmation the upcoming women\u2019s Twenty20 World Cup will be the first tournament to feature front-foot technology. An emotional David Warner completed a stunning return to the international stage by claiming Cricket Australia\u2019s top award, finishing a single vote ahead of Steve Smith. Vanessa Bryant has said in an Instagram post that she was both grieving and angry over the loss of her husband, NBA star Kobe Bryant, and 13-year-old daughter Gianna in a helicopter crash last month. Former clubs and teammates of Jackie McNamara have sent their best wishes after the former Scotland international fell seriously ill. England braved freezing and snowy Edinburgh conditions to maintain their push for a second successive Women\u2019s Six Nations grand slam by beating Scotland 53-0. Toto Wolff has said his priority is to ensure Lewis Hamilton signs a new contract with Mercedes. And a 75-year-old man is training with an Egyptian third division club in a bid to become the world\u2019s oldest professional footballer. Business Our long read today is the little-reported battle for hegemony in the multbillion-pound global tampon market where the clear market leader, Tampax, owned by Procter &amp; Gamble, is under threat from upstart disruptors such as Lola, Cora and Callaly. On the markets, stocks are up again in Asia overnight despite an underwhelming return to work in China where coronavirus is still keeping millions locked in their homes.

When investment is poorly targeted, When systems aren\u2019t integrated. And when we don\u2019t learn from evidence.</p> <p>This is why clear accountability will be at the centre of a new approach to Closing the Gap, with states and territories and the commonwealth government and Indigenous Australians having clear responsibilities for delivering on targets.</p> <p>This is also why the progress we jointly make will be subject to regular independent Indigenous-led reviews.</p> <p>This is about delivering action on the ground.</p> <p>And this is about giving us all the best chance for success.</p> </blockquote> <p>This year, we will see how that is going.</p> <p>We\u2019ll have that, and whatever else the Wednesday throws at us.

rogue, leadership driven Nationals by announcing a $4m feasibility study into a 1 gigawatt power station at Collinsville, Bob Katter has said. </p> <p>The Kennedy MP believes a power station of that size doesn\u2019t stack up financially, and has called on Nationals MPs to stop using the north as a plaything for their own leadership battles.</p> <p>\u201cI am all for a single unit, 200-megawatt power station at Collinsville,\u201d Mr Katter said.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a power station there previously, so half of it is already built. The basic infrastructure is there; pylons, housing, buildings, and flooring. The construction costs would be negligible; it would create 100 jobs for the area and you would need to transport the coal from Newlands 60km away. So a 200-megawatt power station would be relatively cheap for North Qld industry and I say if you want to build it, just do it.</p> <p>\u201cGoing to a power station five times the size is just ridiculous. If we build a major coal-fired power station, the size they are talking of, we are locked into $84 a megawatt hour \u2013 Finkle is right. North Qld\u2019s businesses and industries would collapse. Alternatively the people in south-east Qld are getting their power at $28 a megawatt hour.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-11T06:04:45.130Z\">at 6.04am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e423b8f8f08e13324740f24\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-11T05:31:28.008Z\">5.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">High court decision may have created 'a new category of persons', says minister.</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It has taken a while, but the acting immigration minister, <strong>Alan Tudge</strong>,<strong> </strong>has responded to the high court decision from this morning.

If you have been breaking the law for three-and-a-half years and then you decide to breaking the law is that good for bad? It makes you look stupid and negligent.

They go along taxing and doing everything and they have been told by the science brigade in the government, the lawyers that it is October and it is OK and now it is not OK. </p> <p>The government were so greedy there they wanted to go after welfare shaming, blame the poor they are ripping things off and they didn\u2019t bother to check the detail.

These rights depend on the existence of societies with continuing systems of law and customs that pre-date the acquisition of sovereignty by the British, and the unique connection Aboriginal people have to the lands of Australia. This means they cannot be regarded as aliens.\u201d</p> <p>Ms Wright said the decision raised a number of complex issues which require careful consideration.</p> <p>The plaintiffs in the case were both born outside Australia and were not Australian citizens but they identified as Aboriginal people and were accepted as such by other members of their community.</p> <p>\u201cThe decision is not one which the high court has previously had to consider but is one of a number of questions which might naturally flow from the <em>Mabo (No 2)</em> decision in 1992,\u201d Ms Wright said.</p> <p>\u201cIt will no doubt be the subject of much scrutiny and comment in the coming weeks and months.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-11T04:26:49.080Z\">at 4.26am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e4229d08f08e13324740ee8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-11T04:14:42.111Z\">4.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Morrison </strong>calls time on question time.</p> <p>That hour was a very long month. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e42295e8f08e13324740ee6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-11T04:12:24.920Z\">4.12am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I just nearly choked on a rogue Snickers peanut and that was still more enjoyable than this question time.</p> <p>You\u2019re really not yourself when you\u2019re hangry. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e4228e48f086a28115a965a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-11T04:09:43.219Z\">4.09am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>What we learned there, in that very long nothing answer, is that the government wants to avoid answering whether or not it would provide an indemnity to any new coal-fired power plant in north Queensland.</p> <p>And that is important to note. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-11T04:13:41.475Z\">at 4.13am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e4227a98f0811db2faf54e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-11T04:08:33.434Z\">4.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mark Butler </strong>to<strong> Scott Morrison:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The proponents of the Collinsville coal power plant have said it will require a taxpayer indemnity from carbon risk, which the Australian Industry Group says could cost taxpayers $17bn.

And that review, Mr Speaker, then led to the series of options that were put before the government, which the government has agreed to support, undertaking feasibility studies to assess those options and how they can support jobs in north Queensland. </p> <p>Now, Mr Speaker, we are technology agnostics when it comes to ensuring we have reliable power generation in this country. </p> <p>We want to ensure the electricity prices come down, not go up.

That other commodities enjoy.</p> <p>This is about ensuring that populous politics and the policies of One Nation are not adopted by the Labor party. </p> <p>This reckless, reckless cruel hoax to dairy farmers that are doing it tough is something I didn\u2019t think I would see, particularly the last time that we had a floor price was for wool. It was for wool. And how did that work out? </p> <p>That ended up being a stockpile, an oversupply. </p> <p>All economists say exactly the same thing. This is a perishable product. A perishable product. In fact, I remember the member for Hunter coming into this chamber and espousing the fact that it was a Labor minister that got rid of the floor price on wool. Now they have turned around and gone with the economic advice of One Nation. That is what the economic credentials of the Australian Labor party has become, nothing more than a cruel hoax.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-11T04:08:24.045Z\">at 4.08am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e4225f78f0811db2faf54e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-11T03:56:51.523Z\">3.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>From a reader:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/psylenced/status/1227078473287491584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmyRemeikis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AmyRemeikis</a> New &#39;anti-solar&#39; panel generates electricity in the dark.

Smith was concerned that the debate was distracting from practical issues. </p> <p><strong>Scott Morrison</strong> assured MPs they would be consulted, and he indicated he wanted the process to be like the one <strong>Christian Porter</strong> has pursued in relation to religious freedom. Wyatt spoke and indicated that recent comments he had made about the timetable for a referendum had been misrepresented in the media. </p> <p>Government MPs tell me there would have been more dissent on the recognition issue today but the word had gone out to keep it nice in today\u2019s party room. Which I gather it largely was. </p> <p>People tell me <strong>Matt Canavan</strong> also made a plea that MPs allow the feasibility study for a new coal-fired power plant at Collinsville to run its course, but the intervention didn\u2019t generate any responses. </p> <p>That fight is playing out in public.

I hope we take forward significant reform because that act is not working for people who want to grow and develop this country, in particular Indigenous Australians in Cape York who want to have a sort of similar economic base that we enjoy in other parts of the country; they are locked up in ribbons of green tape at the moment that stops them from developing their own land. </p> <p>You know, 25 years ago we gave Indigenous Australians land rights back.

This is quite outrageous. Here we have, essentially, the government pretending that the world isn\u2019t changing. What we need is a transition to a clean energy economy. And the truth is that no private sector operation will touch a new coal-fired power plant with a barge pole. It can\u2019t get the proper insurance, they can\u2019t get financing. And that\u2019s because renewables are cheaper. And the risk factor with regard to investing in a new coal-fired power plant means that it simply doesn\u2019t stack up. And what we have with this $4m is essentially you can add it to the sports rorts and add it to the other areas whereby the $150m program for women\u2019s sports that didn\u2019t actually fund women\u2019s sport, as $4m just for political purposes. This is hush money. Hush money for the climate change deniers in the Coalition. I mean, Matt Canavan yesterday made the most extraordinary comment about renewables as the dole bludgers of the system. The fact is that the cheapest new energy sources in Australia today are solar and wind.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>So, let me put this to you because you don\u2019t support the feasibility study money, but your deputy, Richard Marles, struggled on Sunday to answer whether Labor would support new coal-fired power generators if they were funded by industry. You have just said what we need is a transition to a clean energy economy. If it stacked up, if industry was prepared to back it, would a Labor government support it, allow it?</p> <p><strong>Albanese: </strong>You may as well ask me, Fran, if I support unicorns.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>This is important. Because do you have a position on this?</p> <p><strong>Albanese</strong><strong>: </strong>Fran, we have a position which is that it does not stack up. It will not proceed. It doesn\u2019t stack up. No private sector operator, Fran, right now, there is nothing to stop a private sector operator establishing a coal-fired power station.</p> <p><strong> Q; </strong>I understand. But why can\u2019t you say that a Labor government would not allow any new coal-fired power stations to be built? Why can\u2019t you say that?</p> <p><strong>Albanese: </strong>Well, because it\u2019s not happening, Fran. It won\u2019t happen. We do know that, Fran, we do know that because it\u2019s reality.

Last year came with a renewed focus on a \u201crefresh\u201d \u2013 as Scott Morrison said in 2019 At Coag in December last year, all governments committed to share ownership of, and responsibility for, jointly agreed frameworks, targets and ongoing monitoring of a refreshed Closing the Gap Agenda, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples at its heart. Cag asked that this work be finalised by the middle of this year. This is a major step toward the genuine and mutually respectful formal partnership between governments and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians that will empower individuals and allow communities to thrive. Governments fail when accountabilities are unclear. When investment is poorly targeted, When systems aren\u2019t integrated. And when we don\u2019t learn from evidence. This is why clear accountability will be at the centre of a new approach to Closing the Gap, with states and territories and the commonwealth government and Indigenous Australians having clear responsibilities for delivering on targets. This is also why the progress we jointly make will be subject to regular independent Indigenous-led reviews. This is about delivering action on the ground. And this is about giving us all the best chance for success. This year, we will see how that is going. We\u2019ll have that, and whatever else the Wednesday throws at us. You get the feeling everyone in this building is a little more tired and cranky than they usually are at this point in the sitting. Tensions seem a little fraught and patience a little short, so it should be a *fun* last two days. A very big thank you to Mike Bowers for his magic, as well as Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and Katharine Murphy for all that they do.

Thank you to everyone who commented, or sent messages \u2013 I do try to get back to all of them, but some days I am more successful than others. If you have a burning enquiry, you\u2019ll find me on the socials here, and here. Have a lovely night. And please \u2013 take care of you. Backbench senator Matt Canavan is wasting no time stirring the pot from his new seat in the Senate. Just as Labor\u2019s social team have wasted no time in capturing his interjections to Simon Birmingham in the Senate in a video for their MPs to share. Over in the Senate, Larissa Waters and Janet Rice have seen a motion demanding the government produce documents between the infrastructure minister and the prime minister regarding the sports grant affair pass. The government has until tomorrow morning to produce the documents. Which, based on recent history, it will not. And it\u2019s official, official. Some other question time goodies from Mike Bowers: Someone seemed a little cranky this question time. Bob Katter, whose electorate of Kennedy sits just outside Collinsville, in the Capricornia electorate where the coal-obsessed Nationals want a coal-fired power plant has some things to say about the proposal: The federal government has bowed to the pressure of rogue, leadership driven Nationals by announcing a $4m feasibility study into a 1 gigawatt power station at Collinsville, Bob Katter has said. The Kennedy MP believes a power station of that size doesn\u2019t stack up financially, and has called on Nationals MPs to stop using the north as a plaything for their own leadership battles. \u201cI am all for a single unit, 200-megawatt power station at Collinsville,\u201d Mr Katter said. \u201cThere was a power station there previously, so half of it is already built. The basic infrastructure is there; pylons, housing, buildings, and flooring. The construction costs would be negligible; it would create 100 jobs for the area and you would need to transport the coal from Newlands 60km away. So a 200-megawatt power station would be relatively cheap for North Qld industry and I say if you want to build it, just do it. \u201cGoing to a power station five times the size is just ridiculous. If we build a major coal-fired power station, the size they are talking of, we are locked into $84 a megawatt hour \u2013 Finkle is right. North Qld\u2019s businesses and industries would collapse. Alternatively the people in south-east Qld are getting their power at $28 a megawatt hour.\u201d It has taken a while, but the acting immigration minister, Alan Tudge, has responded to the high court decision from this morning. The key line here is: \u201cOn the face of it, it has created a new category of persons; neither an Australian citizen under the Australian Citizenship Act, nor a non-citizen.\u201d Brendan Thoms has also been released from detention, following the court\u2019s 4-3 ruling. The statement: The high court delivered a significant judgment today which has implications for our migration programs. In Love v Commonwealth of Australia and Thoms v Commonwealth of Australia, the high court acknowledged that neither Mr Thoms nor Mr Love were born in Australia and neither are Australian citizens under the Australian Citizenship Act 2007. Both men are citizens of other countries and entered Australia on valid visas, which were mandatorily cancelled under the character provisions in the Migration Act 1958, due to their significant criminal histories. The Migration Act gets its head of power under s 51(xix) of the Australian constitution \u2013 the power to make laws for \u201caliens\u201d. The court held that Aboriginal Australians are not within the reach of the \u201caliens\u201d power under the constitution. This may have implications for both the operation of the Australian Citizenship Act and the Migration Act. On the face of it, it has created a new category of persons; neither an Australian citizen under the Australian Citizenship Act, nor a non-citizen. The government is currently reviewing the decision and its implications. In light of the court\u2019s ruling, Mr Thoms was this morning released from immigration detention. Mr Love had previously been released in September 2018. The Department of Home Affairs will consider the best methods to review other cases which may be impacted. On robodebt, Bill Shorten says he believes most of the $1.5bn the government raised in revenue using the scheme, should be returned to those who paid it: I mean, the reality is that if this, just without over complicating it. Robodebt was introduced by the government. They would assess whether or not a Centrelink recipient was entitled to a payment. It doesn\u2019t take into account sometimes people are unemployed and people are employed. This is farmers, students, single mums and pensioners. They have relied on a computer generated program and we have said it was an unfair program, but what I\u2019ve discovered in the last few months and now the courts have established, it is illegal. In other words, the government didn\u2019t have the power to just rely on a computer program without checking it before they sent the letter of demand out to vulnerable Australians. This is a scandal. I know we\u2019re almost so cynical about scandals, but this is a situation where the government of Australia, the biggest entity, the most powerful organisation in Australia has been unlawfully creating debts from citizens to the commonwealth which were just invalid. Why don\u2019t heads roll anymore? ... It was an unlawful scheme. It is wrong. ... If you have been breaking the law for three-and-a-half years and then you decide to breaking the law is that good for bad? It makes you look stupid and negligent. What happened on 19 November is the chief lawyer for the tax office says to the commissioner of taxation effectively it was a smoking gun document which the document didn\u2019t want us to see, but we won the vote so it went out publicly. They said, \u201cHey, the Department of Social Security\u2019s lawyers have told us we can\u2019t do this.\u201d How embarrassing for the tax office. They go along taxing and doing everything and they have been told by the science brigade in the government, the lawyers that it is October and it is OK and now it is not OK. The government were so greedy there they wanted to go after welfare shaming, blame the poor they are ripping things off and they didn\u2019t bother to check the detail. Two, they did check the detail and they just didn\u2019t care. Either way it is an incompetent scandal and in this government where blame never sticks to the elected ministers, who is in charge? Bill Shorten is now speaking to Patricia Karvelas on the ABC and he\u2019s asked about Labor\u2019s position on coal: First of all, we\u2019ve got coal fired power stations and they\u2019re part of our energy grid, but going forward, you know, I know that people like to debate the hypotheticals \u2013 the only proposal which seems to have any legs at all is that the government will underwrite a taxpayer funded coal fired power station. That\u2019s the only proposition on the table and Labor wouldn\u2019t invest any taxpayer money in that. ...It is a hypothetical and we know that one of the great stalling tactics of the climate sceptics of the government and they did it to some effect in the last election was, you know, putting up these hypothetical propositions. I agree with something that the previous interviewee, Zali Steggall said. We have got to start thinking about the future. You and I know that this government is so divided that they have got to placate the climate sceptics with taxpayer-funded coal fired power stations and that\u2019s the issue and indeed today in Question Time, poor old Minister Birmingham is up the front trying to give one answer and you hear Matt Canavan down the back interjecting and you have got George Christensen out there on contradicting other Liberals. We have this ongoing destructive debate we have seen since 2013. On the division within the Coalition on climate, Zali Steggall says: Look, I think it is distracting and I don\u2019t think it is good, but at the same time this is democracy and to expect everyone to have the same views on every issue is unrealistic, but what I want to see is every issue being given the same weight and importance. We should have a conscience vote on the climate change bill where it is a matter of principle. We should not have a situation where a couple of rogue voices hold to ransom good policy. ... I\u2019m not in the party room. I\u2019m an independent, but I certainly encourage and urge every MP that feels strongly that we need to be on a path of clear policy when it comes to climate action to speak up. You have a duty to your electorate to ensure they are safe in the future. I support those MPs that want to speak up on better action on climate change. ...I do think everyone is accountable. And at the end of the day we are all accountable to the electorate and the people who voted for us, if they don\u2019t feel we have done a great job in representing their views and concerns, it will be their decision in two years. We have that duty and responsibility. This is what we\u2019re here to do. We have a duty to make sure we\u2019re looking further afield.It can\u2019t just be about reactive policies and three-year short-termism. We need to put in place a long-term plan. So I would encourage MPs to be brave and stick to their principles and really fight for what\u2019s right. Zali Steggall tells Patricia Karvelas more than 20,000 people have signed the petition calling for her climate bill to be treated as a conscience vote. It has only been up since the weekend. Guardian Australia understands that shadow assistant treasurer Stephen Jones has made an offer for Labor to support the Coalition\u2019s proposed amnesty for employers who have failed to pay superannuation \u2013 if the Coalition agrees to an amendment putting the superannuation guarantee in the national employment standards. Super in the NES would make it a right enforceable by workers (and their unions, lawyers etc), to sue for unpaid super rather than relying on the Australian Tax Office to follow it up. Labor points to the fact an amnesty is expected to gain back just $86m of the $5.9bn unpaid superannuation bill, so wants something with more teeth. The Law Council has responded to the the high court decision today. From its statement: The Law Council of Australia has welcomed a landmark high court decision confirming that the Australian parliament cannot use the \u201caliens\u201d power to make laws for Aboriginal Australians. Law Council president, Pauline Wright, said the decision of the high court today in Love v Commonwealth of Australia; Thoms v Commonwealth of Australia flows from the Mabo (No 2) decision in 1992. This decision confirms that the question of membership of Aboriginal societies is outside of the legislative power of the Australian parliament, Ms Wright said. \u201cMany lawyers were concerned about the notion that people of Indigenous heritage could be deported both for the individuals concerned and their families,\u201d Ms Wright said. \u201cThe Law Council welcomes the decision which turned on the principle of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people having native title rights. These rights depend on the existence of societies with continuing systems of law and customs that pre-date the acquisition of sovereignty by the British, and the unique connection Aboriginal people have to the lands of Australia. This means they cannot be regarded as aliens.\u201d Ms Wright said the decision raised a number of complex issues which require careful consideration. The plaintiffs in the case were both born outside Australia and were not Australian citizens but they identified as Aboriginal people and were accepted as such by other members of their community. \u201cThe decision is not one which the high court has previously had to consider but is one of a number of questions which might naturally flow from the Mabo (No 2) decision in 1992,\u201d Ms Wright said. \u201cIt will no doubt be the subject of much scrutiny and comment in the coming weeks and months.\u201d Scott Morrison calls time on question time. That hour was a very long month. I just nearly choked on a rogue Snickers peanut and that was still more enjoyable than this question time. You\u2019re really not yourself when you\u2019re hangry. What we learned there, in that very long nothing answer, is that the government wants to avoid answering whether or not it would provide an indemnity to any new coal-fired power plant in north Queensland. And that is important to note. Mark Butler to Scott Morrison: The proponents of the Collinsville coal power plant have said it will require a taxpayer indemnity from carbon risk, which the Australian Industry Group says could cost taxpayers $17bn. Will the prime minister provide that indemnity? Morrison: Our government believes in jobs. We believe in jobs in north Queensland. We believe in jobs in northern Tasmania. We believe in jobs in Western Australia. Right across the country we believe in jobs and we believe in ensuring that manufacturing continues to be able to get access to the reliable power it needs to ensure that they can support jobs and livelihoods into the future. So before the last election our government committed to undertake to look at what the reliable power generation options were to support heavy industry in north Queensland. And that review, Mr Speaker, then led to the series of options that were put before the government, which the government has agreed to support, undertaking feasibility studies to assess those options and how they can support jobs in north Queensland. Now, Mr Speaker, we are technology agnostics when it comes to ensuring we have reliable power generation in this country. We want to ensure the electricity prices come down, not go up. We want to ensure the lights stay on, not go off. We want to ensure that industries, whether they be in north Queensland or anywhere else, that provide the livelihoods for Australians continue to be maintained and we will assess the options which support those jobs. The simple question I have for those opposite... We may never know the answer to that, because Tony Burke brings him up on relevance, which Tony Smith agrees with. George Christensen then has a go: The point of order is that the question is purely hypothetical. There is no carbon price unless they\u2019re proposing to bring in a new tax. Smith tells him the question is in order, and the prime minister didn\u2019t object to it, so the time to have done that is passed. Morrison goes on, but then Smith sits him down and tells him to get to the point. Morrison: What I was seeking to do was to say that the feasibility study of the Collinsville project was what the government has committed to undertake. The matter that the member has raised with me in this question is not currently before the government. It\u2019s not currently before the government. It is not before us. What I know, Mr Speaker, is our government will always stand up for jobs and the leader of the opposition wants to have his eachway on every bet and when it comes to the resources industry in north Queensland and the jobs of north Queensland ... he is nowhere to be found. Vince Connolly appears to still be possessed by a cut-price Toastmasters aficionado, and is losing the battle to keep the spirit contained. The power of Lizzo compels you. The power of Lizzo compels you. THE POWER OF LIZZO COMPELS YOU. Joel Fitzgibbon to Scott Morrison: Will the prime minister consider the implementation of a minimum farmgate milk price to help our desperately struggling dairy farmers? David Littleproud, and his tie, gets the nod for this one: This is nothing more than a cruel hoax. This should be above politics and cheap politicisation. In fact, the member for Hunter is not promising a minimum milk price, what he said was he\u2019d get the ACCC to investigate. Let me save the Australian taxpayer a couple of million dollars. The ACCC gave back a report that actually said it shouldn\u2019t do that but in fact we should have a dairy code of conduct, one in which this government is putting in place. One which we are making sure that there is a timeline of transition, complemented by a market mechanism that will grow like other commodities can. That other commodities enjoy. This is about ensuring that populous politics and the policies of One Nation are not adopted by the Labor party. This reckless, reckless cruel hoax to dairy farmers that are doing it tough is something I didn\u2019t think I would see, particularly the last time that we had a floor price was for wool. It was for wool. And how did that work out? That ended up being a stockpile, an oversupply. All economists say exactly the same thing. This is a perishable product. A perishable product. In fact, I remember the member for Hunter coming into this chamber and espousing the fact that it was a Labor minister that got rid of the floor price on wool. Now they have turned around and gone with the economic advice of One Nation. That is what the economic credentials of the Australian Labor party has become, nothing more than a cruel hoax. From a reader: Michael McCormack is really enjoying Keith Pitt\u2019s performance. Enough said. Phil Thompson brings Keith Pitt to the dispatch box, and the new minister turns up with a \u201cit\u2019s great to be back\u201d. Dude, it\u2019s been less than 24 hours. You didn\u2019t actually go anywhere. Scott Morrison continues: And I can confirm that the small-scale renewable energy technology package remains part of the government\u2019s policy and will continue to remain part of the government\u2019s policy, Mr Speaker. And the minister of resources \u2013 and I\u2019ve been asked about comments by the minister for resources. And I quote the minister for resources \u2013 he has a lot of common sense. He says, \u201cAs an electrical engineer, I can tell you solar panels don\u2019t work in the dark.\u201d Well, that\u2019s a simple statement of fact, Mr Speaker. We can\u2019t have the entire Australian economy relying on the weather, he says, Mr Speaker, \u201cotherwise you\u2019d only be working between 11am and 3pm in the afternoon, if it\u2019s just on solar. You won\u2019t do anything in the dark.\u201d The minister of resources is making a point which seems lost on those opposite. That if you\u2019re putting all your eggs in one basket on intermittent renewals, you cannot support jobs in heavy industry, Mr Speaker. Now, the leader of the opposition needs a GPS to explain his policy, Mr Speaker. He\u2019s got one policy on climate in north Queensland and another one down in Melbourne, Mr Speaker. Just like the member for Maribyrnong. Mr Speaker, they can\u2019t even tell you what their 2030 target is. And if you ask the deputy leader of the Labor party, normally so eloquent at this dispatch box, as he comes and gives each audition without notes, you ask him about coal, Mr Speaker, and his tongue wraps around his head! Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: I refer to his new minister for resources\u2019 statement that, and I quote, \u201cWe have got a real risk, particularly with solar panels and lithium batteries, that they could turn out to be this generation\u2019s asbestos.\u201d Does this statement reflect his government\u2019s policy? That is in relation to this story from Sarah Martin in June 2019, where Keith Pitt said: The Nationals MP Keith Pitt, who is leading the charge for the new Senate probe, said he was open to the idea that a carbon price may be necessary for nuclear power to stack up. \u201cThis is the purpose of having the select committee, I think it is past time we had the conversation with the Australian people about nuclear energy,\u201d Pitt said. He said he wanted the select committee to also look at the lifetime costs of renewable technologies in comparison to nuclear, saying solar panels only had a life expectancy of up to 20 years and there were \u201ctens of millions\u201d of them already in the system. \u201cWe have got a real risk particularly with solar panels and lithium batteries that they could turn out to be this generation\u2019s asbestos,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to look at the life cycle in its entirety and we need to have a balanced approach moving forward with energy in this country.\u201d Morrison: Under our government, we have now one of the highest rates of solar panels on people\u2019s roofs of any country in the world, Mr Speaker. And, under our government\u2019s policy, Mr Speaker, we know the future of emissions reduction and renewable energy is achieved through technology, not taxation. We know you achieve it not by putting people\u2019s electricity prices up, we know you don\u2019t put more taxes on it, and we know you don\u2019t wipe out jobs in regional Australia because of the approaches that those opposite would have applied to the Australian people, had they been elected at the last election. What we have, and the minister for resources and northern Australia is an electrical engineer, Mr Speaker. And, Mr Speaker, he could write on a postage stamp what the leader of the opposition would know about this issue compared to the new minister, Mr Speaker. Albanese jumps up on relevance. Karen Andrews is going full Karen in the house. Seriously. There is a reason we don\u2019t cover dixers. Susan Templeman to Greg Hunt: Young Australians in my electorate have faced the stress and trauma of bushfires for weeks and weeks and weeks. Yet the government\u2019s only promised one headspace satellite service for my entire electorate, and it still hasn\u2019t opened. Will the government listen to the calls from my community to upgrade the Katoomba headspace to a full centre and get it up and running immediately? Hunt: And I want to thank the member for her point. Only yesterday I met with Pat McGorry, as well as spoke with the head of headspace for Australia. We discussed a number of needs across Australia, and whilst they didn\u2019t raise this one, I can say that this is one of 30 new services which the government is funding. And, more significantly than that, we know that the Nepean Blue Mountains [primary health network] PHN is working closely with the local community to ensure that the new headspace is established. In particular, in addition, the PHN is receiving funding of $500,000 to support young people aged 12-25 in bushfire-affected communities. So this is in addition to the headspace funding. So we are supporting headspace by establishing one, we\u2019re providing, right now, at this moment, $500,000. And unfortunately that was omitted from the question, that important detail. And as well as that, and I make this commitment to the House, there is additional funding for those PHNs and those headspaces which require additional services, if demand exceeds what is provided for then we will provide that additional funding. So that will be demand-driven in the case of Katoomba. So it\u2019s one of 30 around the country. It\u2019s supplemented by $500,000, specifically for PHN. Again, I realise that was an omission from the question. And the commitment is that if demand exceeds what is currently provided, we will meet that demand in full. There is a real pattern emerging of Nationals MPs wearing green ties with dark blue suits, and really I can see why the party room is in revolt. Josh Frydenberg is yelling again, and I can\u2019t transcribe it, because GUESSWHOTHATFINANCIALGENIUSWASSIRTAXALOT is doing my head in, and really, you only get one life. Angus Taylor is allowed to take dixers again. Moving on. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg (this is really shaping into the battle between two MPs who have the leadership of their respective parties in their future sights, and have a very similar parliamentary style \u2013 although one seems to know how microphones work, which gives him a slight edge): The Reserve Bank said very low levels of investment are a very significant issue for the Australian economy. Given that business investment is now down 20% under this Liberal government, and is now at its lowest levels since the last recession three decades ago, why doesn\u2019t the government have a plan to lift business investment and get the economy going again? Frydenberg: Under the Coalition, investment outside the mining sector has increased by 34% since we came to government, Mr Speaker. Under Labor, investment outside the mining sector fell by 10% during their time in office. Now, Mr Speaker, the member for Rankin refers to the governor of the Reserve Bank. Now, the Governor of the Reserve Bank made a very interesting speech last week, and what he said was that the fundamentals of the Australian economy were, in his words, \u201cvery strong\u201d, Mr Speaker. That is what he has said. The strong fundamentals include world-class endowments of natural resources, a highly skilled and innovative workforce, an established and predictable regulatory system, sound public finances, a diverse and growing population, and being well-placed to benefit from the strong growth in Asia, not just in China, but also in the countries of Indonesia and India, Mr Speaker. So, this is what the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia said. So we have a lot to feel fortunate about. \u201cWe enjoy a set of fundamentals and a standard of living that few other countries enjoy. It\u2019s important that we do not lose sight of this.\u201d So, why is it only the Labor party who\u2019s constantly talking down the Australian economy, Mr Speaker? The governor of the Reserve Bank is saying how strong the fundamentals ... It\u2019s because the Labor party are only interested in the politics of the economy, not the jobs that the economy creates, not in boosting the livelihoods of hardworking Australians. Someone is excited about the impending royal visit: For the record, I am a republican. And also #TeamSussex It really is the Josh Frydenberg hour today. My main takeaway is that he STILL hasn\u2019t worked out how a microphone works. Sussan Ley\u2019s office has updated the threatened species list after the bushfires: The Wildlife and Threatened Species Bushfire Recovery Expert Panel has identified a provisional list of 113 animal species as the highest priorities for action to support recovery from the 2019-2020 bushfires. Among the animals identified for the most urgent management intervention are the Kangaroo Island dunnart, the northern corroboree frog, the Blue Mountains water skink and the Kangaroo Island glossy black cockatoo. The panel\u2019s detailed review overlays the status of species before the fires, the area of habitat potentially impacted by fires and the species\u2019 overall vulnerability to fire events. As the Morrison government\u2019s initial $50m wildlife and habitat recovery package flows to states, natural resource managers and zoos to help fund animal treatment, insurance populations, food drops and pest animal control, the expert panel\u2019s work is identifying species in most critical need of action for short-term protection and long-term recovery. The panel\u2019s scientific advice will help the government\u2019s on-ground delivery partners to target their efforts to where it is most needed. Thirteen birds, 19 mammals, 20 reptiles, 17 frogs, five invertebrates, 22 crayfish and 17 fish species are identified as the highest priorities for urgent management intervention over the coming weeks and months. Some species were already threatened before the fires, but this new analysis also includes other mammal, bird, reptile, frog and crayfish species that were not previously considered to be under threat. The whole list can be found, here You may be noticing a theme there. The theme being the budget surplus is probably forked, and Josh Frydenberg now has to sell a strong economy line, while walking back all the \u2018back in black\u2019 declarations and hoping that there is some massive turnaround in the next few months. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: Can the treasurer confirm that, since the election, the government has downgraded its own forecasts for growth, the IMF and OECD have downgraded Australia\u2019s growth forecasts more than other advanced economies, the Reserve Bank has downgraded its forecast for growth three times? Why has the government refused to provide support to an economy that was already floundering, even before the bushfires and coronavirus hit? Frydenberg: I can confirm to the House that the International Monetary Fund has the Australian economy growing faster this year than the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Mr Speaker. Now, the honourable member ... asked about the support that we were giving to the Australian economy. Well, I can confirm, in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which was released just prior to Christmas, we announced the bringing forward of $4.2bn in funding and spending on infrastructure, Mr Speaker. And we announced more than half a billion dollars extra for aged care, Mr Speaker. And since the election, we\u2019ve announced about $1.3bn of commitments over and above what had previously been announced in relation to responding to the drought, Mr Speaker. And those on this side of the House know that we announced a $2bn National Bushfire Recovery Fund, which was on top of the payments and allowances which we provide from the commonwealth through the states. Now that $2bn was announced without increasing taxes, Mr Speaker. ... So, the Labor party, they\u2019re in favour of higher taxes, they\u2019re in favour of fewer jobs, they\u2019re in favour of stronger unions. What we are in favour of, on this side of the House, is more jobs, lower taxes and a stronger Australian economy. Michael McCormack, resembling the word interminable, is once again pretending to be a statesman, and honestly, it would be funny if it wasn\u2019t so depressing. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: Why does the treasurer pretend that weakness in the economy is entirely due to the fires and coronavirus, when before they hit, this Liberal government was already presiding over weak and slowing growth with a one in front of it, stagnant wages growth, high underemployment, declining business investment and falling productivity, well below-average consumer and business confidence, and record net debt and record household debt? Frydenberg: I\u2019m pleased to inform the member for Rankin, and the House, that we have the first current account surplus in more than 40 years, Mr Speaker. We have the lowest welfare dependency in 30 years, Mr Speaker. We have the biggest tax cuts in more than 20 years, Mr Speaker. And we have the first balanced budget in 11 years, Mr Speaker. Now, the member for Rankin referred to the time before the coronavirus. Now, Mr Speaker, that includes the month of December. Now, that includes the job numbers for the month of December. Well, we created 29,000 new jobs, Mr Speaker. And unemployment fell to 5.1%, Mr Speaker. What was unemployment under Labor? 5.7%, Mr Speaker ... Today, employment growth is around three times what it was under Labor, and around double the OECD average, Mr Speaker. Under Labor, the gender pay gap was 17.2% and rising. Today, it\u2019s now 14%, Mr Speaker, and we\u2019re seeing that women are about $1,000 a year better off, Mr Speaker, in that particular bracket. Now, under Labor, non-mining investment was in free-fall, Mr Speaker. It fell 10% over their six years in government. Since we\u2019ve come to government, growth in non-mining investment has been over 30%, Mr Speaker. Under Labor, in the last year, 62,000 small businesses shut their door, Mr Speaker. Under us, in the last reported year, 75,000 small businesses were created, Mr Speaker. Under Labor, living standards, as measured by real net national disposable income per capita, had fallen by 1.2%. And they are 3.3% higher through the year today, Mr Speaker. And under Labor, in their last four budget outcomes, the budget deteriorated by about $80bn. Whereas our last four budgets, we\u2019ve seen improvement of over $10bn, Mr Speaker. So growth continues under the Australian economy. We\u2019ve seen more jobs created. And under Labor you\u2019ll always see higher taxes and fewer jobs. Once again \u2013 the last time Labor was in power, there was the global financial crisis. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister agree with the father of the House, the Liberal member for Menzies, who said today, and I quote, \u201cIf you can\u2019t govern yourselves, you can\u2019t govern the country\u201d? Morrison: (tl;dr \u2013 the government is united, don\u2019t you know) ... This government is united on the need to lower taxes, Mr Speaker. I can assure the House the government is united on the need to build infrastructure, as we are. That we\u2019re united on the need, Mr Speaker, to build the dams, that is climate action now, Mr Speaker. I can say, Mr Speaker, the government is united on the need to continue to expand our trade borders, as we have done, Mr Speaker, and increased the amount of trade, two-way trade that is subject to export agreements, under this government from 26% to 70%, Mr Speaker. I can say absolutely, Mr Speaker, that this government is united on the need to bring our defence force funding and spending to 2% of GDP, Mr Speaker. ... And I can tell you we\u2019re united on the need to take action on the drought and support drought funds, Mr Speaker. I can tell you that we\u2019re united on the position of having temporary exclusion orders for terrorists and mandatory sentencing for paedophiles, and cracking down on farm invaders, Mr Speaker. And I can tell the House that we are united on the need to ensure that we meet our emissions reduction targets, not by increasing taxes on people, not by putting up people\u2019s electricity prices, and not by walking away from the jobs of Australians in rural and regional areas. That\u2019s what we\u2019re united on, and we\u2019re united on what we took to the Australian people, Mr Speaker. And what we took to the Australian people was an economic plan to create jobs, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, Mr Speaker. That\u2019s what we took to the Australian people. Now, once upon a time was a Labor government that did believe in creating jobs, Mr Speaker. Given he is referring to a comment that was first made by the former prime minister, Mr Hawke, this is what the leader of the opposition used to say about the Hawke government, Mr Speaker. He said in an article quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald, it was said that the Hawke government had lost touch with people when they talk about wages, budget deficits, they talk about it like it\u2019s out of the textbooks. [They show] ... an absolute contempt for working-class people. Someone like Keating can put himself up as a possible Labor PM, but he\u2019s more comfortable mixing with millionaires and business executives than he is with working-class people. This mob are not a patch on Hawke and Keating, Mr Speaker. They have nothing in common with them. Tony Burke points out that the article quoted was from the \u201cprevious millennium\u201d but the House moves on. Scott Morrison has recently said there is no question climate change is happening and it is having an impact within his government, and that has always been the case. Cue Craig Kelly: The decision for a couple to have children is normally personal and private. However, last night the national broadcaster put to air comments of a young lady saying she was too scared to bring children into this world because of climate anxiety. Sadly, this is what hysteria, alarmism, propaganda and misinformation has brought. The facts are a child born today is 100 times safer from extreme weather than their grandparents. And this trend continues. Last year was the safest year in human history from extreme weather events. And a child born this year will enjoy a life expectancy 25 years longer than that of their grandparents. And while we worry about the coronavirus, remember our great grandparents survived world war one, lived through the Spanish flu, which killed between 50 and 100 million people, about 3% to 6% of the world\u2019s population. They then survived the horrors of the great depression and world war two. And with the very real threat of nuclear war, our parents and grandparents maintained the optimism and decided to have children, otherwise none of us would be here today. The reality is a child born today will inherit a world that is safer and more prosperous than ever before, and given the freedom and opportunity they will make it even better. First we get a statement on indulgence* on the coronavirus and how the Chinese-Australian community have handled it: Scott Morrison: We want to thank the Chinese-Australian community for the way they\u2019ve supported each other and how so many other Australians have also supported them. Those who might have been involved in self-isolation, the medical professionals who have been working within these communities. This is a very significant challenge and the Chinese-Australian community has risen to that challenge. They deserve our great appreciation and support. And going forward, Mr Speaker, I know that will continue. And the House stands as one on this matter. Anthony Albanese thanks the prime minister for his bipartisanship comments. *Albanese did a 90-second speech on this topic and Morrison\u2019s statement on indulgence followed it. Question time is about to begin. Huzzah. The treasurer and deputy leader, Josh Frydenberg, also echoed the prime minister\u2019s remarks, reflecting on John Howard\u2019s adage that the Coalition was a \u201cbroad church\u201d and joking that \u201csometimes we need to bring in the builders to build an extra pew or two\u201d. \u201cBut what unites us is bigger than what divides us,\u201d he said. He also said he was frustrated that the \u201chistoric\u201d visit on Monday by the Indonesian president was overshadowed by the Nationals\u2019 turmoil, urging colleagues to focus on the issues that mattered to voters, including economic management and lower household power prices. \u201cWe must all focus on those achievements and our policies and plans going forward and put internal issues of recent days behind us,\u201d he said. The Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, said he had received a call from Judy Brewer, the wife of former Nationals leader Tim Fischer, who had called him after he completed a trek in Tumbarumba. McCormack said Brewer had relayed her view that Fischer \u201cwould want us all to stand firm together at present\u201d to deliver on the government\u2019s commitment to deliver lower taxes and to help those affected by fire and drought. Following a robust discussion in last week\u2019s party room meeting over climate change, the former resources minister, Matt Canavan, spoke about the importance of delivering on the promise of a feasibility study into the Collinsville coal-fired power station, saying it was an election commitment that had boosted the vote in Michelle Landry\u2019s seat of Capricornia. Canavan said the Collinsville community had rewarded Landry with a 48% primary vote \u201cdespite it being historically a strong Labor community and some of that was to do with the promises being made\u201d. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has lectured MPs about the importance of unity, urging them to focus on the Australian people and move past the Coalition\u2019s \u201cdifficult period\u201d of recent months. In a joint party room meeting of MPs on Tuesday, Morrison urged his squabbling MPs to remember that they came to Canberra as members of the government \u201cteam\u201d, saying there were only \u201ctwo party rooms in this building\u201d: that of the government and that of the opposition. \u201cWhen we walk through the doors of the cabinet room we take on serious responsibilities. Equally when we walk through the doors of the government party room we also take on serious responsibilities and we must do so as a government,\u201d he said, according to a spokesman. \u201cThat\u2019s the argument we took the last election: highlighting local plans and capabilities of local MPs, but also doing so very much as a member of the government and the team.\u201d Morrison said that the Australian people had endorsed MPs as a \u201cgovernment\u201d and that no individual was above that. \u201cWe are the government, I am not, but we are. No individual is. We are together the government. \u201cWe know that there are many parties in this government, the Liberal party, the National party, the CLP, the LNP, but the contract we have with the Australian people is when we are walking through these doors is to be the government, their government. \u201cThe people supported us and we owe them to continue to deliver for them, to deliver what we promised \u2013 in terms of tax relief, economic growth and other policies, including stable government that is focused on them. That is the contract we have with the Australian people.\u201d Morrison urged MPs to focus on their constituents when they returned to their electorates at the end of the week. \u201dFocus on the people who put us here \u2013 think of them because when they are foremost in our minds, as they are in mine, we do our best for them,\u201d Morrison said. On those Australians who are in quarantine on Christmas Island, Greg Hunt laid out this timetable for their departure: The respective dates for the quarantine for Christmas Island ending February 17 for the first humanitarian flight, and February 19 for those that came from New Zealand via Air New Zealand, and we thank the New Zealanders. They will be tested before they leave and if health authorities believe that additional testing is required, then they\u2019ll do that. But they\u2019ll be able to go home, subject to having a very clear process of having been checked and declared disease-free. If the chief medical officer has had to warn people to stop being xenophobic, you know it is bad. He\u2019s not alone. George Christensen also had to issue a plea to stop on his Facebook page, where he reported a constituent had presented to hospital concerned they had caught coronavirus because they had eaten Chinese food. Christensen was worried about the impacts of the scare on north Queensland tourism. Strange bedfellows, yes, but irrational public panics tends to create those. Professor Murphy continued: We\u2019re talking about a relatively small number of people just because of where they\u2019ve been, not who they are. There is no community transmission of this virus in Australia. We have not seen any case of sustained transmission at all in this country. There is no reason for people to be wearing masks. There\u2019s no reason for people to avoid anybody of any particular background or appearance. I want to reassure the community. As the minister said, our quarantine is working extremely well at the moment, and we\u2019re very, very pleased that the two facilities have had excellent medical support, and we\u2019re obviously actively screening everybody on a regular basis. So, the situation is clearly evolving in China. There are still more and more cases in Hubei, but we are watching that very closely and there is smaller growth outside of that province. The international scene has been closely watched, and at the moment, our containment strategies are effective and do seem to be working in Australia. In a press conference with Greg Hunt, updating the nation on coronavirus (five cases have recovered), Prof Brendan Murphy, the chief medical officer, has warned against xenophobia when discussing the health pandemic. We\u2019ve still only got 15 cases in Australia and all are clinically in good condition. They\u2019re all in stable condition. Five have recovered. This is consistent with the exported cases around the world, the 455 cases. There have been some severe cases in some countries, but they\u2019re very small numbers, and only two deaths in the exported cases. Which is a positive. But, as we know, more than 2% of the cases in Hubei province have been reported as having an unfortunately fatal outcome. So we are still evaluating the severity of this virus, and there\u2019s still a lot more information that we need to know. But as the minister says, our strategies have been there, saying that we\u2019ve isolated the cases, all of whom had come from Hubei province, or in one case, had contact with someone who was a confirmed case from Hubei province. We have not yet seen anyone without contact from Hubei province or been from Hubei province detected in Australia. As the minister said also, our risk population is people who have come from China from February 1. Not people of Chinese background. People who have come from China, whatever their background is. And we are very concerned about xenophobia and any sort of racial profiling which is completely abhorrent. Look, there is a lot to unpack there. As always. Bottom line though is the government should probably stop trying to deport Australians. And just on the \u201chOw mUcH bLOOd dO YoU haVe\u201d ridiculous argument a lot of white people like to throw at Indigenous people, have a look at any St Paddy\u2019s day celebration, where people whose great-great-great-grandmother\u2019s cousin\u2019s sister\u2019s best friend\u2019s neighbour was Irish are suddenly running around with a \u2018kiss me, I\u2019m Irish shirt\u2019. Stop it. It\u2019s a shit argument. Pauline Hanson responded to the high court decision in the most Pauline Hanson way possible: They are the native title holders of the land, well they are the traditional owners, I understand that, native title holders, because I was born here, this is my land as much as any Aboriginal, they are the true traditional owners and they like to be acknowledged as that, so, if you are truly Aboriginal. But I don\u2019t see why they shouldn\u2019t have to get a passport, because a lot of people now, how much Indigenous blood do they have, so I think this should be, everybody should be treated equally, in this land, whether you are Aboriginal or a migrant, if you require a passport, everyone must apply for a passport. Labor\u2019s Mark Butler has issued a statement on Zali Steggall\u2019s and the crossbench climate action bill. He says Labor wants to look at it and work on it with Steggall, but for it to go anywhere the government has to bring it on for debate (which it has a history of not doing): Labor welcomes any constructive effort to progress climate action and looks forward to continuing to engage with Zali Steggall about her climate change bill. For Zali Steggall\u2019s bill to be considered, Scott Morrison would need to allow a full debate in the parliament. When Labor moved a motion to declare a climate emergency last October, Scott Morrison wouldn\u2019t allow the question to be debated at all. Scott Morrison and his divided government have never taken action on climate change seriously. The latest official government emissions data confirms Australia will not meet our Kyoto commitment to cut emissions by 5% by 2020. In fact, emissions reduction will amount to little more than a rounding error of 0.3%, putting the lie to the prime minister\u2019s claim that we are meeting and beating our international commitments. The government\u2019s own data suggests emissions will come down during the next 10 years by only less than 5%. At that rate, it will take Australia 230 years to reach net zero emissions, rather than the 30 years scientists tell us is necessary. No major explosions in today\u2019s Coalition party room meeting, but there were rumblings about constitutional recognition. The Liberal senator James McGrath sought assurances that the party room and the appropriate backbench committees would be consulted before the government reached a final landing on the recognition of Indigenous people. (This is a not very subtle code that a number of MPs are unhappy with the way Ken Wyatt, the responsible minister, is handling this particular issue.) I gather two other senators voiced objections: Amanda Stoker and Dean Smith. According to colleagues, Stoker expressed opposition to recognition per se. Smith was concerned that the debate was distracting from practical issues. Scott Morrison assured MPs they would be consulted, and he indicated he wanted the process to be like the one Christian Porter has pursued in relation to religious freedom. Wyatt spoke and indicated that recent comments he had made about the timetable for a referendum had been misrepresented in the media. Government MPs tell me there would have been more dissent on the recognition issue today but the word had gone out to keep it nice in today\u2019s party room. Which I gather it largely was. People tell me Matt Canavan also made a plea that MPs allow the feasibility study for a new coal-fired power plant at Collinsville to run its course, but the intervention didn\u2019t generate any responses. That fight is playing out in public. Possibly there was no appetite to bring it into closer quarters. Christian Porter, after admitting the government missed its own deadline on putting forward its own legislation, has said the government will release its own (some argue less effective) federal integrity body, when its ready. But don\u2019t expect that any time soon. Adam Bandt lost 72 to 70 to have the issue dealt with now, so the House is voting on Darren Chester\u2019s motion that it be dealt with in the next sitting. Based on those numbers, that is what will happen. Darren Chester is asking the House to move this to the next sitting. Adam Bandt wants it dealt with now. The chamber divides. Shorter Coalition party room meeting message from Josh Frydenberg: I wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school ... I wish I could bake a cake filled with rainbows and smiles and everyone would eat and be happy ... No one was actually saying this, but it never hurts to learn more about parliamentary practices Meanwhile, in the joint party room, it is situation normal: people getting upset about coal, while others got upset that people were upset about coal. The government is doing its best to try to quell the latest climate squabble, but the breakout group doesn\u2019t want to calm down. And its members are feeling a bit bolshie. So good times keep on keeping on. Anthony Albanese has addressed caucus this morning, talking about the Coalition\u2019s internal tensions after yesterday\u2019s Nationals\u2019 boilover. \u201cIf you look like you are more concerned about yourself than the country then the country will punish you,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cOur team is united, coherent and determined. They are a mess. If you can\u2019t govern yourself, you can\u2019t govern the country.\u201d He criticised Morrison\u2019s response to the parliamentary defeat, accusing the prime minister of trying to spin the tactical defeat that saw renegade MP Llew O\u2019Brien elevated to the role of deputy speaker against the will of the government. \u201cWhen you have been defeated like that you take it on the chin and move on. To try to spin it as a win says everything about Scott Morrison. It was all about spin and marketing, not a plan. \u201cScott Morrison has no plan for wages growth, no plan for productivity, no plan for aged care, no plan for education outcomes that are falling, no plan for broadband, no plan for climate change and no plan for energy.\u201d On climate change policy, Albanese said the \u201ctest\u201d for the government was whether it allowed the Collinsville coal-fired power station to go ahead with government assistance. \u201cThe last new coal-fired power station came into operation in 2007. The test for the government when they talk about building Collinsville is whether it is going ahead. The proponents say it can only go ahead with a massive indemnity against climate risk,\u201d he said. As for Labor\u2019s climate policy, Albanese said the party did not need \u201cto fit the timetable of the government or of commentators\u201d, saying he would be focused on the election cycle. \u201dOur plan will need to focus on jobs, lower emissions and cheaper prices,\u201d he said. It\u2019s been confirmed \u2013 Scott Morrison has not yet issued an invitation to Wills and Kate, but he will. So expect the royal tour soon. The bells are ringing. What will today bring? Who knows. That\u2019s the 2020 parliament for you. The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age are reporting Scott Morrison is about to issue an invitation to the duke and duchess of Cambridge to visit Australia so they can tour bushfire regions. From Bevan Shields\u2019s report: \u201cPrince William and his wife Catherine are set to visit bushfire-ravaged Australian coastal towns during a special royal visit that will spur more international financial support for survivors and volunteer firefighters. \u201cPreliminary negotiations between the Morrison government and Kensington Palace \u2013 the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s official household \u2013 have been under way for weeks and Prime Minister Scott Morrison is expected this week to issue the formal invitation needed to give the tour the go ahead.\u201d Back on the Labor staffer meeting: while the rumour Sharon McCrohan would be brought back is floating around, I am being told there is \u201czero chance\u201d she\u2019ll be returning to the show. So make of that what you will. Parliament will start at midday, for those wondering why it is so quiet. Daniel Love\u2019s lawyer is speaking outside the high court on the decision Indigenous Australians cannot be deported, regardless of where they were born: Maurice Blackburn Lawyers\u2019 senior associate Claire Gibbs: This is relevant, particularly to Aboriginal Australians, regardless of where they\u2019re born. We know it\u2019s a relatively small but vulnerable category of Australians, so yes, you know, it\u2019s potentially relevant to others and it\u2019s important. Today marks a day where we have permanent protection for Aboriginal Australians from deportation so it\u2019s very important. I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to talk to Daniel or his family this morning following the decision, but I can tell you during the course of these claims, it has, as I mentioned before, had a lot of mental health impact on him. This decision will come as an incredible relief, not just to him, but to his family, who are Aboriginal. They will all have protection from deportation as a result of this decision. The party room meetings are breaking up. We\u2019ll soon have updates on went on there. Mike Bowers was out the front of parliament this morning where bushfire survivors are holding a protest, asking politicians to cut ties with the coal lobby. They brought debris from what was left of their homes. Pacific Islanders were also protesting, highlighting the dangers their homelands face from a warming planet. Just back on Paul\u2019s post for a moment, you can read the whole summary of that court decision here. While the MPs are meeting, so are their staff. In the opposition staff meeting, a former Victorian premier, Steve Bracks, has been brought in to give \u201ca morale-boosting speech\u201d to the troops. There are also rumours that Labor wants to bring back Sharon McCrohan, who was Bracks\u2019 comms chief and who also came in late during Bill Shorten\u2019s campaign. Bracks has told the staff that to win government from opposition, \u2018You have to let people know where you stand.\u2019 That has raised a few eyebrows, because so far, under Anthony Albanese\u2019s leadership, ministers and MPs have been told to keep their positions fairly close to their chest. Albanese wants the focus on the government, not the opposition, after the release of Labor\u2019s policies early in the last term put the spotlight on what Labor would do, rather than what the government was doing. But with a new year, shadow ministers are starting to get itchy to announce policy positions \u2013 something I understand won\u2019t be happening for a little while longer. Bracks has also told the group to keep reminding people Albanese is \u201cgenuine\u201d. Looks like those focus groups are getting interesting. The high court has decided that Aboriginal Australians are not aliens for the purpose of the constitution, a major defeat for the deportation powers of Peter Dutton\u2019s home affairs department and a significant development in the rights of Indigenous Australians. In four-to-three split decision the high court ruled on Tuesday that Aboriginals cannot be aliens, giving them a special status in Australian constitutional law likely to have ramifications far beyond existing native title law. The majority of the high court ruled that Brendan Thoms was not an alien and the commonwealth therefore did not have power to order his deportation. The court was not able to decide if the second plaintiff, Daniel Love, is Aboriginal Australian, requiring a further hearing to establish the facts. The plaintiffs were born in Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, each with one Aboriginal parent, and face deportation due to laws which allow the cancellation of visas on character grounds. Lawyers for the two Indigenous men, backed up by the state of Victoria, argued the Australian government cannot deport Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders even though they do not hold Australian citizenship because the constitutional definition of \u201calien\u201d can\u2019t be set by the government of the day through citizenship law. Paul Karp is in the high court where a pretty major decision has been handed down about whether or not Indigenous Australians can be considered \u2018aliens\u2019 and deported, if they were not born in Australia. The federal government is attempting to deport Daniel Love and Brendan Thoms, who were born abroad, following criminal convictions. Both men identify as Indigenous, and their case went to the high court, to determine whether they could be considered \u2018aliens\u2019 under immigration law. Matt Canavan, who has been in front of more cameras this morning than I have taken Panadol, told Laura Jayes on Sky this morning that he will be concentrating on defending the poor, besmirched resources industry now that he is on the backbench and has more time to be Matt Canavan. Having made the mining industry sound like a Dickensian orphan, Jayes asks Canavan who exactly is attacking the industry: Well, look, it\u2019s mainly, it\u2019s these well-financed environmental organisations \u2013 there is this creeping environmentalism coming over our society, and we all want to balance the environment, but some of the restrictions and regulations placed on people on the land, who actually live in the environment, make no sense, and that\u2019s what needs to be pulled back on.\u201d Because apparently people who care about the environment do not live in the environment, or something. (Side note: creeping environmentalism sounds like something a Dickens character would say, so I am glad he is remaining on theme at least.) Canavan continued, all but declaring himself to be the Batman to the \u201c\u2018creeping environmentalism\u201d poison ivy: Now, could the government be doing more on this? Absolutely we could.\u201d (Like the Coalition hasn\u2019t been in power since 2013 and he hasn\u2019t been a minister in that government for a very big chunk of that time, with the power to do something about those very things.) That\u2019s what I\u2019ll be pushing for. But I expect many, many at this stage, to be disagreeing with government policy. All of these things are more about direction and, and, and speed. And so that\u2019s what I hope to do, is try and speed those things up.\u201d From the backbench. In terms of what well, we\u2019ve got a review of the federal environmental law, the EPBC act, this year. I hope we take forward significant reform because that act is not working for people who want to grow and develop this country, in particular Indigenous Australians in Cape York who want to have a sort of similar economic base that we enjoy in other parts of the country; they are locked up in ribbons of green tape at the moment that stops them from developing their own land. You know, 25 years ago we gave Indigenous Australians land rights back. We gave them native title back and we spent the next 25 years slowly taking it away from them again, and just giving it to bureaucrats in departments of environments around the country. On ABC RN with Fran Kelly this morning, Anthony Albanese continued cleaning up Labor\u2019s position on coal after his deputy squibbed it on Insiders on Sunday: Q: Should the government be funding a feasibility study for new coal-fired power stations? Albanese: No. Exclamation mark. This is quite outrageous. Here we have, essentially, the government pretending that the world isn\u2019t changing. What we need is a transition to a clean energy economy. And the truth is that no private sector operation will touch a new coal-fired power plant with a barge pole. It can\u2019t get the proper insurance, they can\u2019t get financing. And that\u2019s because renewables are cheaper. And the risk factor with regard to investing in a new coal-fired power plant means that it simply doesn\u2019t stack up. And what we have with this $4m is essentially you can add it to the sports rorts and add it to the other areas whereby the $150m program for women\u2019s sports that didn\u2019t actually fund women\u2019s sport, as $4m just for political purposes. This is hush money. Hush money for the climate change deniers in the Coalition. I mean, Matt Canavan yesterday made the most extraordinary comment about renewables as the dole bludgers of the system. The fact is that the cheapest new energy sources in Australia today are solar and wind. Q: So, let me put this to you because you don\u2019t support the feasibility study money, but your deputy, Richard Marles, struggled on Sunday to answer whether Labor would support new coal-fired power generators if they were funded by industry. You have just said what we need is a transition to a clean energy economy. If it stacked up, if industry was prepared to back it, would a Labor government support it, allow it? Albanese: You may as well ask me, Fran, if I support unicorns. Q: This is important. Because do you have a position on this? Albanese: Fran, we have a position which is that it does not stack up. It will not proceed. It doesn\u2019t stack up. No private sector operator, Fran, right now, there is nothing to stop a private sector operator establishing a coal-fired power station. Q; I understand. But why can\u2019t you say that a Labor government would not allow any new coal-fired power stations to be built? Why can\u2019t you say that? Albanese: Well, because it\u2019s not happening, Fran. It won\u2019t happen. We do know that, Fran, we do know that because it\u2019s reality. It\u2019s like saying, \u201cDo you know if the sun will come up this morning.\u201d Liberal senator James Paterson had a chat to Sky News this morning about the Nationals. Here is what he had to say about some of his colleagues: I think we\u2019re all responsible for our own behaviour in politics. There\u2019s a lot of disappointments in politics. Everybody has ambition. It\u2019s not always realised or at least not realised in the timeline that you might want it to. But that doesn\u2019t give you licence to misbehave and act out. And it\u2019s certainly not an excuse to say that you [or] your friends were passed over for promotion. Last night a motion put forward by Larissa Waters \u2013 that the House of Representatives bring about a vote on the Greens national integrity commission bill \u2013 passed the Senate: (1) That the Senate notes that: (a) the Senate passed the Australian Greens\u2019 national integrity commission bill 2018 (No 2) on 9 September 2019 to establish a federal corruption watchdog with broad remit to investigate allegations of corruption and misconduct, and to ensure strong, independent oversight of the actions of parliamentarians; and (b) public consultation on the commonwealth integrity commission model proposed by the government ended more than one year ago, but the government has yet to introduce legislation to establish an integrity commission. (2) That the Senate calls on the federal government to bring on the Australian Greens\u2019 national integrity commission bill 2019 in the House of Representatives for a vote in the February 2020 sittings. (3) That this resolution be sent to the House of Representatives for concurrence. That should hit the House around midday. And it\u2019s the first opportunity Llew O\u2019Brien will have to cross the floor. One of his big bugbears has been the government\u2019s proposed national integrity commission not being strong enough. Let the games begin. This happened late yesterday, but is worth repeating: The barrister and former inspector general of intelligence and security, Bret Walker, gave some very interesting evidence at the Senate inquiry into press freedom last night. Walker called for a root and branch reform of disclosure laws, including a general reversal of the presumption against disclosure of governmental matters and a loosening of freedom of information laws. He argued that because government is not done for profit and it has no commercial rivals, it is absurd to apply the same levels of secrecy in government as occurs in the commercial world. The obvious exception is national security. But Walker criticised the government for an overly expansive definition that encompasses relations with foreign governments and harm to the economy. \u201cWe\u2019re not a free and confident people if we can\u2019 t have a vociferous debate, for example, about Australia\u2019s dealings with a notoriously tyrannical regime,\u201d he said. \u201c[At present] national security catches too much.\u201d Walker proposed: Dedicated units within government departments and agencies to ensure serious consideration of whistleblower complaints. A positive duty of public servants to protect whistleblowers who go through the correct internal channels, rather than just a duty not to do them harm. Citizens and bloggers should receive the same sorts of protection for publishing governmental information as journalists \u2013 provided they do the right thing by checking with agencies what information is genuinely secret before doing so. On why bloggers deserve protection, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s the first or only time they publish ... they should have the same protection [as journalists]. The idea that people\u2019s right to know should be filtered first by government and then an intermediary class of journalist I find really offensive ... I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to give a monopoly to [officially approved] journalists. I don\u2019t want the government to be giving badges to people, here are our licensed critics \u2013 that\u2019s nonsense.\u201d But Walker also had harsh words for public servants who are paid to keep genuinely classified material confidential and nevertheless leak, suggesting this amounted to \u201cdisreputable disloyalty\u201d and warning \u201cif you take your money for the promise of confidentiality, you should follow [that promise]\u201d. Anthony Albanese also tried to clean up Richard Marles\u2019s trainwreck of an interview on Insiders on Sunday by laying out Labor\u2019s position on coal, by discussing the problems with the Collinsville coal-fired power station $4m feasibility study. Well the truth is that we have a market-based economy. And what we see is that they\u2019re not just climate sceptics, they are market sceptics. And what we see with this $4m subsidy is taxpayers\u2019 right throughout Australia, including in regional Australia, paying for something. $4m is a lot of money for a feasibility study. I\u2019ve been the infrastructure minister. That is an extraordinary amount of money. That is $4m of hush money for the climate change deniers in the Coalition. Anthony Albanese stopped by the media pack outside the doors this morning to lay out his theme of the day. Spoiler: it\u2019s about the Nationals. Well we have seen this movie of what happens when a party is divided. When a government\u2019s divided. We know how it ends. It ends badly for the government. And this government are incapable of putting themselves together. This is a government that has had three prime ministers. That\u2019s had three deputy prime ministers. Has had countless number of defence ministers, countless number of ministers in so many portfolios. I give Scott Morrison credit when he was taking President Widodo around his frontbench. He at least remembered all of their names which is a real challenge. It\u2019s a challenge for us to look across the other side and work out who\u2019s on the frontbench. It\u2019s Tuesday, which means it is party room day, and boy oh boy I would love to be a fly on the Akubra I assume hangs on the wall of the Nationals\u2019 party room. After Labor humiliated the government on Monday by nominating rebel LNP MP Llew O\u2019Brien for the deputy Speaker role over Michael McCormack\u2019s pick of Damian Drum \u2013 and won, with the help of at least five rogue government MPs (Ken O\u2019Dowd, Barnaby Joyce and O\u2019Brien himself, with the other two not confirmed, but very, very easy to guess) \u2013 McCormack and Scott Morrison are struggling to pretend everything is just bibbity boppity boo in the junior Coalition partner. O\u2019Brien remains in the government but will sit as an LNP MP, not a National. He wants the Queenslanders to sit as LNP MPs across the board. The Greatest Nation on Earth formally married the Coalition partners under Lawrence Springborg\u2019s direction a few years ago, and every now and then one of them gets shirty at either the Liberal party or National party federally and starts making noises about a separate party room. Nothing ever comes of it, but that doesn\u2019t mean they stop. So O\u2019Brien won\u2019t be in the party room today when the Nationals work out what the hell happened over the past 24 hours. O\u2019Dowd, who admitted on national TV he not only voted for O\u2019Brien against the party\u2019s wishes, he was also going to run himself, may have some explaining to do, but his job as deputy Nationals whip \u2013 the guy who runs around making sure the Nats keep toeing the party line \u2013 is allegedly safe: A ballot in the House of Representatives is a free and fair vote. Mr O\u2019Dowd is entitled to his democratic right as a member of parliament. This was not a vote on government legislation or a matter of supply for the Australian government and both candidates in the ballot are members of the government,\u201d a spokeswoman for McCormack said. McCormack tried to shrug it all off as \u201cthat\u2019s democracy\u201d. But Drum, who missed out on the $42,000 pay rise, extra staffer and the prestige of overseeing the federation chamber (where speeches go to die) may actually crack his teeth if he keeps gritting them so hard through his fake smile. Well, I just didn\u2019t think ... anyway, I was pretty surprised,\u201d he told reporters as he got in his comcar overnight. We\u2019ll cover all of that and more as the sitting week rolls on. You have Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin along for the ride. I am going to hunt down my second coffee, so that\u2019s a win. Ready? Let\u2019s get in to it.",

Elsewhere, \u201cindependent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable\u201d because of the substantial movement of people who were infected but had not yet developed symptoms, and the absence of public health measures to stop the spread.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/01/interactive-coronavirus-tracker\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Epidemiologists and modellers were trying to figure out what was likely to happen, said Leung. \u201cIs 60-80% of the world\u2019s population going to get infected? Maybe not. Maybe this will come in waves. Maybe the virus is going to attenuate its lethality because it certainly doesn\u2019t help it if it kills everybody in its path, because it will get killed as well,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Experts also need to know whether the restrictions in the centre of Wuhan and other cities have reduced infections. \u201cHave these massive public health interventions, social distancing, and mobility restrictions worked in China?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf so, how can we roll them out, or is it not possible?\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/what-is-coronavirus-how-worried-symptoms-how-spread\">What is coronavirus and how worried should we be?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There would be difficulties. \u201cLet\u2019s assume that they have worked.

And if you remove those [restrictions], then is it all going to come right back and rage again?

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus epidemic could spread to about two-thirds of the world\u2019s population if it cannot be controlled, according to Hong Kong\u2019s leading public health epidemiologist. His warning came after the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said recent cases of coronavirus patients who had never visited China could be the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d. Prof Gabriel Leung, the chair of public health medicine at Hong Kong University, said the overriding question was to figure out the size and shape of the iceberg. Most experts thought that each person infected would go on to transmit the virus to about 2.5 other people. That gave an \u201cattack rate\u201d of 60-80%. \u201cSixty per cent of the world\u2019s population is an awfully big number,\u201d Leung told the Guardian in London, en route to an expert meeting at the WHO in Geneva on Tuesday. Even if the general fatality rate is as low as 1%, which Leung thinks is possible once milder cases are taken into account, the death toll would be massive. He will tell the WHO meeting that the main issue is the scale of the growing worldwide epidemic and the second priority is to find out whether the drastic measures taken by China to prevent the spread have worked \u2013 because if so, other countries should think about adopting them. The Geneva meeting brings together more than 400 researchers and national authorities, including some participating by video conference from mainland China and Taiwan. \u201cWith 99% of cases in China, this remains very much an emergency for that country, but one that holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world,\u201d the WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in his opening remarks. To date China has reported 42,708 confirmed cases, including 1,017 deaths, Tedros said. Leung \u2013 one of the world\u2019s experts on coronavirus epidemics, who played a major role in the Sars outbreak in 2002-03 \u2013 works closely with other leading scientists such as counterparts at Imperial College London and Oxford University. At the end of January, he warned in a paper in the Lancet that outbreaks were likely to be \u201cgrowing exponentially\u201d in cities in China, lagging just one to two weeks behind Wuhan. Elsewhere, \u201cindependent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable\u201d because of the substantial movement of people who were infected but had not yet developed symptoms, and the absence of public health measures to stop the spread. Epidemiologists and modellers were trying to figure out what was likely to happen, said Leung. \u201cIs 60-80% of the world\u2019s population going to get infected? Maybe not. Maybe this will come in waves. Maybe the virus is going to attenuate its lethality because it certainly doesn\u2019t help it if it kills everybody in its path, because it will get killed as well,\u201d he said. Experts also need to know whether the restrictions in the centre of Wuhan and other cities have reduced infections. \u201cHave these massive public health interventions, social distancing, and mobility restrictions worked in China?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf so, how can we roll them out, or is it not possible?\u201d There would be difficulties. \u201cLet\u2019s assume that they have worked. But how long can you close schools for? How long can you lock down an entire city for? How long can you keep people away from shopping malls? And if you remove those [restrictions], then is it all going to come right back and rage again? So those are very real questions,\u201d he said. If China\u2019s lockdown has not worked, there is another unpalatable truth to face: that the coronavirus might not be possible to contain. Then the world will have to switch tracks: instead of trying to contain the virus, it will have to work to mitigate its effects. For now, containment measures are essential. Leung said the period of time when people were infected but showed no symptoms remained a huge problem. Quarantine was necessary, but to ensure people were not still carrying the virus when they left, everybody should ideally be tested every couple of days. If anyone within a quarantine camp or on a stricken cruise ship tested positive, the clock should be reset to 14 days more for all the others. Some countries at risk because of the movement of people to and from China have taken precautions.

      "bodyText": "China has fired two senior officials in Hubei, the highest-ranking yet to be sacked, as Beijing asserts its control after the deadly coronavirus outbreak \u2013 with local officials appearing to be bearing the blame. State media said that Zhang Jin, the Communist party chief of the health commission in hardest-hit Hubei province, and Liu Yingzi, its director, were both fired. They will be replaced by a national-level official, Wang Hesheng, the deputy director of China\u2019s national health commission. The sackings come days after a wave of public anger aimed at the government after the death of a Wuhan doctor who was punished for trying to warn friends and colleagues about the new virus. Li Wenliang, who succumbed to the virus last week, has become a martyr for many and a lightning rod for criticism of the Chinese state\u2019s instinct to suppress information. Chinese authorities appear to be ramping up a campaign of punishing local officials for the epidemic, which has now claimed more than 1,000 lives. Earlier this month, 337 officials in Hubei were \u201cpenalised\u201d, including six officials who were fired for \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d. Officials from the Red Cross society in Hubei were also removed. A team from China\u2019s anti-corruption agency, the national supervisory commission, has been sent to Hubei to investigate Li\u2019s death. Focusing on the wrongdoing of local authorities, more often the target of public anger than central officials, also helps deflect criticism from the country\u2019s top leaders, including Xi Jinping. Xi\u2019s disappearance from public view for several weeks had prompted derision online following his pledges in January that he was \u201cpersonally\u201d overseeing the government\u2019s response. But on Tuesday, photos of Xi visiting a neighbourhood and hospital in Beijing where he held a video call with health workers in Wuhan filled the front page of the official People\u2019s Daily. Xi promised the country would win the \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d against the virus. The national health commission on Tuesday reported 108 new deaths from the virus, bringing the total number to 1,016. Officials reported 2,478 new cases of infection on Monday, down from 3,062 the day before, prompting some optimism that measures to contain the virus may be working after more than 40,000 people in China have been infected. Zhong Nanshan, an epidemiologist and top adviser, said in an interview with Reuters that the outbreak may peak in mid to late February before reaching a plateau and eventually easing. Zhong said that in some provinces, the number of new cases had already declined. Speaking at the beginning of a two-day World Health Organization meeting in Geneva, the WHO director, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the outbreak still posed a serious threat globally. \u201cWith 99% of cases in China, this remains very much an emergency for that country, but one that holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world,\u201d he said. Gabriel Leung, the chair of public health medicine at Hong Kong University and a leading epidemiologist who worked extensively on Sars, told the Guardian the virus could spread to about two-thirds of the world\u2019s population if it were not controlled. There have been more than 300 cases in 24 other countries and territories as well as two deaths outside of mainland China: one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines. In Hong Kong, dozens of residents were evacuated from an apartment building on Tuesday after a 62-year-old woman living 10 floors above another resident, previously diagnosed, was found to have the virus. On Tuesday, Taiwan, which has already blocked visitors from China, Hong Kong and Macau, issued a travel warning advising citizens not to visit Hong Kong or Macau. Vietnam and Thailand each confirmed another case of the virus. Thailand, which has now recorded 33 cases of the coronavirus, on Tuesday blocked the entry of a Holland America cruise ship that has been turned away by several countries since it departed from Hong Kong earlier this month with more than 2,200 passengers.",

The patient arrived last week on a flight carrying US citizens evacuated from China and was one of four admitted to UC San Diego and held in isolation. After authorities said on Sunday tests on the four people for coronavirus came back negative, the individual was discharged to quarantine quarters at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.

      "bodyText": "The parents of an 18-month old Australian toddler stranded in the Hubei province of China have pleaded with the federal government to evacuate her from the centre of the new coronavirus outbreak. So far more than 500 Australians have been airlifted out of the city of Wuhan by two Australian-operated flights that prioritised the \u201cisolated and vulnerable\u201d, including the young and elderly. But Chloe Luo, an Australian citizen, remains in the neighbouring city of Suizhou \u2013 which has the world\u2019s fourth-highest number of coronavirus cases, and has been under lockdown since 24 January. The toddler from Canberra was being looked after by her grandmother, but last week her grandmother was hospitalised with a cold, unrelated to coronavirus, leaving Chloe with her great-aunt. Her parents, Yufei Luo and Yi Zhao, who live in the Canberra suburb of Ngunnawal, said they were willing to fly into Suizhou, which is three hours drive from Wuhan, to be with Chloe and bring her back home. But the Australian government has said it is not planning on organising a third evacuation flight for citizens remaining in Wuhan and Hubei. Yufei told Guardian Australia they decided in early January that Chloe should visit China because they were worried that bushfire smoke in Canberra was damaging her health. \u201cWe thought to send her back just for a couple of weeks, just a month, until the smoke was gone,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe tried to give her better conditions. Then everything happened in Wuhan.\u201d On 1 January, Canberra\u2019s air quality reached 1296 micrograms of PM2.5 particles per cubic metre, compared with 41 micrograms in Beijing. Since 24 January, people have not been allowed to move through the Hubei province without authorisation, and all public transport has been suspended. Other Australians citizens still in Wuhan have said they felt they are being \u201cswept under the carpet\u201d by the Australian government, and that other elderly and vulnerable people remained stranded in the city. Desmond Lim from Sydney said the method of determining who was prioritised was unclear, and his wife, Jing Gong, who is also an Australian citizen, had been left in the city despite multiple requests for assistance. Yufei said the Australian government told him that they could not evacuate Chloe on any of the earlier flights. \u201cWe talked to the government \u2013 they said they can only take permanent residents or citizens. Chloe is an Australian citizen but her grandma isn\u2019t. \u201cShe can\u2019t get to the plane because only her grandma can take her \u2013 but her grandma is not an Australian citizen, or permanent resident. \u201cBoth my wife and I can\u2019t go and pick up Chloe because we don\u2019t have any pass [to travel through Hubei]. We don\u2019t have any pass to pick up Chloe and stay with her. That\u2019s what is happening at the moment. \u201cI think she can\u2019t travel by herself. I can only trust myself to go back to pick up Chloe, or my wife.\u201d Yufei said he was worried for Chloe\u2019s wellbeing in the city, where China\u2019s medical system is under strain from the impacts of coronavirus. \u201cShe was staying with her grandma. But her grandma developed other conditions, and went to hospital last week. So at the moment, she is staying with my mother-in-law\u2019s sister. \u201cShe is still in hospital. Not with coronavirus \u2013 just a normal cold. But at this stage, sometimes if you go into a hospital you have to stay there for at least 10 days. My daughter is only one and half. It\u2019s really hard to look after a little kid, with just one adult. \u201cAll I hope is that I can get some pass or the government can help me get back to Suizhou. Then I can stay there for a few days, or get there and bring Chloe back to Australia. I asked them, they said they can\u2019t do anything.\u201d",

On Tuesday, Facebook, Cisco Systems, US chipmaker Intel and Chinese smartphone manufacturer Vivo became the latest firms to cancel, citing health and safety concerns. Ericsson, Amazon, Sony and LG have also abandoned plans to attend the congress, due to be held from 24-27 February. China\u2019s top smartphone manufacturer, Huawei, and its smaller rival ZTE, are still set to attend and have said their executives and staff will undergo a self-imposed two-week quarantine period before appearing at the show. ZTE has also said its stand and equipment would be disinfected daily, with all of its booth exhibition staff brought in from countries outside of China, mainly Europe. In a statement posted on its website , GSMA \u2013 which organises the congress \u2013 said the coronavirus had \u201ccreated disruption, in particular for exhibitors and attendees from around the world, including the 5-6,000 (5-6%) who have historically attended from China\u201d. It offered its sympathy to all those affected but said the congress would go ahead as planned. However, GSMA said no travellers from Hubei province would be allowed to attend the event, while all travellers who had been in China would need to prove they have been out of the country for 14 days before the congress started. Attendees will have their temperatures taken and will also have to self-certify that they have not been in contact with any infected people. An \u201cincreased cleaning and disinfection programme\u201d will be implemented in catering areas, toilets and public touch-screens, and on surfaces and handrails. Other measures include a \u201cno-handshake policy\u201d for all those attending, a \u201cmicrophone disinfecting\u201d protocol for all speakers, and the distribution of sanitising and disinfection products.

If they are not guaranteed then I cannot deliver on my full potential as a coach and cannot live up to my responsibilities.\u201d Having swallow-dived into Berlin\u2019s Olympiastadion promising to keep Hertha up and transform them into title contenders with the financial backing of major investor Lars Windhorst, Klinsmann will remain at the club as part of the \u201csupervisory board\u201d upon which he sat before taking over from Ante Covic. \u201cWe were surprised about this development,\u201d parped Hertha in a club statement. \u201cEspecially after the trusting cooperation regarding personnel decisions during the intensive winter transfer window, there was no sign of this. We will inform you about further developments in due course.\u201d While the club come to terms with this shock news, Klinsmann\u2019s assistant, Alexander Nouri, has been put in charge, while his former boss sets about the process of calming things down by helping to identify and appoint his own replacement. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cIn Paris, I missed the chance to become the best coach in the world. I won the league, four domestic cups and two Troph\u00e9es des Champions. But the ultimate goal was [Big Cup]. The first year, in the round of 16 against Barcelona, we played a really high-level first leg. In the return leg, we were knocked out because VAR didn\u2019t yet exist\u201d \u2013 Unai Emery there, with an interesting take on what caused his career to nosedive. RECOMMENDED LOOKING Dele Alli, Duncan Ferguson and Sean Dyche feature in David Squires\u2019s spanking cartoon on the Premier League\u2019s winter break. You can buy it here. FIVER LETTERS \u201cI\u2019ve noticed a recent trend of letter o\u2019 the day being awarded to people for simply reporting on something witty that others had done instead of actually writing something funny themselves. I can\u2019t imagine why anyone at The Fiver would think that sort of thing is worth rewarding \u2013 Scott L Henderson. \u201cDown here in the land of Oz, Guardian Australia regularly conducts opinion polls on the state of our political leaders. This fortnight for example, PM Scott Morrison has an approval rating of 39%, and more than half the sample, 52%, disapprove of his performance. Fiver readers\u2019 perspicacity and influence is almost greater than I thought. The poll\u2019s sample size is 1,056 respondents\u201d \u2013 Stephen Hodgson. \u201cFun fact: rhinos may have thick skin, but their derma is actually quite sensitive and can be easily scarred. The comparison between these majestic unicorns and Everton\u2019s sometimes-majestic No 1 (yesterday\u2019s Fiver) may be even more apt than thought, with the Netherlands\u2019 former choice between the sticks now sitting between the subs at Goodison, Pickford may find his position in the pecking order \u2018endangered\u2019\u201d \u2013 Matt Richman. \u201cRe: Jordan Pickford moaning that everyone hates England players, I can confirm, as a Scotsman, that this is 100% true\u201d \u2013 Mathew Conway. \u201cSend your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Stephen Hodgson.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Former Celtic captain Jackie McNamara is seriously ill in hospital after collapsing near his home in York. Dele Alli is facing a possible FA charge over a post on social media disgrace SnapTok in which he appeared to mock an Asian man and claimed he might be infected with the coronavirus. A 12-year-old boy has been charged in connection with racist chants against Rangers striker Alfredo Morelos. Manchester United have asked for permission to install rail seating for up to 1,500 fans at Old Trafford. \u201cIt is fantastic news that the world\u2019s most famous club is seeking to enhance spectator safety in this way,\u201d cheered Jon Darch of the Safe Standing campaign group. Meanwhile, Ed Woodward has backed Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r to lead United\u2019s summer spending. \u201cOur focus is on bringing in a combination of experience and the best young players with potential to develop further,\u201d he blathered. And Adri\u00e1n has revealed he spent a steamy night sleeping with the Super Cup after his penalty-saving heroics in last year\u2019s final. \u201cJames [Milner] told me to take the trophy with me for the night. It took me several seconds to realise he really meant it. Getting into the room with the Super Cup, my first title \u2026 awesome,\u201d phwoared the Liverpool goalkeeper. STILL WANT MORE?

Will Unwin does, and chatted about it with him for our latest Golden Goal. G\u00e9d Houllier\u2019s achievements at Liverpool are undervalued, writes Sachin Nakrani, who corrects the record with this long read. Ed Aarons investigates why teams in England\u2019s top two divisions are taking sizeable loans from an Australian bank. Proper Journalism\u2019s David Conn praises Everton for temporarily reining it in with the gambling advertising and appearing against Palace endorsing the club\u2019s community work on their shirts.

      "bodyText": "Finally, the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 has closed 52 points higher or 0.7% at 7499. Traders shrugged off today\u2019s GDP report, as the City joined a wider global rally triggered by signs that the coronavirus infection rate may be slowing. TUI ended 13% higher after reporting record holiday bookings. America\u2019s stock market hit a fresh record high today, amid general optimism that the coronavirus crisis could be easing. It\u2019s now dipped back -- and president Trump knows who to blame: At 1.75%, US interest rates are certainly higher than in the eurozone (o%) and the UK (0.75%), but that\u2019s because America\u2019s economy has been growing faster. Record low borrowing costs are usually a sign that something\u2019s gone wrong, not right. And while the dollar has hit a four-month high today, a certain somebody\u2019s trade wars have also been tough on exports (ask a soybean farmer....). Anyway, Jerome Powell hasn\u2019t been too gloomy today - he told Congress that the US economy is in a good place, and the expansion can clearly continue. Mark Carney also told the House of Lords that more public and corporate investment are needed, to lift growth. It\u2019s a timely intervention, given today\u2019s weak GDP report and the decision to press on with the high-speed HS2 rail project. Carney said that the current low interest rate environment made it a good time to borrow to invest. \u201cThis is an environment in which, yes, the right infrastructure, the right corporate investment projects make sense and will be necessary in order to ultimately get us out of this situation.\u201d Outgoing Bank of England chief Mark Carney is now weighing in too. Speaking at the House of Lords, Carney says UK interest rates are likely to be relatively low for the foreseeable future (they\u2019re currently just 0.75%, with two policymakers pushing for a cut this month). Upward adjustments are likely to be \u201cmodest\u201d, predicts Carney (who\u2019s leaving next month). GDP is always a blunt instrument, and the New Economics Foundation fears that today\u2019s growth report doesn\u2019t capture the damage to living standards since the financial crisis. NEF, a think tank, has calculated that the UK population are still \u00a397 poorer on average compared to the first three months of 2008. They\u2019ve calculated this by working out the actual inflation experienced by consumers, including VAT changes and import costs. Here\u2019s what it shows: Alfie Stirling, Head of Economics at the New Economics Foundation, says: \u201cThe current debate on the economy and Brexit is at risk of missing the wood for the trees \u2013 whatever the nature of tomorrow\u2019s trade deals, the far bigger issue is that the economy is failing the majority of people today. \u201cThe current political turmoil has distrust in technocracy and \u2018expert\u2019 views at its core. Matters won\u2019t be helped if too much attention is given to where the next recession is going to come from, when the average person has yet to even recover from the last one.\u201d Another central banker, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, has warned politicians that the coronavirus is a key threat to the global economy. Testifying to Congress, Powell says: \u201cIn particular, we are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy.\u201d Powell has also indicated that the Fed will continue its current programme of buying billions of dollars of short-term US bonds until at least April. This is meant to prevent liquidity drying up -- but also appears to be driving asset prices steadily higher. Here\u2019s our updated news story on the UK GDP figures: Meanwhile in Strasbourg, the head of the European Central Bank has warned that the eurozone has been slowing for two years! Christine Lagarde told the European Parliament: Euro area growth momentum has been slowing down since the start of 2018, largely on account of global uncertainties and weaker international trade. Moderating growth has also weakened pressure on prices, and inflation remains some distance below our medium-term aim. This weakness prompted the ECB to launch a new stimulus programme last year. Lagarde warns, though, that central banks can\u2019t do it all alone. Monetary policy cannot, and should not, be the only game in town.... In other words, politicians need to do more -- a point UK chancellor Sajid Javid may address in the March budget. Time for a recap Britain\u2019s economy stagnated in the final quarter of 2019, as political uncertainty, Brexit worries, a slowing eurozone and trade tensions all hurt growth. GDP flatlined in the October-December, the ONS reported this morning. But while the economy shrank by 0.3% in November, it bounced back with 0.3% growth in December. There may be some green shoots peeking out. During the quarter, the services sector grew by 0.1% while industry shrank by 0.8% -- extending a decline that began early in 2019. Business investment shrank 1%, as firms were deterred from investing in new offices and machinery. ONS\u2019s Head of GDP, Rob Kent-Smith, explained: \u201cThere was no growth in the last quarter of 2019 as increases in the services and construction sectors were offset by another poor showing from manufacturing, particularly the motor industry. The GDP report also showed that the UK economy grew by 1.4% during 2019. That\u2019s faster than the eurozone, where France\u2019s economy shrank 0.1% during the last quarter. Here are some international comparisons. The ONS flagged up that Brexit uncertainty had weighed heavily on the manufacturing industry last year -- with some factories closing down in April and November in case of a hard Brexit. Some manufacturing sub-sectors have been shrinking since the summer. Economists were encouraged that growth in the third-quarter of 2019 was revised up, but there are also predictions that UK interest rates could be cut soon to spur growth. Political reaction was predictably mixed. Chancellor Sajid Javid promised bold measures in March\u2019s budget, while the shadow chancellor blamed government failure. Business groups called for more assistance - including a cut to business rates and some clarity on the UK-EU trade deal (which is likely to include some painful friction) Chancellor Sajid Javid has managed to respond to today\u2019s GDP figures, without actually mentioning the GDP figures! Impressive, in some ways.... Rather than focusing on the stagnating UK economy, Javid is looking ahead to next month\u2019s budget statement, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve broken the deadlock and left the EU \u2013 now we need to seize this moment to level up and prepare our great nation for long-term success. \u201cIn my Budget, exactly one month from today, I\u2019ll set out how we will move forward, with more ambition and new thinking, and empower our people and businesses so everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\u201d And over in parliament, Boris Johnson has just confirmed that the HS2 rail project will go ahead. The PM is arguing that the UK needs increased capacity and faster speeds, despite concerns over the cost of the high speed line from London to Birmingham, and then the north. This will please the business groups who were calling for more support this morning, but obviously disappoint campaigners and critics of the plan. But there will be changes, which will affect connections to Manchester and Leeds, and the new terminus at Euston. Our Politics live blog has all the details: Meanwhile in the City, shares in holiday firm TUI are now up 11% after reporting record booking levels - thanks to the demise of rival Thomas Cook. Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University reckons there are three reasons to suggest that the UK economy will remain on shaky ground. First, the carry over effects of today\u2019s no GDP growth will undermine future UK growth. Second, the rising headwinds of the new Coronavirus will hit, to some extent, global growth and, consequently, undermine further the prospects of future UK growth. Third, the BoE continues to delay an interest rate cut by being too optimistic. Indeed, the 1.1% annual growth for 2019 Q4 is much lower than its 1.67% forecast two years ago or its 1.72% forecast one year ago... So there\u2019s a case for UK interest rates to be cut, as soon as next month, he adds: As Liverpool colleagues and I have shown, additional monetary stimulus can mitigate the impact of zero UK growth and the uncertain global environment. In other words, I think it is quite likely that the Bank of England will intervene by cutting its policy rate as early as March the 26th when its next interest rate decision is scheduled. Today\u2019s growth report isn\u2019t as bad as some economists feared, points out our economics editor Larry Elliott. But while things may improve in 2020, there\u2019s little hope of the UK economy racing ahead. He writes that the situation is finely balanced: Surveys have suggested that some of the [business] investment that had been on hold has now been sanctioned. The \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal agreed between Washington and Beijing has removed the threat of intensifying protectionism. Wages are rising faster than prices, which should support consumer spending. And the UK chancellor, Sajid Javid, is poised to deliver an expansionary budget next month. It is not all good news. The agreement between China and the US amounts to a truce, not a permanent peace. Businesses will remain cautious about investment all the time there is a risk that the UK and the EU will fail to agree a trade deal. The impact of coronavirus on the global economy is growing. On balance, the positive should outweigh the negative \u2013 at least for now. Growth will rebound in the first quarter and looks likely to be faster in 2020 than in 2019. But boom-boom Britain it won\u2019t be. John Springford of the Centre for European Reform predicts a growth-friendly budget next month: Here\u2019s CBI deputy director Josh Hardie on today\u2019s GDP report: Ruth Gregory of Capital Economics says today\u2019s GDP figures were not quite as bad, and may show the UK outperformed the eurozone last year. The stagnation in GDP in the fourth quarter beat our forecast of a 0.1% q/q fall. Encouragingly, overall household consumption managed to eek out a small rise of 0.1% q/q, suggesting that growth in spending off the high street compensated for the 0.9% quarterly fall in retail sales. Meanwhile, Q3\u2019s quarterly GDP estimate was revised up from 0.4% to 0.5% q/q. As a result, GDP grew by 1.4% in 2019. That beat 2018\u2019s 1.3% increase and the likely 1.2% gain in the euro-zone. Here\u2019s a chart showing how UK manufacturing has fared in the last six months. As you can see, sub-sectors such as machinery, pharmaceuticals and chemicals contracted in both Q3 and Q4. But car production was volatile - surging in the summer because factory closures had been brought forward to April (due to the Brexit deadline), then stumbling in the autumn (as the second deadline loomed). Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, says the UK economy ended 2019 in \u201ca funk\u201d, with stagnation in Q4. It needs some assistance from Chancellor Sajid Javid in March\u2019s budget, he says: It\u2019s likely that political uncertainty and unwinding stockpiles caused the economy to flag at the end of last year. However, firms entered 2020 with more of a spring in their step. Confidence has shot up, while hiring plans and investment intentions have also risen a notch, but the post-election bounce may tail off. \u201cUncertainty from the next stage of Brexit negotiations will increasingly play on the minds of business leaders. Meanwhile, ongoing hiccups in global growth, including the fallout from Coronavirus, could eat into the economy if global financial markets and trade slow. \u201cThis makes the Budget a crucial moment to get the economy moving. The Chancellor must clear the way for entrepreneurs to create jobs and drive up productivity, by unleashing investment in start-ups, slashing business rates, and revamping our skills system.\u201d Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, points to the poor manufacturing figures: \u201cThe UK economy lost momentum in the final quarter of 2019 due to weaker figures for industrial production. \u201cUK manufacturing remains a weak point for the UK economy with sluggish global demand, tightening cashflow and disrupted supply chains dragging on activity in the sector. \u201cDespite breaking the Brexit deadlock in Westminster, a faltering global economy and a challenging domestic business environment could limit the UK\u2019s growth prospects - particularly if the lack of clarity over post-transition trading arrangements persists. Jack Leslie, Economist at the Resolution Foundation, is disappointed that UK GDP in Q4 2019 was only 1.1% higher than Q4 2018 (according to the ONS today). \u201cThe UK economy ended the 2010s on a low, with the joint weakest annual economic growth of the decade. This slowdown is widespread too \u2013 manufacturing is in recession and the services sector grew at its slowest rate since mid-2016. The UK economy actually did better than some rivals, despite stagnating in the last quarter. We don\u2019t have all the GDP reports for Q4 yet, but as things stand we know that America and Spain did OK while France and Italy shrank. China was the standout performer, even though annual growth dropped to a 30-year low. China: +1.5% quarter-on-quarter growth in October-December US: +0.5% Spain: +0.5% Eurozone: +0.1% UK: zero growth France: GDP shrank by 0.1% Italy: GDP shrank by 0.3% On an annual basis, the UK is mid-table too: The British economy failed to grow in the final three months of last year, as political uncertainty took its toll on businesses, writes my colleague Richard Partington: The Office for National Statistics said that growth in gross domestic product (GDP) flatlined between October and the end of December, down from 0.5% growth in the third quarter. The latest snapshot shows the economy returned to its weak trajectory in the run-up to Christmas, with paralysis in Westminster followed by a general election campaign that ended in a large majority for Boris Johnson. However, there are signs that resolving the impasse over the first stage of Brexit, which resulted in Britain leaving the EU on 31 January, has brought a rebound in business activity since the start of the year. In January service sector companies \u2013 the cornerstone of the economy \u2013 recorded the strongest upturn in activity since mid-2018, according to a closely-watched survey. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, is appalled by the poor performance of UK industry this year. He says: \u201cThese are damning figures showing an economy punctured by a decade of decline. \u201cWith production tumbling over 2019 at its worst rate since 2012, it is clear that the Tories\u2019 combination of cruel cuts and economic mismanagement has sent the economy into freefall. \u201cThe Tories lack any vision or plan for the economy, and the upcoming Budget risks another decade of disappointment.\u201d There\u2019s certainly no sign of the once-promised March of the Makers today. Production output in 2019 looks more like a weary stagger.... You can read the fourth-quarter UK GDP report here: December\u2019s report is online here. Disappointingly, business investment fell by 1% in the final quarter of 2019. The ONS blamed \u201cheightened uncertainty\u201d (yes, our old \u2018friend\u2019 Brexit again...): Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) fell by 1.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The fall was driven by declines in investment in information and communication technology (ICT) equipment, dwellings, transport, and intellectual property products, though these were partially offset by an increase in investment in other buildings and structures. Business investment fell by 1.0% in the final quarter of the year, continuing its recent subdued performance as heightened uncertainty is likely to have weighed on the willingness of firms to invest in capital. Boris Johnson\u2019s (broken) pledge to leave the EU on 31 October \u2018do or die\u2019 hurt UK manufacturing, today\u2019s GDP report shows. Some car factories paused work in November in case Britain had crashed out of the EU on 31 October without a deal. By the time the delay came, it was too late to change plans. The ONS says: Output in the manufacturing sector fell by 1.1% in the most recent quarter, driven by a decrease in the manufacture of transport equipment, with several factories going ahead with planned shutdowns in November It\u2019s not all doom and gloom. UK growth in the third quarter of 2019 has been revised up to show 0.5% growth, from 0.4%. And in the second quarter (hit by Brexit-related factory closures), the economy only shrank by 0.1% not the 0.2% expected. That doesn\u2019t take away from the disappointing stagnation in Q4, but shows that 2019 was a little better than thought (but still far from sparkling). At the risk of aping Norman Lamont, there are some small green shoots of recovery peeking out of today\u2019s UK GDP report. Services, manufacturing and construction did all manage some growth in December. That helped to grow the economy by 0.3%, after a torrid November in which services and manufacturing both shrank. That could be a sign that confidence picked up after the general election -- something which business surveys have already reported. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to the UK economy\u2019s failure to grow in the final quarter of 2019, despite a pick-up in December: Brexit uncertainty is to blame for Britain\u2019s volatile (and mediocre!) growth in 2019. So says the Office for National Statistics in today\u2019s December growth report (which also gives a picture of the whole year). The ONS says: The volatility in 2019 can be seen to some extent in all headline sectors, but most notably in production and construction. However, while construction data can often be volatile, the recent volatility in the production sector has been notable, coinciding with the UK\u2019s two previously planned departure dates from the EU. Despite this, the underlying picture for production was one of weakening throughout 2019, with nine months of the year showing negative rolling three-month growths. During 2019, the UK economy grew by 1.4% - up from 1.3% in 2018. That\u2019s two years of rather weak, sub-trend, growth. Today\u2019s GDP report also shows that the manufacturing sector had a grim year, shrinking by 1.5%. Here\u2019s the ONS\u2019s Head of GDP, Rob Kent-Smith, on Britain\u2019s flatlining economy: \u201cThere was no growth in the last quarter of 2019 as increases in the services and construction sectors were offset by another poor showing from manufacturing, particularly the motor industry. \u201cThe underlying trade deficit widened, as exports of services fell, partially offset by a fall in goods imports.\u201d Britain\u2019s service sector grew by a paltry 0.1% in the final quarter of 2019, today\u2019s GDP report shows. But manufacturing did badly again -- slumping by 1.1% in October-December. The broader measure of industrial production shrank by 0.8%. The construction sector grew by 0.5%. Newsflash: The UK economy stagnated in the final quarter of 2019, with no growth at all. But in December alone it grew by 0.3%, reversing its slump in November, according to the Office for National Statistics. More to follow.... Just five minutes to go until we learn whether Britain ended 2019 with a bang or a whimper.... City economists reckon UK GDP may have risen 0.2% in December - but that wouldn\u2019t make up for November\u2019s 0.3% slide.... Here\u2019s Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management on today\u2019s UK GDP report (due in 35 minutes): Investment spending is likely to be negative, driven down by the uncertainties caused by US President Trump\u2019s trade taxes and the interminable EU-UK divorce. Online grocer Ocado has today confirmed what you may already have suspected -- a major warehouse fire is rather bad news for profits. Ocado has reported a \u00a3214.5m loss for 2019, rather worse than the \u00a344.4m loss a year earlier. Although revenues jumped 10%, this was wiped out by the impact of a huge blaze at its warehouse in Andover last year John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, says this loss has taken the shine off Ocado\u2019s recent technology deals abroad. \u201cOcado has delivered decent revenue growth and a range of new partnerships in the last 12 months, but its loss for the year is well beyond analyst expectations. While the impact of the Andover facility fire will account for some of this, the scale of the loss may have some market watchers concerned. Looking underneath the cashflow figures the UK has turned positive, but investment in the international business has pushed the scale of cash outflow higher.\u201d City traders appear to be hoping that central bankers will save the day (again) if the global economy stumbles: Boom! European stock markets have hit a record high in early trading. The Stoxx 600, which tracks the largest six hundred companies across Europe, has gained 0.6% at the open to a new peak. In London, the FTSE 100 is up 54 points or 0.7% at 7500. Airline and holiday stocks are leading the way, with TUI surging 11% and easyJet up 3.3%. Traders appear to be more optimistic that the coronavirus crisis will not cause serious damage to the global economy. Even though the death toll has now passed 1,000, there are signs that the infection rate may be slowing. But with the death toll now over 1,000, and predictions that 60% of the world\u2019s population could catch the virus, this relief could be premature.... Overnight, we\u2019ve seen that UK retailers aren\u2019t enjoying this alleged \u2018Boris Bounce\u2019. The latest data from the British Retail Consortium shows that spending only rose modestly in January, and actually shrank over the last three months. My colleague Larry Elliott explains: The monthly BRC/KPMG health check of the retail sector found that total sales rose by 0.4% in January but were unchanged once increases in floor space were taken into account. Over the latest three months \u2013 a better guide to the underlying trend because it includes Black Friday bargains in November, the peak Christmas spending weeks in December and the January sales \u2013 food and non-food takings were down. Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management investment manager Dan Smith believes the UK economy could actually have shrunk over the last quarter [City consensus is for 0% growth] \u201cConsidering December was a month plagued by political uncertainty and retail sales have already shown a more cautious consumer over the period, this figure looks challenging. While a contraction in activity over the quarter will likely dampen sentiment towards the UK, it may not totally alter the outlook for 2020, as recent data has shown enough green shoots to raise hopes for a Boris bounce.\u201d Ipek Ozkardeskaya, Senior Analyst at Swissquote Bank, is more sceptical about this bounce given the struggle to agree a UK-EU trade deal.... . Today\u2019s data could confirm an anemic growth in the four the quarter, and a stagnant industrial and manufacturing production in December. The fact that business surveys in January hinted at a bounce in activity posterior to Boris Johnson\u2019s victory may attenuate the impact of soft production and growth data. But the optimism in surveys is now being eaten up as investors realize that the second - and the most decisive phase of Brexit negotiations will likely continue weighing on businesses. In fact, avoiding an immediate no-deal Brexit didn\u2019t necessarily save the UK from walking out of the EU without a deal at the very end. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover how well, or badly, the UK economy fared in the final three months of 2019 in the face of Brexit tensions, a general election, and a slowing European economy. It may not be a pretty sight. Economists predict that growth fizzled out in the last quarter, with GDP likely to be unchanged compared to Q3 (when the economy grew by 0.4%). On an annual basis, growth may have slumped to just 0.8% year-on-year \u2014 a very weak performance. We learned last month that the economy shrank by 0.3% in November alone - so it\u2019ll take something special in December to avoid a disappointing end to a troubled year. 2019 was a choppy year for growth. Two Brexit deadlines forced firms and households to stockpile goods, only to then run them down again, while consumer confidence and business investment were both knocked. Economists reckon that the UK service sector was probably stagnant during Q4, with manufacturing shrinking and construction growing. We\u2019ll find out at 9.30am, along with new trade and industrial production data too. Also coming up today Three top central bankers will vie for the limelight. ECB chief Christine Lagarde is testifying at the European Parliament, Fed chair Jerome Powell is appearing before Congress, and outgoing Bank of England governor Mark Carney is at the House of Lords. Doubtless we\u2019ll hear about growth prospects, interest rate moves, climate change, and the coronavirus. The agenda 9.30am GMT: UK GDP for October-December 2019: expected to be flat, after 0.4% growth in July-September 2pm GMT: Christine Lagarde at the European Parliament in Strasbourg 3pm GMT: Jerome Powell at the House Financial Services Panel 3.35pm GMT: Mark Carney at the House of Lords economic committee",

The eight cases also include another healthcare worker, a locum doctor working in Brighton.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday evening, the POA, formerly the Prison Officers\u2019 Association, said it had been briefed that three people had been taken ill at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire with suspected coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The association\u2019s general secretary, Steve Gillan, said the wing on which the three were being held had been put on lockdown and that one man, who had previously been held in the Thai prison system, had been taken to a hospital offsite for tests.

As soon as I knew I had been exposed to a confirmed case of coronavirus I contacted my GP, NHS 111 and Public Health England.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was advised to attend an isolated room at hospital, despite showing no symptoms, and subsequently self-isolated at home as instructed.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A sign fixed to the door of the Deneway branch read: \u201cThe surgery is closed due to organisational health and safety reasons.

      "bodyText": "A healthcare worker at Worthing hospital is among the eight confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK. Staff at the West Sussex hospital received a memo on Tuesday telling them a member of staff working in the A&amp;E department had been diagnosed with the disease. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said that all services at the hospital, including surgery and outpatients, are operating normally. The eight cases also include another healthcare worker, a locum doctor working in Brighton. On Tuesday evening, the POA, formerly the Prison Officers\u2019 Association, said it had been briefed that three people had been taken ill at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire with suspected coronavirus. The association\u2019s general secretary, Steve Gillan, said the wing on which the three were being held had been put on lockdown and that one man, who had previously been held in the Thai prison system, had been taken to a hospital offsite for tests. The other two were being held in isolation within the prison. No test results have been returned, but Gillan expressed concern about the welfare of prison officers should cases of the virus be confirmed, saying they needed to be given proper protection. The statement came after a businessman who inadvertently infected at least 11 people with coronavirus identified himself in a statement from hospital in which he said his thoughts were with others who had contracted the potentially fatal illness. Steve Walsh, 53, who is in an isolation unit at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London, which has a specialist infectious disease centre, said he had fully recovered. Walsh unknowingly contracted the disease at a sales conference in Singapore between 20 and 22 January and then went on a ski trip to the French Alps before returning home. Coronavirus has a two-week incubation period. He is believed to have transmitted the virus to several people in France. Public Health England (PHE) said on Monday that four people in Brighton linked to him had tested positive. As a result, the city has become the centre of the crisis in the UK, with five of the eight cases identified across the country there. Walsh said: \u201cI would like to thank the NHS for their help and care \u2013 whilst I have fully recovered, my thoughts are with others who have contracted coronavirus. As soon as I knew I had been exposed to a confirmed case of coronavirus I contacted my GP, NHS 111 and Public Health England. \u201cI was advised to attend an isolated room at hospital, despite showing no symptoms, and subsequently self-isolated at home as instructed. When the diagnosis was confirmed I was sent to an isolation unit in hospital, where I remain, and, as a precaution, my family was also asked to isolate themselves.\u201d He thanked friends, family and colleagues for their support and asked the media to respect their privacy. Walsh spoke as the World Health Organization called for people not to face blame where the virus had transferred from them to others. Dr Michael Ryan, the executive director at WHO\u2019s health emergencies programme, said it was \u201cdeeply, deeply unhelpful\u201d to single out sufferers as culpable in some fashion. He told a press conference on Tuesday: \u201cI really wish we could refrain from personalising these issues down to individuals who spread disease.\u201d When asked about Walsh, Ryan said it was important to learn from individual cases, but that WHO\u2019s overall risk assessment had not changed. \u201cThis is by no means, compared to other events, a massive \u2018super-spreading\u2019 event. This is an unusual event and it is a wake-up call because there may be other circumstances in which this disease can spread like this, so we need to study those circumstances for sure but it doesn\u2019t change our overall assessment. \u201cPeople are not at fault \u2013 they are never at fault in this situation, so let\u2019s be extremely careful here, it\u2019s really, really important that we don\u2019t attach unnecessary stigma to this.\u201d Walsh is thought to be a so-called super-spreader \u2013 someone who transmits infections to far more people than the majority do.

We continue to provide support to him and his family. We are working with public health authorities to ensure the welfare of our staff and communities and wish anyone with the virus a quick and full recovery.\u201d Walsh\u2019s statement came as it emerged a second GP surgery in Brighton had shut after the outbreak of coronavirus in the city. On Monday, the County Oak medical centre closed because of an \u201curgent operational health and safety reason\u201d, after a member of staff contracted the virus. On Tuesday morning, it emerged that a second branch of the same practice, less than two miles away, had also closed. A sign fixed to the door of the Deneway branch read: \u201cThe surgery is closed due to organisational health and safety reasons. Please contact 111 if you need to speak to a health professional.\u201d PHE said it was working to identify healthcare staff and patients who had been in contact with the two infected healthcare workers, as well as people who had close and sustained contact with other people confirmed to have the virus. PHE has been contacting passengers who sat near Walsh during his journey home on 28 January, on flight EZS8481 from Geneva to Gatwick. The Brighton Evening Argus reported on Tuesday that two nurses at a local hospital were being quarantined after treating a new patient suspected of contracting the coronavirus.

Top stories The parents of an Australian toddler stranded in China\u2019s Hubei province are pleading for her evacuation. So far more than 500 Australians have been airlifted out of the city of Wuhan. But 18-month-old Chloe Luo, an Australian citizen, remains in the neighbouring city of Suizhou \u2013 which has the world\u2019s fourth-highest number of coronavirus cases and has been under lockdown since 24 January. The toddler from Canberra was being looked after by her grandmother, who was hospitalised last week with a cold, unrelated to coronavirus, leaving Chloe with her great-aunt. Her parents, Yufei Luo and Yi Zhao, who live in Canberra, said they were willing to fly into Suizhou to bring Chloe back home. But the Australian government has said it is not planning on organising a third evacuation flight for citizens remaining in Wuhan and Hubei. Polling averages in New Hampshire show Bernie Sanders with a comfortable lead over Pete Buttigieg, but after the shock of the Iowa caucus debacle eight days ago, New Hampshire could deliver a surprise of its own, with the previously unheralded Amy Klobuchar making a late surge as the state votes in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primary. If Tulsi Gabbard drops out of the Democratic nomination race in the coming days, her unique campaign is likely to be remembered more for her spats with the Democratic party, accusations of being a Russian operative and her promise to \u201cbring a soldier\u2019s heart to the White House\u201d than a realistic bid for the presidency. Joe Biden is pulling up his stakes from New Hampshire and heading to South Carolina tonight, he has told supporters. Follow the latest on our live blog. Scott Morrison will argue on Wednesday for a new approach to address Indigenous disadvantage as the latest Closing the Gap report finds little progress has been made on five of seven targets, including life expectancy and child mortality rates. According to Wednesday\u2019s report, the target to have 95% of Indigenous four-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education by 2025 was achieved in 2017 but has slipped backwards to 86.4% in 2018, compared to 91.3% of non-Indigenous children. The report card also notes that attendance in inner regional areas is almost 17% higher than the lowest attendance rate in very remote areas. Australia Industrial greenhouse gas emissions in Australia have risen 60% in the past 15 years, putting the country on a path that, if it continues, will lead to it missing the target set at the Paris climate conference.

Groups working with the LGBTQI community are particularly worried, warning they could be discriminated against by their local federal MP if they do not support their work.

A US citizen evacuated from China amid the coronavirus outbreak was mistakenly released from hospital, after officials were told by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the person was in the clear. The coronavirus epidemic could spread to about two-thirds of the world\u2019s population if it cannot be controlled, according to Hong Kong\u2019s leading public health epidemiologist. Sudan is to hand over former dictator Omar al-Bashir to the international criminal court in The Hague to face trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity, the country\u2019s military council has said. Two-thirds of migrants fleeing Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have had a relative taken or killed before their departure. The Doctors Without Borders study said 42.5% of interviewees reported the violent death of a relative over the previous two years. Ladysmith Black Mambazo founder Joseph Shabalala has died aged 78.

the rotten core of Chinese governance\u201d.</p> \n  <p>As the crisis expands across the country, Xu Zhangrun, a law professor from one of the country\u2019s top universities, lambasted the government

      "bodyText": "Here is a recap of the latest coronavirus developments over the last few hours: Two inmates are being tested for coronavirus in a prison in Oxfordshire. The novel coronavirus has been officially named Covid-19. The first coronavirus vaccine could be available in 18 months, according to the World Health Organization chief. Coronavirus may be peaking in China, a senior government medical adviser said. A businessman linked to 11 other coronavirus cases after he contracted the disease in Singapore has made a full recovery. According to the latest figures, 1,018 people have died from the virus, with over 43,000 total cases worldwide. Facebook has pulled out of a major event over coronavirus fears. The tech company has said it will not be participating in the MWC 2020 tech conference due to take place in Barcelona from 24-27 February. Facebook joins other big companies, including Amazon and Sony, to pull out of the event over concerns about the spread of the virus. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, Facebook employees won\u2019t be attending this year\u2019s Mobile World Congress due to the evolving public health risks related to coronavirus,\u201d said a spokesperson for Facebook. \u201cWe will continue to collaborate with the GSMA and our partners and thank them for their efforts.\u201d Hundreds of workers have been made redundant in China as the country\u2019s economy reels from the coronavirus outbreak. Chinese firms struggled to get back to work after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, hundreds of them saying they would need loans running into billions of dollars to stay afloat. Company layoffs were beginning despite assurances by President Xi Jinping that widespread sackings would be avoided, as supply chains for global firms from car manufacturers to smartphone makers ruptured. Chinese firm Xinchao Media said on Monday it had laid off 500 people, or just over a tenth of its workforce, and restaurant chain Xibei said it was worried about how to pay its roughly 20,000 workers. Authorities said they would roll out measures to stabilise jobs, in addition to previously announced cuts to interest rates and fiscal stimulus designed to minimise any downturn. The World Bank ruled out any new health loans to China, though technical assistance would be offered. Singapore expects a 25-30% drop in visitor numbers this year due to the coronavirus outbreak, its tourism board has said. Singapore has reported 45 cases of the virus, and some countries, such as Kuwait and Qatar, have already started advising their citizens against travel to the Southeast Asian business hub. \u201cThe situation this year will be at least as severe as Sars and possibly worse,\u201d Singapore Tourism Board chief executive Keith Tan said, referring to a 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome that killed over 30 people in Singapore. Tan said most of the reduction in visitors so far were from China due to travel restrictions, but that travellers from other countries were also deferring or cancelling trips to Singapore. The Singapore government has said it expects a hit to its economy from the virus and is planning measures to support the tourism and hospitality industry. Fitch Ratings estimates the tourism sector accounts for about 6% of the wealthy city-state\u2019s economy. The use of the term \u2018super-spreader\u2019 to describe individuals who inadvertently infect others with coronavirus is \u201cdeeply, deeply unhelpful\u201d, according to a leading WHO official. Dr Michael Ryan, executive director at the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, said: I really wish we could refrain from personalising these issues down to individuals who spread disease. This is deeply, deeply unhelpful People are not at fault - they are never at fault in this situation, so let\u2019s be extremely careful here, it\u2019s really really important that we don\u2019t attach unnecessary stigma to this. He added that the case in which a British businessman inadvertently infected at least 11 people was by no means a \u201cmassive \u2018super spreading\u2019 event. This is an unusual event and it is a wake-up call because there may be other circumstances in which this disease can spread like this, so we need to study those circumstances for sure, but it doesn\u2019t change our overall assessment. The latest coronavirus figures show that 1,018 people have died from the infection, with over 43,000 cases worldwide. All but one death has been in China, the World Health Organization director general said in a press conference. Outside China, there have been 393 coronavirus cases across 24 countries. The Church of England could suspend the sharing of chalices during communion because of coronavirus. The church is \u201cmonitoring the situation closely and taking advice from the relevant medical authorities\u201d, James Newcome, bishop of Carlisle, told the C of E\u2019s ruling body, the general synod, meeting in London. He reminded the synod that during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, the church advised clergy to suspend chalice sharing and urged churches to post notices about hygiene. \u201cIf the situation continues to get worse, that sort of [advice] will certainly be issued,\u201d he said. The Catholic church in England and Wales has issued guidance to priests which includes asking people with cold and flu symptoms to refrain from taking communion from the chalice and for all members of congregations to use hand sanitisers. But it stopped short of suggesting the chalice to be withdrawn, or the sign of peace - when church-goers shake hands - to be suspended as happened in 2009. The Cornerstone Community Cafe in Brighton remains closed after it emerged one of the latest coronavirus cases attended a yoga class there. One of the web of people infected with the virus through businessman Steve Walsh had taken part in a Yoga For Runners course at the community centre on Hove\u2019s Church Road. A sign on the door reads: Yesterday we were advised that a member of the Cornerstone is now being cared for by the NHS. We have been reassured by Public Health England that no one else is at risk. The centre is due to reopen on Monday 17 February. The number of people in Scotland tested for coronavirus has doubled in 48 hours, according to the latest figures. Statistics published by the Scottish Government on Tuesday afternoon show 82 people in Scotland have been tested and all returned negative results. This is up from 41 tests on Sunday and 57 on Monday, and follows labs being set up at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh to test patients in Scotland. Scotland\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Dr Catherine Calderwood said while there have been no confirmed cases north of the border so far there is a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d a patient will test positive for the disease in future. The first coronavirus vaccine could be available in 18 months, \u201cso we have to do everything today using available weapons\u201d, the World Health Organization chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in Geneva. Last week, Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s vaccine unit, said: \u201cIt will take at least 12 to 18 months, which means in the acute situation we are in now - at least in China - that will not create a benefit.\u201d At least a dozen drugmakers are working on vaccines, or antivirals and other treatments to help those infected. Ghebreyesus urged countries to be \u201cas aggressive as possible\u201d in fighting the newly named Covid-19 coronavirus. If the world doesn\u2019t want to wake up and consider the virus as public enemy number one, I don\u2019t think we will will learn from our lessons. We are still in containment strategy and should not allow the virus to have a space to have local transmission. The new coronavirus has been named Covid-19 by the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told a press conference a name was chosen that \u201cdid not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people, and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease\u201d. He said: Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatising. It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, responsible for the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2002-03, and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome). The current novel coronavirus outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China, had remained unnamed until today. Some coronaviruses cause serious illness, while others cause mild or moderate infections, like the common cold. Jessica Murray here, taking over the blog from Frances Perraudin, as coronavirus continues to travel around the world, and experts question the use of the term \u201csuper-spreader\u201d. Our handy visual explainer tracks the spread of the virus across the globe. Two prisoners are being tested for coronavirus in Oxfordshire. The men, who are inmates at HMP Bullingdon, near Bicester, are being kept in isolation. One wing where the affected prisoners are has restricted access, but the prison remains operational, the Guardian understands. Public Health England is on site to help manage the situation. Here is the latest update from Public Health England on the number of concluded tests in the UK (1,358). The number of people who have tested positive in the UK remains at eight. Here\u2019s some more detail from Hancock\u2019s comments to parliament. The health secretary said: The NHS has the capability now to cope with the very highest level of intensity and isolation with 50 cases and the capability to expand that to 500 cases and to do that without an impact on the wider work of the NHS. But of course, if the number of cases get bigger, then we will need to take further steps and as he knows from his time in my shoes, there are extensive plans already in place for how that should happen if we reach that eventuality. Conservative MP for the Vale of Clwyd, James Davis, asked for a likely timescale for the development of a vaccine and how much Britain has contributed to that. Hancock responded that \u201cestimates vary\u201d on when a vaccination will be available. We\u2019ve put \u00a340m into the both global and domestic efforts to find a vaccine and work is under way fast and that work is progressing, but the time taken not just to develop a vaccine but also to ensure that it is assured and that it is safe to use, it does take time. Birmingham Live is reporting that a British man who contracted coronavirus while on his honeymoon on a Japanese cruise ship expects to be released from hospital later this week. Alan Steele, 58 and from Tettenhall in Wolverhampton, tested positive for the virus while on the Diamond Princess ship with his new wife Wendy. He posted on Facebook that had been symptom-free since he was moved to hospital last Thursday. He said: Doctor has given me the set plan of action for my discharge and as long as I pass the tests I will be free on Friday. Would have been Thursday but Japan on holiday tomorrow so no one to do the test results. Heard bad news on more cases on ship but possible good news is all will now be tested so if you\u2019re free of virus they should let you go. Responding to Hancock, the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said Labour supported the government\u2019s move to extend powers to quarantine people. I understand why the secretary of state has invoked the regulations, as he is entitled to do under the public health act. He has our support. Quarantine arrangements must be seen to be necessary, proportionate and in accordance with law, and enforcement of those quarantine arrangements, including the powers of restraint where necessary, must be fully transparent and the rights and freedoms of the quarantined [people] must be fully understood so as to ensure they are treated with dignity and respect. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been giving a statement to parliament on the new powers the government has given itself to allow it to force people into quarantine if they suspect they have coronavirus. He described it as a \u201cbelt and braces\u201d approach to protecting the public. \u201cThe powers are proportionate and will help us slow down transmission of the virus, make it easier for NHS and public health staff to do their jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe clinical advice about the risk to the public has not changed and remains moderate\u201d. He added: \u201cDealing with this disease is a marathon, not a sprint. The situation will get worse before it gets better. We will be guided by the science. Be in no doubt, we will do everything that is effective to tackle this virus and keep people safe.\u201d The diagnosis of four people living in a single apartment block in Hong Kong has prompted worried comparisons with the deadly Sars pandemic of 17 years ago. Medical workers in full protective suits went to Hong Mei House in Tsing Yi district on Tuesday, evacuating more than 100 people in 34 apartments. Health officials said it was a precautionary measure after a 62-year-old woman was diagnosed with the virus on Tuesday. She was living 10 floors below a man who was earlier confirmed with the virus. The woman\u2019s son and daughter-in-law, who live with her, were among seven new cases reported, raising the city\u2019s tally to 49. As in 2003, officials suspect the building\u2019s plumbing may be to blame. The people evacuated were living in the 34 apartments vertically above or below the woman, and share the same sewage system. A modified toilet drainage pipe in her unit may have spread the virus and officials disinfecting the building are checking if any other units have made such alternations. Authorities sought to assuage fears of an epidemic, dismissing similarities to the Sars outbreak at the Amoy Gardens housing estate in 2003. More than 300 people were infected and 42 people died after a defective sewage pipe in the apartment block was believed to have caused the vertical spread of Sars. Most of Hong Kong\u2019s 7.4 million population live in high-rise apartments. A number of scientific experts have clarified the \u201csuper-spreader\u201d term used to describe the man who infected 11 others with coronavirus after contracting it in Singapore. \u201cThe issue with the term \u2018super-spreader\u2019 is that it implies that the person in question is inherently more able to pass on disease compared with others,\u201d said Dr Stephen Griffin, associate professor at the University of Leeds and chair of the virus division of the Microbiology Society. He said the ability of an individual to pass on the disease depended on a number of factors: For example, a patient that is very unwell, coughing without practising good hygiene, and who is then stuck in a crowded lift for an hour, is far more likely to spread infection to multiple recipients compared with someone that self-isolates at the first sign of symptoms. Meanwhile, Brendan Wren, a professor of microbial pathogenesis at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: There is no clear evidence that individuals with the new coronavirus can be \u2018super-shedders\u2019 or \u2018super-spreaders\u2019. It is likely that individuals may have mild symptoms prior to unwittingly transferring the virus. Griffin said that while it had not yet been confirmed clinically, there was increasing anecdotal evidence to suggest the virus can be passed on prior to the onset of symptoms. Thousands of people have been ordered into quarantine in the Chinese city of Tianjin after a cluster of new coronavirus cases were linked to one department store, the New York Times reports. Nearly a third of the 102 new patients in Tianjin worked or shopped at a department store in the Baodi district, or had close contact with employees or customers, according to the city\u2019s health authorities. In the city of more than 15 million people, 70 miles southeast of Beijing, officials estimated 11,700 customers visited the unidentified shopping complex during a period in late January. The authorities said those customers would be quarantined, and the department store would be sealed and disinfected. Emergency measures have been imposed in some areas of the district, home to nearly 1 million people, including road blocks and round-the-clock security patrols. Meanwhile, an apartment building in Hong Kong has been evacuated and dozens of residents quarantined after two people living on different floors were found to be infected with the virus. The cases suggest the virus spread through the building, perhaps through a pipe, raising further fears of the virus\u2019s ability to spread. The Chinese financial news website Caixin is reporting on new research which suggests that the incubation period for the coronavirus is as long as 24 days rather than the previously believed 14 days. The study \u2013 which is based on data gathered from more than 1,000 coronavirus patients in China \u2013 also found that fewer than half of the patients showed fever symptoms when they first saw doctors. The researchers from Chinese hospitals and medical schools, led by Zhong Nanshan, found that relying on signs of fever to identify the virus in its early stages could result in large numbers of infected people going undiscovered. Fever occurred in just 43.8% of patients, but later developed in 87.9% following hospitalisation. We would like to hear from Guardian readers in the UK: how are you responding to these warnings? Have you amended plans or altered holidays? Have you temporarily changed part of your routine to avoid certain places? Have you started stockpiling food or medical supplies, or ordered protective face masks? Please let us know. Guardian journalist Henry McDonald has paid a visit to the County Oak Medical Centre in Brighton, which remains shut this morning after a member of staff contracted the virus. A delivery driver tried in vain to deliver three parcels to the clinic but no one was there to let him in. A Lloyd\u2019s Pharmacy next door remains open. A member of Brighton and Hove city\u2019s council\u2019s health board, Prof Samer Bagaeen, has expressed concern that the number of people infected in the area may be much higher than suggested. Cllr Bagaeen accused the council of failing to keep Brighton and Hove residents fully informed about the coronavirus outbreak on the south coast. He also claimed the council had instructed local elected representatives not to talk to journalists. I think they have not been straight with everyone from the start and have intentionally hid the implications of the infections. We don\u2019t know who in the city has been exposed and where. I am finding details about incidents from newspapers days after they have happened. We should have been informed since day one. You have people who are \u2018self isolating\u2019 but could still be going to the shops. And the council has told us councillors that we must not speak to journalists. Here is some more detail on those comments from Zhong Nanshan, the Chinese government\u2019s senior medical adviser. In an interview with Reuters, the 83-year-old epidemiologist who won fame for combating the Sars epidemic in 2003, said the coronavirus outbreak was hitting a peak in China and may be over by April. He said a forecast based on mathematical modelling, recent events and government action suggested the peak should come in middle or late February, followed by a plateau and decrease. \u201cI hope this outbreak or this event may be over in something like April,\u201d he said in a hospital run by Guangzhou Medical University, where 11 coronavirus patients were being treated. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so contagious, so that\u2019s a big problem,\u201d added Zhong, whose previous forecast of an earlier peak turned out to be premature. He said there was a gradual reduction in new cases in the southern province of Guangdong where he was, and also in Zhejiang and elsewhere. Do face masks actually help prevent coronavirus? Guardian health editor, Sarah Boseley, has this video explainer. Guardian reporter Henry McDonald reports that students at the University of Sussex have been sent an email to say that one of their peers has been tested for coronavirus in hospital, though the test results are still unknown. The university said it would keep students informed about the outcome of the test. The student had recently returned from overseas and was feeling unwell. It is understood that he lived in the Lewes Court halls of residence in Falmer. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, has told MailOnline that there could be a justification for giving the public more information about those infected with coronavirus: Patient confidentiality is important but we may now be at the point where the public\u2019s need to know more information is greater. It would be helpful to know if [Steve Walsh] got a taxi straight home or got a bus and stopped off at the supermarket. Letting the public know this timeline will reassure many that they are not at risk. Steve Walsh is thought to have contracted the virus at a conference in Singapore organised by his employer, the gas analytics company Servomex. A Servomex spokesman said: We are very pleased that Steve Walsh has made a full recovery. We continue to provide support to him and his family. We are working with Public Health authorities to ensure the welfare of our staff and communities and wish anyone with the virus a quick and full recovery. The man from Brighton thought to have passed the coronavirus to at least 11 other people after attending a conference in Singapore has issued a statement via St Thomas\u2019s Hospital in London, where he is in quarantine. Steve Walsh, 53, \u2013 who has been described as a \u2018super-spreader\u2019 \u2013 said he had fully recovered. I would like to thank the NHS for their help and care \u2013 whilst I have fully recovered, my thoughts are with others who have contracted coronavirus. As soon as I knew I had been exposed to a confirmed case of coronavirus I contacted my GP, NHS 111 and Public Health England. I was advised to attend an isolated room at hospital, despite showing no symptoms, and subsequently self-isolated at home as instructed. When the diagnosis was confirmed I was sent to an isolation unit in hospital, where I remain, and, as a precaution, my family was also asked to isolate themselves. I also thank friends, family and colleagues for their support during recent weeks and I ask the media to respect our privacy. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, has issued a statement on Twitter on the opening of the global research and innovation forum on the coronavirus. It\u2019s hard to believe that just two months ago, the #2019nCoV \u2013 which has come to captivate the attention of media, financial markets, and political leaders \u2013 was completely unknown to us. With 99% of #2019nCoV cases in #China, this remains very much an emergency for that country, but one that holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world. This #2019nCoV outbreak is testing us in many ways. It\u2019s a test of political solidarity \u2013 whether the world can come together to fight a common enemy that does not respect borders or ideologies. It\u2019s a test of financial solidarity \u2013 whether the will invest now in fighting the #2019nCoV outbreak, or pay more later to deal with its consequences. And it\u2019s a test of scientific solidarity \u2013 will the world come together to find shared answers to shared problems? A second GP surgery branch in Brighton has been shut following the outbreak of coronavirus in the city, PA Media reports. The County Oak Medical Centre was closed on Monday \u201cbecause of an urgent operational health and safety reason\u201d, following reports a member of staff there was one of those infected. On Tuesday morning, it emerged that a second branch of the surgery \u2013 located less than two miles away \u2013 has also been closed. A sign fixed to the door of the Deneway branch says: \u201cThe surgery is closed due to organisational health and safety reasons. Please contact 111 if you need to speak to a health professional.\u201d Reuters is reporting comments by Zhong Nanshan, the epidemiologist and pulmonologist who discovered the Sars virus in 2003. He said the new coronavirus had been very contagious compared with Sars up to this point, but there was evidence that the situation was improving in some Chinese provinces. I\u2019ll bring you more when we have it. Much of today\u2019s UK coverage of the spread of the coronavirus focuses on the case of a man, who appears to have passed the virus to the majority of the Britons to have tested positive for the virus. The Guardian\u2019s health editor, Sarah Boseley, has this on the phenomenon of the \u201csuper-spreader\u201d. She writes: Not everybody is equal when it comes to the transmission of infectious diseases. In fact, it has been established for at least two decades that there is something called the 20/80 rule \u2013 that a small core group of about one in five people transmit infections to far more people than the majority do \u2026 The third British case, after the first two diagnosed in York, was a man in his 50s who contracted the coronavirus infection at a conference in Singapore. He then travelled to France where he stayed with his family in a ski chalet in the Alpine resort of Les Contamines-Montjoie. Five people who were in the chalet, including a boy of nine, have tested positive for coronavirus since the man came back to the UK on an easyJet flight and was diagnosed in Brighton. Another Briton who was on holiday in the chalet flew back to his home in Mallorca and was admitted to hospital in Palma. The chief medical officer said four more people had tested positive in England \u2013 all of whom were also on the skiing holiday in France. In the UK, officials are working to trace patients of two healthcare workers who are among eight people to be diagnosed with coronavirus in the country. The pair, who were working in general practice in Brighton, are believed to have been in contact with about a dozen patients. In a statement on Monday, the medical director of Public Health England, Yvonne Doyle, said: We are now working urgently to identify all patients and other healthcare workers who may have come into close contact, and at this stage we believe this to be a relatively small number. The County Oak Medical Centre in Brighton announced on Monday it would close its doors \u201cbecause of an urgent operational health and safety reason\u201d. One of those newly diagnosed is reportedly a health worker there and people wearing protective full body suits and gloves were seen cleaning the centre in footage shared online. Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: Patients should not be alarmed as it is still more likely that anyone with flu-like symptoms will have the flu. However, in light of the members of staff who tested positive for coronavirus in Brighton we\u2019d like to remind the public that it is vital that any patient who thinks they may have symptoms does not try to attend a GP appointment or hospital emergency departments in person. They should stay at home and call NHS 111. Guardian Australia reporter Josh Taylor has this report on how the country\u2019s tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of the coronavirus. Ben Woodward has seen some difficult times in the tourism industry, but the Cairns operator says the coronavirus outbreak threatens to beat the lot. \u201cAs an industry, we\u2019ve come through crisis situations before, there\u2019s been Sars, there\u2019s been the GFC, there\u2019s been the pilot strike, but it is looking like one of the worst crisis situations we\u2019ve encountered as an industry.\u201d Cairns and Port Trips and Attractions has more than 200 staff across its bus tours, nature parks and sanctuaries in far-north Queensland. Woodward, the company\u2019s sales and marketing director, says cancellations started rolling in as soon as the Australian government imposed its ban on non-Australian citizens arriving from China, following China\u2019s own cancellation of international tour groups leaving the country. \u201cAnd they kept coming through to the point where the following couple of weeks are supposed to be the busiest weeks for Chinese new year, and it\u2019s just completely dropped off,\u201d he says. \u201cAnywhere from 40% to 60% down [on last year].\u201d Deaths in China stand at 1,016, with 42,638 confirmed infections. A leading virus expert has warned 60% of the word\u2019s population may catch the virus. Two senior officials in Hubei province were sacked over their role in combating the virus. A leading Chinese academic has blamed President Xi Jinping for the \u201ccatastrophe\u201d sweeping China. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive asked citizens to stay at home to prevent the virus spreading. South Korea has advised citizens not to travel to Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore. Thailand has barred passengers from Holland America\u2019s cruise ship MS Westerdam from disembarking. Vietnam confirmed a three-month-old baby had become the country\u2019s 15th case. Japanese health authorities will allow older and chronically ill passengers off the stricken Diamond Princess cruise liner amid growing concern about their health. A prominent Chinese intellectual has become the first high-profile public figure to lay the blame for the coronavirus crisis at the feet of the country\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, saying the spread of the deadly virus has \u201crevealed the rotten core of Chinese governance\u201d. As the crisis expands across the country, Xu Zhangrun, a law professor from one of the country\u2019s top universities, lambasted the government under Xi in an essay titled Viral Alarm, When Fury Overcomes Fear. In it, Xu laid the blame for the current national crisis at the feet of Xi and a culture of suppression and \u201csystemic impotence\u201d that he has created. The virus has killed more than 1,000 people inside China. \u201cThe cause of all of this lies with The Axelrod and the cabal that surrounds him,\u201d Xu writes, referring to Xi, according to a translation of the article by the historian Geremie Barm\u00e9 published on Monday by the website ChinaFile. \u201cIt is a system that turns every natural disaster into an even greater man-made catastrophe. The coronavirus epidemic has revealed the rotten core of Chinese governance; the fragile and vacuous heart of the jittering edifice of state has thereby shown up as never before.\u201d Xu describes the outbreak as a \u201cnational calamity\u201d that involves politics, the economy and \u201cnation\u2019s ethical fabric\u201d making it \u201cmore perilous than total war itself\u201d. You can read the full story below: Hong Kong\u2019s leading public health epidemiologist says other countries should consider adopting China-style containment measures. Prof Gabriel Leung, the chair of public health medicine at Hong Kong University, sounded his warning after the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said recent cases of coronavirus patients who have never visited China could be the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d. \u201cSixty per cent of the world\u2019s population is an awfully big number,\u201d Leung told the Guardian in London, en route to an meeting of experts at the WHO in Geneva. He will tell the meeting that the main issue is the scale of the growing worldwide epidemic and the second priority is to find out whether the drastic measures taken by China to prevent the spread have worked \u2013 because if so, other countries should think about adopting them. You can read our full story here: South Korea has \u201cstrongly advised\u201d its citizens not to travel to Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore in an attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus. South Korea, which confirmed its 28th case of the respiratory illness on Tuesday, has already asked its nationals to refrain from travelling to China. Singapore has reported 45 cases, while Thailand has 32. Japan 25 (in addition to 135 aboard the Diamond Princess), Malaysia and Taiwan 18 each, and Vietnam 14. \u201cThe measure is part of efforts to prevent the inflow of the coronavirus into the country through a third nation,\u201d Kim Gang-lip, deputy head of the central disaster headquarters, said, according to the Yonhap news agency. From Wednesday, South Korea will also require people arriving from Hong Kong and Macau to undergo quarantine screening to determine if they are suffering from symptoms associated with the virus, such as a fever or respiratory problems. Arrivals will be required to fill in a health form, provide their mobile phone numbers and address while staying in South Korea, and notify the authorities if they have visited Hubei province - where the outbreak is believed to have started - in the previous two weeks. Seoul imposed a ban earlier this month on all foreign travellers who had been to Hubei during the previous fortnight. Agence France-Presse has published its roundup of global cases of the virus. I have updated the list to include the newest cases in the US (1) and Vietnam (1), today. Asia/Pacific Japan: 26 + 135 on Diamond Princess cruise ship Singapore: 45 Hong Kong: 42 (including one death) Thailand: 32 South Korea: 28 Japan: 25 Taiwan: 18 Malaysia: 18 Australia: 15 (including 5 recoveries) Vietnam: 15 Macau: 10 India: 3 Philippines: 3 (including one death) Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Cambodia: 1 North America United States: 13 Canada: 7 Europe Germany: 14 France: 11 Britain: 8 Italy: 3 Russia: 2 Spain: 2 Finland: 1 Sweden: 1 Belgium: 1 Middle EaSt United Arab Emirates: 8 South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency is reporting that the country has advised against travel to Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore. I\u2019ll bring you the details on this shortly. Stock markets have continued to push upwards throughout Asia Pacific today. With the day almost done, the ASX200 is up 0.5% in Sydney. In Hong Kong, where the chief executive has told people not to leave their houses, the Hang Seng is up 1.25%. In Shanghai the Composite is up one third and Seoul has risen 0.7%. However, some analysts are warning that the impact from the outbreak on the global economy could be much greater than investors appear to think. Analysts at Nomura said in a note that measures of returning workers and passenger traffic flows within China suggested the virus had \u201ca devastating impact on China\u2019s economy in January and February ... We are concerned that global markets thus far appear to be significantly underestimating the extent of disruption inflicted by the virus\u201d. We wrote earlier that Capital Economics has downgraded its forecast for Chinese GDP in the first quarter of this year to 3%, down from 5%. A little snapshot of life on board the quarantined cruise ship, Diamond Princess, comes from the niece of some of the people stuck on board. I\u2019m getting more now on Carrie Lam\u2019s appeal to people in Hong Kong to stay at home as much as possible due to the coronavirus. \u201cAs part and parcel of enhancing social distancing we are making an appeal to the people of Hong Kong to stay at home as much as possible,\u201d Lam told reporters. \u201cBut at the moment, we\u2019re making this appeal, we\u2019re not going for compulsory closures because Hong Kong is a free society.\u201d It follows the evacuation of more than 100 residents in 35 households from a high-rise building in the early hours of Tuesday, after two residents from the building were confirmed to have contracted coronavirus. The government said it was investigating drainage pipes in the building in Tsing Yi district in the New Territories amid worries the virus may have been spread through the system as the city goes on high alert to contain an outbreak. The government said on Tuesday the occupants of 23 households in the Tsing Yi housing complex had been sent to quarantine centres, while it was still trying to make contact with people from nine housing units. The director of the Centre for Health Protection said authorities were investigating the suspected \u201cenvironmental transmission\u201d of the two confirmed cases. Parts of Hong Kong, including restaurants, shopping malls and cafes, are almost deserted as people work from home and schools remain closed, invoking memories of 2003 when Sars sent panic across the city. Most of Hong Kong\u2019s population of more than seven million people live in high-rise buildings. Just while I\u2019m on graphs and figures, here are two particularly interesting graphs from the economics research company, Capital Economics. The first shows the rate of new cases since the city of Wuhan was locked down and transport in and out curtailed. It appears to show a substantial drop after in new cases at around 14 days after the lockdown. The virus has a maximum incubation period of 14 days. The second graph plots the growth of the coronavirus in China versus Sars. And you can see how much steeper the coronavirus growth is. Here\u2019s a graph from the Economist\u2019s Simon Rabinovitch of the new reported cases of the virus. Some are suggesting on social media that the sustained downward trend in the past few days is linked a reported change in how new cases of the virus are registered. And another collation of global figures (based on WHO figures), appears to show the angle of the curve changing, as per the Johns Hopkins graph a couple of posts ago. There\u2019s been lots of attention paid to figures of new cases of the virus in China today, and that the cases outside Hubei province are continuing to drop. I\u2019ve also been looking at the rise in confirmed cases ... Johns Hopkins\u2019 dashboard, which we have been using regularly, seems to be showing a change in the growth rate of new cases. Chinese state media is reporting that party secretary of Health Commission of Hubei Province, Zhang Jin, and the director of the Hubei Provincial Health Commission, Liu Yingzi, have been fired. The BBC\u2019s correspondent in China, Stephen McDonell, has tweeted about the China\u2019s national health commission changing the way it counts confirmed cases of the virus. I have seen a lot of this on social media today. The suggestion is that patients who test positive but have no coronavirus symptoms, are not counted in the daily update of confirmed cases ... and that this may account for the slowing growth rate of new cases. I\u2019ll bring you more on this when I have it. Chinese firm Xinchao Media has laid off 500 people, or just over 10% of its workforce, saying it needed to resort to such measures to survive the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Xinchao Media, which places advertisements in elevators, announced its job cuts in a post on its official WeChat account on Monday, which carried the transcript of an internal speech given by its chief executive, Zhang Jixue. \u201cTo overcome the epidemic, you have to step on the brakes, jam the cash flow, reduce costs, to ensure survival ... China\u2019s bosses, they have at this time become a helpless and disadvantaged group. While usually strong, they also hope they can gain understanding and care,\u201d he said, according to Reuters. He said the company still had nearly 1bn yuan ($143m) in its coffers, but forecast that it would likely only be able to tide over for 6-7 months if they had no income. Thailand has barred passengers from Holland America\u2019s cruise ship MS Westerdam from disembarking, its health minister has said, the latest country to turn it away amid fears of the coronavirus despite no confirmed infections aboard. The company, owned by Miami-based Carnival Corp, had said on Monday that passengers would disembark in Bangkok on 13 February (Thursday) and that there was no reason to believe anybody aboard had the virus. \u201cI have issued orders. Permission to dock refused,\u201d public health minister Anutin Charnvirakul said in a Facebook post. The Westerdam has already been turned away from several countries, including Japan and the Philippines. Holland America says no one on board has the virus. Media reports say it carries 1,455 passengers and 802 crew; its original destination was Yokohama, Japan, which refused it permission to dock. \u201cThe ship is not in quarantine and we have no reason to believe there are any cases of coronavirus on board despite media reports,\u201d the company said. It had earlier said the Westerdam was sailing toward Bangkok, and it is not immediately clear whether the ship would change course. Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, has appealed for all people to stay at home as much as possible, Reuters is reporting. It follows the evacuation of a residential building where four people showed symptoms of the flu-like virus. The government said it was investigating pipes within the building amid concerns the virus may have been spread through the system, raising concerns of a community outbreak. Vietnam now has 15 confirmed cases of the virus, the health ministry said on Tuesday, after a three-month-old baby girl tested positive. The baby was infected by her grandmother, the ministry said in a statement, Reuters reported. Ten out of 15 confirmed cases are in the northern province of Vinh Phuc, the ministry said. Vietnam has made plans to quarantine hundreds of its citizens returning from China, including 950 at military camps outside Hanoi, and another 900 at temporary facilties on the Vietnam-China border. The coronavirus outbreak remains the biggest challenge facing the global economy over coming months, says the consultancy Capital Economics, which has cut its forecast for first quarter growth in China from 5% year-on-year to 3% year-on-year. Although chief economist Neil Shearing says it is impossible to determine the exact outcome, he says \u201cChina\u2019s role at the centre of global supply chains increases the likelihood that the disruption spreads to other countries. Economies in Emerging Asia look most vulnerable, as do firms operating in both the tech and electronics sectors\u201d. He says that the bounce back in the stock market since initial falls caused by concerns about the virus made sense because investors were right to expect central banks to keep interest rates low and therefore underwrite asset prices. But the global economy was still walking a tightrope between \u201crates remaining low enough to support current asset valuations and economic growth on the one hand, and markets being able to allocate capital efficiently in a world of continued low rates on the other. The longer it goes on, the more difficult the balancing act will become\u201d He concludes: The fallout from the coronavirus remains the biggest challenge facing the global economy over coming months and, as things stand, it is unclear how events will play out. But the market response to the virus reveals a deeper vulnerability at the heart of the global economy. The current goldilocks environment of low but positive growth and low interest rates justifies the high valuation of asset prices. But the longer it continues, the greater the risk that it sows the seeds of the next major economic downturn. You can read more on how the outbreak might impact the world economy here: In terms of travelling to China, Greg Hunt, says the advice to Australians remains: \u201cdo not travel to China\u201d. Brendan Murphy is being asked if we should expect the number of infected passengers on the cruise ship in Japan to rise. Murphy says; So cruise ships are well known as a place where communicable diseases are there.We\u2019ve all heard of norovirus on cruise ships. It can pretty much affect half or more of the population. So at the moment, given the quarantining period, it\u2019s still likely that all of those cases were infected before the quarantining was instituted. He says it\u2019s not surprising there were a lot of infections before the quarantine period started. A reporter asks about the apparent lack of reported cases in Indonesia. Brendan Murphy says: I think we\u2019re watching that situation in Indonesia.Obviously, it is somewhat surprising that there are no cases, but I believe that they do have some testing capability now and we will be closing watching what happens in Indonesia. Reporters are asking if Australia will extend the current travel ban. Brendan Murphy says this is being regularly reviewed: We\u2019re going to have a very serious consideration of that at the end of this week. And I think that the important thing is that what ever period is put in place, we are reviewing this every day, and if the situation changes, we\u2019ll provide advice to Government on a daily basis, as necessary. The current travel advice to Australia from the department of home affairs is as follows: As of 1 February 2020, all travellers arriving from any part of mainland China, regardless of nationality, will be subject to enhanced border control measures to ensure the health, safety and well-being of the Australian community. Australia will deny entry to anyone who has left or transited mainland China from 1 February, with the exception of: Australian citizens permanent residents immediate family members of Australian citizens and permanent residents including spouses, minor dependents and legal guardians Murphy says the sheer scale of the outbreak in Hubei province may mean there are mild and undetected cases there. We\u2019re clearly getting growth every day. The rate of growth \u2013 potentially is flat a bit at the moment, but early to say. Because most of the data is coming out of China. China, sometimes the data can be a little bit patchy. So we\u2019ve just got to watch that. But there doesn\u2019t seem to be quite the rate of growth in the last few days as before, but I wouldn\u2019t want to draw any conclusions from that. We\u2019re now hearing from Australia\u2019s chief health officer, Prof Brendan Murphy. He reiterates Hunt\u2019s message that there should be no discrimination against the Chinese community in Australia. We have not yet seen anyone without contact from Hubei Province or been from Hubei Province detected inAustralia. As the minister said also, our risk population is people who have come from China fromFebruary 1. Not people of Chinese background. People who have come from China, whatever their background is. And we are very concerned about xenophobia and any sort of racial profiling which is completely abhorrent. We\u2019re talking about a relatively small number of people just because of where they\u2019ve been, not who they are. There is no community transmission of this virus in Australia. We have not seen any case of sustained transmission at all in this country. There is no reason for people to be wearing masks. There\u2019s no reason for people to avoid anybody of any particular background or appearance. I want to reassure the community. Australia\u2019s health minister, Greg Hunt, is holding press conference. He is denouncing discrimination against the Australian Chinese community, which he says has arisen as a result of the coronavirus. \u201cThere remain only 15 reported and confirmed cases in Australia. Five at this point have recovered,\u201d he says. The 10 cases are stable. Australia evacuated a plane-load of citizens from Wuhan to Christmas Island off the coast of Western Australia. He says one more patient on the island is being tested as a precaution. Of the 229 Australians aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, 11 have tested positive for coronavirus. They are being treated off the ship. 218 Australian passengers remain onboard. Reuters is reporting that the first coronavirus infection has been confirmed in San Diego, California in a person who was aboard the first US evacuation flight from Wuhan, China to a Miramar airbase. This takes the number of confirmed cases in the US to 13. Japan is to allow older passengers and those with chronic health conditions to leave the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise liner, amid growing concern about onboard sanitation and the state of their health, the Kyodo news agency has reported. The government initially said all 3,700 passengers and crew would have to stay on the ship throughout its 14-day quarantine in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, in an attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus. So far 135 among the 439 passengers tested have been diagnosed with the virus and have been transferred to local hospitals. But authorities are poised to allow other vulnerable passengers to disembark from Tuesday, Kyodo said, citing an unnamed source. Conditions aboard the vessel pose a health risk to older passengers, some of whom require medication for conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes. About 80% of the 2,600 passengers are aged 60 or over, with 215 in their 80s and 11 in their 90s, Kyodo said. The news agency quoted Masahiro Kami, head of the Medical Governance Research Institute, a nonprofit organisation, as saying that older people with chronic illnesses could see their health deteriorate if they are confined to cramped cabins. \u201cThey will be susceptible to virus infection and risk their lives,\u201d Kami said. The health ministry is so far sticking with plans to allow passengers who show no signs of the virus to leave the vessel on 19 February. The ministry has sent medications to about 750 passengers, but one person aboard told Kyodo that some passengers who were feeling unwell needed proper medical care. \u201cWe want the government to send more doctors, nurses and consultants,\u201d the passenger said. On Monday a group of passengers wrote to the health ministry to warn that the long quarantine was beginning to affect standards of hygiene. \u201cCabins have gone largely uncleaned and bed linens unchanged for nearly a week,\u201d the letter said, according to the Nikkei Asian Review. \u201cThe environment on board is rapidly growing worse day by day.\u201d The Diamond Princess has been kept in quarantine since 5 February after it emerged that a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong late last month had tested positive for the coronavirus. I\u2019m just looking at some of the key dates for deaths in China with regards to the virus. As I mentioned earlier, the first death was reported in China on 11 January. By 24 January the World Health Organization (WHO) said there had been 25 deaths in China from the virus. That\u2019s just 18 days ago. As of midnight Monday into Tuesday, there are 1,016 deaths. Kyodo is reporting that Japanese health authorities will allow older and chronically ill passengers off the Diamond Princess amid growing concern about their health. They will instead spend the rest of their quarantine in local hospitals. Many passengers are in their 70s and 80s and there have been complaints that they aren\u2019t getting medicine they needed for other conditions such as high blood pressure, and diabetes. Shanghai is still very quiet again today, after people returned to work on Monday. AFP\u2019s deputy China bureau chief, Laurent Thomet, has made a good point about the death toll - the first death was reported on 11 January ... it has increased 1,000-fold. Asia Pacific stock markets have opened strongly today despite the growing coronavirus death toll after Wall Street reached yet more all-time highs in Monday\u2019s session. The ASX200 rose 0.3% in Sydney and the Kospi was up 0.7% in Seoul. The Nikkei is closed today for a public holiday in Japan. The Hong Kong and Chinese markets open in less than an hour. Despite the upward trend, there is clearly some concern on the markets. The safe havens of gold and the US dollar have risen today and bond yields and oil are continuing to fall, indicating that traders are not confident about the outlook for the world economy. On Wall Street earlier, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 174.31 points, or 0.6%, to 29,276.82. The S&amp;P 500 gained 24.38 points, or 0.73%, to 3,352.09 and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 107.88 points, or 1.13%, to 9,628.39. One investor who spoke to Reuters, Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, summed up the optimistic moodin the US: \u201cWe know the coronavirus will affect results at least in first quarter. (But) we\u2019ll be back to growth as usual for the rest of the year.\u201d We\u2019re getting some more detail now on the new deaths inside China from the National Health Commission. Total deaths from outbreak: 1,016 Total new deaths in past 24 hours: 116 Total confirmed cases: 42,638 Suspected cases: 21,675 Usually the commission provides details of where all the deaths have taken place. But this is not available on this latest release, although it did say earlier that 103 of the new deaths had been in Hubei. The final update also does not give the details of how many new cases are in Hubei. With limited opportunities for residents in many Chinese cities to get out of their homes to shop, and with many shops closed, buses in Shanxi province have been turned into food markets. China\u2019s president has made a rare public appearance during this virus outbreak, visiting a hospital in Beijing. Wearing a face mask, Xi Jinping had his temperature checked while visiting medical workers and patients affected by the outbreak. Xi has been notably absent from view, including from media, over the past week or so. He has not visited Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, but instead sent his number two, Li Keqiang. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, with me, Alison Rourke. Here\u2019s a summary of what we know so far The death toll has passed 1,000 in China and infections have risen over 42,000. The new coronavirus represents a serious and imminent threat to public health, the UK\u2019s health secretary declared. British Airways has extended the suspension of flights serving Chinese cities: flights to and from Beijing and Shanghai had been cancelled until 31 March. The World Health Organization has said recent cases of coronavirus reported in France and the UK could \u201cbe the spark that becomes a bigger fire\u201d.
