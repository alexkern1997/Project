Please go to our new liveblog: Coronavirus latest updates Here\u2019s a summary of the latest events: Two people died in the United Arab Emirates; the first deaths suffered by the country. The country\u2019s official news agency, WAM, said each had suffered from previous health conditions. Israel also announced its first death. The country\u2019s health ministry has said an 88-year-old man who had been suffering from previous illnesses had died. A member of the US vice president\u2019s staff tested positive. The employee, who was not identified, had not come into close contact with either the US president, Donald Trump, or his boss, Mike Pence, who is in charge of the US\u2019s coronavirus response. You can read a summary of the day\u2019s earlier events here. Panama has confirmed 200 coronavirus cases, up from 137 on Thursday, the country\u2019s health minister has said. Pence\u2019s press secretary, Katie Miller, has said the vice president\u2019s office office was notified about the staffer\u2019s positive test on Friday evening. The statement did not name the individual. \u201cFurther contact tracing is being conducted in accordance with CDC guidelines,\u201d she said, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cuba is going to stop allowing foreigners to enter the island, with the exception of residents, in a bid to contain the outbreak, its president Miguel Diaz-Canel has said. A member of the US vice president\u2019s staff has tested positive, Reuters reports, citing Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary. Pence was placed in charge of Washington\u2019s response to the pandemic by the US president, Donald Trump. Neither the president nor the vice president had been in close contact with the patient, the press secretary said. Argentina\u2019s authorities are trying hard to enforce the nationwide mandatory quarantine imposed Friday by President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, with great difficulty in some cases. In the northern city of Jujuy, police in white full-body sanitary suits tried to arrest a group of youngsters who defied the quarantine, in a dramatic chase captured by an onlooker around San Mart\u00edn park Friday morning (ART). The French Riviera city of Nice will be put under curfew from Saturday night, the local prefect has said, adding that it\u2019s necessary to enforce strict confinement measures decided by France. Bernard Gonzalez has told BFM TV: A curfew is going to be put in place. This decree is essentially aimed at those who find it funny to gather together and defy public authorities. The curfew will start at 11pm local time (10pm GMT) and run until the early hours of the morning. Any irresponsible failure to adopt social distancing must end, Ireland\u2019s president has said. Michael D Higgins appealed to young people to respond to official advice on limiting the spread of Covid-19. Another 126 cases were confirmed in Ireland on Friday, bringing the total to 683, and three people have died. Higgins signed into law emergency health legislation giving the power to impose detention and other measures. These new health and social measures may be difficult for many but they affect us all and we are at a point now when a person\u2019s actions have consequences not only for themselves but for all in society. Irresponsible individual action puts all at risk. We must draw on our strengths now. Large numbers of young people have been seen socialising in Dublin\u2019s Temple Bar, despite a high-profile warning against gatherings a short time earlier from the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. We reported earlier that the District of Columbia and New Jersey were announcing new restrictions. Now, the governor of Illinois, Jay Pritzker, has ordered all residents to \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d, beginning on Saturday evening (CDT). All non-essential businesses are to close indefinitely. Using a term that usually refers to the response to mass shootings, the governor said: To avoid the loss of tens of thousands of lives we must order an immediate shelter-in-place. Pritzker said the order does not mean people cannot go outside at all, but they are to stay home unless it is essential to go to food shops, pharmacies, doctors\u2019 office, fuel stations, or other essential places. He called it a very difficult choice and said in the short-term it likely cost some people jobs. Ultimately, you can\u2019t have a livelihood if you don\u2019t have a life. The governor also said the scheduled date for all public schools in the state to reopen has been indefinitely postponed. I want to be honest with you: we don\u2019t know yet all the steps that we\u2019re going to have to take. The clampdown follows similar orders in California and New York. At least 11 people have died from the coronavirus outbreak in Brazil, up from seven on Thursday, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. Infections now number 904, the ministry said, compared with 621 the previous day. Brazil is currently Latin America\u2019s hardest hit country by the outbreak. Similarly, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium Helen Dickinson has said: The VAT deferral is a vital lifeline for thousands of firms and millions of jobs in UK retail. Hardworking staff across the retail industry should benefit from the coronavirus job retention scheme, which will guarantee wages and help keep people in jobs. But it is essential that both are delivered promptly and effectively. In the UK, where the prime minister has told the likes of pubs and restaurants to close their doors, the British Beer and Pub Association has welcomed measures announced at the same time aimed at keeping firms in business. The association\u2019s chief executive, Emma McClarkin, has said: The government has been clear that pubs must now shut down. The safety and wellbeing of people is our priority. We stand ready to play our part in the fight against Covid-19 and in the process protecting our communities and employees. As a sector employing nearly one million people, the chancellor\u2019s support package announced today on staff wages will safeguard thousands of livelihoods and help closed pubs try to get through this difficult period. We stand ready to work with the government to ensure that the support is accessible as fast as possible. There remain areas where we need further support to sustain our great brewing and pub sector through this difficult time, to ensure that all staff will have jobs to return to and to guarantee all pubs can reopen again when this crisis is over and continue to be at the heart of communities up and down the country. Two people have died in the United Arab Emirates, its health ministry has said. The country\u2019s official news agency, WAM, reports that the two deaths are cases that suffered from previous health conditions. The death toll in Turkey due to the coronavirus has risen to nine, the country\u2019s health minister, Fahrettin Koca, has said. He added that there was a total of 670 confirmed cases in the country; a 24-hour increase of 311. An 88-year-old man who was suffering from previous illnesses has died in Israel, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. It said the man had been brought to the hospital about a week ago in serious condition. Israel has reported 705 cases of coronavirus, the large majority with mild symptoms. About 10 patients are in serious condition and 15 have recovered completely. The UK\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, has spoken to the UN\u2019s secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, about the need for global cooperation, Downing Street has said. They agreed on the need for a global response to this global challenge, and for countries to coordinate in order to stop the spread of the virus and limit the economic impact on our citizens. They underlined the importance of continued funding for the development of a vaccine and to support the resilience of healthcare systems in developing countries. The prime minister said that the UK had already committed \u00a3241m to the international response and would continue to look at what further support was necessary. The number of confirmed cases in Costa Rica has reached 113; an increase of 26 on Thursday, the government has said. It is the country\u2019s largest single day rise so far. Two people have died so far in the Central American country and the health minister, Daniel Salas, has said the next 15 days will determine how badly the global pandemic will affect Costa Rica. Beaches have been closed across the country in an effort to stop the advance of the virus, with citizens asked to stay home throughout the crisis if possible. In Zimbabwe, the health minister Obadiah Moyo said a man who lives in Victoria Falls, a popular tourist destination, has been infected. Moyo said the 38-year-old had travelled to Britain on 7 March, returning home via neighbouring South Africa on 15 March. He put himself in self-quarantine upon arrival and later called his doctor after realising he was not feeling too well,\u201d the Associated Press quoted the minister as saying. Zimbabwe declared a national disaster days ago and some citizens have openly dreaded the pandemic\u2019s arrival. Already public hospitals lack basic items such as gloves. Relatives of patients are expected in some cases to even provide buckets of water. But Zimbabwe\u2019s government has insisted it is well prepared to deal with the outbreak. This post originally and incorrectly said the infected man had died. It has been updated. In America, several areas are putting in place new restrictions. The District of Columbia\u2019s mayor, Muriel Bowser, says social distancing directives for schools, local government and mass gatherings will be extended to 27 April. And New Jersey\u2019s governor, Phil Murphy, says he\u2019s planning to order the shutting down of all non-essential businesses and that he \u201calmost certainly\u201d will tighten rules on gatherings to restrict them to no more than 10 people \u2013 or possibly even ban them altogether. Here\u2019s a little more detail on those Italian park closures we reported earlier. From Saturday, parks and public gardens will be shut down and people will be allowed to take exercise only around their homes, Reuters reported, citing a government directive it has obtained. Games and recreational activities in the open air will also be prohibited. \u201cWe must do even more to contain the contagion,\u201d the health minister, Roberto Speranza, said. The death toll from the outbreak in Italy leapt by 627 to 4,032 on Friday, with 47,021 confirmed cases. Brazil\u2019s universal health system will soon be overloaded by Covid-19 pressure, the country\u2019s health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, has warned. \u201cClearly by the end of April our health system will begin to collapse,\u201d he said during a teleconference with members of Brazil\u2019s business elite, wearing a mask and sitting next to President Jair Bolsonaro. \u201cCollapse is when there is money, health plans, but no room in the hospitals,\u201d he added, making comparisons with Italy; which recently overtook China\u2019s Covid-19 deaths. Brazil so far has so far recorded 612 cases and eight deaths. According to the minister, the number of cases will begin to climb rapidly in April and continue through May, June and July before levelling out in August and falling in September. In his letter Rouhani warns: The coronavirus outbreak has endangered the health of \u2013 and even presented a considerable threat to \u2013 humanity with no distinction as to nationality, or gender or religious backgrounds. This presents an opportune moment to further contemplate our common pains and our human principles. Today, all of humankind feels apprehensive toward the future; a future threatened in every aspect; be it health, business, and even social relationships and the way of life. The level of unpredictability and uncertainty is simply unprecedented. In language Tehran has rarely directed towards the US since the 1979 Islamic revolution, Rouhani urged the American people to form an alliance with Iran to fight a common enemy. It is self-evident that our success in what is likely to be a long fight depends on the spiritual and heartfelt affinity of all human beings. The international defence that we have to mount will not be successful without camaraderie on the part of the whole of humankind. Today, instead of soldiers belonging to different armies, human soldiers, donning similar colour uniforms belonging to no particular country are selflessly and altruistically at war against the enemy of humans across the globe. In this common fight, we all belong to one front. The US has so far not shown any willingness to relax sanctions, arguing instead that humanitarian exemptions mean the sanctions have not damaged Iran\u2019s ability to combat the virus. The US has largely accused Iran of failing to take the necessary steps to stem the spread of the virus, saying lack of resources has not been an issue. The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, made a direct emotional appeal to the American people to persuade Donald Trump\u2019s government to lift their sanctions against his country, saying anything that restricts Iran\u2019s own fight against the pandemic will undermine the fight against the virus throughout the world. Any hostile actor seeking to undermine Iran\u2019s health system and restricting the needed financial resources to tackle the crisis will undermine the fight against the pandemic all over the world. The time has come for American people to halt this dark chapter in American history. Rouhani added that Tehran, Paris, London and Washington were not that far apart in terms of the spread of the virus. His remarks came after the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zaif, sought to enlist the help of the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, and the `EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrel, to use their influence to persuade Washington to relax their sanctions. Italy is taking ever tougher measures; closing all parks and telling people they can only exercise around their homes, Reuters reports. The country\u2019s health minister has said Italians \u201cmust do more\u201d to contain the outbreak. In the UK, Transport for London (TfL) is suspending road charges in order to help key workers get around the capital \u2013 but authorities are adding that other people should be avoiding the roads wherever possible. The congestion charge and the ultra-low and low emission zones are all to be suspended from Monday and until further notice. Wales first minister, Mark Drakeford, said he agreed with the measures announced by prime minister, Boris Johnson, to close pubs, clubs and restaurants. \u201cHealth is a devolved responsibility, and as Welsh ministers, we will tonight exercise our powers under the 1984 Public Health Act in order to close restaurants, pubs, bars and other facilities where people gather,\u201d Drakeford said. He added: \u201cThis also includes leisure centres, gyms, cinemas, theatres and betting shops. I will sign the necessary regulations later tonight, and they will come into force immediately.\u201d \u201cWe do not take this move lightly, and we know this will be immensely difficult for those employed in the industries affected.\u201d Head of the French health authority J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon in his daily update said the situation was worsening rapidly in France. Urged people to follow strictly the advice keep 1m distance and wash hands. It is \u201curgent\u201d to do this, he said. There are now 12,612 confirmed cases in France, and 450 deaths. Of the deaths, 87% were aged over 70 years old. There are 5,226 people in hospital, 35% of them over 65 years old: 1,297 of these are in intensive care, 50% under 60 years old. 1,587 have been released from hospital. \u201cYou should not wear a mask if you are not ill. These are resources that should be reserved for health professionals,\u201d Salomon said A US disaster relief group opened a field hospital on Friday in Italy\u2019s north, as the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll showed no sign of easing. Samaritan\u2019s Purse, a Christian disaster response group based in North Carolina, began setting up the respiratory care unit in Cremona, about 90 kilometres (60 miles) southeast of Milan, and expected to receive its first patients later Friday. The unit, located in the parking lot across from the city hospital, provides eight intensive care unit beds equipped with ventilators, 20 beds for general care, a laboratory and pharmacy, and is set to expand over the weekend. \u201cWe came here because our fellow brothers and sisters, our Italian brothers and sisters, are hurting,\u201d said Kelly Suter, health director of the new hospital. Hospitals in Paris are scrambling to find more intensive care beds, ventilators and medical staff ahead of an expected spike in the number of coronavirus patients in coming days, with the figure expected to peak in April, doctors said. Coronavirus cases in Paris and its suburbs now account for about a quarter of the 11,000 cases across France, and has about 250 now in intensive care, up from just 50 five days ago. The death toll in all France as of Friday evening stood at 450. \u201cWe are working at full speed to ramp up the number of intensive care beds,\u201d Antoine Vieillard-Baron, head of the surgical and medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the University Hospital Ambroise Pare, told a conference call with reporters. Belgium became the latest European country to close its borders to contain the coronavirus Friday, shutting them to all but freight and travellers deemed to be on essential business. Interior minister Pieter De Crem said the decision had been taken after \u201cintensive contacts\u201d with Belgium\u2019s neighbours, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Coronavirus can sicken or kill young people, who must also avoid mingling and spreading it to older and more vulnerable people, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, told a virtual press conference: \u201cToday I have a message for young people: You are not invincible, this virus could put you in hospital for weeks or even kill you. Even if you don\u2019t get sick the choices you make about where you go could be the difference between life and death for someone else.\u201d Amid shortages of protective gear for health workers and diagnostic tests, \u201cair bridges\u201d will be needed to bring supplies to countries for vital health workers, the WHO\u2019s top emergency expert Dr Mike Ryan said. The World Health Organization said Friday that the Chinese centre of the coronavirus outbreak at last reporting no new cases gave hope to the rest of the world battling the pandemic. The city of Wuhan registered no new cases of Covid-19 in 24 hours - for the first time since reporting its first case in December in an outbreak that has gone on to infect more than 250,000 people around the world and kill more than 11,000 people. US-Mexico border is closed to non-essential travel as coronavirus outbreak continues. In Greece, the government has announced further restrictions on movement to curb the spread of the novel virus as the death toll from Covid-19 climbed to eight. As of 6am tomorrow, travel to islands will only be allowed by local residents, following mounting evidence of Athenians snapping up ferry bookings for islands en masse. Ships carrying essential provisions will be exempt from the ban. Pleasure boats out at sea will also have to dock permanently \u2013 a stringent measure in a country with one of the longest coastlines in Europe. The restrictions came as Greek health authorities said confirmed coronavirus cases had risen to 495, an increase of 31 since yesterday, even if presumptive cases are thought to be higher. Most are in Athens. Announcing the latest figures, infectious diseases professor, Sotiris Tsiodras, the Greek health ministry spokesman on coronavirus, blasted Greeks for also heading to villages from the capital, emphasising the risks posed of transmission to remote areas and reiterating the next few weeks were critical. The centre-right government has stopped short of issuing a country-wide curfew, but has signalled it may well be forced to extend an already draconian lockdown if Greeks continue to flout restrictions. The deputy civil protection minister, Nikos Hardalias, also attending the early evening update on Friday, said the government was considering imposing heavier fines on those caught violating measures. Group gatherings of more than ten are banned with 1,000 euro penalties, per person, for infractions. Italy announces 627 more coronavirus deaths, the biggest day-to-day increase in the country\u2019s four-week epidemic. The total number of deaths was 4,032, with the number of infections reaching 47,021. Italy\u2019s previous one-day record death toll was 475 on Wednesday. UK will close all cafes, bars and restaurants and the government said it would pay 80% of wages of those not working. Trump has invoked new powers to speed up virus supplies. US president Donald Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act to get needed medical supplies on the front lines of the coronavirus outbreak, mobilizing the federal government to marshal the private sector to combat the pandemic. There have now been at least 10,316 deaths from coronavirus since it emerged and more than half of those deaths (5,168) have been in Europe, according to an AFP tally based on official sources. More than a quarter of a million cases have been detected in 161 countries and territories around the world. The Tunisian president, Kais Saied, on Friday ordered a general lockdown, restricting public movement to counter the spread of the coronavirus. Among the other worst-affected countries is Iran with 1,433 deaths and 19,644 cases, Spain, with 1,002 deaths and 19,980 cases, France with 372 deaths and 10,995 cases, and the United States with 205 deaths and 14,250 cases. Dr Maria van Kerkhove, speaking at the WHO briefing, said: \u201cThink of a large gathering, people are close to one another and if you have an infected individual in that cluster... the opportunity for the virus to pass between people is much greater.\u201d She added: \u201cPhysical distancing is not enough. It has to be part of a larger package of interventions\u201d. A question is asked about the mortality rate in Europe \u2013 with Italy\u2019s tragically higher and Germany\u2019s lower. Dr Maria van Kerkhove said there was no information about how each country is recording deaths. She said: \u201cWe spoke about this the other day: the difference in mortality compared by country. You have to be careful about how you compare countries ... First it is about populations that the virus is infecting ... moving in older populations we know can cause more deaths. There are a number of factors in which mortality can vary between different populations. Also discussed was the challenges of describing mortality as an epidemic, or pandemic, unfold ... This is just a snapshot of what true mortality is... There are a number of individuals very severe and still in ICU \u2013 some will recover and some will die. We don\u2019t have precise numbers of death.\u201d Italy reported a record 627 new deaths from the novel coronavirus, taking its overall toll past 4,000 as the pandemic gathered pace despite government efforts to halt its spread. The total number of deaths was 4,032, with the number of infections reaching 47,021. Italy\u2019s previous one-day record death toll was 475 on Wednesday. The nation of 60 million now accounts for 36.6% of the world\u2019s coronavirus deaths. Italy has seen more than 1,500 deaths from Covid-19 in the past three days alone. Its current daily death rate is higher than that officially reported by China at the peak of its outbreak around Wuhan\u2019s Hubei province. Dr Maria van Kerkhove, speaking at the WHO briefing, said people can keep connected in many ways without being in the same space. \u201cWe are saying physical distance ... we want people to remain connected through the internet and social media because your mental health, when going through this, is just as important as your physical health.\u201d Misinformation is impacting on efforts to quell the coronavirus pandemic as even \u201cvery well educated\u201d people share false cures, hoaxes and conspiracy theories online, experts warned as recorded cases continued to climb . The World Health Organization (WHO) has increased its efforts to tackle myths and rumours since it warned in February of a massive \u201cinfodemic\u201d, a deluge of information, including false claims that can risk public health. The WHO\u2019s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \u201cI have a message for young peopole: you are not invincible. This virus could put you in hospital for weeks or even kill you.\u201d Italy announces 627 more coronavirus deaths, the biggest day-to-day increase in the country\u2019s four-week epidemic. Boris Johnson is telling cafes, bars, and restaurants to close as soon as possible and not to open tomorrow. He said they can provide takeaway services. He also ordered nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres to close. He said: \u201cYou may be tempted to go out tonight and I say to you please don\u2019t, you may think that you are invincible - but there is no guarantee that you will get it. \u201cBut you can still be a carrier of the disease and pass it on.\u201d He added: \u201cWe want you as far as possible to stay at home.\u201d Follow the full briefing from Johnson via our UK live blog. Boris Johnson is now talking to the media, giving his 5pm briefing. You can follow it live via the link below. New measures are expected as he updates the nation on his government\u2019s response. He will be joined by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor and Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer. There is now a World Health Organisation briefing being streamed live from the top of our live blog. Uki Go\u00f1i reports from Buenos There was panic on a ferry with 385 passengers doing the one hour crossing from Uruguay to Argentina Thursday night when it was discovered that a 21-year-old male coronavirus patient was on board. Ambulances with health officials in full-body white sanitary suits rushed to greet the ferry\u2019s arrival in Buenos Aires. They boarded the ship and quickly removed the youngster to a private health clinic. Argentina\u2019s security ministry tweeted images of the procedure and said it had arrested the young man as well as two female passengers who refused to be screened upon arrival. Nine persons, including the young man, have been placed in hospitals, while the remaining passengers and crew of 19 have been placed in quarantine. According to press reports, the young Argentinian had recently arrived from Holland. In Uruguay he developed symptoms and was under observation at a a medical facility. Some reports say he escaped the facility, others that he left before receiving his test results. With a group of friends, the teenager is said to have managed to trick the fever inspection at the port of Colonia by taking a paracetamol before boarding. The exact details are still forthcoming. According to one report, Uruguayan authorities alerted the ferry company Buquebus of the situation when the ferry was about to arrive in Buenos Aires. Another report states that the young man started feeling unwell and alerted ship officials that he had been diagnosed with coronavirus. The young man is said to have received an email while on board from the Uruguayan clinic saying he had tested positive. Passengers who had started to disembark were told to return to their original seats to work out who had been sitting in close proximity to the young man, a passenger on the ship said in a WhatsApp audio to his family. \u201cThis is total chaos,\u201d the passenger said. Passengers and crew have been distributed among four hotels in downtown Buenos Aires, which have been turned into makeshift quarantine facilities. Some passengers resisted being quarantined and had to be forcibly removed from the ferry, with images of their resistance going viral. Johnny Depp\u2019s UK libel case has been postponed due to coronavirus. A libel case brought by Hollywood actor Johnny Depp against Britain\u2019s the Sun newspaper, over allegations he abused his ex-wife Amber Heard, was suspended Friday due to the coronavirus outbreak. Thanks to those who have been sending me information and please continue to do so. Any news tips or insight from where you are will help us build a picture of what is happening. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com US president Donald Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act to get needed medical supplies on the front lines of the coronavirus outbreak, mobilizing the federal government to marshal the private sector to combat the pandemic. Trump had said earlier in the week he would tap the act as needed. He said Friday he has put that in gear. Trump also announced an effective closure of the US border with Mexico, prohibiting most travel except for trade. That brings it in line with the restriction on the Canadian border earlier this week. The world underestimated the pandemic, says Ian Goldin, an Oxford University professor who predicted it. In 2015, Goldin warned in his book \u201cThe Butterfly Defect\u201d about the risks of a global pandemic in a modern, interdependent world. It appears though that not everyone was listening. Governments, Goldin argues, did not truly understand the potentially enormous dangers posed by astonishing events such as those witnessed across the world in the last few weeks. Trump said he did not believe a national lockdown was necessary at this stage, while New York and California have told residents to stay indoors except for essential activities. The president said New York and California are \u201chotbeds\u201d of coronavirus, but some parts of the country do not have to take the same steps. Read more on the Guardian US live blog, which is now updating on his briefing. A jet carrying 359 people including hundreds of American and Canadian cruise ship passengers home from France landed at Atlanta\u2019s international airport on Friday as emergency responders prepared to screen them for the coronavirus, federal officials said. Three people on the flight have tested positive for COVID-19 but have no symptoms, while 13 others are sick but haven\u2019t been tested, the US Department of Health and Human Services said Friday. Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force response coordinator, said data from Italy indicate the coronavirus fatality rate is twice as high for men across all age groups. Birx reiterated the virus appears to be less deadly for younger people, but she emphasized younger Americans still need to take precautions. \u201cNo one is immune,\u201d Birx said. \u201cWe know it\u2019s highly contagious to everyone. Do not interpret mild or moderate disease as lack of contagion or that you\u2019re immune. The total number of confirmed coronavirus-related deaths in the UK now stands at 177. There have been 167 in England, six in Scotland, three in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. Brazil declared a state of emergency on Friday, freeing up funds for the federal government to fight the coronavirus pandemic, as President Bolsonaro\u2019s popularity declined over his handling of the crisis. The Senate approved a measure letting the government waive fiscal targets this year, with senators voting remotely after two of them tested positive for the virus causing the COVID-19 respiratory disease. Leyland Cecco in Toronto, Canada Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has announced his government will turn away asylum seekers at the US-Canada border as a temporary measure, meant to further halt the flow of people into Canada amid the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cCanada and the United States are announcing a reciprocal arrangement that we will now be returning irregular migrants that attempt to cross anywhere at the Canada-US border,\u201d Trudeau said Friday. Speaking to reporters from self-isolation for the fifth day in a row, Trudeau said the plan to deny entry into Canada for asylum seekers is part of a broader agreement struck with the United States. The two countries announced plans earlier this week to shutter the 5,500 mile shared border to all non-essential travel. Trudeau stressed the \u201cexceptional measure\u201d to deny asylum seekers was temporary. The federal government had previously weighed placing those seeking to enter Canada into mandatory self-isolation. Canada has received roughly nearly 55,000 asylum claims since February, 2017. The prime minister also announced plans to support manufacturing companies across the country, including large automative companies, as they quickly retool much of their production lines to build much-needed medical equipment, including ventilators and masks. Early indications suggest the virus is hitting the Canadian economy hard as businesses across the country close. Trudeau said the government has received 500,000 employment insurance applications this week\u2014 compared to 27,000 from the same period in the prior year. Canada has close to 1,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 11 documented deaths from the virus. The US President, Donald Trump, said on Friday he had put the Defense Production Act into action after saying earlier this week he would invoke the measure but essentially put it on hold until needed. The measure is meant to allow the US government to speed production of masks, respirators, ventilators and other needed equipment to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Trump said he put the measure into action on Thursday evening. There have now been at least 10,316 deaths from coronavirus since it emerged and more than half of those deaths (5,168) have been in Europe, according to an AFP tally based on official sources. More than a quarter of a million cases have been detected in 161 countries and territories around the world. Italy has overtaken China as the worst country with the most virus-linked deaths, with 3,405 as well as 41,035 cases. Among the other worst-affected countries is Iran with 1,433 deaths and 19,644 cases, Spain, with 1,002 deaths and 19,980 cases, France with 372 deaths and 10,995 cases, and the United States with 205 deaths and 14,250 cases. For a second consecutive day China has reports no new domestic cases. But it is now worried about a second wave of infections coming from abroad and on Friday the health commission reports 39 more imported cases. International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach says it is \u201cpremature\u201d to postpone the Tokyo Games planned for July-August, but admits the body is \u201cconsidering different scenarios\u201d. Pharmaceutical industry executives say they expect it will take 12 to 18 months to roll out a vaccine and jointly pledge to make it available worldwide based on need. The Canada-US border is expected to be closed by Saturday for non-essential travel. The same measure is being considered for the US-Mexico border. Trump said US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, would announce restrictions on US-Mexican border travel today. However, the president then appeared to preempt the announcement by saying the southern border was closing to non-essential travel. The restrictions mirror those placed on the US-Canadian border earlier this week. Read more on the US politics live blog. I am looking after the Guardian\u2019s coronavirus live blog.

Joe Parkin Daniels in Bogot\u00e1 Bogot\u00e1, Colombia\u2019s capital, is the latest Latin American capital to go into city-wide quarantine, albeit for a trial period until Tuesday. The Andean capital, with a population of nearly 8 million, went under a quarantine at midnight local time, shuttering businesses in a bid to slow the spread of Covid-19. The measure is an effort from local authorities to prepare for widespread quarantines, which they say are now inevitable as confirmed cases of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus reached 128 in Colombia on Thursday. \u201cIt is an exercise in preparation ahead of an eventual quarantine,\u201d Bogot\u00e1\u2019s mayor, Claudia L\u00f3pez, said in a press conference, announcing that bus terminals will also be shut down over the long weekend. \u201cWe must stay in our homes to avoid what happened in Italy when a quarantine was declared and many travelled and spread the virus around the rest of the country.\u201d Capital cities across Latin America are currently locked down, including Lima in Peru, Buenos Aires in Argentina, and Caracas in Venezuela. The quarantine in Bogot\u00e1 has been mimicked by other provincial officials in Colombia, with other cities also locking down despite some confusion sowed by the president, Iv\u00e1n Duque, who on Wednesday said that only the national government has the jurisdiction to declare quarantines. Medell\u00edn and Cali, Colombia\u2019s two largest cities outside Bogot\u00e1, will also go under quarantine on Friday evening. On Thursday, Duque announced that all international flights to Colombia would be suspended from 23 March, and that nationals would be barred from entering after then for a period of 30 days. Land and maritime borders were closed on Tuesday, while gatherings of more than 50 people are banned. The number of coronavirus cases worldwide has just topped a quarter of a million (250,856), according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University. That includes 10,415 deaths and 87,284 who recovered. Some 2,600 US military personnel, including civilians, are in self-isolation in Europe after being identified as people of concern during the coronavirus outbreak, the US military disclosed on Friday. The number is far higher than anything previously reported. \u201cThese individuals are not necessarily sick, but may have been exposed and are doing their due diligence following health preventative measures,\u201d the Pentagon said in a statement. The White House is about to hold its daily coronavirus briefing, where the president is expected to announce restrictions on travel at the US-Mexican border. Follow the Guardian US blog here. Spanish authorities said on Friday they would turn a Madrid conference centre into a giant makeshift military hospital for thousands of coronavirus patients, as Europe\u2019s second-worst outbreak claimed another 235 lives. Spain\u2019s worst single-day death toll yet brought the country\u2019s total fatalities above 1,000. Jordan has announced a round-the-clock curfew from Saturday morning until further notice to battle the coronavirus outbreak, the government announced. The exceptional measure, to be applied for an indefinite period, was taken after \u201ccitizens did not respect directives\u201d calling on them not to leave their homes except for extreme emergencies, government spokesman Amjad Adayleh said. He warned that lack of compliance with the curfew would result in \u201cimmediate imprisonment, which will not exceed one year\u201d. Mexico and the US are set to announce plans on Friday to sharply limit travel over their busy shared border as they try to control the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Mexican foreign secretary, Marcelo Ebrard, said his government and the Trump administration have agreed to a plan that would prohibit recreational and tourist travel, similar to the restrictions put in place earlier this week along the US and Canadian border. New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, has announced all non-essential workers in the state must stay home amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThis is the most drastic action we can take,\u201d Cuomo said. The announcement comes one day after California governor, Gavin Newsom, announced all of the state\u2019s 40 million residents must stay indoors except for essential activities.

In a message to staff, Northwick Park hospital in Harrow said it has no critical care capacity left and was contacting neighbouring hospitals to discuss transferring patients who need critical care to other sites. The message, sent last night, said: I am writing to let you know that we have this evening declared a \u2018critical incident\u2019 in relation to our critical care capacity at Northwick Park hospital. This is due to an increasing number of patients with Covid-19. This means that we currently do not have enough space for patients requiring critical care. As part of our system resilience plans, we have contacted our partners in the North West London sector this evening to assist with the safe transfer of patients off of the Northwick Park site. Tunisian president, Kais Saied, on Friday ordered a general lockdown in the country, restricting public movement to counter the spread of the coronavirus. Speaking in a televised broadcast, Saied said he was asking the majority of people to stay at home and stopping movement between Tunisian cities. The luxury London store Harrods, which stayed open throughout the bombing during the second world war, has announced it is shutting. It will keep open its food halls and pharmacy, but the rest of the department store will close. The welfare of our community of colleagues, customers and partners has been our absolute priority throughout this time of uncertainty,\u201d managing director Michael Ward said in a statement. It will close from 7pm (1900 GMT)on 20 March. At least 5 million people have been designated as \u201ckey workers\u201d in the UK whose jobs are essential to keep the country going during the coronavirus crisis \u2013 but many are paid well below the national average, Guardian analysis has found. Of this group, at least 1.5 million workers earn below the national median salary of \u00a324,897. The lowest paid key workers were checkout workers and shelf fillers, whose median salaries were \u00a310,000 and \u00a312,000 respectively. There were 13 roles in total earning below average wages, including undertakers, welfare administrators and teaching assistants. The median salary of the occupation groups analysed by the Guardian stood at \u00a331,029. Some of the higher paid roles include air traffic controllers, who earn \u00a394,000 a year on average, and doctors, who earn \u00a361,000. Key workers, who include doctors, nurses, midwives, teachers, nursery staff, police and transport workers, are entitled to send their children to schools and nurseries, which are closed indefinitely for the majority of students. The Guardian analysis found equivalents for job roles mentioned in the government\u2019s list of key workers in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings dataset published by the Office for National Statistics. The list of equivalents found will not include all key workers. Earnings are based on full and part-time workers\u2019s median earnings in 2019. The US Homeland Security Department has said restrictions barring non-essential travel across the US-Canadian land border will begin at 11:59pm (EDT) on Friday and last until 20 April, according to a notice. It said that restrictions do not impact air travel or trade or cargo, but does apply to passenger rail and ferry travel. The restrictions stop tourist trips, but allow US citizens and permanent residents to return to the country. The ban includes exceptions for people travelling for medical purposes, attending school or to work in agriculture, public health purposes or military-related travel. Belgium\u2019s Charleroi airport has announced that it will close to commercial flights for at least two weeks because of travel restrictions imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus. The airport, the country\u2019s second busiest and the main continental European hub for budget airline Ryanair, said it would halt operations on Tuesday night until 5 April at the earliest. Hello everyone. I am taking over the live blog now from my colleague Ben. If you want to share any information with me then please do via any of the channels below. Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist With restrictions being eased across China, the world is getting a glimpse of life after coronavirus. In Shanghai, women walk arm in arm past a reopened shopping district. Narrow pavements are crowded as residents browse food shops. At one entrance to a hospital, a man wore his hazmat suit partly unzipped as he waved in cars. In Beijing, traffic has begun to return and more residents can be seen out on the streets, in parks and in shopping and restaurant districts. Jia Shu\u2019na, 20, travelled to Beijing on Wednesday, a stop along her route back home to Inner Mongolia to resume classes. \u201cNow I feel like things are gradually recovering. Now a lot of transportation has opened up,\u201d she said, sitting in a park with her luggage. Jia said she noticed long lines at the train station when she departed from the southern province of Yunnan, and several people in each train car. \u201cMany people have gone out. It\u2019s much better than before,\u201d she said. More than 80,000 people have been infected by the virus that first appeared in the city of Wuhan, killing more than 3,000, but the number of new infections per day has dropped dramatically. Every major carmaker in the UK and Europe is suspending or cutting production as the disruption from the coronavirus outbreak spreads \u2013 with only lower-volume manufacturers such as Aston Martin keeping factories open. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and Bentley Motors have become the latest British carmakers to suspend production at their UK factories. In Sweden, Volvo announced on Friday that it would close its factory, the last remaining high-volume plant in Europe, from 26 March. Europe\u2019s lockdown has disrupted global supply chains, and massively reduced demand in all key markets is thought by most analysts to be all but certain. Opponents of Vladimir Putin\u2019s plans to amend the constitution so that he can run for president again in 2024 have said they had been forced to scale back Russian protests this weekend due to coronavirus, but would press ahead with some demonstrations. Putin\u2019s changes, which have already been approved by both houses of parliament, would overturn a current constitutional ban on him running for president again in 2024, allowing him to potentially stay in power until 2036 Separately, the Kremlin said that Putin has not been tested for coronavirus and does not need to undergo such a test because he is healthy and has no symptoms, Reuters reports. Russia has reported 199 coronavirus cases so far, fewer than in many other European countries. But the figure has risen sharply in recent days and one person diagnosed with the virus has died. A map showing the differing levels of countermeasures has been compiled by Olivier Lejeune, an analyst at the International Energy Agency (IEA). It includes the latest decisions by Argentina and California to impose a full curfew. Lejeune has tried his best to keep it accurate for every country in the world. Bavaria is going to impose curfews from Saturday morning in an attempt to further curb the spread of Corvid-19 in the southernmost German state. From midnight on Friday people in Bavaria will only be allowed to leave their homes if they can show their trip outside is strictly necessary, such as commuting to work, vital shopping, doctors appointments or seeing people who require care. \u201cWe\u2019re shutting down public life almost completely,\u201d Bavarian state premier Markus S\u00f6der said. The conservative politician justified the further restriction of free movement by pointing to the latest spike in figure: confirmed Covid-19 cases in Bavaria rose by 35% from Thursday to Friday, with number of deaths rising to 15. S\u00f6der also said appeals for people to voluntarily curtail their movement had not worked. People would still be allowed outside to go for runs and walks, S\u00f6der said, adding \u201cfresh air is good for you\u201d. People are advised to do so on their own or within family groups, with police advised to hand out fines for non-compliance. In what might be the first case of its kind in British territory, a 26-year-old on the Isle of Man has been arrested for allegedly failing to self-isolate against coronavirus. The suspect was held by police on the island on Thursday, two days after the British crown dependency announced strict measures to prevent the illness spreading. Since Tuesday night, anyone arriving on the island is subject to 14 days of self-isolation even if they do not have symptoms of the virus. The man, who has not been named, will appear in court in Douglas, the island\u2019s capital, on Friday. He faces a fine of up to \u00a310,000 and a possible three-month jail sentence. The island\u2019s chief constable tweets: As coronavirus cases in South Africa jumped on Friday to 202, the most in the sub-Saharan region, the continent\u2019s and the country\u2019s busiest airport said foreigners cannot disembark. The Associated Press also reports that South Africa said five of its new cases had attended a church gathering of more than 200 people in central Free State province. All had traveled abroad. Another new South Africa case was a health worker who had been in a number of private hospitals. Johannesburg\u2019s O.R. Tambo International Airport said that aircraft with foreigners will be contained at an isolated bay. This is a tweet from an hour ago: Thanks to a tip from a reader, we\u2019ve looked at how New York City\u2019s department of health has changed its guidance on doctors and nurses who come into direct, prolonged, and unprotected contact with patients who are known to suffer from the coronavirus. In short, unless they are exhibiting symptoms, they need to keep working. We heard from medical staff who are concerned that the new policy is spreading the disease. The authorities on the French Riviera are using a drone fitted with a loudspeaker to instruct people to \u201cstay home\u201d. The drone flew over Nice this morning and has been deployed over Cannes this afternoon. \u201cRemember the instructions regarding the Covid-19 epidemic. All movements outside the home are banned except where there is a derogation,\u201d was the message. \u201cPlease respect a safe distance of at least one metre between each other,\u201d it added. The device is being piloted by a local drone business run by former police officer Sabri Ben Hassen. \u201cFor the moment, we\u2019ve only one and it\u2019s sending out the message with a 100 decibel speaker. To give some idea, an Airbus produces 120 decibels when it is taking off,\u201d Ben Hassen, 33, told AFP. The operation was commissioned by the local police prefect. Government was today actively discussing a new clampdown on London with pubs, cinemas and gyms being ordered to close to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. An announcement could be made in hours, with concern among crisis planners rising that too many people are continuing to ignore social distancing advice - making the spread of the virus more likely. The British capital is the target of tougher measures because it has the highest rate of infection and deaths so far. Debate within government is continuing about whether non-essential shops - that is those not selling food or medical supplies - would be included in the ban. The Government had been considering a formal ban on Thursday and was braced to announce it - but pulled back.Among senior government figures there is a deep reluctance to issue banning orders. Officials believe they would have the power to order bans even without special emergency laws drafted specifically to battle the pandemic. Crisis planners and government advisers have been looking at various data, such as transport usage in the capital and hospital admissions, to assess if the pleas made on Monday for people to stay home was being heeded. Continuing anecdotal evidence of people, especially younger Londoners, continuing to go to pubs despite repeated pleas has led to government believing it may have no choice but to issue the ban, which may be announced within hours. You can follow the UK coronavirus developments here. The UK government has banned the parallel export of 80 crucial medicines \u2013 including adrenaline, insulin, paracetamol and morphine \u2013 to protect supplies during the coronavirus outbreak. The government describes parallel exporting as \u201cwhen companies buy medicines meant for UK patients and sell on for a higher price in another country, potentially causing or aggravating supply problems\u201d. The Department of Health said that any company found to be parallel exporting could face tough action from the country\u2019s drug regulator, including the removal of their trading licence. The full list of medicines is here. Guardian film editor Catherine Shoard has this on the big fall in takings at the US box office. With only around 440 cinemas of 5,600 still open across the US, Wednesday\u2019s midweek box office takings hit a historic low with $300,000 recorded. Most multiplexes, including the AMC, Regal and Cinemark chains, closed earlier this week. It is thought that some drive-ins, whose revenue is not officially recorded, remain open. The same Wednesday in 2019 recorded almost $11m in ticket sales while last Wednesday\u2019s box office was $7.7 million, according to Comscore. The Hollywood Reporter suggests \u201canalysts say $300,000 is no doubt the lowest number in modern history for a single weekday\u201d. The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, has tweeted that the US states of New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are too close all barber shops, nail and hair salons, tattoo shops, and similar services from tomorrow at 8pm. Journalists in Turkey have put together a day-long campaign calling for the immediate release of jailed colleagues because of the threat posed by Covid-19, reports Bethan McKernan, the Guardian\u2019s Turkey and Middle East correspondent. The video says: Injustice during the time of corona. Some journalists defied pressure and reported the truth for years. They were threatened, detained and arrested for defending the truth. Now, behind bars, they are defenceless against the coronavirus. Once the pandemic breaks out in prisons, it will pose a greater threat. Cleaning supplies are limited, living conditions are unhealthy. Isolation has become more merciless after visits were banned, telephone calls are limited. At these gravest of times, we miss them the most. Release the journalists. More than 120 journalists are still being held in Turkey\u2019s jails, a global record. The situation for the media in the country has not improved since state-of-emergency measures were lifted in 2018, two years after a failed coup, according to the International Press Institute. On Thursday night the Turkish health ministry confirmed that cases of coronavirus have almost doubled in 24 hours to 359 infections and four deaths. A total of 64 people have been detained over \u201cprovocative and baseless\u201d social media posts about the pandemic, the interior ministry said. Worldwide death toll passes 10,000 There have been more than 10,000 deaths from Covid-19 around the world, roughly two-thirds of which have occurred in China and Italy, and more than 240,000 cases of the virus have been confirmed. There have been 205 deaths in the US, 144 in the UK and seven in Australia, as a result of the outbreak. Spanish death toll passes 1,000 The death toll in Spain has surged to 1,002 \u2013 climbing by 235 deaths in the past day \u2013 as the country scrambles to contain an epidemic that has spiralled into one of the worst in Europe. The latest statistics from the country\u2019s health ministry showed 19,980 confirmed cases of Covid-19 across the country. More than a third of the documented cases are in Madrid. On Friday army specialists were set to begin entering care homes to help with disinfection after the virus claimed more than 50 lives at elderly care facilities across the region. Concern as large numbers take to the roads for Iranian new year Appeals by the Iranian government for the nation to stay at home at the start of Iranian new year have been widely ignored with more than 1.2 million taking to the roads, according to the Iranian police. Northern towns on the Caspian coast, one of the main holiday destinations, reported tens of thousands of cars trying to reach them. UK Hotspot being investigated in England\u2019s West Midlands The British government is investigating a sharp rise in the number of coronavirus deaths in the West Midlands, with one of the region\u2019s NHS trusts reporting nine deaths from the illness, the highest number for any trust in the country. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, confirmed the government was looking \u201cvery, very closely\u201d at why a hotspot seems to have emerged in the region, where 28 deaths have been recorded so far. The majority of deaths have been of elderly and at-risk patients. Governor of California shuts down state The governor of California has ordered all citizens to stay at home as he escalated the attempts of America\u2019s most populous state to combat Covid-19. Gavin Newsom earlier wrote to Donald Trump to warn that 25.5 million people in the state could contract the virus \u2013 roughly 56% of the population. EU open to coronavirus Brexit delay \u2013 European Commission chief The EU would be open to a possible request from Britain for the delaying of the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union, according to the president of the European Commission. Ursula Von Der Leyen\u2019s offer came against the backdrop of the continuing coronavirus outbreak across Europe, which has now led to the UK\u2019s chief negotiator going into self isolation due to symptoms and his EU counterpart testing positive for Covid-19. Warnings over global economy amid profit warnings and lay-offs A worldwide credit crunch triggered by the coronavirus will set in motion a wave of corporate bankruptcies that will make the global financial crisis look like \u201cchild\u2019s play\u201d, investors have warned. With the world\u2019s most advanced economies all entering a shutdown that could last months, companies that have gorged on cheap money for the past decade face going out of business thanks to a huge spike in borrowing costs on international money markets. China reports no new cases for a second day China\u2019s national health commission said earlier on Friday the 39 new cases it confirmed on Thursday were all imported, with 14 in Guangdong, eight in Shanghai, six in Beijing, three in Fujian, and one each in Tianjin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangxi, Sichuan and Gansu. China is among a number of countries where stringent measures appear to have brought the virus under control, but where concerns are now mounting of a fresh wave brought in by travellers. US politicians face demands to resign over reports of stock sell-offs Two Republican senators have faced demands to resign after it was reported they sold off millions of dollars worth of stocks just before the market dropped amid fears of the coronavirus pandemic. Richard Burr of North Carolina, chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, and Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, whose husband is chairman of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), denied that they kept the public in the dark about the scale of the threat. Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has said that he may take a new coronavirus test, Reuters reports. The Brazilian leader said last week that he tested negative for the disease, after reports suggested that he tested positive. Appeals by the Iranian government for the nation to stay at home at the start of Iranian new year have been widely ignored with more than 1.2m taking to the roads, according to the Iranian police. Northern towns on the Caspian coast, one of the main holiday destinations, reported tens of thousands of cars trying to reach them. Latest figures published Friday showed Iran now has 19,644 cases of infection and 1,433 deaths. New infections in the past 24 hours was 1,237 and the number of new deaths 149. The number of new infections is a record for a single day, and the number of deaths, the same as the day before. Every layer of Iranian society, clerical army and national, as well as local government, had urged Iranians to stay at home at New Year, a time when Iranians traditionally travel to see friends and family and celebrate the coming of Spring. Authorities in Mashad, Iran\u2019s second most populous city, and the capital of Khorasan-e Razavi province in the North West said traffic was only 2 % down on the previous year, despite calls by city councillors for people to stay away. Belgium has recorded its biggest daily rise in deaths since the beginning of the epidemic, a spokesman for the Belgian health ministry said on Friday. Authorities recorded 16 new deaths on Thursday because of coronavirus, for a total of 37 in the country, the biggest daily rise since the beginning of the epidemic. Belgian lockdown measures were imposed on Wednesday to contain the spread of coronavirus. In Spain, where new statistics revealed that the death toll in Spain has surged to 1,002, the country is scrambling to contain an epidemic that has spiralled into one of the worst in Europe. More than a third of the documented cases are in Madrid. On Friday, army specialists were set to begin entering care homes to help with disinfection after the virus claimed more than 50 lives at elderly care facilities across the region. While health authorities have warned that the peak of the crisis is still a few days away, those on the frontlines described beleaguered hospitals operating near capacity, their struggles exacerbated by a severe shortage of protective gear such as masks and gloves. \u201cThe current situation in hospitals in Madrid is critical,\u201d said \u00c1ngela Hern\u00e1ndez, of the Association of Doctors and Professionals in Madrid. \u201cThe health care system in a state of alarm.\u201d Earlier this week, her association began offering \u2013 via telephone or email \u2013 free therapy to healthcare professionals in the region in hopes of helping them better cope with the crisis. Aranzazu Loa, whose 68-year-old mother is being treated for pneumonia in a hospital on the outskirts of Madrid, described a chaotic situation. \u201cThere are patients with pneumonia who have been left sitting on chairs in the emergency ward for 48 hours, forced to sleep in these chairs as they wait for the results of their Covid-19 tests,\u201d she said. The regional leader of Madrid denied reports that healthcare workers were being forced to decide who gets potential life-saving care. \u201cThe healthcare system treats all patients equally,\u201d Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso told broadcaster Antena 3. \u201cNo one is being singled out.\u201d The country\u2019s health minister on Thursday promised reinforcements for the system, announcing plans to recruit from groups such as medical students and recently retired physicians to add as many as 50,000 healthcare workers to the system. With the cruise ships gone and the souvenir stalls closed in Venice, the coronavirus lockdown has been transforming La Serenissima\u2019s waterways, John Brunton reports for the Guardian. He writes: At the world-famous and usually overcrowded Rialto market, most of the fish and vegetable stalls are still open, though customers are few and far between. All markets are allowed to serve customers at a minimum one metre distance. In a queue to buy fish, Franco Fabris, an architect, reminisced: \u201cWhen I was a kid growing up, there were far less boats in the canals and lots of kids would jump in and go swimming.\u201d \u201cFor the moment I am not going out fishing as all the restaurants I supply have closed, so what is the point?\u201d said Franco Folin, a fisherman. \u201cBut when this all over, we may well see more fish returning because for the moment pleasure fishing is prohibited \u2013 there will be an awful lot of extra marine life in the lagoon.\u201d More than 1,000 people have now died in Spain from coronavirus, according to the Spanish government. Spain\u2019s health ministry released figures on Friday recording that there are 19,980 people infected, with 1,141 admitted to the intensive care units and 1,002 dead. Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the director of the Ministry\u2019s Health Emergency Coordination Centre has warned that \u201cthe data is very likely to underestimate reality\u201d. YouTube has followed Netflix\u2019s lead in reducing video quality across Europe, according to a Reuters report, to help the continent\u2019s internet service providers cope with the increased usage as social distancing continues. All YouTube videos will now play in standard definition by default for viewers in the EU, a move which should substantially reduce the bandwidth used by visitors to the Google-owned website. The decision follows Netflix\u2019s announcement that it would reduce the quality of its own streams, lowering its impact by 25% overall. Both companies were asked by the EU\u2019s industry commissioner Thierry Breton to take action, amid concerns that networks could collapse if most people who would have been outside in the evening are instead at home consuming video content. Initial fears about broadband capacity rested on the rise in remote working, which led to speculation that residential broadband networks would not be able to cope. But in practice, daytime peaks have risen, while still remaining well below a typical evening peak. Like Netflix, YouTube\u2019s decision also covers the UK, even though Britain has technically left the EU. The move comes on the day YouTube launched a special section of its site for verified Covid-19 news. Every user\u2019s homepage now features a selection of videos from trusted local sources, including the Guardian, on the outbreak. The company has struggled to control the flow of misinformation around coronavirus, initially responding by \u201cdemonetising\u201d any video on the topic to remove the incentive to sensationalise the story, but later reversing course in order to help fund well-made, accurate content. Malaysia will mobilise the army to help enforce curbs on movement aimed at reining in the coronavirus, the government said today as it grapples with the highest number of infections in south-east Asia. Malaysia reported 130 new infections on Friday, taking its total to 1,030, accounting for nearly 40% of those across south-east Asia. Since Wednesday, Malaysia has closed its borders, schools and non-essential businesses and ordered people to limit going outside, warning of a \u201ctsunami\u201d of cases if the curbs are not followed. But people continued to go to restaurants and parks, the defence minister, Ismail Sabri Yaakob, said. \u201cThe army will begin mobilising on Sunday,\u201d he told a news briefing, according to the Reuters news agency. \u201cWe are confident with the army\u2019s assistance, we would be better able to enforce this order.\u201d Footage of an Irish funeral in which mourners have been respecting social distancing measures has been shared by an RTE journalist, Se\u00e1n Mac an tS\u00edthigh. Austria will extend its coronavirus restrictions until 13 April, the chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said today. After the country reported more than 2,200 coronavirus cases and six deaths from the global pandemic, he added, however, that the trend towards infections was \u201cencouraging\u201d. Authorities imposed severe restrictions on movement on Monday in response to the developments in Italy and a sharp increase in the number of coronavirus cases in some of its regions. \u201cHold tight,\u201d Kurz addressed Austrians at a news conference. \u201cWe must not slow down. We must stick with the measures we have taken.\u201d A growing number of musicians are heading online as Covid-19 puts live shows on pause. The Brighton band Metronomy were supposed to be playing sold-out dates in Portugal, Spain and France at the start of their European tour when the Covid-19 outbreak meant all their shows were cancelled. This week, instead of taking to the stage in Madrid, Adelekan has started giving online tutorials in bass and music production. This week Neil Young, Chris Martin of Coldplay, Keith Urban and pop-punk act Yungblud have all put on or promised impromptu online performances as most major concerts, festivals and gigs are cancelled until at least after the summer. For once, an entire country is begging for bad weather this weekend, as Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, said the behaviour of the population tomorrow will crucially influence whether her government will have to issue curfews from Monday. \u201cSaturday is a crucial day, and we will keep a close eye on that\u201d, the German chancellor\u2019s chief of staff, Helge Braun, told news magazine Der Spiegel. \u201cWhile people usually used their weekends to socialise with friends and relatives, \u201cthis is currently not an option outside the family core,\u201d the CDU politician added. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t happen, then it could happen that the federal states have to take further measures that we would like to avoid\u201d. Schools, nurseries, bars, nightclubs and non-essential shops have been closed in most parts of Germany since Tuesday, in an attempt to find a \u201cthird way\u201d between a full lockdown and the more laissez-faire approach to curbing the spread of Covid-19 taken by the UK or the Netherlands. In Berlin, streets have been noticeably emptier throughout the day, but the measures to curb social interaction also seem to have led to an increase in the number of people going out for a run or a cycle in the park. On Sunday evening, Merkel will hold a phone conference with the premiers of Germany\u2019s 16 federal states in which a full lockdown is expected to be discussed. The cities of Freiburg and Leverkusen have already announced lockdown plans of their own. Freiburg\u2019s two-week ban comes into effect on Saturday, banning citizens from entering public places including streets, squares, public green spaces and parks. The British Museum has seen a surge in the number of online visitors with the top 10 searches including those for the Benin Bronzes, metal plaques and sculptures that decorated the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin, and the Lewis Chessmen, a group of distinctive 12th-century chess pieces. It said the number of online visitors between 1-18 March was 978,548, up from 472,890 in the same period last year. Most of the increase has happened over the last seven days. The largest number of online visitors are from Italy, 203,250 in March so far, followed by the UK (175,734), US (113,741), Spain (111,707), Turkey (54,133), Russia (22,764), Canada (15,610), Australia (15,575). The reasons are obvious. Every UK museum and gallery closed down this week so people self-isolating at home are desperate for a diversion. The top 10 searches are: \u2018Egypt\u2019, \u2018Virtual tour\u2019, \u2018Benin bronzes\u2019, \u2018Rosetta stone\u2019, \u2018Netsuke franks\u2019, \u2018Lewis Chessmen\u2019, \u2018Virtual\u2019, \u2018Rosetta\u2019, and \u2018Vase Exekias.\u2019 The museum\u2019s director, Hartwig Fischer, said: \u201cCulture gives comfort in times of turmoil, it unites us and makes us understand what it means to be human. As the world grapples with this current crisis, I am glad that so many people are coming to the website and online collections of the British Museum.\u201d The UK\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, is self-isolating after showing symptoms of coronavirus. The news, which was reported by various sources today and attributed to the UK government comes after Frost\u2019s EU counterpart, Michel Barnier said he had tested positive for the disease on Thursday Details are expected today of plans by the US and Mexico to halt much of cross-border travel without disrupting trade during the coronavirus outbreak. Mexican Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said he proposed steps to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that won\u2019t paralyse economic activity and keep the border open to commerce and work. Pompeo said on Twitter that he was working closely with his Mexican counterpart on travel restrictions. Rail services in Scotland will move to a reduced timetable from Monday 23 March as people follow the extraordinary advice to limit social contact and stay at home. Network Rail Scotland and ScotRail announced they would be operating a reduced service so emergency staff can travel and will prioritise moving goods and emergency supplies such as medicines can be moved around the country. David Simpson, ScotRail operations director, said: \u201cWe are facing an unprecedented challenge on Scotland\u2019s Railway and the revised timetable will help to provide a critical service for the key workers across the country. \u201cOur own people are absolutely committed and are working flat out on the frontline to help keep the country moving, while also keeping themselves and customers safe. Scottish transport secretary Michael Matheson said the government is in discussions with rail unions to protect rail staff during unprecedented times. \u201cWe are also investigating ways to provide proportionate relief to operators, while also ensuring contractual incentives remain to mitigate the impact of doing so. Any changes to rail franchise contracts, including funding mechanisms, will be made in the best interests of the public and business communities.\u201d Confirmed cases of Covid-19 in South Africa have risen by 52 to 202, according to the country\u2019s health minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize. He is giving a press conference now which is being livestreamed here The virus has multiplied in Africa more slowly than in Asia or Europe, but the number of cases has started to rise more rapidly in South Africa in recent days. Twitter won\u2019t be removing a tweet from Elon Musk that claims that children are \u201cbasically immune\u201d to Covid-19, a day after committing to remove misinformation related to the disease, the company says. Musk came under fire on Thursday night for tweeting: The claim isn\u2019t supported by the evidence, which suggests that children can and do catch the virus, with many becoming seriously ill around the world, and many more helping to spread the disease further while suffering mild or no symptoms. While death rates remain low for under-18s, a March paper in the journal Pediatrics concluded \u201cchildren at all ages were susceptible to COVID-19\u201d. But, in a statement given to tech site The Verge, Twitter said it would not be enforcing its new rules on medical misinformation against Musk. \u201cWhen reviewing the overall context and conclusion of the Tweet, it does not break our rules\u201d, the company said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to consult with trusted partners such as health authorities to identify content that is most harmful.\u201d Musk has been talking down the risk of Covid-19 for some time. On March 6, he tweeted: https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1236029449042198528 He has told employees at one of his companies, SpaceX, that \u201cthe risk of death from C19 is vastly less than the risk of death from driving your car home.\u201d He did not deploy the same metaphor at another of his companies, which makes cars, but instead told Tesla employees that they should continue working at his Fremont, California, factory unless they were showing symptoms, despite a shelter-in-place order in the San Francisco Bay Area. Musk was eventually overruled by the local sheriff\u2019s office. Britain\u2019s bus operators have called on the government to provide \u00a31bn in immediate help to maintain critical services as passenger numbers fall away with the coronavirus. Operators say passenger numbers have already fallen by more than half outside London, with a loss of \u00a350million per week in revenues, even before the closure of schools. While the government had pledged to deliver \u00a35bn in additional funding over five years to the industry, with the importance of bus services having risen up the political agenda before the coronavirus outbreak, bus firms now say they need a first tranche simply to guarantee income and support staff costs to maintain vital routes. Graham Vidler, chief executive of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents bus companies, said: \u201cOperators are under extreme pressure and facing impossible choices over which routes they have to cut and how many staff may have to go.\u201d Firms collectively employ around 100,000 drivers and 120,000 support staff, whose jobs are at risk. In Britain, BT is to remove all caps on home broadband plans to give customers unlimited data while working from home or self-isolating. The BT Group, which also includes mobile network EE, said it wanted to help people stay connected during periods of isolation because of the coronavirus outbreak. If comes after the firm said it was among networks in talks with the Government over allowing ministers to use anonymised mobile data to monitor whether people are following social distancing measures. An iconic Italian deli which has served London for more than 75 years is raising money so it can supply pasta and sauce to people in need amid the coronavirus crisis, reports London\u2019s Evening Standard. Lina Stores, which has a site in Soho and another in King\u2019s Cross, wants to make provisions for hospitality staff whose jobs have been cut and people in at risk groups. \u201cWe want to look after London - the community that has been supporting us for over 75 years,\u201d the store, which opened in the 1940s, said in a Go Fund Me page, which has raised more than \u00a311,000 so far and has an aim of \u00a320,000. It sounds like a plot from the Police Academy films: hundreds of trainee cadets, some just a few weeks into their training, are sworn in and assigned to active duty to deal with a national crisis. A trope that Hollywood screenwriters have long used in various forms but on Friday it\u2019s a deadly serious reality in Ireland where 319 students will be sworn in at the Garda College in Templemore, county Tipperary, to deal with the coronavirus emergency. The Garda commissioner, Drew Harris, and justice minister, Charlie Flanagan will preside over a brief attestation ceremony that will observe social distancing protocols. Some 124 tutors and instructors from the college are also being deployed to frontline policing. The eight-acre campus may be turned into an improvised health facility. On Thursday the parliament passed draconian legislation to allow police detain people who breach self-isolation instructions. It came as the Health Service Executive reported another 191 cases, bringing Ireland\u2019s total to 557. Simon Coveney, the t\u00e1naiste and foreign minister said political leadership and people\u2019s actions would determine whether Covid-19 \u201ckills hundreds of people, thousands of people or tens of thousands of people in Ireland\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s Editor-in-chief, Katherine Viner, has written to readers about how we aim to cover the Coronavirus crisis, emphasising the value of expertise, scientific knowledge and careful judgment in our reporting She writes: With you, we are trying to face this unsettling moment with fortitude, and we\u2019re remembering our history \u2013 the Guardian and Observer continued to publish throughout the 1918 flu pandemic and both world wars, and we will do our best to do the same during this global coronavirus pandemic. Read on here Sales at the UK chain Wetherspoons have been falling sales after Prime Minister Boris Johnson told members of the public to stay at home and not visit Britain\u2019s pubs. The pub chain said that sales, which had risen by 3.2% in the previous six weeks, started falling by 4.5% in the week ending March 15, as the coronavirus pandemic scared customers off. The decline picked up even further when the Prime Minister told people that it was vital they do not visit pubs in order to slow the spread of the highly infectious disease. \u201cIn the early part of the current week ... sales have declined at a significantly higher rate,\u201d Wetherspoons chairman Tim Martin said in a statement to shareholders on Friday. Earlier this week the Guardian reported on how staff at the pub chain had spoken of their fears about having to continue working in busy pub environments without masks, hand gel or other protective equipment. They spoke out as the company announced that its pubs would remain open \u2013 but customers will pay by card, avoid standing at the bar and sit at alternate tables. \u201cWe\u2019re effectively going to become Petri dishes,\u201d said one worker who said that he and others should be provided with hand gel, gloves and face masks. \u201cWe come into contact all day with the general public, we handle money, dirty plates, glasses, sometimes bodily fluids, and the fact we can\u2019t wear a mask/gloves front of house is making people feel on edge. We of course are washing our hands as often as possible but it\u2019s just bizarre we aren\u2019t allowed to protect ourselves.\u201d France has tightened the rules of who can go out by banning sports cycling and demanding runners and walkers limit the distance they take from home to a maximum 1-2km and 20minutes. A statement from a cycling body reads: \u201cFaced with the COVID-9 epidemic the French Federation of Cycling asks all cyclists to show their responsibility and avoid all cycling outside during this period. Remember the rule: \u201cSave lives! Stay at home!\u201d The cycling rule is thought to apply only to those cycling for sport. Those using their bikes for essential shopping or work journeys - and carrying the correct papers - are expected to be allowed to continue, subject to policing. French government spokesperson Sibeth Ndiaye warned the confinement rules were likely to be tightened further. \u201cWe see quite irresponsible behaviour, people going to beach to the park. We have to tighten the restrictions. the fines are now 135 and their application is strict; Those who haven\u2019t the right to go out, who don\u2019t have their justification document, who overstep the regulations will be sanctioned,\u201d Ndiaye said. Indonesia\u2019s President Joko Widodo has said he would use \u201call state power\u201d to tackle the health and economic problems caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Authorities launched rapid testing for the disease today in areas where there have been cases of the virus, Widodo told reporters. A scramble by the UK to produce thousands of ventilators to fight the coronavirus outbreak was achieving results as top companies have already produced a prototype and it should be ready for use in hospitals by the end of next week, according to Britain\u2019s health secretary. \u201cMore than half a dozen companies have already made one in prototype, to check with us that we are happy with the quality ,\u201d Matt Hancock told BBC TV. He also said that negotiations were advancing to purchase new equipment in large numbers that would enable home testing. \u201cFrankly I don\u2019t care where it comes from as long as we can get our hands on it,\u201d he told the Today Programme on BBC Radio 4. The tests had only recently been invented and approved by regulators in the past couple of days, he added. Separately, he said that the UK government was looking \u201cvery, very closely\u201d at why there is a coronavirus hotspot in England\u2019s Midlands. Asked on Sky News about 28 deaths recorded in the West Midlands, he said: \u201cThere is a hotspot, not as big as in London, but there is a hotspot in the Midlands. A critical care nurse in Britain has made a tearful appeal to members of the public to stop stripping supermarket shelves of food after she came off a shift and was unable to buy supplies for her family. \u201cThose people who are stripping the shelves of basic foods. You just need to stop it because it is people like me who will be looking after you when you are at your lowest, so just stop it,\u201d said the nurse, named as Dawn. The recording was played this morning to Britain\u2019s Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who told the BBC\u2019s Today programme that his heart went out to people like Dawn. He said that people should follow the guidance which has aleady been set out but the government \u201cwould do whatever it takes\u201d if necessary. Spain is preparing new flights today to Guayaquil, Ecuador, where the local mayor ordered trucks on to the runway yesterday to prevent a plane from landing. That\u2019s according to Spain\u2019s Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez, who was speaking after the European Union asked Ecuador to guarantee access to its airports to ensure it can airlift citizens out of the South American nation. The Iberia flight which was unable to land was planning to repatriate 190 EU citizens. A journalist at TeleSur has tweeted some footage of how the incident unfolded on Thursday. Cirque du Soleil, the world famous entertainment company, has announced it is temporarily laying off 4,679 employees - some 95 percent of its workforce. With schools and universities in the UK now relying on digital services for their switch to remote learning, parents and students are already complaining that residential internet speeds are slowing down dramatically. The Department for Education in England says it is engaging directly with telecommunications providers to try and fix the problem: \u201cThe government is having regular calls with the major fixed and mobile operators, and with Ofcom, to monitor the situation and ensure that any problems on the networks are rapidly addressed and rectified. \u201cWe fully understand the importance of having reliable internet connectivity at this time, so that people can work from home wherever possible and access critical public services online, including health information.\u201c A 36-year-old Australian man diagnosed with Covid-19 has died in Iceland, while his wife has been quarantined with the illness. However, doctors said the man\u2019s symptoms were atypical for the novel coronavirus, and although he had the illness they are continuing to investigate the cause of his death, Iceland\u2019s national broadcaster reported. \u201cWhile he was found to be infected with the coronavirus, it is unlikely to have been the cause of his death,\u201d epidemiologist Dr Thorolfur Gudnason, the chief of the health directorate\u2019s national vaccination program, told public broadcaster RUV. \u201cHis symptoms came on very quickly and were not those usually associated with Covid-19 deaths.\u201d France will consider taking additional measures to limit people\u2019s movements if necessary, the country\u2019s foreign minister has said. News about those comments from Jean-Yves Le Drian are just breaking on Reuters now and we\u2019ll bring you more as we hear them. It\u2019s worth nothing however that the French state has implemented some of the strictest rules on movement already in Europe. Following Italy and Spain, France went into lockdown last Tuesday, with people allowed to leave their homes only to buy food and other essential supplies, travel to work if unavoidable, exercise or attend medical appointments. It\u2019s another day of carnage in the business world, with aviation in the firing line. In Finland, the government has said it will guarantee Finnair\u2019s \u20ac600m (\u00a3550m) pension premium loan to aid the flag carrier hit by coronavirus along with other airlines. Abu Dhabi\u2019s Etihad Airways will survive the coronavirus epidemic, its chief executive said in a video released today, a day after the industry\u2019s largest body warned that Middle East airlines were in crisis. The EU would be open to a possible request from Britain for the delaying of the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union, according to the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen. She was speaking on German radio. The Guardian reported last week that Britain, which entered an 11-month transition period earlier this year, will have to guarantee \u201cuniform implementation\u201d of Brussels\u2019s state subsidy rules. Good morning from London. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog, which will be bringing you coverage of global developments and also important ones from here in Britain. In the UK, parents are waking up to learn further details of how nursery and school places will be provided for key workers including health service, communications and police staff. After waiting all day yesterday, the UK government last night finally published details setting out whose children would be allowed to continue at their schools and nurseries. We have covered that story here. Parents and young people in the UK are also awaiting further clarity today on how qualifications will be awarded after summer school tests were hit by school closures. Also in Britain, Rishi Sunak, Britain\u2019s chancellor of the exchequer, is to unveil an emergency package aimed at protecting workers\u2019 jobs and wages as they face hardship in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. If you\u2019re just joining us or coming back for updates, these are the main developments: The governor of California has ordered all citizens to stay at home as he escalated attempts to combat Covid-19 in America\u2019s most populous state. Gavin Newsom earlier wrote to Donald Trump to warn that 25.5 million people in the state could contract the virus. Train services in Britain will be wound down to a minimum from Monday. Passenger numbers have dropped 70% in the outbreak. Key workers will be able to keep their children in school when they close on Monday. Researchers at Oxford University are racing to develop a UK vaccine against coronavirus with the hope of making it available by the end of the year. The number of deaths in Italy has passed the total in China to make it the worst-affected country in the world with 3,405 fatalities. Southern and central Italy are braced for a \u201ctsunami\u201d of cases. Three passengers who left a cruise ship in Sydney on Thursday have tested positive. Officials have implored around 2,700 other passengers who left the ship to self-isolate. Australia\u2019s PM has told people to \u201creconsider\u201d domestic travel. Argentina has gone into lockdown, Haiti has closed its borders and Chile has postponed a constitutional referendum. Thailand, where cases rose sharply again, will require all visitors from abroad to present a health certificate confirming they virus-free. Stock markets in Asia have had a better day and oil prices have risen. The FTSE100 is set to rise 2.25% this morning but some believe a new credit crunch will create a wave of defaults in the corporate world. Donald Trump has cancelled the G7 meeting at Camp David. It will now be carried out by teleconference. It\u2019s been a mixed day on Asia Pacific stock markets so far. Concerns about the economic impact of the outbreak have been soothed slightly by massive stimulus packages in the US, Europe, Asia and Australia. But investors were still cautious in Japan where the Nikkei finished down 1% today. Sydney was up 0.74% despite a very strong start while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index has risen more than 4%. The FTSE100 is set to lift 2.25% at the opening bell and the US benchmark S&amp;P500 is on course to rise 1.5%. Our long read today is a fascinating insight into the coronavirus outbreak as seen from the frontline. Despite the growing death toll and the unprecedented speed at which events are moving, the past few weeks feel like just a prelude of what is to come, writes Gavin Francis, a GP in Scotland. In another sign of the tightening lockdown in Britain, train services will start to be reduced from Monday. Timetables will be progressively thinned out to reflect the 70% drop in passenger numbers since the outbreak started to take hold. The exact number of services will be left for operators to decide but they must maintain enough trains for key workers and for the public to access medical appointments, as well as ensuring the flow of goods by rail. Gwyn Topham, our transport correspondent, has the full story: My colleague Helen Davidson has filed a wrap of the day\u2019s main developments so far. It includes details about the worsening outbreak in the US and how China has reported no new locally transmitted cases for the second day running. Here it is: In the UK, the department of education has issued a list of key workers who will still be able to send their children to school despite them being closed from Monday. They include health workers, nursery care staff and those involved in food production and distribution. Here\u2019s the full list: And more from Japan where Justin McCurry reports that a senior member of the Japan Olympic Committee [JOC] has called for this summer\u2019s Tokyo games to be postponed. She echoed concerns that athletes will not be able to prepare due to the massive disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIt should be postponed under the current situation, in which athletes can\u2019t be well prepared,\u201d Kaori Yamaguchi, who won a bronze medal in judo at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, told the Nikkei business daily in an interview published on Friday. Yamaguchi, the first JOC board member to call openly Tokyo 2020 to be postponed, criticised the International Olympic Committee [IOC] for insisting that the Games would open as scheduled on 24 July. Yamaguchi said the IOC, which is reportedly \u201cconsidering different scenarios\u201d for the Games, could put athletes\u2019 health at risk if it decided there was no alternatives to holding them this summer. Yamagushi\u2019s intervention came as the Olympic torch arrived in Japan to begin its journey to the main stadium in Tokyo. The torch relay will begin next Thursday at J-Village, a soccer training centre that served as an operations base for workers who battled triple meltdowns at the nearby Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Organisers have asked people not to line the relay route for the first few days, and similar restrictions may go into effect as the torch continues its 121-day journey through Japan. South Korea and China support Japan holding a \u201ccomplete\u201d Olympics, the South Korean foreign ministry has said, according to Reuters. The ministers held a video conference to discuss cooperation on the coronavirus pandemic amid growing concerns over the number of infected people arriving in their countries from overseas. Our Africa correspondent, Jason Burke, has been looking at how the continent\u2019s fragile health systems might cope with a sustained outbreak of the virus. He\u2019s spoken to officials in Nigeria where they are scrambling to add isolation beds and provide more specialised medical training and equipment at state hospitals. \u201cOur health system is not as strong as we\u2019d like it to be,\u201d said Chikwe Ihekweazu, the head of Nigeria\u2019s Centre for Disease Control. \u201cIt is because we are a bit worried about our capacity to deal with a large outbreak.\u201d Here\u2019s his full story: And on the other side of the world, cases are increasing in New Zealand. From Sunday, Thailand will require all visitors from abroad to present a health certificate confirming that they have been tested and are free from the coronavirus. This is effectively a travel ban in all but name. Given the shortages of tests globally, it will be almost impossible for most people to obtain a certificate. The announcement comes as the Thai government faces pressure to impose tougher measures to stop the virus, which appears to have spread more rapidly over the past week. The government reported 50 new coronavirus cases on Friday, taking the total to 322. Most infections have been recorded in Bangkok.The government has shut down schools, universities across the country, while entertainment venues - such as gyms, cinemas and bars - have been asked to close in the capital. There\u2019s so much going on that I\u2019ll just a quick roundup of some other developments around the world: Malaysia will deploy the army from Sunday to assist police in enforcing a a partial lockdown. Nasa\u2019s planned new moonshot is the latest victim of the virus. The space agency has ordered the temporary closure of two rocket production facilities after an employee tested positive for the illness. It will likely delay plans to return astronauts to the moon in 2024. Iran\u2019s president says that the country can fight the virus \u201cwith unity\u201d. Vietnam will temporarily suspend visa-free travel for citizens of Japan, Belarus and Russia from Saturday. An Australian tourist has reportedly died of the disease in Iceland. Thailand has 50 new coronavirus infections, taking its tally to 322, a health official said on Friday. The majority are in Bangkok. A group of 41 new cases is linked to earlier infections, while another, of nine, centres on overseas arrivals and contact with foreigners, Suwannachai Wattanayingcharoenchai, director-general of the disease control department, told a news conference. If you\u2019re just joining us or popping back for updates, these are the main developments in the past few hours: The governor of California has ordered all citizens to stay at home as he escalated the attempts of America\u2019s most populous state to combat Covid-19. Gavin Newsom earlier wrote to Donald Trump to warn that 25.5 million people in the state could contract the virus \u2013 roughly 56% of the population. Another eight people have died in the worst-affected US state, Washington. The number of deaths in Italy has passed the total in China to make it the worst-affected country in the world with 3,405 fatalities. Southern and central Italy are braced for a \u201ctsunami\u201d of cases. Three passengers who left a cruise ship in Sydney on Thursday have tested positive. Officials have implored around 2,700 other passengers who left the ship to self-isolate. Australia\u2019s PM has told people to \u201creconsider\u201d domestic travel and he has delayed the federal budget from May to October. Researchers at Oxford University are racing to develop a UK vaccine against coronavirus with the hope of making it available by the end of the year. British PM Boris Johnson told his daily media conference that the country could turn the tide on the virus in \u201c12 weeks\u201d. Argentina has gone into lockdown, Haiti has closed its borders and Chile has postponed a constitutional referendum. Stock markets in Asia are enjoying a better day and oil prices have risen, helped by massive state intervention around the world. The Bank of England has cut rates to 0.1%, US Republicans propose giving each American $1,200 and Europe is rolling out packages worth 1.7 trillion euros. But some investors believe a new credit crunch will create a wave of defaults in the corporate world. Trump has cancelled the G7 meeting at Camp David. It will now be carried out by teleconference. If you\u2019re wondering about how you might cope with life under social distancing, look no further than our UK podcast. Zoe Williams has spent the week researching tips for life under a new regime of social distancing and self-isolation. She tells Anushka Asthana it is important to give yourself a break amid the hardships. Following on from our earlier post about the Olympic flame\u2019s arrival in Japan, an official from the Japan Olympic Committee has urged a delay of the Tokyo 2020 Games. \u201cIt should be postponed under the current situation where athletes can\u2019t be well prepared,\u201d Kaori Yamaguchi, a JOC executive board member, told the Nikkei daily in an interview published on Friday. Yamaguchi, who won a bronze medal for judo at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, is the first JOC board member to call openly for a postponement of the Tokyo Games, which are scheduled to open on 24 July. Organisers have scrapped qualifiers and scaled back test events, while many countries have imposed travel bans. The International Olympic Committee, which will take the final decision on whether to proceed as scheduled, has voiced its commitment to the Games going ahead. Yamaguchi criticised the IOC stance, saying the body \u201cis putting athletes at risk.\u201d \u201cBy asking them to train under these conditions, the IOC is opening itself up the criticism that it is not putting athletes first,\u201d Yamaguchi told the newspaper. \u201cUnlike other sporting events, the Olympics symbolise the ideal that sports bring about world peace,\u201d she said. The Olympics should not be held \u201cif people across the world can\u2019t enjoy themselves,\u201d she said. Australia to keep schools open Back to that press conference in Australia and the country\u2019s chief medical office Brendan Murphy has confirmed that schools are still advised to stay open. This has been one of the most contentious elements of the Australian government\u2019s response to the outbreak so far, with many asking why Australia has not followed the lead of other countries, including the UK this week, of shutting down schools. Brendan Murphy is addressing that question now: I think it is really important to recognise that, as we\u2019ve said before, we think the risk to children with this virus is very low. Only 2.4% of all the cases in China in Hubei Province were under 19, and there have been very, very few significant cases. Obviously we do have some concerns that children may have a role in transmission but most children who have seemed to have got the virus have got it from adults as you\u2019ve seen in this case. We think keeping children at home when there is relatively no community spread is probably disproportionate given they probably won\u2019t stay at home anyway. They may be cared for by elderly parents. There may be circumstances where there are outbreaks in an area where we do need to close schools for a period of time. Our strategy is in the for the next six months to keep schools open and we think that risk is appropriate. China has taken the highly unusual move of exonerating a doctor who was reprimanded for warning about the coronavirus outbreak and later died of the disease. The official China News Service late Tuesday said police in the city of Wuhan had revoked its admonishment of Dr Li Wenliang that had included a threat of arrest and issued a \u201csolemn apology\u201d to his family. It said two police officers had been issued disciplinary punishments\u201d for the original handling of the matter, without giving further details. In death, Li became the face of simmering anger at the ruling Communist Party\u2019s controls over information and complaints that officials lie about or hide disease outbreaks, industrial accidents, natural disasters and financial frauds, while punishing whistleblowers and independent journalists. The 33-year-old ophthalmologist died in early February at Wuhan Central Hospital, where he worked and likely contracted the virus while treating patients in the early days of the outbreak. After seeing thousands of new cases daily at the peak of the city\u2019s outbreak a month ago, Wuhan on Friday had its second consecutive day with no new confirmed or suspected cases. The health ministry said all of the 39 new cases recorded nationwide Friday were brought from overseas, showing that rigid travel restrictions and social distancing requirements appear to have had their desired effect. China has loosened some travel restrictions in Hubei, the province surrounding Wuhan, although its provincial border remains closed and Wuhan itself remains under lockdown. Officials say they will only lift the quarantine after Wuhan goes 14 consecutive days with no new cases. Australian PM announces further social restrictions but urges people to \u2018keep Australia running\u2019 Australia\u2019s prime minister Scott Morrison has addressed the country, saying that as long as \u201cwe continue to work together in the way we are... Australia will bounce back strongly\u201d. There is a way through this. We all need to keep going. I need all of you to keep going. And we are going to keep going to keep Australia running. All Australians have a role to play as we make our way through, and there is a way through. There will be additional cases. This is something we should be continuing to expect. This is anticipated. The presence of additional cases is not something of itself that should cause alarm, because at the end of the day you don\u2019t stop this virus, but you can defeat it by slowing it down. And that is how we save lives. Among the social restrictions announced by Morrison today, are: Any gatherings of up to 100 people (larger gatherings are banned) must allow for four sq metres of space per person. People should avoid \u201cunnecessary travel for the upcoming school holidays. Additional funding to support aged care facilities All non-essential travel into remote indigenous communities banned. Warnings of region-specific shutdowns if community transmission is identified in particular parts of the country. Morrison also announced that the country\u2019s budget \u2013 normally announced in May \u2013 would be delayed until October. Panama, which is a major regional travel hub for Central America, has announced it is suspending all international flights from Monday. The measure will see no international inbound or outbound flights from Tocumen International Airport, the region\u2019s busiest airport with connecting flights to many other destinations in Central and South America. President Laurentino Cortizo made the announcement on Twitter and said the suspension would last 30 days. Panama has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in Central America, which jumped from 109 to 137 on Thursday. Cargo, humanity and domestic flights will continue as normal, the President Cortizo said. A second dog has tested positive for coronavirus in Hong Kong. Like the first, this one is showing no symptoms and there remains no evidence that a dog can pass the virus back to a human. It too was picked up from a home where its owner had been diagnosed with Covid-19. The German Shepherd was sent for quarantine with another mixed breed dog, which tested negative. The department of agriculture said it would continue to monitor and repeatedly test both dogs. \u201cIt strongly advises that mammalian pet animals including dogs and cats from households with people confirmed as infected with Covid-19, or close contacts of Covid-19 infected people, should be put under quarantine in AFCD facilities,\u201d the statement said. \u201cPet owners are reminded to maintain good hygiene practices and under no circumstances should they abandon their pets.\u201d There\u2019s anger in the US at Republican politicians who sold stocks after receiving classified briefings about the deteriorating public health situation despite giving public assurances that everything was under control. There\u2019s more on this story here. Three passengers on board the Ruby Princess cruise ship in Sydney have tested positive for Covid-19, the health minister of New South Wales says. The tests, done on board, were originally for the flu, but were tested for Covid-19. Of the 13 tested, three tested positive. NSW authorities are now worried the nearly 2700 people who were also on that cruise, may not know Covid-19 was present on the ship. They want all passengers on the Ruby Princess to go into self-isolation. Anyone who shows symptoms should immediately contact their GP The Olympic flame has arrived in Japan, writes Justin McCurry in Tokyo, as uncertainty grows over whether it would reach its destination in Tokyo in July due to the coronavirus pandemic. A chartered plane carrying the torch arrived at an airbase in northeastern Japan on Friday morning amid reports that the International Olympic Committee [IOC] was examining alternatives for the Games, which are currently due to open on 24 July. The New York Times reported that the IOC\u2019s president, Thomas Bach, said the organisation was \u201cconsidering different scenarios\u201d for Tokyo 2020 [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games-2020] \u2013 the first time Bach has publicly suggested that there may be alternatives to holding the Games this summer. The torch relay in Greece was cancelled to avoid drawing crowds and the handover ceremony was open to a small number of officials and journalists. The torch will be displayed in areas of north-east Japan affected by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which killed more than 18,000 people, before beginning the first part of its Japan leg in Fukushima [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/04/japan-lifts-evacuation-order-futaba-town-fukushima-disaster], where the disaster caused a nuclear meltdown, next Thursday. Organisers have urged spectators not to line the route during the opening stages of the relay, and similar restrictions could be put in place as the flame makes its way through Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures in the coming weeks. Runners and staff will have their temperature and health monitored, the organisers said. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, added to speculation that the Tokyo Olympics could be postponed after telling reporters this week that Group of Seven leaders had voiced support for a \u201ccomplete\u201d Games \u2013 an increasingly distant prospect given that athletes in countries severely affected by the outbreak are unable to prepare or qualify for their event. Abe\u2019s deputy, Taro Aso, said holding the Olympics as scheduled made \u201cno sense\u201d if some countries were unable to send athletes. The IOC said earlier this week that only 57% of athletes had so far qualified for the Olympics, after the coronavirus outbreak disrupted qualifying tournaments. Abe reportedly told other G7 leaders during an emergency video conference on Monday that he had yet to decide on whether to support postponing the Games. \u201cWe did discuss it,\u201d Trump told reporters on Thursday. \u201c[Abe] has told us that he has not made a decision as to what to do,\u201d Trump said, adding that the Japanese leader faced a \u201cbig decision\u201d. Here\u2019s more of what California governor Gavin Newsom told people in the state on Thursday afternoon local time. We direct a statewide order for people to stay at home. That order goes into effect this evening. We are confident the people of California will abide by it. If we meet this moment, we can truly bend the curve to reduce the need to have to go out and to cobble all those assets together. I don\u2019t believe the people of CA need to be told by law enforcement it\u2019s appropriate to home-isolate, go about the essential patterns of life, but do so by socially distancing yourselves from others and using common sense. The state was facing hospitalization rate of 20% \u2014 about 19,543 people that would need to be hospitalized, above the existing capacity of the system, he said. We\u2019ve got more on the dramatic escalation in California\u2019s attempts to limit the spread of coronavirus. Shortly before issuing his stay at home order, governor Gavin Newsom said 56% of California residents were expected to contract Covid-19 over the next eight weeks. It would require nearly 20,000 more hospital beds than the state could currently provide. Here\u2019s the story: Newsom had earlier on Thursday asked Donald Trump to send a US Navy hospital ship to Los Angeles \u201cimmediately\u201d. The city, the nation\u2019s second-largest city, would likely be \u201cdisproportionately impacted\u201d by the pandemic in the coming weeks, he said. And here\u2019s how the order might work: Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro has news of stranded cruise ship passengers being flown home from Brazil. Hundreds of British, European, Australian and New Zealand citizens stranded in the Brazilian port of Recife in the Northeastern state of Pernambuco on a cruise-liner will began flying home on Friday. A chartered Latam flight will take 116 British passengers and crew and 15 Europeans from Recife to Heathrow at 21.30 Friday night. Veejay Rangarajan, the UK\u2019s ambassador in Brazil, tweeted the news on Thursday night. \u201cI\u2019m delighted,\u201d he posted. \u201cThanks to all the passengers for their patience and resilience.\u201d The passengers have been confined to their cabins on the Silver Shadow cruise liner since it docked in Recife on March 12 and a Canadian male passenger aged 78 felt sick. He later tested positive for Covid-19 and is hospitalised in serious condition, a spokesman for the Pernambuco state government said. His Canadian wife has also since tested positive but has milder symptoms. An Irish woman passenger earlier tested negative. The Australian government did not immediately comment on reports that a separate flight carrying 25 Australians and two New Zealanders will leave Recife at 5pm. There are also 103 Americans on board and the US consulate in Recife said it is continuing to work to \u201cfacilitate the return of all U.S. citizen passengers aboard the Silver Shadow to the United States\u201d. California\u2019s governor has issued a statewide \u201cstay at home\u201d order to residents, telling them to leave their homes only when necessary during the coronavirus pandemic. The stock markets have taken a terrible battering in recent weeks but although they are showing signs of recovery today \u2013 the Nikkei is down just 1% while stimulus-rich Australia is up 4% \u2013 trouble looms in the international credit markets. I\u2019ve been speaking to investors and economists who say that the crisis has exposed deep-seated weaknesses in the global financial system. Angus Coote, of Jamieson Coote Bonds in Melbourne, says the corporate world is heading for a wave of bankruptcies as companies struggle to rollover debt because borrowing costs (as shown by so-called credit spreads) have spiked so much as risk has increased. He says this will make the GFC look like \u201cchild\u2019s play\u201d. Here\u2019s the full story: South Korea has reported 87 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total infections to 8,652, the country\u2019s disease control centre said on Friday. As I mentioned in the summary at the top, Argentina has announced a nationwide lockdown until the end of the month. The country has so far recorded 128 cases including three deaths. Our correspondent in Buenos Aires, Uki Goni, has this dispatch: Argentina is going into an obligatory nationwide quarantine until atleast March 31, President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez announced Thursday night, just two and half hours before the measure goes into effect at the stroke of midnight. \u201cThis means nobody can move from their place of residence, everybody has to stay home,\u201d the president said in a televised address. Police and other security forces will be patrolling the streets to enforce the measure, Fern\u00e1ndez said. Only supermarkets, neighbourhood grocery stores, drugstores and some other shops such as neighbourhood hardware stores will be allowed to remain open. The only permitted outings will be to shop for food, medicine and walk pets. No jogging or outdoor walking will be allowed. Banks, shopping malls, restaurants, entertainment venues and most other stores will remain closed. \u201cWe are going to be completely inflexible,\u201d the president said. \u201cThis truly is an exceptional measure at an exceptional moment, but it is absolutely within the framework of what democracy allows.\u201d The president left the door open for prolonging the measure should the spread of the disease demand it. Authorities announced the highest daily coronavirus jump Thursday, with 31 new cases, bringing the total to 128 cases since the first cases were made public on March 5. There have been three deaths so far. Of the 31 new cases, 20 correspond to recent arrivals from countries where coronavirus is widespread, five from contacts with some of these persons and six cases whose source of contagion has not yet been determined. Figures released in China on Friday morning say that the country has gone a second successive day without recording any new locally transmitted cases. However, China had 39 new confirmed cases on Thursday, the country\u2019s health commission said, all of which were imported, Reuters reports. Of the new imported infections, 14 were in Guangdong, eight in Shanghai and six in Beijing, the health authority said on Friday. China\u2019s total cases so far is 80,967, with 3,245 deaths. Australian banks have granted small businesses a six-month loan deferral as part of the country\u2019s ongoing economic measures to soften the impact of the outbreak. You can follow all the developments there with our separate Australia-focused blog. On Thursday the central bank cut the main interest rate to zero as the nation faces its first recession for nearly 30 years. A plane will arrive in Japan from Greece today carrying the Olympic torch amid mounting concern about whether the Games will go ahead in Tokyo as planned in late July. The flame will be taken to Japan\u2019s north-western coast which was ravaged by a tsunami, earthquake and nuclear disaster in 2011. The welcome ceremony will have no spectators. Japan\u2019s deputy PM said on Thursday that the Olympics are \u201ccursed\u201d by world events every 40 years. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the main developments: The number of deaths in Italy has passed the total in China to make it the worst-affected country in the world with 3,405 fatalities compared with 3,245. Southern and central Italy are braced for a \u201ctsunami\u201d of cases as the outbreak spreds from the badly hit northern regions. Researchers at Oxford University are racing to develop a UK vaccine against coronavirus with the hope of making it available by the end of the year. Donald Trump claimed a malaria treatment would be ready to help combat Covid-19 in the US before he was contradicted by officials. The governor of California has written to Trump saying that 25.5 million people in the state could contract the virus \u2013 roughly 56% of the population. Another eight people have died in the worst-affected state, Washington. Argentina has gone into lockdown, Haiti has closed its borders and Chile has postponed a constitutional referendum Governments and central banks around the world have stepped up their stimulus response. The Bank of England has cut rates to 0.1%, US Republicans propose giving each American $1,200 and Europe is rolling out packages worth 1.7 trillion euros. Trump has cancelled the G7 meeting at Camp David. It will now be carried out by teleconference.",

      "bodyText": "Forty million people on Friday morning woke up to a locked down-California, grappling with new rules about what to do and where to shop as the state battles the coronavirus pandemic. At a press conference late Thursday, when Gavin Newsom, the California governor, announced a shelter-in-place order that asks people to stay home unless absolutely necessary, he said the rate of coronavirus was doubling every four days in some areas of the state. The degree to which the hospital system will be overwhelmed will depend on how Californians respond to the restrictions, he said. It was a dramatic escalation in the state\u2019s attempt to curb the spread of a coronavirus the governor said could over the next eight weeks infect 25.5 million people \u2013 more than half the state\u2019s population. Non essential-traffic at the US-Mexico border, the busiest port of entry in the US, had been halted on Friday as both countries sought ways to defend against an unseen virus. A few minutes north in Chula Vista, where a city councilman has been hospitalized after he was infected with coronavirus, police use drones rigged to loudspeakers to enforce the lockdown. Los Angeles was a shadow of its ordinary self. Famously gridlocked freeways stood virtually empty, prompting bored-at-home Angelenos to open Google Maps just to marvel at the rare green sight of uniformly traffic-free roads in the middle of the day. The traffic reduction led to significant improvement in air quality as smog and pollution dramatically declined. Across LA county this week, the air was consistently ranked as \u201cgood\u201d quality, instead of at levels officials deem \u201cunhealthy\u201d for many, which frequently dominate the region in normal times. At the Wine House, a prestigious outlet for wines and spirits in West Los Angeles, staff were quick to shoo out the last lingering shoppers shortly after the restrictions took effect, telling customers that orders would be strictly by curbside delivery from now on. \u201cThey say we\u2019re not an essential service,\u201d an Italian wine specialist, Lance Montalto, said as a colleague hastened to lock the doors. \u201cIn a crisis like this, I think we should be.\u201d Their economic worries matched that of the city\u2019s small army of waiters, bartenders and restaurant hosts who were laid off a few days ago. Many of those restaurant workers are also aspiring actors, but auditions and shoots are off the agenda as the TV and film industry screeched to a stop. One of LA\u2019s most prominent chefs, Nancy Silverton, announced that she was turning one of her restaurants on Melrose Avenue into a relief center for laid-off restaurant workers that would provide 300 high-quality meals every night for the next two weeks, paid for by the whiskey company Maker\u2019s Mark, along with a variety of household essentials. Up north in Sacramento, the first day of shelter-in-place felt like a weekend-come-early. The clangs of the passing trolleys and beeps of the pedestrian walk signals echoed in the downtown area\u2019s near-empty streets. The typical steady flow of pedestrians had slowed to a trickle, with few still pacing the sidewalks with dogs and grocery bags. Parking, a precious commodity in California, was plentiful, with lines of meters blinking blankly next to swaths of spaces. The Capitol Mall, usually buzzing with activity on a weekday, sat quiet and peaceful under blue skies, few cars and even fewer people passing by the state house.

Behind them, dog-walkers and parents with children enjoying a warm spring morning dotted the usually crowded Dolores park. Even as workers nailed plywood over windows of nearby shops, the video-rental section of Fayes coffee did brisk business. \u201cWe\u2019re telling people if you want to leave your house once this week and rent 15 movies, we\u2019re not going to be charging late fees,\u201d said the store owner Justin Lawrence. Life had re-emerged, too, on the trails and sidewalks lining Oakland\u2019s iconic Lake Merritt. Sidewalks filled only with radio silence on Monday night had been reanimated by Friday morning, as bikers and joggers awkwardly navigated a 10-ft sidewalk while trying to observe social distancing norms. Nearby, Amber Fina, 30, was organizing clothes in the tent where she sleeps.

The announcements come one day after California issued a similar order to its 40 million residents. The US-Mexico border is closing to all non-essential travel, secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced. The same restrictions will take affect at the US-Canadian border tonight at midnight.

Senators are negotiating over the stimulus package, which is meant to bolster the economy through the coronavirus crisis. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said he wants an \u201cagreement in principle\u201d on the bill, which will likely cost more than $1 trillion, by tonight in order to set up a Monday vote. Senator Richard Burr called for a Senate ethics investigation into his recent stock trades. The North Carolina Republican is facing calls for his resignation after reports revealed he sold up to $1.7 million in stock last month while receiving briefings on coronavirus, sparking accusations he tried to profit off the pandemic.

Asked what he would say to Americans who are scared about the pandemic right now, Trump told NBC\u2019s Peter Alexander, \u201cI say that you\u2019re a terrible reporter.\u201d A member of Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s staff tested positive for the coronavirus. Contact tracing is under way, and the White House says neither Pence nor Trump had close contact with the individual. My west coast colleagues have a comprehensive report on Day One of California under lockdown: And you can stay on top of all the latest developments with our global coronavirus live blog here: Guardian contributor Hallie Golden reports from Seattle: Washington state residents have taken to Twitter to broadcast their frustration over local leaders not implementing a shelter-in-place order to address the rapidly growing coronavirus outbreak. They are using the hashtag #ShutItDownJay and #SHUTDOWNSEATTLE, with some posting about the many people in parks and at stores not practicing social distancing. One user posted a photo of a group of people sitting together in a truck bed. Some Twitter users wrote about how amazed they were that the governor of Washington, Jay Inslee, had not yet instructed residents to shelter-in-place, while others shared their experience still having to go to work. \u201cWhat if our workplace is still requiring us (including seniors and those with underlying health conditions) to work in crowded rooms with groups of more than ten where there is no possibility of being six feet apart?\u201d Sarah Ann posted Friday on Twitter. Other people remarked on the fact that California residents have already been ordered to shelter-in-place, and New York and Illinois locals have been instructed to stay home except for essential activities, but Washington leaders have still not implemented similar policies. Washington has the second highest number of cases in the U.S., reporting 1,524 cases, including 83 deaths. Senator Bernie Sanders is holding another \u201cvirtual roundtable\u201d on the coronavirus pandemic, this time with Sara Nelson, president of the flight attendent\u2019s union, and Saru Jayaraman, director of the Food Labor Research Center at University of California, Berkeley. You can tune in here: Guardian contributor Hallie Golden reports from Seattle: As the number of coronavirus cases in Washington continues to increase, people across the state have called on local leaders to implement a shelter-in-place order to curb the spread. Washington has the second highest number of cases in the U.S., reporting 1,376 cases, including 74 deaths. When the governor of Washington, Jay Inslee, was asked during a press conference on Wednesday whether he\u2019s getting close to calling for a shelter-in-place, he called that a \u201cfutile\u201d thing to think about. \u201cWe can\u2019t just try to speculate what may happen, 30, 40, 60 days from now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a futile exercise of chasing our tail. We got to pull together, be calm, be rational and make good decisions today.\u201d A Change.org petition pushing for a shelter-in-place order from Washington\u2019s governor has received over 500 signatures. In a tweet posted Friday, Lauren Deacon wrote, \u201cGet it together and #ShutItDownJay! If you wait any longer the blood is on your hands!\u201d In California, residents have been ordered to shelter-in-place, while New York and Illinois have instructed locals to stay home except for essential activities. On Monday, Inslee ordered a ban on gatherings of 50 people or more, as well as a two-week closure of all restaurants, bars, and entertainment and recreational facilities. Jason Rantz, who hosts a local radio show, wrote on local news site MyNorthwest.com that a shelter order may be painful, but is necessary in Washington. \u201cThe sooner we get to extreme self-isolating, the faster we\u2019ll get back to a normal life,\u201d he wrote. Localized shutdowns continue to expand across the country. The city of Miami Beach and Miami-Dade County are shutting down hotels, and the city is imposing a nightly curfew. The message? Spring break is over. In the past 24 hours we have also seen governors of the following states impose stay-at-home orders: California \u2013 population 40m New York - population 20m Illinois \u2013 population 12.5m Connecticut \u2013 population 3.5m Altogether, those four states account for approximately 76m people, or more than 20% of the US population. A member of Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s staff has tested positive for coronavirus, according to a statement by the VP\u2019s press secretary. According to the statement, neither the president nor Pence was in \u201cclose contact\u201d with the individual. The Guardian\u2019s Kathleen Caulderwood and Tom Silverstone spoke to American doctors and nurses from around the country about what it\u2019s like to treat patients as Covid-19 spreads. They say they\u2019re frustrated with a lack of testing ability, and a lack of protective equipment they need to fight Covid-19. They say the US isn\u2019t prepared for the spike of patients suffering from the virus in the coming weeks. A distinct partisan divide still exists in how seriously Americans are taking the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new poll by ABC News/Ipsos. The survey found that 87% of Democrats are concerned about getting coronavirus, compared to just 66% of Republicans. The divide is somewhat narrower than last week, when just 56% of Republicans reported concern about the virus. Strikingly, nearly three fourths of respondents (72%) said their lives had been disrupted by the coronavirus in some way \u2013 a huge jump from the previous week\u2019s poll when only 26% of Americans reported the same. The poll also found growing numbers of people working from home (17%, from 3% last week), and that the highest rates of concern for Americans came from 18-29 year olds (83%). People over 65 reported similarly high rates of concern (82%). When billionaire Mike Bloomberg launched his ill-fated presidential campaign in late 2019, he promised staffers that they would be employed through November, whether or not he won the Democratic nomination. But since dropping out after failing to win a single state on Super Tuesday (he did win American Samoa, a US territory), the former New York City mayor has reneged on that promise. Today, the Bloomberg campaign announced that it is donating $18m to the Democratic National Committee \u2013 and laying off staff in six swing states, BuzzFeed News reports. The newly unemployed staffers will lose their healthcare at the end of April. \u201cHe\u2019s chopping his employees in a pandemic,\u201d one staffer told BuzzFeed. The $18m donation to the DNC is large, and could enable the committee to hire the laid-off organizers, but there are no guarantees of employment. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: Wisconsin elections officials do not currently have enough cleaning supplies or poll workers to adequately run the state\u2019s April 7 primary, election officials warned on Friday. The officials asked Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, to help them acquire hand sanitizer, as well as with assistance recruiting poll workers in a Friday letter. They also asked him to assign a public health expert to the commission to assist with guidance for local officials and messaging. \u201cAs of today, local election officials do not have access to the people or supplies needed. This leaves voters, clerks, and poll workers to make difficult choices,\u201d Megan Wolfe, the commission\u2019s administrator, wrote on Friday. \u201cVoters should not have to choose between voting or staying healthy.\u201d Florida and Illinois, two states that held primaries this week faced criticism for moving ahead with their primary contests despite health concerns. In both states, poll workers didn\u2019t show up on election day and some of those who did lacked adequate cleaning supplies. A handful of states have already moved their primaries amid the Covid-19 outbreak. Wisconsin\u2019s April 7 election includes many local contests in addition to its presidential preference primary, including a crucial statewide state supreme court race. The state does not require an excuse to vote absentee, and election officials there have already received more than 300,000 requests for absentee ballots. Democrats are suing the state to try and give voters more time to register online or by mail and to waive the requirement that voters submit photo ID with their request for a ballot. Hello everyone, this is Julia Carrie Wong in Oakland, California, taking over the blog for the rest of the day. Connecticut governor Ned Lamont plans to order employees of \u201cnon-essential\u201d businesses to stay home due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Hartford Courant reports. The order is akin to that of New York governor Andrew Cuomo, who ordered non-essential businesses in his state closed earlier on Friday. Businesses such as grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations will remain open, but offices, malls and clothing stores will close. Construction and manufacturing can continue, according to the Courant. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Julia Carrie Wong, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: New York and Illinois told residents to stay home except for essential activities in order to mitigate the spread of coronavirus. The announcements come one day after California issued a similar order to its 40 million residents. The US-Mexico border is closing to all non-essential travel, secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced. The same restrictions will take affect at the US-Canadian border tonight at midnight. The Dow closed down 900 points, extending its weekly loss to 17%. Overall, the markets suffered their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis.

Asked what he would say to Americans who are scared about the pandemic right now, Trump told NBC\u2019s Peter Alexander, \u201cI say that you\u2019re a terrible reporter.\u201d Julia will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Dow has closed down 900 points, capping the worst week for the markets since the financial crisis. Overall, the Dow\u2019s weekly loss landed at 17% as investors\u2019 fears about the economic fallout from coronavirus intensified. Meanwhile, senators continue to negotiate over the stimulus package to bolster the economy through the crisis, a proposal that will likely end up costing more than $1 trillion. For more analysis on the market drop, read the Guardian\u2019s business live blog: Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said essential services like grocery stores would remain open and urged residents to only buy the supplies they need, as many stores\u2019 shelves go empty. \u201cGrocery stories, pharmacies, gas stations, these sources of fundamental supplies will continue to operate,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cThere is no need to run out and hoard food, gas, or medicine. Buy what you need within reason. There is enough to go around as long as people do not hoard.\u201d The \u201cstay at home\u201d order will take effect tomorrow evening and last until at least April 7. Three states are now ordering all residents to stay home except for essential activities: California, New York and Illinois. The three states collectively have 72 million residents, meaning roughly 1 in every 5 Americans is under an order to remain indoors right now. Considering the rising number of coronavirus cases across the country, other states may likely soon follow suit. Illinois is ordering all residents to stay at home except for essential activities, mirroring the restrictions in New York and California. The order will take effect tomorrow evening and will apply to all 13 million residents until at least April 7. Illinois held its presidential primary on Tuesday, which raised concerns about exposing residents to coronavirus in order to cast their ballots. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: Guaranteeing that every American can cast a mail-in ballot this year would cost between $982 million and $1.4 billion, according to a new estimate from the Brennan Center for Justice. The projection comes as many states are rushing to expand vote-by-mail options amid the coronavirus outbreak. States have a wide range of rules on who can use an absentee ballot (17 states require an excuse) and there is deep concern that unless states act urgently, Americans will have to choose between between risking their health and casting a ballot in November. Senators Ron Wyden and Amy Klobuchar have introduced legislation that would require every voter to be mailed a ballot. The Brennan Center\u2019s estimate reflects the many systems states would need to invest in to guarantee vote by mail. The center estimated it would cost between $54 and $89 million to print a ballot for every American. It would cost between $413 million and $593 million to cover the cost of mailing and receiving mail-in ballots. The estimate also lays out the costs of some of the technological upgrades to switch to voting by mail, including implementing ballot tracking ($4.2 million), and better mail-in ballot processing technology ($120 to $240 million). The Trump Organization is feeling the effect of coronavirus as well, closing properties and cutting staff as the pandemic leaves hotels largely empty. The New York Times reports: In recent days, the Trump Organization cut staff from hotels in New York and Washington, halted new reservations at a hotel overlooking the Las Vegas Strip and closed golf courses in Los Angeles and the Miami area, according to people with knowledge of the matter. It also closed the Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, which normally would be at a peak right now, with regular seasonal visits by Mr. Trump himself. The cutbacks, expected to continue in coming days, were a last resort, a company executive said, as the priority had been keeping thousands of employees and contract workers on the job. The company has a portfolio of more than a dozen golf clubs and at least partially owns or operates five-star hotels in Chicago, Hawaii, Las Vegas, New York, Vancouver and Washington, as well as Ireland and Scotland. Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago resort earlier this month, meeting with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Two of the Brazilian president\u2019s colleagues who accompanied him to Mar-a-Lago later tested positive for coronavirus. The closure of DC bars and restaurants will also extend until April 27, Mayor Muriel Bowser just announced. The city had already shut down bars and restaurants except for takeout and delivery, and that order will now last for at least another month. Bowser said the city\u2019s previous restrictions on mass gatherings would similarly be extended until at least April 27. DC will keep its schools closed until April 27, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced at a press conference moments ago. Bowser\u2019s announcement comes just after DC recorded its first coronavirus-related death, a 59-year-old man with underlying health conditions. Trump\u2019s campaign launched its own attack on Joe Biden after the Democratic candidate criticized the president\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cMost of what Biden says the government should do are things President Trump is already doing,\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign communications director, Tim Murtaugh, said in a statement. \u201cThe President is leading an unprecedented mobilization of America against the coronavirus and all Joe Biden can offer is ineffective partisan sniping from the sidelines.\u201d Biden said in a campaign call with reporters that Trump\u2019s response to the crisis had alternated between \u201cover-promising and buck-passing.\u201d Joe Biden criticized Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic in a campaign conference call with reporters. The Democratic presidential candidate said he was \u201cinspired\u201d by how Americans have responded to the crisis but argued Trump has not met the moment. \u201cIn times of crisis the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility,\u201d Biden said. \u201cUnfortunately, President Trump has not been that president.\u201d Trump has come under repeated criticism for making statements or promises during White House briefings that later have to be corrected or clarified by other officials. Just moments ago, the Mexican foreign minister came out to say Trump\u2019s statement that Mexico was suspending flights from Europe was false. Biden gave Trump this advice: \u201cStop, stop stop. Stop swerving between over-promising and buck-passing. ... Stop saying false things that make you sound like a hero.\u201d The former vice president also promised he would be taking regular questions on-camera as the coronavirus crisis unfolds. \u201cI want to be in daily or at least significant contact with the American people and communicate what I would be doing and what I think we should be doing,\u201d Biden said. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced the state has had its first death from coronavirus, as the number of cases across the country continues to climb. DeWine said he was acquainted with the unnamed individual, who was \u201cvery well respected by everyone who knew him.\u201d On a more emotional note, the governor asked state residents to remember that every coronavirus death represents not a statistic but a person who was loved. North Carolina\u2019s other senator said Richard Burr owes the state an explanation for his stock activity, as some demand Burr\u2019s resignation over the controversy. Senate Thom Tillis, another North Carolina Republican, said Burr\u2019s request for the Senate ethics committee to investigate the matter was \u201cappropriate\u201d and called for a \u201cprofessional and bipartisan inquiry into this matter.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that the work of the Senate ethics committee is notoriously slow, so it could be many months before the panel reaches any kind of conclusion on the issue. Senator Kelly Loeffler denied wrongdoing in connection to her stock trades last month, which have raised concerns she tried to profit off the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI can only speak for myself in saying I have been very careful though my entire career to adhere to the letter and the spirit of the law,\u201d the Georgia Republican told CNBC. Loeffler and one of her colleagues, Richard Burr, are facing calls to resign over their stock activity, which shielded them from significant losses as coronavirus devastated the markets in recent weeks. Burr said earlier today that he had asked the Senate ethics committee to review the matter, which Loeffler appeared to encourage. \u201cI\u2019m happy to answer any and all questions and will submit to whatever review is needed,\u201d Loeffler said. The Guardian\u2019s Leyland Cecco in Toronto writes: Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau has announced his government will turn away asylum seekers at the US-Canada border as a temporary measure, meant to further halt the flow of people into Canada amid the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cCanada and the United States are announcing a reciprocal arrangement that we will now be returning irregular migrants that attempt to cross anywhere at the Canada-US border,\u201d Trudeau said Friday. Speaking to reporters from self-isolation for the fifth day in a row, Trudeau said the plan to deny entry into Canada for asylum seekers is part of a broader agreement struck with the United States. The two countries announced plans earlier this week to shutter the 5,500 mile shared border to all non-essential travel. Trudeau stressed the \u201cexceptional measure\u201d to deny asylum seekers was temporary. The federal government had previously weighed placing those seeking to enter Canada into mandatory self-isolation. Canada has received roughly nearly 55,000 asylum claims since February, 2017. The prime minister also announced plans to support manufacturing companies across the country, including large automative companies, as they quickly re-tool much of their production lines to build much-needed medical equipment, including ventilators and masks. Early indications suggest the virus is hitting the Canadian economy hard as businesses across the country close.. Trudeau said the government has received 500,000 employment insurance applications this week\u2014 compared to 27,000 from the same period in the prior year. Canada has close to 1,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 11 documented deaths from the virus. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The US-Mexico border is being closed to non-essential travel, secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced. The news comes two days after it was announced the US-Canadian border was closing to all but essential travel. All non-essential employees in New York have been asked to stay home. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced strict guidelines for state residents, banning all non-essential gatherings of any size for any reason and ordering vulnerable groups to remain indoors. Senator Richard Burr asked the Senate ethics committee to investigate his recent stock trades. The North Carolina Republican sold up to $1.7 million in stocks last month as he received briefings on coronavirus, raising concerns that he attempted to profit off the pandemic. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Well, that was an eventful daily coronavirus briefing. Here are some of the highlights: Secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced the US-Mexican border was being closed to non-essential travel. The announcement comes two days after officials said the US-Canadian border was similarly closing to all but essential travel. Trump said the Department of Education was waiving standardized testing requirements for K-12 students. The government is also temporarily waiving interest on all federally-held student loans. Trump lashed out against the press for the second day in a row. When NBC\u2019s Peter Alexander asked what message the president had for Americans who are scared right now, Trump replied, \u201cI say that you\u2019re a terrible reporter.\u201d Dr Deborah Birx said evidence indicates the coronavirus fatality rate is twice as high for men across all age groups, based on data from Italy, which has recorded the most coronavirus deaths. Trump offered a muddled message on whether he is using the powers of the Defense Production Act. The president said he is invoking the act, but he then seemed to say he was not requiring companies to speed up production of medical supplies. Trump and Dr Anthony Fauci sent two very different messages about a potential coronavirus treatment. Trump said he was optimistic about using a malaria drug as treatment for coroanvirus. (He said yesterday that the drug had been approved for treating coronavirus, but that was not accurate.) Fauci said the evidence of the drug\u2019s benefits against coronavirus are \u201canecdotal,\u201d and it should not be viewed as some kind of miracle cure. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump and Dr Anthony Fauci both downplayed the need for universal coronavirus testing. The president said he did not believe every American should go out and receive a coronavirus test, a message that was reiterated by Fauci. \u201cI don\u2019t see how testing everybody in the country is going to help you implement this,\u201d said Fauci, referring to the social distancing restrictions the CDC has released. \u201cLet\u2019s not conflate testing with the action you have to take,\u201d Fauci added. Trump followed up on his comments yesterday that the Carnival cruise company offered their ships for the coronavirus response. The president clarified that the offer was extended by the company, but he was not currently taking them up on it. Trump again noted that two hospital ships would soon be deployed to New York City and the west coast to help free up hospital beds. Vice President Mike Pence sought to answer the question asked to Trump about what message they had for scared Americans right now. \u201cI would say do not be afraid, be vigilant,\u201d said the vice president, who is leading the coronavirus task force. Pence noted early evidence indicates coronavirus is three times more contagious than the flu, which is why Americans need to take every possible precaution right now. Dr Anthony Fauci criticized senator Ron Johnson for downplaying the threat of coronavirus and questioning the drastic government response to it. \u201cI\u2019m not denying what a nasty disease COVID-19 can be, and how it\u2019s obviously devastating to somewhere between 1 and 3.4 percent of the population,\u201d Johnson said earlier this week. \u201cBut that means 97 to 99 percent will get through this and develop immunities and will be able to move beyond this. But we don\u2019t shut down our economy because tens of thousands of people die on the highways. Fauci said it was a \u201cfalse equivalency to compare traffic accidents\u201d to coronavirus and emphasized a drastic response was necessary when a new and dangerously contagious virus was uncovered. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo is now taking questions from reporters about how the State Department is addressing the coronavirus pandemic. When Trump introduced Pompeo, he referred to the State Department as the \u201cDeep State Department.\u201d The derisive nickname appeared to prompt a baffled chuckle from Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. However, when Pompeo was asked about Trump\u2019s use of the term, the secretary shrugged off any concern and insisted the president respects the diplomats carrying out America\u2019s foreign policy. Trump\u2019s former press secretary, Sean Spicer, asked the president about reports of senators selling stock last month as they received briefings on coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI find them all to be very honorable people, and they said they did nothing wrong.\u201d Senator Richard Burr is facing calls for his resignation over his trade activity, and he has called on the Senate ethics committee to investigate the matter. The country just saw a surreal moment where Trump called on his former press secretary, Sean Spicer, to ask a question during the briefing. Spicer appeared to be in the briefing room on behalf of his new employer Newsmax, a conservative website. Spicer\u2019s appearance in the briefing room triggered some immediate criticism from the White House press corps: Trump was asked again what message he had for Americans who are currently scared about the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThere is a very low incidence of death,\u201d the president said in response, predicting the country would be stronger than ever after combatting the virus. Health experts have estimated the rate of death from coronavirus is about 1%, making it ten times more deadly than the flu. Trump was asked what he had to say to Americans who are scared about the spread of coronavirus right now. \u201cI say that you\u2019re a terrible reporter,\u201d Trump told NBC\u2019s Peter Alexander. \u201cThe American people are looking for answers, and they\u2019re looking for hope,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s really bad reporting.\u201d Trump said he did not believe a national lockdown was necessary at this stage, while New York and California have told residents to stay indoors except for essential activities. The president said New York and California are \u201chotbeds\u201d of coronavirus, but some parts of the country do not have to take the same steps. On the subject of social distancing, Trump said it is \u201cprobably the hottest term there is\u201d right now. Trump said his administration is now invoking the Defense Production Act to speed up the production of medical supplies. The president signed the act earlier this week but said he would not use the powers of it unless absolutely necessary. Trump had a call this morning with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who urged him to invoke the act, and the president said he is now using it to accelerate medical supply production. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, applauded the governors of New York and California for ordering residents to stay indoors except for essential activities. Fauci noted he himself is a New Yorker, and he urged fellow residents to adhere to the restrictions outlined by Governor Andrew Cuomo this morning. \u201cI know what New Yorkers can do,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cWe\u2019re tough.\u201d Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force response coordinator, said data from Italy indicate the coronavirus fatality rate is twice as high for men across all age groups. Birx reiterated the virus appears to be less deadly for younger people, but she emphasized younger Americans still need to take precautions. \u201cNo one is immune,\u201d Birx said. \u201cWe know it\u2019s highly contagious to everyone. Do not interpret mild or moderate disease as lack of contagion or that you\u2019re immune.\u201d Secretary of state Mike Pompeo has confirmed the US-Mexican border will be closing to non-essential travel. The announcement comes two days after officials said the US-Canadian border would similarly ban all non-essential travel amid the coronavirus pandemic. Pompeo also reiterated that the State Department has issued a Level 4 advisory for all international travel, urging all Americans to stay in the country or immediately return home if they are abroad. Trump said secretary of state Mike Pompeo would announce restrictions on US-Mexican border travel today. However, the president then appeared to preempt the announcement by saying the southern border was closing to non-essential travel. The restrictions mirror those placed on the US-Canadian border earlier this week. Trump expressed approval of California and New York\u2019s decisions to order all residents to stay home except for essential activities. \u201cI applaud them,\u201d Trump said of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and California Governor Gavin Newsom. The president has also confirmed the tax deadline has been extended three months to July 15, as Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin announced earlier today. Trump said he had a \u201cvery good\u201d call with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer about the Senate stimulus package to bolster the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. The president also announced the Department of Education was waiving standard testing requirements for students in elementary school through high school. Trump said the government was also temporarily waiving interest on all federally-held student loans. The White House is about to hold its daily coronavirus briefing, where the president is expected to announce restrictions on travel at the US-Mexican border. Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was spotted in the briefing room. Spicer recently joined the conservative website Newsmax. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the new restrictions would take effect Sunday evening. The governor pushed back against a reporter who characterized the restrictions as a \u201cshelter-in-place order.\u201d Cuomo emphasized the language used to describe the restrictions matter, and he does not want to unnecessarily scare people about the new reality. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he made the decision to restrict all non-essential activity in consultation with local leaders, but he emphasized he accepts \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the decision. \u201cIf somebody is unhappy, if somebody wants to blame somebody, they should blame me,\u201d Cuomo said. The governor said he wants to be able to look back on the coronavirus pandemic and be able to say, \u201cI did everything we could do.\u201d Cuomo said, \u201cThis is about saving lives. If everything we do saves just one life, I\u2019ll be happy.\u201d New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the state now has 7,102 cases of coronavirus, marking an increase of 2,950. Cuomo retierated the increasing number of cases is a reflection of the expanding testing capacities in the state. \u201cThe tests are just demonstrating what was,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cFinding positives is a good thing because then we can isolate and track back.\u201d The governor noted the state did 10,000 tests last night. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state is banning non-essential gatherings of any size for any reason amid the pandemic. The governor noted all residents over the age of 70 and other vulnerable populations must remain indoors. Cuomo said residents can go outside for solitary exercise, but he emphasized there should not be groups gathering outside for any reason. \u201cThere are people and places in New York City where it looks lke life as usual,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cNo, this is not life as usual.\u201d New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced all non-essential workers in the state must stay home amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThis is the most drastic action we can take,\u201d Cuomo said. The announcement comes one day after California Governor Gavin Newsom announced all of the state\u2019s 40 million residents must stay indoors except for essential activities. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said lawmakers should not be allowed to own individual stock, as senator Richard Burr faces calls to resign over his stock activity. Burr sold up to $1.7 million in stocks last month as he was receiving briefings on coronavirus, raising concerns that he attempted to profit off the pandemic. Burr released a statement this morning denying wrongdoing and asking the Senate ethics committee to investigate the matter. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is moving quickly on the third coronavirus bill, which is aimed at bolstering the economy through the pandemic. McConnell said he wants an \u201cagreement in principle\u201d on the package by tonight so that senators can vote on the bill Monday. That timeline would require senators and their staffers to work through the entire weekend to have the bill ready by Monday. McConnell said the $1 trillion package Senate Republicans released yesterday -- which outlines direct payments to American families and $200 billion to airlines and other distressed industries, among other things -- would be the starting point for negotiations. However, Senate Democrats have already signaled they want many changes made to the bill, so a lot of negotiating will need to take place between now and Monday to set up a vote. Senator Richard Burr has denied wrongdoing in his massive stock sales last month, which occured as he received briefings on coronavirus. In a new statement, the North Carolina Republican called on the Senate ethics committee to review the trades, but Burr insisted he relied solely on public reports to inform his stock activity. Joe Biden called on companies to commit to not buying back their own stock as the economy suffers because of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump surpisingly said yesterday that he would be \u201cokay\u201d with requiring companies who receive federal bailout money to commit to not buying back their own stock. For reference, the tax cuts the president signed into law in 2017 sparked a record-setting round of corporate buybacks, which were widely criticized by Democratic lawmakers. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin previewed the likely tax filing deadline extension last week, after testifying on Capitol Hill. \u201cFor small and medium sized businesses, for hardworking individuals, we are going to recommend to the president that we allow the delay and that they don\u2019t have to pay an interest or penalty on that,\u201d Mnuchin told reporters last week. \u201cThat will have the impact of putting over $200 billion back into the economy, and that will create a very big stimulus.\u201d Interestingly, Mnuchin\u2019s tweet announcing the extension said it would apply to \u201call taxpayers and businesses,\u201d even though he signaled last week some of the wealthiest Americans would be excluded. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the tax filing deadline would be pushed back three months, to July 15, amid the coronavirus pandemic. Mnuchin said Trump had directed the move, which will allow individuals and businesses additional time to file and pay the government without suffering a penalty. NBC News announced one of their longtime employees had died after testing positive for coronavirus. Larry Edgeworth had spent 25 years working as an audio technician at the network\u2019s 30 Rockefeller Plaza headquarters in New York. His wife said he suffered from other health issues. \u201cMany of you were fortunate enough to work with Larry over the years, so you know that he was the guy you wanted by your side no matter where you were,\u201d NBC News Chairman Andy Lack said in an email to staff this morning. A number of Edgeworth\u2019s NBC colleagues shared their memories of him after his passing: Kevin Hassett, the White House\u2019s former top economist, said he is returning to the Trump administration to serve as an adivser on the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Hassett spent two years serving as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and left the White House last summer. Hassett has recently been warning of severe economic consequences tied to the coronavirus pandemic, predicting the US will lose 1 million jobs this month alone. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at one of the biggest negative job numbers we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Hassett told CNN on Monday. The Trump administration is expected to announce travel restrictions at the US-Mexico border today, as officials from both countries work to mitigate the spread of coronavirus. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo said yesterday he was working with his Mexican counterpart on limiting cross-border traffic: According to Reuters, the restrictions are expected to be similar to those that Trump announced on Wednesday for the US-Canadian border, where all non-essential travel has been banned. Dr Anthony Fauci said Americans should prepare for having to stay home for several weeks in order to mitigate the spread of coronavirus. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told NBC\u2019s Savannah Guthrie that the trajectory of outbreaks in other areas indicated Americans would need to continue their social distancing beyond the month of March. \u201cIt\u2019s at least going to be several weeks,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cI cannot see that all of a sudden, next week or two weeks from now, it\u2019s going to be over. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a chance of that. I think it\u2019s going to be several weeks.\u201d Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, is facing calls for his resignation after ProPublica reported he sold up to $1.7 million in stocks last month while receiving briefings on coronavirus. In the weeks since, the market has suffered severe losses that have impacted many Americans\u2019 retirement savings. NPR also obtained a recording of Burr privately warning that coronavirus was \u201caggressive in its transmission\u201d and could create a crisis similar to that of the 1918 flu pandemic. The reports of Burr\u2019s actions triggered immediate calls for his resignation from both sides of the aisle. Progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez accused Burr of failing in his duty to the public: Even Fox News host Tucker Carlson said Burr had to resign if he could not come up with an explanation for his actions: \u201cThere is no greater moral crime than betraying your country in a time of crisis, and that appears to be what happened,\u201d Carlson said. Good morning, live blog readers! Donald Trump is once again coming under harsh criticism for his response to the coronavirus pandemic, with New York Mayor Bill de Blasio telling MSNBC this morning that the federal government has been \u201cabsent\u201d as the city grapples with thousands of cases. \u201cHe should get the hell out of the way and let the military do its job,\u201d said de Blasio, who simultaneously praised the work of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. The mayor warned that if Trump does not immediately deploy the military and speed up production of medical supplies, the consequences could be tragic. \u201cA lot of people are going to die who don\u2019t have to die,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cIf the president doesn\u2019t act within days to maximize production, to get surgical masks, if he doesn\u2019t mobilize the US military, people will die.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Stories about people travelling in buses from cities and descending on small towns and stripping the supermarket shelves are rife on social media \u2013 and some mainstream media \u2013 but the evidence is scarce. Guardian Australia, along with several ABC and regional journalists, have attempted to back up the claims about the organised bus tours of shoppers but all came up empty. Facebook feeds are full of stories about someone\u2019s sister who saw a minibus pull up outside a grocer in Deniliquin, or Kyneton, or Gulgong, but no one has a photo to prove it. In the age of camera phones, we couldn\u2019t find any credible photographs of this reported phenomenon anywhere. Guardian Australia found one supermarket where a security guard had been employed to check shoppers were not from out of town, but no evidence of buses. Some of the posts say the buses are full of \u201cAsian\u201d or \u201cChinese\u201d passengers. \u201cEvery report I\u2019ve seen said those on the buses were Chinese,\u201d said one commenter. \u201cHighly organised with different buses hitting different towns at the same time.\u201d The Daily Mail called it \u201ctourist panic-shopping\u201d and quoted \u201cangry residents\u201d on Facebook: \u201cPeople from Sydney [are] packing cars to the brims. Our supermarkets don\u2019t get enough supplies, only enough for our population let alone hoarders. It\u2019s really sad and I think it needs to be policed from now.\u201d On Tuesday the claims were given credibility by a story in the Age headlined \u201cBusloads of city dwellers stripping regional shelves bare\u201d, although there was no racial element in the report. \u201cRegional towns are being swamped by busloads of panicked \u2018Coles tourists\u2019 who are driving from the city to strip supermarket shelves of basic supplies,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe Age has heard reports of city-dwellers rushing supermarkets in Gisborne, Kyneton, Romsey, Seymour, Woodend, Daylesford and even in towns as far away as Kerang and Deniliquin.\u201d While the paper said they\u2019d \u201cheard reports\u201d there was little in the way of evidence to back it up and no photographic proof. Guardian Australia contacted two of the supermarkets mentioned in the Age \u2013 the Romsey IGA and the Woodend Coles \u2013 and both stores denied busloads of people from other areas were shopping. On Thursday an appearance by home affairs minister Peter Dutton on the Ray Hadley mornings show on 2GB gave the story a boost \u2013 and fuelled its racial overtones. Hadley claimed he was \u201csceptical at first\u201d but now he had \u201cphotographic evidence\u201d that hoarding and panic buying had morphed into busloads of Asian shoppers descending on small towns. \u201cIt\u2019s a busload of Asian Australians, I presume with a trailer on the back, just going to these shopping centres and shops \u2026 Aldi, Coles and Woolies and clearing the joint out,\u201d Hadley said. Dutton agreed and said there was an investigation under way into what he believed was a criminal enterprise. \u201cWe do have some people I think that are profiteering, Dutton said. \u201cThey\u2019re hoarding, not for their own consumption, I think they\u2019re either sending some of the products overseas or they\u2019re selling it in a black market arrangement in Australia. \u201cI\u2019m gonna come after those people \u2026 It won\u2019t be a pretty experience when we deal with them.\u201d The radio station posted grainy photographs on its website and on Facebook, which a listener called Ben claims to have taken \u201cin front of a Woolworths and says the bus went to Orange, Parkes and Forbes in the one day\u201d. Guardian Australia spoke to Coles management who said they knew nothing about it. One of the people quoted by the Age, Reverend Mel Clark from St Mary\u2019s Anglican church in Woodend, a tourist destination 30 minutes\u2019 drive from Daylesford in Victoria, was the only person we found who had witnessed buses at their supermarket. Clark told Guardian Australia she had seen two minibuses of about 15 people pull up outside Coles last week.

      "bodyText": "Simon Armitage has written a poem to address the coronavirus and a lockdown that is slowly being implemented across the UK, saying that the art form can be consoling in times of crisis because it \u201casks us just to focus, and think, and be contemplative\u201d. The poet laureate\u2019s new poem, Lockdown, moves from the outbreak of bubonic plague in Eyam in the 17th century, when a bale of cloth from London brought fleas carrying the plague to the Derbyshire village, to the epic poem Meghad\u016bta by the Sanskrit poet K\u0101lid\u0101sa. Armitage, who is at home with his family in West Yorkshire, said that \u201cas the lockdown became more apparent and it felt like the restrictions were closing in, the plague in Eyam became more and more resonant\u201d to him. His poem references Eyam\u2019s boundary stone, which contained holes that the quarantined villagers would put their money in to pay for provisions from outside, and then fill with vinegar in the hope it would cleanse the coins. It also touches on the doomed romance between a girl who lived in Eyam and a boy outside the village who talked to her from a distance, until she stopped coming. The poem was also influenced by a scene in Meghad\u016bta in which an exile sends reassuring words to his wife in the Himalayas via a passing cloud. \u201cThe cloud is convinced to take the message because the yaksha, which I think is sort of an attendant spirit to a god of wealth, tells him what amazing landscapes and scenery he\u2019s going to pass across. I thought it was a kind of hopeful, romantic gesture,\u201d said Armitage. He thought there was a message to be learned \u201cabout taking things easy and being patient and trusting the Earth and maybe having to come through this slightly slower, and wiser, at the other end \u2013 given that one thing that\u2019s accelerated the problem is our hectic lives and our proximities and the frantic ways we go about things\u201d. Poetry is \u201cby definition consoling\u201d because \u201cit often asks us just to focus and think and be contemplative\u201d, said Armitage. \u201cPoetry is often about detail, even to the point where there\u2019s just something sacramental in the ordinary descriptions of everyday life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that there\u2019s going to be a book of poems that are consolation against catastrophe, but just in poetry\u2019s nature, in the way it asks us to be considerate of language, it also asks us to be considerate of each other and the world. In the relationship with thoughtful language, something more thoughtful occurs.\u201d Lockdown by Simon Armitage And I couldn\u2019t escape the waking dream of infected fleas in the warp and weft of soggy cloth by the tailor\u2019s hearth in ye olde Eyam. Then couldn\u2019t un-see the Boundary Stone, that cock-eyed dice with its six dark holes, thimbles brimming with vinegar wine purging the plagued coins. Which brought to mind the sorry story of Emmott Syddall and Rowland Torre, star-crossed lovers on either side of the quarantine line whose wordless courtship spanned the river till she came no longer. But slept again, and dreamt this time of the exiled yaksha sending word to his lost wife on a passing cloud, a cloud that followed an earthly map of camel trails and cattle tracks, streams like necklaces, fan-tailed peacocks, painted elephants, embroidered bedspreads of meadows and hedges, bamboo forests and snow-hatted peaks, waterfalls, creeks, the hieroglyphs of wide-winged cranes and the glistening lotus flower after rain, the air hypnotically see-through, rare, the journey a ponderous one at times, long and slow but necessarily so.",

      "bodyText": "Thank yous are too often implied. They get casually dumped in a box labelled \u201ctake it as read\u201d, presumed too self-evident to be publicly stated. Sometimes they\u2019re expressed through a knowing nod or a smile, or \u2013 before our current plight, of course \u2013 a gently squeezed hand clasp. In normal times that\u2019s not really good enough, and in a time of mounting catastrophe, it definitely isn\u2019t. So, this is a thank you, more profusely meant than any other. Thank you to the supermarket workers, as panicked people throng your stores, leaving your shelves in need of relentless replenishment, your checkouts requiring constant attention and disinfection. You\u2019ve been compelled to offer reassurance to a public who \u2013 even in times of calm \u2013 can be prone to taking their private frustrations out on you, believing that the power dynamic shields them from retribution. In some US states, you have now been rightly reclassified as emergency workers, and yet most of you toil for long hours on wages too low to sustain a comfortable life. Thank you to the paramedics, midwives, nurses and doctors, overwhelmed and under-resourced even before a public health emergency detonated in your hospitals and ambulances. You are lacking in equipment and staff, and \u2013 with insufficient masks, protective gear or testing \u2013 are risking your health to save lives. You have suffered a decade-long squeeze in NHS funding, falling real wages and, in the case of junior doctors, the workhorses of the NHS, vilification when you dared to strike to defend your conditions. More frightened ill people will enter your care as conditions deteriorate in the coming weeks, and yet your efforts will prolong lives and relieve suffering. Thank you, too, to the hospital administrators, managers, secretaries, rota coordinators and other pillars of a desperately strained NHS, without whom it would collapse. Thank you to the cleaners, among the nation\u2019s most undervalued and underpaid workers. As it is, you save thousands of lives each year \u2013 in hospitals and in office blocks \u2013 by extinguishing the invisible tormentors of our immune systems. Many middle-class professionals are able to retreat to the relative safety of working from their homes, but no floor can be cleaned remotely: you have now become frontline soldiers in a war against a remorseless killer. When cleaners belonging to the Independent Workers of Great Britain went on strike, their slogan was \u201cwe are not the dirt we clean\u201d, and yet that is how bosses and society have treated you, even now as your health is imperilled. Thank you to those who produce and deliver food and the goods necessary for a healthy existence; to those who keep our transport system operating, preventing the collapse of a nation\u2019s infrastructure. Thank you to the teachers who, by continuing to educate the children of key workers, allow doctors and nurses to focus on saving lives and the country to function. And as we say our thank yous, let\u2019s note who we are disproportionately saying them to: women, minorities and the low-paid, all of whom always suffer the most in every crisis. Thank yous are important, but they are not sufficient. If this gratitude is to be given meaning, it should lead to an overdue reassessment of who we value most in society and how we treat them.

You had as many people down here as you would on New Year\u2019s Day,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was one of the busiest days I\u2019ve ever seen and it was cause for concern, but it\u2019s outdoors \u2014 I could see that people were generally keeping their distance, so even though the beach was incredibly packed, you could see that people were keeping a metre and a half, two metres away from one another.\u201d The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, on Saturday called the behaviour of beachgoers \u201cunacceptable\u201d as the number of diagnosed coronavirus cases in Australia reached 1,000. \u201cTo those small few who are doing the wrong thing, think of others, and to those who have local responsibilities, discharge those responsibilities,\u201d Hunt said. Advice from Australian authorities is to limit outdoor gatherings to fewer than 500 people, and indoor gatherings to fewer than 100 people. Venues hosting smaller gatherings, including restaurants, cafes and hotels, are required to provide four 4 sq metres per patron. People are advised to maintain a 1.5 metre distance from others, in an attempt to prevent the transmission of the coronavirus.",

      "bodyText": "So, it\u2019s a fourth championship in five seasons for Melbourne City - the team that has changed the face of the domestic competition since their arrival. Steph Catley is awarded the player of the match - and fair reward too for her rampaging runs down City\u2019s left. Sydney FC\u2019s incredible ever-present skipper Teresa Polias with a heart-tugging speech. \u201cThis group of girls - I will lose beside you a thousand times, if that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d Before reverting to the mandatory football catch cry of \u201cWe go again next season\u201d. Steph Catley is her bubbly, effusive self. \u201cIt was such a fun game today\u201d. A sentiment not shared presumably by at least half of the players on the pitch. And after a curious handshake-free ceremony that includes players picking up their own medals off a tressle table, finally City lift the trophy. And on the balance of the season nobody can say it\u2019s not well-deserved. So many incredible talking points. Did I just hear that correctly - is that a 7th W-League title for Aivi Luik?! Not bad for a competition that\u2019s only been running eleven seasons. It\u2019s an elated Kyah Simon talking post-game. \u201cI missed most of last season, so to come back, win a title, play undefeated, it\u2019s a dream come true\u201d. Both she and Steph Catley congratulate their opponents Sydney on a hard-fought game. You have to say, as a neutral, they were unfortunate not to get something from that game. At the very least you would have loved to see the pedigree City side be forced to go out and really win the contest. But, that\u2019s finals football - sometimes just one moment, one error, can be the difference. And there\u2019s the whistle! Melbourne City have won their fourth W-League championship. The Sydney FC players slump to the ground - they gave their absolute all, and many would say they were hugely unfortunate to lose in this manner. City won\u2019t mind - there players run to hug one another and the bench celebrates. Last year\u2019s blemish is forgotten - City are champions once again! 90 + 3 min: Sayer with it in midfield, but she has her pocket picked by Van Egmond, and the scattering of home supporters sound their appreciation as Williams dives on a loose ball and soaks up vital seconds. 90 + 1 min: Oh my, it\u2019s almost a second for City, as Mijatovic closes down Bledsoe, but the ricochet rolls just past the post. What a hammer blow that could have been. Sydney FC push Alanna Kennedy up front - they\u2019re throwing everything at this. 89 min: City win repeat throw ins and they\u2019re in no hurry as they take the sting out of the game. And the board comes up - we\u2019ll have four added minutes. Is there one last flourish for Sydney FC? 87 min: They\u2019re throwing everything at this, Sydney FC - terrific heart given the mismatch, at least on paper in terms of experience, between these two squads. Ibini finds Huerta inside the box, but her touch is poor and the defence steps in to clear. 84 min: Final roll of the dice from Sydney, as Hawkesby comes on for Ray, and Watt replaces Simon for City. Six minutes plus added time to make a name. Can either of these print their names in light? 82 min: Brilliant work from Kennedy and Brush who cover as Carpenter breaks free after a fine ball from Simon. The first closes down the flying fullback, the latter anticipates the cutback ball and clears. 80 min: Save! Was that the match?! Huerta with a terrific stepover to free up Princess Ibini inside the box. She drills her shot across Williams, but Australia\u2019s No 1 gets a strong hand to it and saves. Massive stop from the City custodian. 79 min: Kennedy plays a booming crossfield ball to look for Latsko but it just runs out of field. City in no hurry with the restart to the frustration of the Sydney FC bench. 76 min: A lengthy delay and chat as we stop for a drop ball, but Sydney FC players are perplexed at the non-award of what appeared an obvious offside. Anywho, we play on. Still a lot of spike and feeling out there - so many born competitors in both sides, they won\u2019t go quietly today, Sydney FC. 73 min: Amy Sayer comes on for Nat Tobin in the Sydney FC midfield. Another underrated showing from the veteran sky blue. Up against players the like of Van Egmond, Kinga and Luik, but she hasn\u2019t looked out of place. What can the youngster add to the contest. 69 min: A few signs that this one is just starting to get stretched - a really crucial 5-10 minutes ahead; if Sydney can pinch one here it really could be game on, but conversely, this might be where City put the game to bed. Clare Lawrence has written in: Sydney started strong but have faded since conceding that goal. Two seriously unlucky moments with Bledsoe\u2019s mistake and the uncalled penalty and now is when you would really love to have Logarzo and Foord walking out in sky blue. Sydney will need to score first to have any hope of coming back. Don\u2019t disagree with that assessment, Clare. You can\u2019t look backwards but given how little game time they\u2019ve seen respectively in the UK Super League, you\u2019d love to have seen those two Matildas playing for Sydney today. 67 min: A first sub for City - it\u2019s Mijatovic on for Kinga. They\u2019re not taking the foot off the pedal, a striker for a midfielder. Many would try and shut up shop, but you have to respect the attacking instincts. 65 min: Luik with a good win in midfield - she\u2019s not billed as one of the stars of this side, but her work is critical to City\u2019s end product. Carpenter is increasingly coming into her own as bodies tire. Sydney FC have kept her pretty well marshalled, but she flashes a shot/cross just past Bledsoe\u2019s post. Another warning shot across the bows. 62 min: Ante Juric looks to make his first change, as Princess Ibini gets stripped and ready to enter the fray. It\u2019s Siemsen off, to some raised eyebrows. The joint-golden boot trots off, she won\u2019t add to her tally tonight. 60 min: A break in play as Agnew receives treatment. She and Simon went down in the box with City players screaming for a penalty. Replays suggest it was a fair challenge, with the striker caught between two defenders fighting for the ball. 57 min: Simon springs the offside trap - it\u2019s a huge chance one-on-one, but she drags her shot wide! A big let off for Sydney FC - can they use that as a morale booster to find the equaliser? Their final could have been over then and there. 55 min: Carpenter and Agnew come together, and it\u2019s a free kick to the Sydney FC left back. Kennedy with a poor giveaway at the back, but she covers her error with a good foot in. There are tackles flying in everywhere out there - there may be hardly any crowd due to the coronavirus regulations but it\u2019s certainly not a friendly. 52 min: Van Egmond and Catley play a short corner and it\u2019s the skipper who curls it in, but it\u2019s headed cleared by Taylor Ray. She\u2019s been good in the heart of midfield, the FC youngster, and Sydney clear their lines. 49 min: Off the line! What a chance that was - Sydney FC get one-on-one with Williams, who gets a vital hand to the lofted shot to slow it down, before Carpenter recovers to clear with the goal gaping! Not sure who got the shot away - I think it was Latsko? Could she have made more of that, the American? Credit the keeping, and then the recovery from Carpenter though. 47 min: Words from City\u2019s coach just after the break - Rado Vidosic wants to see his side moving the ball quicker and playing with more width to get round this Sydney FC press. He gives credit to his opponents, but remains confident his side can see it out from here. Second half! 45 min: And we\u2019re away - the final 45 minutes of the W-League season - unless we head to an unprecedented extra-time and/or penalty shootout. So, your thoughts on that opening half? Where is it being won and lost? And who could be a potential X-factor in the second stanza? And there\u2019s the whistle. Sydney FC harried and hurried, but it\u2019s two significant slices of fortune that see the undefeated regular-season side Melbourne City take a narrow lead at the break. An unfortunate goalkeeping error from Bledsoe gifted City the opener, before Steph Catley was fortunate not to concede a penalty after the ball appeared to strike her hand inside the box. It\u2019s still in the balance this one, but you\u2019d imagine Sydney have to score next to be any chance from here. 45 min: Just the one minute of added time, but some concern as the City skipper Catley stays down. Not too clear what the injury is, perhaps a whack on the schnozz. She appears to be up and moving freely again now. 42 min: Ray steps in and wins it in midfield before Siemsen releases Huerta who forces a fine save out of Williams. She hasn\u2019t been overly tested, the Matildas\u2019 No 1, but she had to be on her mettle there to deny the former Mexican, now American, international. 39 min: Kinga is finding plenty of the ball at the base of midfield, as she starts another good passage of play for City. Another coming together between Huerta and Carpenter. We\u2019ve spoken a lot about Carpenter\u2019s youth over the years but she\u2019s also pretty tenacious. Plenty of robust stuff going on out there. 36 min: Interesting! Catley looks to take a ball in the face in the box, but replays suggest it was an outstretched arm! No VAR in the W-League, but you\u2019d have to say - they were fortunate not to concede a penalty there, the premiers. Neither Melbourne City nor Sydney FC have conceded a penalty this season in the league, but that really should have been the first. Huge reprieve - and fortune favours the table-toppers once again. 33 min: They\u2019re struggling to play it out, Sydney. When they do win it they\u2019re not finding teammates to feet, as they increasingly look long. Another close call - it\u2019s Simon who throws a boot at it, and has that rattled off the crossbar! It has. A really dangerous patch for the visitors - they cannot afford to go two down; City simply wouldn\u2019t let a lead like that slip. 30 min: City with it at the back, looking to build some passages of sustained possession. Sydney are still pressing well, nipping in and not allowing Melbourne too much time on the ball, as Brush steps in and clears upfield. City then find Emslie free in the box and Bledsoe goes a long way to saving her blushes there - that\u2019s a huge one-on-one save! 26 min: A well-worked move from City sees Barnes feed Van Egmond who tests Bledsoe with a sharp flat strike. Better from the \u2018keeper, who will be grateful for that solid touch. They\u2019re starting to see plenty of the ball down their left-hand side, Melbourne City - Sydney may have kept Carpenter quite so far, but it\u2019s the skipper Catley that\u2019s really posing problems. 23 min: A fierce coming together between Latsko and Carpenter who thunder in to win it. It\u2019s deemed a freekick to Sydney FC, but City get to the cross first and look to launch a swift counter attack. 20 min: A real sucker punch for Ante Juric\u2019s side - they didn\u2019t deserve that on the balance of play - and it\u2019s not like a team like Melbourne City need any extra help. A real test of character of now for Sydney FC. 15 min: Ach! I\u2019d just given Bledsoe the pump up, but it\u2019s an awful goalkeeping error. Catley plays a fine one-two with Van Egmond and receives the ball at the edge of the box. She drives a decent strike straight at the Sydney FC shotstopper, but she\u2019s got her hands all wrong, and it spills in! What an awful moment for the on-loan Washington Spirit star. 12 min: A ball in from City\u2019s right, but it\u2019s too long for Simon in the middle, Bledsoe happily sees it out for a goal kick. After a good first ten from the visitors, it\u2019s City that are starting to get their feet on the ball, as Catley darts in from the left to the delight of the small smuggled-in home supporters. 9 min: As you\u2019d expect in a final a relatively tight opening offering. Sydney are pressing high and hard, snapping at the heels of the City playmakers, and they\u2019ve earned a freekick in an attacking situation. Huerta looks to float it in, but its Emma Checker who gets to it first with the head, and clears. 6 min: Van Egmond looks for Emslie down the left, but she\u2019s just offside and play comes back. So much experience between Kennedy and Brush at the back for Sydney FC and they\u2019ve got that one exactly right. 4 min: An early touch for Sydney\u2019s \u2018keeper Bledsoe. What a gem in the competition she\u2019s been over the seasons. Could there be a decisive contribution from her in today\u2019s final? 1 min: It\u2019s Sydney FC in an unfamiliar white strip, with the home side winning the right to wear the sky blue that\u2019s customary to both teams. An early opportunity for Latsko - one of Sydney\u2019s US imports - but she blazes a shot/cross deep over Williams\u2019 goal. Okay! We\u2019re not a million miles away from kickoff - the players are out on the pitch, going through some last warm ups. Can\u2019t wait. Unsurprisingly, it is Melbourne City that dominate the head-to-head in recent years: you have to go back to 2017 for the last time Sydney FC stopped this Rolls Royce machine. They\u2019re on a 15-game unbeaten streak in the league, too - but you just never know in one-off finals matches. All the pressure will have been on City this week, Sydney know they\u2019ll be up against it. A goal to Remy Siemsen could send her to outright top in the golden boot race - I wonder if that figures in the back of the Sydney FC striker\u2019s thinking? I can\u2019t stop looking at the City XI, phwaor. Seven Matildas, a Scottish, Kiwi and 100-cap former Japanese international superstar. And then they\u2019ve got players like Dobson and Mijatovic to come off the bench. Absolute fire. For Sydney FC there\u2019s still plenty to like in a squad that\u2019s strong enough that there\u2019s no room for rising stars Shay Evans or Julia Vignes even on the bench. A huge day for young midfielder Taylor Ray you\u2019d imagine, while Canadian import Lindsay Agnew has a tremendous task on her hands to try and stop the rampaging Ellie Carpenter down Sydney\u2019s left. But - without further ado - to team news! Here\u2019s how the home side, Melbourne City, will line up: And the visitors, Sydney FC: So, a slightly unusual W-League final awaits us. Given the context of the coronavirus it will officially be a behind-closed-doors events at AAMI Park, but the word is the governing body has allowed a handful of tickets for players for their immediate family. Presuming they all sit five seats apart, you imagine. It\u2019s a strange vibe for what should be a day of celebration. Melbourne City were disappointing last season, failing to make the finals after three consecutive championships, but \u201cRado\u2019s revolution\u201d has paid dividends in coach Rado Vidosic\u2019s second season at the helm - some of the football City have played this campaign has been scintillating; it\u2019s hard to see where opposite number Ante Juric can find weakness. Scottish international Claire Emslie has been imperious this season for the home side, but she has told the BBC how tricky the off-field circumstances have made preparations. \u201cThis week has been a bit crazy. It\u2019s mixed emotions really. The last two days have been really stressful off the pitch because obviously countries are going into lockdown. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a few internationals so are we going to get home? Will we be stuck in Australia? Where are we going to live? All that sort of thing is going through players\u2019 heads.\u201d Hi all. Best of season to thee and thine - I hope this finds you well, wherever around the world you\u2019re following our coverage today. Are you a Thorns tragic from west coast USA, still remembering the glory days of Steph Catley tearing it up alongside Vero Boquete, Tobin Heath, Christine Sinclair and Alex Morgan? Get in touch, we\u2019d love to hear from you - via twitter or email. I want to hear predictions, reminiscences; hell - send us some fan pics of you with EvE, Kyah, Alanna Kennedy etc. They\u2019ve competed in seven of the eleven W-League finals, and as the winners of the last four championships there\u2019s little doubt that these are the two powerhouses of the Australian domestic game. With the late-season raiding of the W-League by overseas leagues though this still looms as a mismatch, such has been the form of Melbourne City this season the loss of players like Caitlin Foord and Chloe Logarzo comes as a huge blow to Sydney FC as they look to defend their title. Stopping City\u2019s Matildas-laden squad is the starting point - Emily van Egmond has been scoring for fun, Ellie Carpenter is arguably the hottest property in the league, and Kyah Simon has made a big comeback to the top of her game this season after a run of injuries. Still, there\u2019s plenty of experience in Sydney FC\u2019s line up, whose back five (including \u2018keeper) remain imposing, and it could be a game tailor made for Princess Ibini or Remy Siemsen to make a name for themselves. Plenty to look forward to in this one - the big dance - the 2020 W-League grand final.",

But the man responsible for a joke WhatsApp audio clip that claimed the Ministry of Defence was about to requisition Wembley Stadium to cook the world\u2019s biggest lasagne has said his viral success also shows the risks of believing everything that gets sent to you on the messaging service.

Exams are cancelled.</p> <p>You may have read about <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/03/12/during-pandemic-isaac-newton-had-work-home-too-he-used-time-wisely/\">what Isaac Newton discovered </a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/03/12/during-pandemic-isaac-newton-had-work-home-too-he-used-time-wisely/\">while under quarantine</a>, or that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/24/shakespeares-great-escape-plague-1606--james-shapiro\">Shakespeare wrote King Lear during an outbreak of plague</a>. This may be driving you crazy, as those people did not, history suggests, have sole care of a four-year-old and a six-year-old. You can console yourself, momentarily, with the timetables that parents are drawing up and putting on Twitter: 9am to 11am, Frozen; 11am to 11.05am, pizza; 11.05am to 1pm, fighting; 1pm to 3pm, Frozen II. But this will kill only 30 seconds. Even the most anarchic parent will recognise that they have to find a fruitful way to fill the days, which means trying to replicate the formal education the kids are missing.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.educationotherwise.org/index.php/approaches\">Education Otherwise</a>, the primary English home-schooling organisation (it has a Welsh arm; <a href=\"http://www.schoolhouse.org.uk/\">Scotland has Schoolhouse</a>), describes parents\u2019 two core approaches: structured or autonomous. Structured learning follows the school day and curriculum; there is a solid argument that, since you intend for your children to go back to school and the school will give you materials (all primary and secondary schools are making plans to this effect), this is the way to go. If you are of an autonomous bent, however \u2013 keen to follow the Platonic ideal: \u201cDo not train a child to learn by force or harshness, but direct them to it by what amuses their minds\u201d \u2013 that is also legitimate. Your children are unlikely to get hopelessly behind. They might even come out knowing more about creative writing than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/09/fronted-adverbials-sats-grammar-test-primary\">fronted adverbials</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When children are engaged and active their focus can be incredible</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Amanda Grace is the deputy head teacher of Macaulay Church of England primary school in Lambeth, London; she also has two sons at secondary school. She is clear on the structured approach: \u201cStart every morning with a timetable and stick to your timings. Use language such as \u201cnow\u201d and \u201cnext\u201d. For younger children, you can build in very clear timings such as 10 minutes\u2019 reading followed by 10 minutes\u2019 Lego, role playing, chase games or exercises.\u201d</p> <p>Ben Wilson, 19, was home-schooled between the ages of 12 and 13. While he and his mother, the film-maker Beadie Finzi, describe a lot of creative learning, sometimes only tangentially related to the curriculum, he says: \u201cWe put together quite a formal timetable. The routine aspect is important. If you\u2019re just: \u2018At some point we\u2019ll do this,\u2019 you\u2019ll fall into the trap of not ever getting anything done.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Children under five</strong></h2> <p>I just made myself laugh out loud by attempting to start this paragraph with \u201carguably\u201d. There is no argument: this is the hardest age to do yourself. Whether you have one, two or three under-fives, all those situations are uniquely challenging (loneliness, squabbling or constant squabbling).</p> <p>On the plus side, a lot of the formal learning requirements are things you would do instinctively: communication and language development; fine motor movements; large movements and coordination; reading and writing; counting and adding; shape, space and measures; and expressive arts and design. There is a section on understanding \u2013 the world, people and communities, technology \u2013 and, sincerely, where would any of us start? The challenges in this age group will be around letting off steam, especially if you can\u2019t leave the house, not being able to socialise, especially for a child without siblings, maintaining concentration, especially your own, and mess.</p> <p>Keep your timetable realistic. You will not conclude a slime-making session in less than an hour; you will probably not spend more than 10 minutes at a go, reading.

      "bodyText": "OK, so now we are home-schooling. All of the UK\u2019s schools are closed (although they will still cater for vulnerable children and the children of NHS staff and other frontline workers). Exams are cancelled. You may have read about what Isaac Newton discovered while under quarantine, or that Shakespeare wrote King Lear during an outbreak of plague. This may be driving you crazy, as those people did not, history suggests, have sole care of a four-year-old and a six-year-old. You can console yourself, momentarily, with the timetables that parents are drawing up and putting on Twitter: 9am to 11am, Frozen; 11am to 11.05am, pizza; 11.05am to 1pm, fighting; 1pm to 3pm, Frozen II. But this will kill only 30 seconds. Even the most anarchic parent will recognise that they have to find a fruitful way to fill the days, which means trying to replicate the formal education the kids are missing. Education Otherwise, the primary English home-schooling organisation (it has a Welsh arm; Scotland has Schoolhouse), describes parents\u2019 two core approaches: structured or autonomous. Structured learning follows the school day and curriculum; there is a solid argument that, since you intend for your children to go back to school and the school will give you materials (all primary and secondary schools are making plans to this effect), this is the way to go. If you are of an autonomous bent, however \u2013 keen to follow the Platonic ideal: \u201cDo not train a child to learn by force or harshness, but direct them to it by what amuses their minds\u201d \u2013 that is also legitimate. Your children are unlikely to get hopelessly behind. They might even come out knowing more about creative writing than fronted adverbials. Amanda Grace is the deputy head teacher of Macaulay Church of England primary school in Lambeth, London; she also has two sons at secondary school. She is clear on the structured approach: \u201cStart every morning with a timetable and stick to your timings. Use language such as \u201cnow\u201d and \u201cnext\u201d. For younger children, you can build in very clear timings such as 10 minutes\u2019 reading followed by 10 minutes\u2019 Lego, role playing, chase games or exercises.\u201d Ben Wilson, 19, was home-schooled between the ages of 12 and 13. While he and his mother, the film-maker Beadie Finzi, describe a lot of creative learning, sometimes only tangentially related to the curriculum, he says: \u201cWe put together quite a formal timetable. The routine aspect is important. If you\u2019re just: \u2018At some point we\u2019ll do this,\u2019 you\u2019ll fall into the trap of not ever getting anything done.\u201d Children under five I just made myself laugh out loud by attempting to start this paragraph with \u201carguably\u201d. There is no argument: this is the hardest age to do yourself. Whether you have one, two or three under-fives, all those situations are uniquely challenging (loneliness, squabbling or constant squabbling). On the plus side, a lot of the formal learning requirements are things you would do instinctively: communication and language development; fine motor movements; large movements and coordination; reading and writing; counting and adding; shape, space and measures; and expressive arts and design. There is a section on understanding \u2013 the world, people and communities, technology \u2013 and, sincerely, where would any of us start? The challenges in this age group will be around letting off steam, especially if you can\u2019t leave the house, not being able to socialise, especially for a child without siblings, maintaining concentration, especially your own, and mess. Keep your timetable realistic. You will not conclude a slime-making session in less than an hour; you will probably not spend more than 10 minutes at a go, reading. Make as much use of your garden as you can (for communication, all motor skills, understanding the world). In the pre- or only just-verbal age group, it\u2019s hard to explain what\u2019s going on in a reassuring way; you can download a really good, illustrated booklet here. Five to eight By this point, you\u2019ll have materials from school, and can base your day around that. Now they\u2019ve got some fine motor skills, you can build in some practical experiments, which can be either directly or indirectly germane to the curriculum. Making sugar crystals, exploding baking powder and vinegar, putting eggs in Coke, dyeing noodles in unicorn colours: all of this will genuinely (I\u2019m not even joking) come up in the science curriculum, and can be spaced out over several days, which will give a sense of the world still turning.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Other companies offering to lend expertise, staff and factory floor space include the automotive firms McLaren and Nissan, Dyson, Airbus, Vauxhall, Jaguar Land Rover, Renishaw and JCB.</p> \n<p>As well as ventilators, hand sanitiser and masks are in huge demand, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/18/brewdog-begins-making-hand-sanitiser-shortages-uk\">prompting several companies to venture into new territory</a> to help increase supply.</p> \n<p>The British Honey Company, which makes honey, gin, rum and other spirits from its base in the Cotswolds, said it would use spare capacity in its distillery in Worminghall, Buckinghamshire, to produce hand sanitiser.

      "body": "<p>So all-consuming and all-conquering has Disney become, it even owns the rights to its analogies now. First Disney was Marvel supervillain Thanos, relentlessly acquiring pop culture\u2019s Infinity Stones including Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel itself \u2013 all the better to obliterate half the Hollywood universe. Having swallowed up its rival 21st Century Fox for a colossal $71bn, Disney became the Death Star \u2013 an empire so intimidatingly huge and hungry it reduced its rivals to the status of scattered rebels. Last year, Disney dominated the movies like no studio has before, taking more than 38% of the world\u2019s box office. Now, with its streaming service <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/mar/12/which-streaming-stick-should-i-buy-for-disney\">Disney+</a> rolling out, Disney is like Simba in The Lion King: as Mufasa tells him, \u201ceverything the light touches is our kingdom\u201d.</p> <p>Maybe not quite everything, yet. But Disney\u2019s gravitational pull is warping the very space-time continuum of the media landscape. You will have to work harder than ever to escape the Magic Kingdom\u2019s reach. If it doesn\u2019t get you with the Avengers, it will get you with The Simpsons, or <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/\">National Geographic</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/wes-anderson\">Wes Anderson</a>. If it doesn\u2019t get you with Elsa sticking plasters, it will get you with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/03/baby-yoda-the-mandalorian-star-wars\">Baby Yoda</a> memes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"126260977f24b2cbdcf489c74c20e308c5742d0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/126260977f24b2cbdcf489c74c20e308c5742d0b/0_49_1787_1072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Disney CEO Bob Chapek, right.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minnie driver\u2026 new Disney CEO Bob Chapek, right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Can anything stop Disney? Are the rebels\u2019 weapons useless against it? Or might the Death Star contain a fatal design flaw? One potential wrinkle came last month with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/25/disney-chief-executive-bob-iger-announces-surprise-exit\">surprise resignation of Disney\u2019s CEO, Bob Iger</a>. His successor was also a surprise: the unheard-of Bob Chapek, formerly head of Disney\u2019s theme-parks division. Iger, who was scheduled to retire at the end of 2021, will stay on as chairman to \u201cmake sure that our creative pipelines are vibrant\u201d. Inevitably, the relationship between the two Bobs has been likened to that of \u201cSith apprentice and Sith lord\u201d, though given Chapek\u2019s background, he is also an uncanny parallel to Tom Wambsgans, Matthew Macfadyen\u2019s character in HBO\u2019s Succession, who plots his ascent from the lowly resorts division of the Roy media empire \u2013 at last, an analogy Disney doesn\u2019t own.</p> <p>Iger was very much the architect of Disney\u2019s spectacular renaissance. By all accounts a straight-talking, decidedly un-Thanos-like New Yorker, he rose through the ranks of ABC television before Disney acquired it in 1996. In his autobiography, Iger recalls his first board meeting as Disney CEO in 2005. He got straight to the point and said: \u201cAs you all know, Disney Animation is a real mess.\u201d On a visit to Hong Kong Disneyland he had noticed that most of the characters in the parade were from Disney movies past, with barely any from the last decade.</p> <p>His solution was to go shopping. It helped that Iger had personal relationships with some key people \u2013 such as Steve Jobs, whom he persuaded to sell Pixar to Disney in 2006, for $7.4bn. He also got Jobs to vouch for him to Ike Perlmutter, owner of Marvel. Iger also had a relationship with George Lucas, which helped him acquire Lucasfilm. Rather than \u201cDisneyfying\u201d these assets, Iger was smart enough to let each of them operate independently. As he told Pixar\u2019s bosses: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense for us to buy you for what you are and then turn you into something else.\u201d In fact, he imported Pixar\u2019s culture to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/18/frozen-ii-how-disney-left-other-animation-studios-out-in-the-cold\">rejuvenate Disney\u2019s own animation department</a>, just as he sidelined Perlmutter to give free rein to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/11/kevin-feige-martin-scorsese-marvel-studios-superhero-movies\">Kevin Feige</a>, the mastermind of Marvel\u2019s spectacular movie series. Considering Avengers: Endgame has taken close to $3bn alone, that $4bn price tag for Marvel looks like a sound investment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e85a62d447526bcf2a6c31672a0fc826f0a7fdf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e85a62d447526bcf2a6c31672a0fc826f0a7fdf0/0_0_3343_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Simpsons are now part of the Disney family.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"718\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homer\u2019s new home\u2026 The Simpsons are now part of the Disney family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Iger and Disney also had the good fortune to be stocking the cupboard just as the whole media landscape was tilting in favour of \u201cover the top\u201d streaming services. Having vanquished its old Hollywood rivals, Disney now finds itself facing the likes of Netflix, Amazon, Apple TV+, HBO Max (which launches in the US in May), and Comcast/NBCUniversal\u2019s forthcoming Peacock. \u201cThe old guard of the traditional entertainment business is going through changes nobody would have predicted even five years ago,\u201d says Cynthia Littleton, business editor at Variety. \u201cSo there was a real feeling that if Disney did not prepare for the future, they could become a takeover target by a gigantic tech firm.\u201d She describes Iger as a \u201conce-in-a-generation executive\u201d. \u201cHe gets a lot of credit for looking out at the landscape and saying: \u2018We need to do this and we need to do this now.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Littleton does not imagine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/21/disney-streaming-service-to-launch-earlier-in-uk-on-24-march\">Disney+</a> will catch up with Netflix\u2019s 160 million subscribers any time soon. Its stated target was 60 to 90 million, although it already has 30 million subscribers in the US, and some analysts are predicting it could reach 130 million in five years. \u201cI think they expect to be a really strong competitor, but they don\u2019t see it as a zero sum game.\u201d</p> <p>One weak spot in the plan is the content. Disney+ gives you more than 500 movies and 350 series from the Disney/Pixar/Star Wars/Marvel back catalogue, not to mention National Geographic and 30 seasons of The Simpsons \u2013 all for a very competitive \u00a35.99 a month (compared to \u00a38.99 for HD Netflix). But much of it is aimed at children and families. Flagship Star Wars spin-off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/12/the-mandalorian-review-star-wars-jon-favreau\">The Mandalorian</a> has been a runaway success, but grownup subscribers expecting more of the same might be disappointed. Much of Disney+\u2019s original content either plays it safe or pitches it wrong. There are family-friendly reboots such as High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, and a live-action Lady and the Tramp; there are new series such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7aN9OkNl7U\">The World According to Jeff Goldblum</a>, in which the actor cocks a quizzical eyebrow at, you know, stuff. And there are dispiritingly on-brand shows like Disney\u2019s Fairy Tale Weddings (couples getting married at Disney theme parks), or Be Our Chef, in which families compete to make a Disney-themed dish to serve at Disney World. You have to wonder how vibrant those \u201ccreative pipelines\u201d are right now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca94125c71bf4122c4badbd2acb4050ac03962c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca94125c71bf4122c4badbd2acb4050ac03962c9/0_371_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yifei Liu in Disney\u2019s delayed live-action Mulan remake.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kick-ass too\u2026 Yifei Liu in Disney\u2019s delayed live-action Mulan remake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jasin Boland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the Mandalorian demographic, there are some Marvel spin-offs further down the pipeline: The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (due in August, although production has been suspended due to the coronavirus crisis) and WandaVision (December). But shows have been cancelled or long-delayed, including a Tron-themed series and Star Wars spin-off Obi-Wan. Other, edgier fare has been moved to the streaming service Hulu in the US (it owns that, too), such as Love, Victor \u2013 inspired by the hit movie Love, Simon, with a gay protagonist dealing with his sexuality. The latter suggests Disney is keeping things \u201cfamily friendly\u201d, which could be tantamount to playing to a conservative common denominator.</p> <p>It is a similar picture in the movie world. With so many universes coming under the Disney umbrella, and so much return required of its investments, there is the fear that Planet Disney will now simply eject a steady stream of sequels and spin-offs. But with both the Marvel and Star Wars sagas reaching some kind of conclusion last year, you wonder how much appetite there is for more of the same. Disney and Pixar are still putting out original stories but, again, their big successes of late have been sequels such as Toy Story 4 and Frozen II, or remakes of Disney classics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/11/the-lion-king-review-anthro-leonine-clones-original\">such as The Lion King</a>.</p> <p>Next in the pipeline comes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/08/mulan-first-trailer-for-disney-live-action-reboot-released\">a live-action remake of Mulan</a>, which could expose another compromising aspect of Disney\u2019s supremacy. China is vital to Disney\u2019s growth, and the Mouse House has learned its lesson with Mao\u2019s house, so to speak. Its 1997 movie Kundun (directed by Scorsese) led to a virtual shutout by the Chinese authorities for its pro-Tibetan stance. Disney has, by all accounts, been making huge efforts to get back in ever since. It finally succeeded in 2016, with the opening of the $5.5bn Shanghai Disneyland, which Iger described as \u201cthe biggest accomplishment of my career\u201d. But Disney only owns 43% of it; the rest is in the hands of the Chinese government.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5726464c241d78852e203464debf6bf203406827\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5726464c241d78852e203464debf6bf203406827/0_0_2397_1598/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Disney+ release The Mandalorian.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Star wares\u2026 Disney+ release The Mandalorian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Disney+/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So the new Mulan is unlikely to be taking any chances. The story looks to be closer to the original Chinese legend than the 1998 animation: no Eddie Murphy-voiced comedy dragon, and no sexuality-subverting relationship with officer Li Shang, who falls for Mulan when she is pretending to be a man. It could still be a great movie, but Mulan betrays a concern over just how much Disney is honing its product according to commercial and political considerations. When Walt Disney opened Disneyland in 1955, he dedicated it to \u201cthe ideals, the dreams, and the hard facts that have created America\u201d. But Disney the company no longer represents American values; it seeks to embody those of the world \u2013 potentially including its most repressive regimes.</p> <p>This is not to suggest Disney is inherently problematic, or that it is doing anything the rest of Hollywood isn\u2019t also doing. Against these totalitarian fears, you could set such frontier-pushing mainstream films as Black Panther or Captain Marvel or Moana \u2013 all of which have made radical steps in terms of representation and inclusion. Or Disney\u2019s laudable embrace of the LGBT+ community (Mulan aside): it has hosted unofficial \u201cGay Days\u201d at Disney World for more than 20 years.

      "bodyText": "So all-consuming and all-conquering has Disney become, it even owns the rights to its analogies now. First Disney was Marvel supervillain Thanos, relentlessly acquiring pop culture\u2019s Infinity Stones including Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel itself \u2013 all the better to obliterate half the Hollywood universe. Having swallowed up its rival 21st Century Fox for a colossal $71bn, Disney became the Death Star \u2013 an empire so intimidatingly huge and hungry it reduced its rivals to the status of scattered rebels. Last year, Disney dominated the movies like no studio has before, taking more than 38% of the world\u2019s box office. Now, with its streaming service Disney+ rolling out, Disney is like Simba in The Lion King: as Mufasa tells him, \u201ceverything the light touches is our kingdom\u201d. Maybe not quite everything, yet. But Disney\u2019s gravitational pull is warping the very space-time continuum of the media landscape. You will have to work harder than ever to escape the Magic Kingdom\u2019s reach. If it doesn\u2019t get you with the Avengers, it will get you with The Simpsons, or National Geographic, or Wes Anderson. If it doesn\u2019t get you with Elsa sticking plasters, it will get you with Baby Yoda memes. Can anything stop Disney? Are the rebels\u2019 weapons useless against it? Or might the Death Star contain a fatal design flaw? One potential wrinkle came last month with the surprise resignation of Disney\u2019s CEO, Bob Iger. His successor was also a surprise: the unheard-of Bob Chapek, formerly head of Disney\u2019s theme-parks division. Iger, who was scheduled to retire at the end of 2021, will stay on as chairman to \u201cmake sure that our creative pipelines are vibrant\u201d. Inevitably, the relationship between the two Bobs has been likened to that of \u201cSith apprentice and Sith lord\u201d, though given Chapek\u2019s background, he is also an uncanny parallel to Tom Wambsgans, Matthew Macfadyen\u2019s character in HBO\u2019s Succession, who plots his ascent from the lowly resorts division of the Roy media empire \u2013 at last, an analogy Disney doesn\u2019t own. Iger was very much the architect of Disney\u2019s spectacular renaissance. By all accounts a straight-talking, decidedly un-Thanos-like New Yorker, he rose through the ranks of ABC television before Disney acquired it in 1996. In his autobiography, Iger recalls his first board meeting as Disney CEO in 2005. He got straight to the point and said: \u201cAs you all know, Disney Animation is a real mess.\u201d On a visit to Hong Kong Disneyland he had noticed that most of the characters in the parade were from Disney movies past, with barely any from the last decade. His solution was to go shopping. It helped that Iger had personal relationships with some key people \u2013 such as Steve Jobs, whom he persuaded to sell Pixar to Disney in 2006, for $7.4bn. He also got Jobs to vouch for him to Ike Perlmutter, owner of Marvel. Iger also had a relationship with George Lucas, which helped him acquire Lucasfilm. Rather than \u201cDisneyfying\u201d these assets, Iger was smart enough to let each of them operate independently. As he told Pixar\u2019s bosses: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense for us to buy you for what you are and then turn you into something else.\u201d In fact, he imported Pixar\u2019s culture to rejuvenate Disney\u2019s own animation department, just as he sidelined Perlmutter to give free rein to Kevin Feige, the mastermind of Marvel\u2019s spectacular movie series. Considering Avengers: Endgame has taken close to $3bn alone, that $4bn price tag for Marvel looks like a sound investment. Iger and Disney also had the good fortune to be stocking the cupboard just as the whole media landscape was tilting in favour of \u201cover the top\u201d streaming services. Having vanquished its old Hollywood rivals, Disney now finds itself facing the likes of Netflix, Amazon, Apple TV+, HBO Max (which launches in the US in May), and Comcast/NBCUniversal\u2019s forthcoming Peacock. \u201cThe old guard of the traditional entertainment business is going through changes nobody would have predicted even five years ago,\u201d says Cynthia Littleton, business editor at Variety. \u201cSo there was a real feeling that if Disney did not prepare for the future, they could become a takeover target by a gigantic tech firm.\u201d She describes Iger as a \u201conce-in-a-generation executive\u201d. \u201cHe gets a lot of credit for looking out at the landscape and saying: \u2018We need to do this and we need to do this now.\u2019\u201d Littleton does not imagine Disney+ will catch up with Netflix\u2019s 160 million subscribers any time soon. Its stated target was 60 to 90 million, although it already has 30 million subscribers in the US, and some analysts are predicting it could reach 130 million in five years. \u201cI think they expect to be a really strong competitor, but they don\u2019t see it as a zero sum game.\u201d One weak spot in the plan is the content. Disney+ gives you more than 500 movies and 350 series from the Disney/Pixar/Star Wars/Marvel back catalogue, not to mention National Geographic and 30 seasons of The Simpsons \u2013 all for a very competitive \u00a35.99 a month (compared to \u00a38.99 for HD Netflix). But much of it is aimed at children and families. Flagship Star Wars spin-off The Mandalorian has been a runaway success, but grownup subscribers expecting more of the same might be disappointed. Much of Disney+\u2019s original content either plays it safe or pitches it wrong. There are family-friendly reboots such as High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, and a live-action Lady and the Tramp; there are new series such as The World According to Jeff Goldblum, in which the actor cocks a quizzical eyebrow at, you know, stuff. And there are dispiritingly on-brand shows like Disney\u2019s Fairy Tale Weddings (couples getting married at Disney theme parks), or Be Our Chef, in which families compete to make a Disney-themed dish to serve at Disney World. You have to wonder how vibrant those \u201ccreative pipelines\u201d are right now. For the Mandalorian demographic, there are some Marvel spin-offs further down the pipeline: The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (due in August, although production has been suspended due to the coronavirus crisis) and WandaVision (December). But shows have been cancelled or long-delayed, including a Tron-themed series and Star Wars spin-off Obi-Wan. Other, edgier fare has been moved to the streaming service Hulu in the US (it owns that, too), such as Love, Victor \u2013 inspired by the hit movie Love, Simon, with a gay protagonist dealing with his sexuality. The latter suggests Disney is keeping things \u201cfamily friendly\u201d, which could be tantamount to playing to a conservative common denominator. It is a similar picture in the movie world. With so many universes coming under the Disney umbrella, and so much return required of its investments, there is the fear that Planet Disney will now simply eject a steady stream of sequels and spin-offs. But with both the Marvel and Star Wars sagas reaching some kind of conclusion last year, you wonder how much appetite there is for more of the same. Disney and Pixar are still putting out original stories but, again, their big successes of late have been sequels such as Toy Story 4 and Frozen II, or remakes of Disney classics such as The Lion King. Next in the pipeline comes a live-action remake of Mulan, which could expose another compromising aspect of Disney\u2019s supremacy. China is vital to Disney\u2019s growth, and the Mouse House has learned its lesson with Mao\u2019s house, so to speak. Its 1997 movie Kundun (directed by Scorsese) led to a virtual shutout by the Chinese authorities for its pro-Tibetan stance. Disney has, by all accounts, been making huge efforts to get back in ever since. It finally succeeded in 2016, with the opening of the $5.5bn Shanghai Disneyland, which Iger described as \u201cthe biggest accomplishment of my career\u201d. But Disney only owns 43% of it; the rest is in the hands of the Chinese government. So the new Mulan is unlikely to be taking any chances. The story looks to be closer to the original Chinese legend than the 1998 animation: no Eddie Murphy-voiced comedy dragon, and no sexuality-subverting relationship with officer Li Shang, who falls for Mulan when she is pretending to be a man. It could still be a great movie, but Mulan betrays a concern over just how much Disney is honing its product according to commercial and political considerations. When Walt Disney opened Disneyland in 1955, he dedicated it to \u201cthe ideals, the dreams, and the hard facts that have created America\u201d. But Disney the company no longer represents American values; it seeks to embody those of the world \u2013 potentially including its most repressive regimes. This is not to suggest Disney is inherently problematic, or that it is doing anything the rest of Hollywood isn\u2019t also doing. Against these totalitarian fears, you could set such frontier-pushing mainstream films as Black Panther or Captain Marvel or Moana \u2013 all of which have made radical steps in terms of representation and inclusion. Or Disney\u2019s laudable embrace of the LGBT+ community (Mulan aside): it has hosted unofficial \u201cGay Days\u201d at Disney World for more than 20 years. Disney\u2019s dominance is not simply down to deep pockets; its reputation was built on courage and innovation. Despite its flops, it has consistently set the bar creatively. So you could see Disney as a machine designed to exploit the masses by any means, or you could see it as a creative coalition striving to make the best possible fare. Either way, we have never seen a kingdom like Disney\u2019s, except, perhaps, in one of its movies. In The Lion King, Mufasa gives the young Simba a portfolio-management lesson straight out of the Iger playbook. \u201cEverything you see exists together in a delicate balance,\u201d he says. \u201cAs king, you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures, from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.\u201d To which Simba replies: \u201cBut Dad. Don\u2019t we eat the antelope?\u201d Still, having established itself as entertainment\u2019s apex predator, is a last-minute plot twist in store? The coronavirus has disrupted the landscape immeasurably, and Disney has been disproportionately hit.

      "bodyText": "As disruptions to daily life in the US continue because of the coronavirus, officials have gone far beyond urging social distancing, enacting policies that make activities such as studying and working dramatically more reliant on digital platforms. While the internet provides opportunity for many to live with some modicum of normalcy amid the outbreak, millions of Americans do not have reliable access to the web. Also many industries ranging from auto-manufacturing to hospitality cannot be conducted online. Because of this stark digital divide, many are at risk of educational lapses, profound social isolation or unemployment, advocates warn. According to the Pew Research Center, 29% of adults with household incomes less than $30,000 a year don\u2019t own a smartphone, while 44% don\u2019t have home broadband and 46% lack a \u201ctraditional\u201d computer either. Pew also noted that 35% of lower-income households with school-age children don\u2019t have a home-based broadband internet connection. Tom Sheppard, a Bronx resident with two daughters and one son attending New York City public schools, which have closed until at least 20 April due to coronavirus, said: \u201cDepending on where you live, you either have incredible access to technology or you don\u2019t.\u201d The city will launch remote learning on 23 March. Officials in New York City said this will include providing devices to students who don\u2019t have them, and working with internet companies to provide web access. Sheppard described the tech side of this launch as \u201ca slow-motion trainwreck\u201d. \u201cEvery school has plenty of support resources for teachers,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there\u2019s nothing available for parents. So what does technical support look like? Nobody knows,\u201d said Sheppard, who has home internet but is deeply involved with this issue as a parent advocate. Some of the devices distributed to families are outdated, he said, and \u201calmost completely unusable technology, generally speaking\u201d. \u201cPart of it is internet access,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so you\u2019re basically giving them technology that doesn\u2019t connect to the internet \u2013 you\u2019re basically handing out paperweights. \u201cThere aren\u2019t public places that kids can go to now because everything is shut down,\u201d he added. \u201cEverybody says \u2018the library\u2019.

The potential for widespread disparity due to the digital divide is underscored by how broadly in-person activities have come to a halt amid Covid-19. Thirty-nine US states have decided to shutter schools.

Or your tenant has stopped paying the rent. These and hundreds of other situations are often covered by insurance contracts. But as coronavirus sweeps the world, will the insurers pay out?</p> <p>Until now the focus has been on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/07/coronavirus-holidays-travel-insurance-gigs-flight-cancelled\">travel insurance</a>, but as the economic impact of the virus is taking hold, other types of insurance come into play.

Given that spring and early summer are the peak season for weddings, there will be a lot of people wanting to claim if they took out a policy. Big providers include John Lewis and Debenhams, and specialist including Emerald Life.</p> <p><em>Will it pay out for coronavirus?</em></p> <p>Couples who wanted to get married are now being tied in knots by the wording in these insurance policies. For example, the John Lewis policy says explicitly it will pay out for cancellation caused by \u201cthe booked venue for the wedding or wedding reception being unable to hold your wedding due to an outbreak of infectious or contagious disease\u201d.</p> <p>A lot of couples will think, great, surely we will get a payout. But it\u2019s not that simple \u2013 and distraught couples are finding their claims are being rejected.</p> <p>Why? Because weddings have not been banned by the government. If the wedding venue itself does not cancel the event the John Lewis policy will not pay out.</p> <p>John Lewis says: \u201cThe current UK government position is that \u2026 weddings are still permitted to take place. So if your wedding venue is still prepared to hold your wedding and you chose to cancel, then this would not be covered.\u201d</p> <p>John Lewis also warns couples against cancelling without minimising losses \u2013 for example, asking suppliers such as venues, cake makers, photographers etc, to give refunds, or to rebook at a later date. \u201cWe may ask you to provide copies of your venue and supplier contracts as well as relevant correspondence with them, and may refuse cover in the event that we consider that you have not adequately minimised your costs.\u201d</p> <p>John Lewis will pay out if a person central to the wedding \u2013 bride, bridegroom, very close family etc \u2013 has contracted coronavirus. But if a key person is self-isolating without an actual diagnosis it won\u2019t pay out.</p> <p>The company has, inevitably, stopped selling wedding insurance, and its treatment of customers during this period will no doubt be noted by other couples arranging their nuptials in future.</p> <p>Emerald Life kept selling wedding insurance until 18 March, although only for weddings taking place in or after October, but it has also now closed its doors. It said: \u201cWhat we are doing is talking through whether customers can rearrange as a practical measure. Most venues and suppliers seem to want to help, and we will then just move their wedding date forward and extend the wedding coverage at no extra charge.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Income protection cover</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2256f29e00c8c9aaa5e72c40c89c94402398c557\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2256f29e00c8c9aaa5e72c40c89c94402398c557/0_92_4256_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fridge magnets with mortgage payment reminder note\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will your insurance pay out if you have to stay home with coronavirus, but can\u2019t get a diagnosis?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>What is it?</em></p> <p>The insurers promise that an income protection policy will give you a monthly income if you can\u2019t work because you are ill or injured, and in some cases if you are made unemployed. It pays a proportion of your lost earnings (usually around two-thirds of your former salary), with the payments continuing until you return to paid work or you retire.</p> <p>Policies are sold with \u201cwaiting periods\u201d. The more expensive ones let you claim the moment you can\u2019t work, while the cheaper (and more widely sold) don\u2019t pay out until after a month or so. The typical monthly cost is about \u00a360 to \u00a380.</p> <p><em>Will it pay out for coronavirus?</em></p> <p>When we contacted LV=, one of the UK\u2019s biggest providers, it said it had yet to receive a coronavirus-related claim. But it added that it would stand by the policies and pay claims as they arise.</p> <p>It said: \u201cWhile coronavirus is an unprecedented global pandemic, we recognise that it is already changing lives of everyday individuals and families. Income protection insurance has, and will have, a role to play, offering valuable reassurance and a much-needed financial safety net.\u201d</p> <p>For a confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus, LV= said: <strong>\u201c</strong>We\u2019ll assess and pay their claim in the usual way, reflecting their chosen waiting period and the policy terms and conditions.\u201d</p> <p>But what if you have not been given a diagnosis, but have to stop working and self-isolate?

      "bodyText": "You can\u2019t work because of illness. Or your wedding has to be cancelled. Or you\u2019ve been made redundant and can\u2019t pay the mortgage. Or your tenant has stopped paying the rent. These and hundreds of other situations are often covered by insurance contracts. But as coronavirus sweeps the world, will the insurers pay out? Until now the focus has been on travel insurance, but as the economic impact of the virus is taking hold, other types of insurance come into play. We examine what you might have, what you might get, and what you won\u2019t. Wedding insurance What is it? These policies are designed to pay out if the couple have to cancel or rearrange their wedding due to unforeseen circumstances. Given that spring and early summer are the peak season for weddings, there will be a lot of people wanting to claim if they took out a policy. Big providers include John Lewis and Debenhams, and specialist including Emerald Life. Will it pay out for coronavirus? Couples who wanted to get married are now being tied in knots by the wording in these insurance policies. For example, the John Lewis policy says explicitly it will pay out for cancellation caused by \u201cthe booked venue for the wedding or wedding reception being unable to hold your wedding due to an outbreak of infectious or contagious disease\u201d. A lot of couples will think, great, surely we will get a payout. But it\u2019s not that simple \u2013 and distraught couples are finding their claims are being rejected. Why? Because weddings have not been banned by the government. If the wedding venue itself does not cancel the event the John Lewis policy will not pay out. John Lewis says: \u201cThe current UK government position is that \u2026 weddings are still permitted to take place. So if your wedding venue is still prepared to hold your wedding and you chose to cancel, then this would not be covered.\u201d John Lewis also warns couples against cancelling without minimising losses \u2013 for example, asking suppliers such as venues, cake makers, photographers etc, to give refunds, or to rebook at a later date. \u201cWe may ask you to provide copies of your venue and supplier contracts as well as relevant correspondence with them, and may refuse cover in the event that we consider that you have not adequately minimised your costs.\u201d John Lewis will pay out if a person central to the wedding \u2013 bride, bridegroom, very close family etc \u2013 has contracted coronavirus. But if a key person is self-isolating without an actual diagnosis it won\u2019t pay out. The company has, inevitably, stopped selling wedding insurance, and its treatment of customers during this period will no doubt be noted by other couples arranging their nuptials in future. Emerald Life kept selling wedding insurance until 18 March, although only for weddings taking place in or after October, but it has also now closed its doors. It said: \u201cWhat we are doing is talking through whether customers can rearrange as a practical measure. Most venues and suppliers seem to want to help, and we will then just move their wedding date forward and extend the wedding coverage at no extra charge.\u201d Income protection cover What is it? The insurers promise that an income protection policy will give you a monthly income if you can\u2019t work because you are ill or injured, and in some cases if you are made unemployed. It pays a proportion of your lost earnings (usually around two-thirds of your former salary), with the payments continuing until you return to paid work or you retire. Policies are sold with \u201cwaiting periods\u201d. The more expensive ones let you claim the moment you can\u2019t work, while the cheaper (and more widely sold) don\u2019t pay out until after a month or so. The typical monthly cost is about \u00a360 to \u00a380. Will it pay out for coronavirus? When we contacted LV=, one of the UK\u2019s biggest providers, it said it had yet to receive a coronavirus-related claim. But it added that it would stand by the policies and pay claims as they arise. It said: \u201cWhile coronavirus is an unprecedented global pandemic, we recognise that it is already changing lives of everyday individuals and families. Income protection insurance has, and will have, a role to play, offering valuable reassurance and a much-needed financial safety net.\u201d For a confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus, LV= said: \u201cWe\u2019ll assess and pay their claim in the usual way, reflecting their chosen waiting period and the policy terms and conditions.\u201d But what if you have not been given a diagnosis, but have to stop working and self-isolate? If you are self-employed, that means you immediately lose income. Can you claim? LV= said that for its Personal Sick Pay plan holders with a day-zero and week-one waiting period, it would consider claims for medically advised self isolation. It adds: \u201cThese are highly unusual circumstances, so any decision and payment we make for self isolation will be outside of the normal terms and conditions. \u2026 We\u2019ll make decisions immediately and any payments we make for self-isolation (current guidance is for up to 14 days from contact) will be in our member\u2019s bank account within a couple of days.\u201d LV= policies do not include cover for unemployment. It said it is still selling the policies, but that is under constant review. When we put the same questions to Aviva, another major provider of income protection policies, its response was a bit tougher. Aviva confirmed that customers with coronavirus who are unable to work past the waiting period will receive payouts according to the policy terms. But it added that its policies did not cover any other reasons why customers couldn\u2019t carry out their occupation, such as employer or government restrictions around self isolation, though it added it would look at \u201ceach case individually to determine the best outcome for their circumstances\u201d. Rental guarantee insurance What is it Direct Line is a big seller of landlord insurance, and offers an add-on called rent guarantee insurance. As the Direct Line marketing says: \u201cWe\u2019ll provide cover for any unpaid rent if you have to repossess your property. If your tenants can\u2019t pay, we will.\u201d Claims can be made once the rent has been overdue for at least one month, and landlords can claim as much as \u00a3250,000. Will it pay out for coronavirus? This is going to be a very interesting one. Currently, Direct Line says: \u201cOnce the tenant has not paid rent for 30 days and the relevant section 21 or section 8 notice has been issued, then you can claim.\u201d A section 21 notice is the standard eviction notice used by landlords. But on 18 March the government banned all evictions. So it puts landlords in a catch-22. They have insurance that will pay out if a tenant defaults, but can only claim if they evict the tenant, and that is now banned for the moment. Direct Line said: \u201cThe situation with coronavirus is unprecedented, and the actions of the landlord will vary depending on the circumstances they are faced with and those facing the tenant. Just because a landlord has rent guarantee cover doesn\u2019t mean that they will call upon the policy to make a claim in every circumstance.\u201d It said the landlord might decide to accept a revised payment schedule, and that a tenant who has lost their job might be able to claim universal credit. But it confirmed that the landlord can only make a claim on the rent guarantee if the eviction notice \u201chas been correctly served on the tenant\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Celebrities have always been the symmetrical, smiling face of wealth inequality. Their role in modern life is as paradoxical as trickle-down economics: to be preternaturally charming and attractive, but also relatable and attainably aspirational. We speak of \u201cliking\u201d one celebrity and \u201cdisliking\u201d another on the basis of the professionally calibrated personas they beam out to us as sincerity. We enjoy their work \u2013 their acting, their singing, their athleticism \u2013 and we cheer on their successes. They are purveyors of a great American myth: that there is such a thing as \u201cwell-earned\u201d luxury, or a \u201cdeserving\u201d millionaire.</p> <p>And in America, fame doesn\u2019t just make you rich: it makes you a role model. So it makes sense that over the past, terrifying week \u2013 a week which has set the foundation of modern life shaking like the San Andreas fault \u2013 we have seen a slew of beloved celebrities solemnly, dutifully announcing that they have received a positive test result for Covid-19. Idris Elba, Kevin Durant, Daniel Dae Kim. Many of these celebrities, including the entire roster of the Brooklyn Nets, were tested on the basis of their potentially having been in contact with a confirmed infected person; many, including Elba, were asymptomatic. Tom Hanks and his wife were fortunate to be in Australia when they got symptoms - testing there is much more widely available.</p> <p>Still other celebrities have announced their <em>negative</em> test results, including Heidi Klum and Kris Jenner. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/coronavirus-testing-elite.html\">As the New York Times notes</a>, some of these celebrities \u2013 like Klum \u2013 received tests after using their platforms to complain about not being able to get tested.</p> <p>Covid-19 is a terrifying virus, and I genuinely hope that the celebrities who have contracted it recover fully. I have no doubt that their being tested will benefit many others, especially those who work alongside them and now know to self-isolate. In an ideal world, these celebrities would<em> </em>be tested, because we would <em>all </em>be tested, but that is not the world we live in. Instead, these celebrity Covid-19 tests have happened alongside a broader failure to test everyday citizens and residents in the US and the UK, including medical workers, those in at-risk groups, and those experiencing serious, even hospitalization-requiring symptoms.

      "bodyText": "Celebrities have always been the symmetrical, smiling face of wealth inequality. Their role in modern life is as paradoxical as trickle-down economics: to be preternaturally charming and attractive, but also relatable and attainably aspirational. We speak of \u201cliking\u201d one celebrity and \u201cdisliking\u201d another on the basis of the professionally calibrated personas they beam out to us as sincerity. We enjoy their work \u2013 their acting, their singing, their athleticism \u2013 and we cheer on their successes. They are purveyors of a great American myth: that there is such a thing as \u201cwell-earned\u201d luxury, or a \u201cdeserving\u201d millionaire. And in America, fame doesn\u2019t just make you rich: it makes you a role model. So it makes sense that over the past, terrifying week \u2013 a week which has set the foundation of modern life shaking like the San Andreas fault \u2013 we have seen a slew of beloved celebrities solemnly, dutifully announcing that they have received a positive test result for Covid-19. Idris Elba, Kevin Durant, Daniel Dae Kim. Many of these celebrities, including the entire roster of the Brooklyn Nets, were tested on the basis of their potentially having been in contact with a confirmed infected person; many, including Elba, were asymptomatic. Tom Hanks and his wife were fortunate to be in Australia when they got symptoms - testing there is much more widely available. Still other celebrities have announced their negative test results, including Heidi Klum and Kris Jenner. As the New York Times notes, some of these celebrities \u2013 like Klum \u2013 received tests after using their platforms to complain about not being able to get tested. Covid-19 is a terrifying virus, and I genuinely hope that the celebrities who have contracted it recover fully. I have no doubt that their being tested will benefit many others, especially those who work alongside them and now know to self-isolate. In an ideal world, these celebrities would be tested, because we would all be tested, but that is not the world we live in. Instead, these celebrity Covid-19 tests have happened alongside a broader failure to test everyday citizens and residents in the US and the UK, including medical workers, those in at-risk groups, and those experiencing serious, even hospitalization-requiring symptoms. Medical workers are not being tested, and each day brings new stories of sick, vulnerable people who are refused testing. We know that testing is a key to derailing this virus\u2019s path of destruction. The communities that get tested fast and early \u2013 which, in test-strapped countries, appear to primarily be the communities of the wealthy and powerful \u2013 will be far better protected. Watching yet another celebrity announce that they have been tested (often while asymptomatic) feels like watching a medical drama that takes place on another planet. Meanwhile, the rest of us wait: not just for tests, but for the after-effects that a lack of testing will bring upon our communities, and upon the communities of those we love. The reaction of the internet community to celebrity Covid-19 testing has been, broadly, predictable. \u201cNot Uncle Idris!\u201d some cry. \u201cTom Hanks!? Who do I have to fight?\u201d Is this how we would react if, say, a hedge fund manager announced his Covid-19 status? Of course, Elba and Hanks\u2019s job is to play characters like Stringer Bell and Forrest Gump, not to directly manipulate markets and profit off of the financial devastation of everyday workers.

      "bodyText": "The Ruby Princess cruise ship, which docked in Sydney this week and has been linked to six confirmed Australian coronavirus cases, had previously logged 158 instances of illness onboard, according to a News Corp report. Almost 2,700 passengers were allowed to disembark from the ship at Circular Quay in Sydney on Thursday, before NSW Health had conducted testing for coronavirus among passengers who had been unwell. The Ruby Princess was one of four cruise ships that had been allowed an exemption to an Australia-wide 30-day ban on foreign ships, and authorities made the decision to allow passengers to disembark after assessing there was a \u201cvery low risk\u201d of coronavirus. That testing of patient swabs found four passengers with the Covid-19 virus. All passengers are now required to self-isolate for 14 days. The ship is also linked to two cases of the coronavirus in the Northern Territory. As the New South Wales health minister Brad Hazzard on Saturday defended his government\u2019s compliance regime for cruise ships, the Australian reported cases of sickness had been logged on the Ruby Princess when it left Sydney for New Zealand with 4,000 people on board on March 8. The Australian said 158 sickness cases had been logged in a government portal used to monitor the condition of cruise ship passengers, but that an email from the ship\u2019s master to the Port Authority of NSW on 8 March had stated there were \u201cno ill passengers or crew on board\u201d. Facing reporters on Saturday, Hazzard said that in hindsight he would have waited for coronavirus test results before allowing passengers to disembark. \u201cIf I had my opportunity to have my two bob\u2019s worth, with the benefit of what we now know about those \u2026 people I\u2019d have said yeah, maybe we should hold them on the ship,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state government of NSW has already had a very strict compliance regime.

The family have always had lunch together on Mother\u2019s Day but this year, Martin\u2019s 73-year-old mother is self-isolating and plans had to change. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to not see my mother on Mothering Sunday,\u201d said Martin. \u201cWe had to do something and the cross-generational aspect of the Mothering Sunday is part of the joy I don\u2019t want any of us to miss. \u201cThe children\u2019s instruments \u2013 and my singing voice \u2013 don\u2019t naturally fit together in a trio but we\u2019ve worked together, improvising a piece for their grandmother over the past week.\u201d Martin\u2019s children are six, eight and 11. \u201cI confidently expect chaos,\u201d she said. \u201cThe kids will probably trample on all Mum\u2019s lovely spring flowers in their excitement and get mud all over their instruments, but at least it will be a fun event for her to watch out of her window. \u201cMy husband is going to video it too so mum can rewatch the hilarious chaos in the months coming up.\u201d Martin is not alone. Families across the country are finding innovative ways to spend Mother\u2019s Day together even if they\u2019re forced to be apart. Maria Lawrence and her adult son, Leo, will share their Mother\u2019s Day meal in York via Skype. Abioye Achebe will act as proxy son to his neighbour, Edith O\u2019Sullivan, by eating lunch together on different sides of their garden fence in east London, and Alys Thomas will have a picnic with her husband and children outside the window of her mother\u2019s care home in Leeds. Lawrence is self-isolating so her son will deliver a home-cooked lunch to her doorstep on Sunday morning. He has prepared the same meal for himself, and mother and son will eat at 1pm exactly, sharing the experience on Skype. She said: \u201cLeo will put his iPad, streaming Skype, facing him on the dining table and I\u2019ll do the same in my little flat.

      "body": "<p>Well, you can\u2019t accuse Disney of not picking its moment \u2013 although, as it turns out, the universe really picked it for them. Nearly five months after its debut in the US, after a long-period of fan-frustrating non-confirmation and further waiting, the UK launch of the Disney+ streaming service is finally upon us, beaming into your living rooms and laptops from Tuesday. And just as self-isolation from the coronavirus is making home entertainment the only entertainment for many, the timing is almost morbidly perfect.</p> <p>After all, it\u2019s not as if you\u2019ll be able to get your Disney fix on the big screen for a while now: following the lead of several other studios, the Mouse House has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/13/disney-delays-release-of-mulan-the-new-mutants-and-antlers-as-black-widow-speculation-grows\" title=\"\">indefinitely postponed</a> the cinema release dates of blockbusters <em>Mulan</em>, <em>The New Mutants</em> and <em>Antlers</em>, with <em>Black Widow</em> widely expected to follow. Instead, for \u00a35.99 a month or an annual subscription fee of \u00a349.99 (which goes up by a tenner if you subscribe after the launch), you\u2019ll be <a href=\"https://preview.disneyplus.com/uk/?cid=DSS-Search-Google-71700000063854266\" title=\"\">granted access</a> to a slightly daunting array of Disney and Disney-adjacent content. It makes the old, now-defunct <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/19/coco-pixar-disneylife-streaming\" title=\"\">DisneyLife</a> platform look as quaint as a Blockbuster Video store by comparison.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://cdnvideo.dolimg.com/cdn_assets/797b8a27e53b73fcea18ba077ba8420b5b38f1b6.pdf\" title=\"\">full list </a>of content would take me several columns to get through. Broadly, we\u2019re looking at 450 films from Disney\u2019s back catalogue, not including the full range of Pixar features and shorts (except for the resently released <em>Onward</em>), the collected works of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and all the <em>Star Wars </em>romps but the last one. TV-wise, we\u2019re looking at more than 200 Disney series, again not including assorted Marvel and <em>Star Wars</em> spinoffs.</p> <p>An archive of 640 episodes of <strong>The Simpsons</strong><em> </em>is the most prominent asset in an otherwise somewhat random assortment of properties inherited from the company\u2019s Fox takeover \u2013 which includes family-suitable films ranging from <strong>The Sound of Music </strong>to <strong>Mrs Doubtfire</strong> to <strong>Avatar</strong>. And for conscientious parents concerned about their children consuming too many hours of bubblegum Disney content on the trot, there\u2019s at least a hefty library of National Geographic documentaries to vary the programming with something a little more edifying.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNQX4q4Ef4Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KNQX4q4Ef4Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNQX4q4Ef4Y\">Watch a trailer for Disney+</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The star attractions of the service are obvious enough. Many families that will seize upon it for the kids\u2019 umpteenth viewing of <em>Frozen</em> or <em>The Lion King</em> \u2013 both the joyous 1994 and soulless 2019 versions are available, though why anyone would pick the latter in a side-by-side situation is beyond me. Many will be subscribing for <strong>The Mandalorian </strong>alone: the world premiere of the first live-action series in the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise has been the most loudly and eagerly anticipated of all new Disney+ offerings. (Well, those who didn\u2019t impatiently find it through, er, less legitimate means when American fans got it back in November.) Following months of hype that saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/03/baby-yoda-the-mandalorian-star-wars\" title=\"\">Baby Yoda</a> become a ubiquitous internet meme even with those who hadn\u2019t seen it yet, the <em>Star Wars</em> series \u2013 set between <em>Return of the Jedi</em> and <em>The Force Awakens</em> in the saga\u2019s timeline \u2013 won\u2019t disappoint die-hards, but it\u2019s not solely for them. Dispensing with the somewhat dour pompousness of the last few films, its cheerfully silly, western-influenced storytelling came as a tonic to this agnostic. It gets the Saturday-matinee spirit that 2018\u2019s strained <em>Solo</em> missed.</p> <p>If <em>The Mandalorian</em> acts as an auspicious flagship for the Disney+ range of original series, their roster of original films has yet to land on an equivalent bullseye. A live-action remake of <strong>Lady and the Tramp </strong>is innocuous but insipid, made to feel all the more pointless \u2013 like, indeed, almost all of Disney\u2019s recent rehashes \u2013 when the silky animated original is right there. More ambitious is <strong>Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made</strong>, a kid-detective caper made with a cockeyed sense of quirk by Tom McCarthy. Pretty much the last thing we\u2019d have expected from the writer-director after the Oscar-winning <em>Spotlight</em>, it\u2019s amiably odd, but just not funny enough to fly. Better is <strong>Stargirl</strong>, a sweet, slightly fey YA romance that director Julia Hart (who made the excellent <em>Fast Color</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/07/streaming-international-womens-day-female-directors-ida-lupino\" title=\"\">recently discussed</a> in this column) imbues with a winning strangeness amid the more predictable \u201cbe yourself\u201d messaging.</p> <p>Still, there\u2019s nothing yet to compete with classic Disney, and it\u2019s here where critical recommendations from the catalogue are all but futile: Disney+ will be a service that thrives on nostalgia and devoted fandom, so pick your own childhood favourite as your children pick theirs. I\u2019ll be taking return trips to <strong>The Little Mermaid</strong>, <strong>The Great Mouse Detective </strong>and <strong>Bambi</strong>, for starters, bingeing on the sharp early years of <em>The Simpsons</em> and the warm-and-fuzzy charms of assorted Muppets films, while mourning the absence of <em>The Muppets Take Manhattan\u2013</em> but, hey, we can\u2019t have everything. Pick your own comfort viewing and settle in: we may be here a while, after all.</p> <h2>New to streaming &amp; DVD this week</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0TjA5hZtqw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d0TjA5hZtqw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0TjA5hZtqw\">Watch a trailer for Le Mans \u201966</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Le Mans \u201966</strong> <br><em>(Fox, 12) </em><br>Also known by its US title <em>Ford v Ferrari</em>, this chunky slab of racing-car history is old-school Hollywood movie-making of a satisfying order: familiar dramatic beats pumped up by the Oscar-winning flash of its editing and sound design.</p> <p><strong>Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night</strong><br><em>(Drakes Avenue, 12)<br></em>Not to be confused with the Eugene O\u2019Neill adaptation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/14/streaming-max-von-sydow-film\" title=\"\">released last week</a>, Bi Gan\u2019s bewitching waking dream of a film bends space and time to depict the haunting effect of a lost love \u2013 though it does lose something at home without its virtuosic 3D finale.</p> <p><strong>The Biggest Little Farm</strong><br><em>(Parkland, PG)<br></em>John Chester\u2019s hugely appealing documentary follows the director\u2019s own quest to leave the rat race of LA and pursue biodiverse farming.

      "bodyText": "Well, you can\u2019t accuse Disney of not picking its moment \u2013 although, as it turns out, the universe really picked it for them. Nearly five months after its debut in the US, after a long-period of fan-frustrating non-confirmation and further waiting, the UK launch of the Disney+ streaming service is finally upon us, beaming into your living rooms and laptops from Tuesday. And just as self-isolation from the coronavirus is making home entertainment the only entertainment for many, the timing is almost morbidly perfect. After all, it\u2019s not as if you\u2019ll be able to get your Disney fix on the big screen for a while now: following the lead of several other studios, the Mouse House has indefinitely postponed the cinema release dates of blockbusters Mulan, The New Mutants and Antlers, with Black Widow widely expected to follow. Instead, for \u00a35.99 a month or an annual subscription fee of \u00a349.99 (which goes up by a tenner if you subscribe after the launch), you\u2019ll be granted access to a slightly daunting array of Disney and Disney-adjacent content. It makes the old, now-defunct DisneyLife platform look as quaint as a Blockbuster Video store by comparison. The full list of content would take me several columns to get through. Broadly, we\u2019re looking at 450 films from Disney\u2019s back catalogue, not including the full range of Pixar features and shorts (except for the resently released Onward), the collected works of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and all the Star Wars romps but the last one. TV-wise, we\u2019re looking at more than 200 Disney series, again not including assorted Marvel and Star Wars spinoffs. An archive of 640 episodes of The Simpsons is the most prominent asset in an otherwise somewhat random assortment of properties inherited from the company\u2019s Fox takeover \u2013 which includes family-suitable films ranging from The Sound of Music to Mrs Doubtfire to Avatar. And for conscientious parents concerned about their children consuming too many hours of bubblegum Disney content on the trot, there\u2019s at least a hefty library of National Geographic documentaries to vary the programming with something a little more edifying. The star attractions of the service are obvious enough. Many families that will seize upon it for the kids\u2019 umpteenth viewing of Frozen or The Lion King \u2013 both the joyous 1994 and soulless 2019 versions are available, though why anyone would pick the latter in a side-by-side situation is beyond me. Many will be subscribing for The Mandalorian alone: the world premiere of the first live-action series in the Star Wars franchise has been the most loudly and eagerly anticipated of all new Disney+ offerings. (Well, those who didn\u2019t impatiently find it through, er, less legitimate means when American fans got it back in November.) Following months of hype that saw Baby Yoda become a ubiquitous internet meme even with those who hadn\u2019t seen it yet, the Star Wars series \u2013 set between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens in the saga\u2019s timeline \u2013 won\u2019t disappoint die-hards, but it\u2019s not solely for them. Dispensing with the somewhat dour pompousness of the last few films, its cheerfully silly, western-influenced storytelling came as a tonic to this agnostic. It gets the Saturday-matinee spirit that 2018\u2019s strained Solo missed. If The Mandalorian acts as an auspicious flagship for the Disney+ range of original series, their roster of original films has yet to land on an equivalent bullseye. A live-action remake of Lady and the Tramp is innocuous but insipid, made to feel all the more pointless \u2013 like, indeed, almost all of Disney\u2019s recent rehashes \u2013 when the silky animated original is right there. More ambitious is Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made, a kid-detective caper made with a cockeyed sense of quirk by Tom McCarthy. Pretty much the last thing we\u2019d have expected from the writer-director after the Oscar-winning Spotlight, it\u2019s amiably odd, but just not funny enough to fly. Better is Stargirl, a sweet, slightly fey YA romance that director Julia Hart (who made the excellent Fast Color, recently discussed in this column) imbues with a winning strangeness amid the more predictable \u201cbe yourself\u201d messaging. Still, there\u2019s nothing yet to compete with classic Disney, and it\u2019s here where critical recommendations from the catalogue are all but futile: Disney+ will be a service that thrives on nostalgia and devoted fandom, so pick your own childhood favourite as your children pick theirs. I\u2019ll be taking return trips to The Little Mermaid, The Great Mouse Detective and Bambi, for starters, bingeing on the sharp early years of The Simpsons and the warm-and-fuzzy charms of assorted Muppets films, while mourning the absence of The Muppets Take Manhattan\u2013 but, hey, we can\u2019t have everything. Pick your own comfort viewing and settle in: we may be here a while, after all. New to streaming &amp; DVD this week Le Mans \u201966 (Fox, 12) Also known by its US title Ford v Ferrari, this chunky slab of racing-car history is old-school Hollywood movie-making of a satisfying order: familiar dramatic beats pumped up by the Oscar-winning flash of its editing and sound design. Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night (Drakes Avenue, 12) Not to be confused with the Eugene O\u2019Neill adaptation released last week, Bi Gan\u2019s bewitching waking dream of a film bends space and time to depict the haunting effect of a lost love \u2013 though it does lose something at home without its virtuosic 3D finale. The Biggest Little Farm (Parkland, PG) John Chester\u2019s hugely appealing documentary follows the director\u2019s own quest to leave the rat race of LA and pursue biodiverse farming. The results are gentle, family-friendly and piglet-cute, but with an incisive streak. Autumn Sonata (Mubi) If last week\u2019s Max von Sydow appreciation got you in an Ingmar Bergman mood, head to Mubi\u2019s impeccable Mother\u2019s Day selection: a sharply anguished, bruise-tender mother-daughter study, with Ingrid Bergman magnificent in her final film role.",

They come in two types: towers, to which you attach a monitor, keyboard and mouse, and all-in-ones, which are computers built into the back of screens, such as Apple\u2019s iMac and Windows PC equivalents.</p> <p>Some basic specs should include:</p> <p>\u2022 Processor: look for a ninth or 10th-generation Intel i5 or i7, AMD\u2019s Ryzen 5 2500 or Intel\u2019s i3 at the lowest end</p> <p>\u2022 RAM: 8GB minimum</p> <p>\u2022 Storage: an SSD with 256GB of storage minimum, some machines may also come with large capacity traditional HDD too</p> <p>Look for a discrete graphics card made by Nvidia or AMD if you work in a creative content industry, such as photo or video editing or similar.</p> <p><strong>Laptops</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"837cd5e75bcfae578c8aaab1c948685c8fa447cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/837cd5e75bcfae578c8aaab1c948685c8fa447cd/310_531_3659_2196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laptops are extremely popular because they contain everything you need in one package, but they also promote poor posture.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laptops are extremely popular because they contain everything you need in one package, but they also promote poor posture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The big advantage of a laptop \u2013 portability \u2013 has one big downside: terrible ergonomics making you hunch over which is bad for your back, shoulders and wrists. Consider varying your working position and height during the day, from sitting at a desk or kitchen table to standing at a kitchen work surface.</p> <p>There is a massive range in laptops including traditional hinged laptops, 2-in-1s where the keyboard folds all the way round the back and convertibles where the screen detaches from the keyboard to turn into a tablet.</p> <p>Broadly speaking traditional laptops will be cheaper. You should look for a ninth or 10th-generation Intel i5 or i7 processor, at least 8GB of RAM (preferably 16GB if an option) and 256GB of SSD storage \u2013 do not buy a laptop that only has a traditional hard drive, and nothing below 128GB. </p> <p>In addition you have to consider the screen, keyboard and trackpad. A 13in to 14in screen will be fine for most uses, so look out for a resolution of at least 1080p (1920 x 1200 or similar). The higher the resolution the crisper the screen will look.</p> <p>Laptops with poor keyboards or a poor trackpad can be infuriating to use, so check reviews before you buy.

      "bodyText": "With the coronavirus pandemic resulting in more and more of us being asked to work remotely, it\u2019s time to get to grips with what\u2019s required for working from home for more than just a day at a time. Broadly speaking you have two options: a desktop computer or a laptop. Desktops Desktop computers have a few advantages, with one big downside: you can\u2019t easily move them. The upsides are they are typically cheaper, can often be upgraded fairly easily and cheaply, and lower-cost desktops will likely age better than their laptop counterparts in terms of performance. Most modern desktops will be able to handle general office work. They come in two types: towers, to which you attach a monitor, keyboard and mouse, and all-in-ones, which are computers built into the back of screens, such as Apple\u2019s iMac and Windows PC equivalents. Some basic specs should include: \u2022 Processor: look for a ninth or 10th-generation Intel i5 or i7, AMD\u2019s Ryzen 5 2500 or Intel\u2019s i3 at the lowest end \u2022 RAM: 8GB minimum \u2022 Storage: an SSD with 256GB of storage minimum, some machines may also come with large capacity traditional HDD too Look for a discrete graphics card made by Nvidia or AMD if you work in a creative content industry, such as photo or video editing or similar. Laptops The big advantage of a laptop \u2013 portability \u2013 has one big downside: terrible ergonomics making you hunch over which is bad for your back, shoulders and wrists. Consider varying your working position and height during the day, from sitting at a desk or kitchen table to standing at a kitchen work surface. There is a massive range in laptops including traditional hinged laptops, 2-in-1s where the keyboard folds all the way round the back and convertibles where the screen detaches from the keyboard to turn into a tablet. Broadly speaking traditional laptops will be cheaper. You should look for a ninth or 10th-generation Intel i5 or i7 processor, at least 8GB of RAM (preferably 16GB if an option) and 256GB of SSD storage \u2013 do not buy a laptop that only has a traditional hard drive, and nothing below 128GB. In addition you have to consider the screen, keyboard and trackpad. A 13in to 14in screen will be fine for most uses, so look out for a resolution of at least 1080p (1920 x 1200 or similar). The higher the resolution the crisper the screen will look. Laptops with poor keyboards or a poor trackpad can be infuriating to use, so check reviews before you buy. If you\u2019re really price constrained and do all your work in browser, consider a Chromebook which will offer a much better experience at the low end than an equally cheap Windows laptop. You can use a riser or a pile of books to bring laptops up to eye-level, or attach them to an external monitor, and connect a keyboard and mouse to improve ergonomics. Monitor If you\u2019re buying a tower desktop you need a monitor, which come in a vast array of sizes, resolutions and prices. Up to 24in Full HD, 1080p or similar resolution should be fine, although Quad HD, 1440p or similar will look crisper. Larger monitors benefit greatly from increased resolution with QHD being a minimum at 27in or above, and 4K monitors being a luxury. Look for a monitor with height adjustment, and position the top of the screen at eye level. If your monitor doesn\u2019t offer height adjustment consider a third-party stand if VESA compatible (the manual or specs should tell you) or carefully propping it up on a riser or stack of books.

They come in USB or wireless versions, which are now typically connect via the Bluetooth available in the vast majority of modern laptops and desktops.

Stick to whichever type you\u2019re comfortable with. Don\u2019t forgot a mouse too. Avoid fancy-looking flat ones and consider a more ergonomically shaped one or a vertical mouse to help with wrist pain. Noise-cancelling headphones After the computer and desk set up, noise cancelling headphones might be the next best tip, particularly useful if your home office is more like the kitchen table. They\u2019re also useful for video conferencing or phone calls, as most have built-in microphones. The best in the business are the Bose QC35 II, but most large, over ear headphones will help.

      "body": "<p>Long before the arrival of Covid-19, the speed and contents of the news had made me feel almost overwhelmed with fear. Faced with a flood of images that includes migrant children in cages, melting glaciers and forest fires, it has felt impossible to process information, let alone assess the best way to react.</p> <p>We\u2019ve entered an era characterised by the twin forces of speed and instability, in which a superabundance of potential threats \u2013 running from Islamic State to nuclear war, the rise of the far right, Brexit, environmental catastrophe and now a global pandemic \u2013 is matched by a dearth of time in which to process them. It\u2019s impossible to keep up, and far too alarming to look away. Thanks to the accelerating effects of social media, it\u2019s begun to seem as if the social landscape is shifting at such a rate that thinking, the act of making sense, is permanently balked. It\u2019s increasingly difficult to distinguish real danger from rumours, speculations, conspiracy theories and deliberate lies, a process the spread of coronavirus around the globe has only intensified. Logging into Twitter or following the rolling news has meant being trapped in a spin-cycle of hypervigilant anxiety.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If this virus shows us anything, it\u2019s that we\u2019re interconnected, just as Dickens said. We have to keep each other afloat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>During this febrile period, I\u2019ve found myself longing for a different kind of timeframe, in which it would be possible both to feel and to think, to process the intense impact of the news and perhaps even to imagine other ways of being. The stopped time of a painting, say, or the dilations of the novel, in which it is possible to see patterns and consequences that are otherwise invisible. Art has begun to feel not like a respite or an escape, but a formidable tool for gaining perspective on what are increasingly troubled times.</p> <p>Can art do anything, especially during periods of crisis? In 1967, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/05/george-steiner-obituary\" title=\"\">George Steiner</a> wrote a famous essay about the deficiencies of art in the wake of the Holocaust. He argued that if a concentration camp commander could read Goethe and Rilke in the evening and still go about their duties at Auschwitz each day, then art had failed in its highest function, which he defined as the ability to humanise. The problem with this argument is that it implies for art to be successful it must act as a magic bullet, effortlessly reorganising moral faculties; in effect obliterating free will.</p> <p>Art can\u2019t forcibly induce a change in behaviour. It\u2019s not a re-education pill. Empathy is not something that happens to us when we read <em>War and Peace</em>. It\u2019s work, for which art can, however, provide us with radiant materials. Art can\u2019t win an election or bring down a president. It can\u2019t stop the climate crisis, cure a virus or raise the dead. What it can do is serve as an antidote to times of chaos. It can be a route to clarity, and it can be a force of resistance and repair, providing new registers, new languages in which to think.</p> <p>One of the problems with the internet as a source of information is that there is no end, no definitive conclusion to be reached. You travel link by link, pursuing digressions and counter-claims, interrupted by continuous breaking updates. The novel, by contrast, is a technology of orderly revelation, slowing and speeding time so as to trace connections and consequences down into hours, minutes, seconds, or out into decades, even centuries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dc6e5902fe3521b0e8efbec34020b4e94ab47dca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc6e5902fe3521b0e8efbec34020b4e94ab47dca/0_111_2050_1230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The TV adaptation of Bleak House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The TV adaptation of<em> </em>Bleak House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Mike Hogan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dickens is the master of this, and it strikes me that there can\u2019t be many better figurations for what information-gathering feels like on social media than Krook\u2019s Rag and Bottle shop in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/12/charles-dickens-bleak-house-book-that-changed-me\" title=\"\">Bleak House</a></em>. This \u201cgeneral emporium of much disregarded merchandise\u201d is overflowing with indeterminate objects, among them blacking bottles and pickling bottles, heaps of parchment scrolls, rags and hundreds of rusty keys. Buried somewhere in this maddening chaos is, or might be, a vital document, without which clarity and justice will never be achieved.</p> <p>There\u2019s a plague in <em>Bleak House</em> too, the hyper-contagious smallpox virus, which serves to underscore Dickens\u2019s larger argument about interconnection, his determined attempt to show that social classes are not inviolate or impermeable, and that no group of people, no matter how grand or rich, are truly separate from their neighbours, no matter how poor or abject. The fever doesn\u2019t respect titles or addresses, racing indiscriminately from the London slum of Tom-All-Alone to Bleak House itself. Esther catches it because she insists on helping the abject, homeless orphan Jo, shivering and stumbling from ditch to doorway, always being moved on. Realising she too is sick, she establishes herself in rigorous quarantine, knowing that by locking the door on her dear friend Ada, she is carrying out an act of love. \u201cAs she loved me and wished my mind to be at peace,\u201d she instructs, \u201ccome no nearer than the garden\u201d: the tender message of self-isolators everywhere.</p> <p>One of the pleasures of <em>Bleak House</em> is that it\u2019s a drama about the act of information-gathering itself, slowly and laboriously producing clarity and order out of lies, misinformation and occlusion. Back in the early 1990s, the critic and queer studies pioneer Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick wrote an illuminating essay about this vexed and essential process. Sedgwick was once described by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/27/the-agronauts-maggie-nelson-observer-review\" title=\"\">Maggie Nelson</a> as \u201cfat, freckled, prone to blushing, bedecked in textiles, generous, uncannily sweet, almost sadistically intelligent and, by the time I met her, terminally ill\u201d. She wrote \u201cParanoid Reading and Reparative Reading, or, You\u2019re So Paranoid, You Probably Think This Essay Is About You\u201d at the centre of the Aids crisis, at a time when many of her closest friends and colleagues were dying difficult and painful deaths, and she herself was undergoing treatment for the breast cancer that later killed her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>That\u2019s the thing about utopias, they keep you going, in a way that reading The Road does not</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Though it was written predominantly for an academic audience, \u201cParanoid Reading\u201d is about something that affects us all, which is how we approach knowledge and uncertainty, as we do constantly in the course of our daily lives, and particularly at times of disaster or rapid political change. Sedgwick begins by describing the paranoid approach, so common and widely practised that we sometimes forget there are alternatives to it.</p> <p>A paranoid reader is concerned with gathering information, tracing links and exposing secrets. They anticipate and are perennially defended against catastrophe and disappointment. They\u2019re always on the lookout for danger, about which they can never, ever know enough. Paranoia can be an appropriate mode in circumstances like those we\u2019re in now, when knowledge is crucial and swift reactions matter. As the poet Anne Boyer observes in a much-shared essay about coronavirus, \u201cfear educates our care for each other \u2013 we fear a sick person might be made sicker, or that a poor person\u2019s life might be made even more miserable, and we do whatever we can to protect them because we fear a version of human life in which everyone lives only for themselves. I am not the least bit afraid of this kind of fear, for fear is a vital and necessary part of love.\u201d</p> <p>The difficulty lies in gauging the level and amount of information it\u2019s useful to acquire. How much does the average citizen need to know about epidemiology or viral loads? Does the accumulated store of possible scenarios help a person to act safely or does it paralyse their capacity to act at all? Furthermore, how much of what is read is true, and how much is being used to convey a more sinister message, like Trump\u2019s constant harping on a \u201cforeign\u201d virus, his deployment of a disease to broadcast propaganda about closed borders? At their worst, Twitter, Facebook and the like can be a factory for manufacturing speculation and mistrust, in which material travels more rapidly the more frightening it is, providing comprehensive evidence for hopelessness and dread.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be5b0ebd9e8a69e57cb30b91ea04c659cfbdd02d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be5b0ebd9e8a69e57cb30b91ea04c659cfbdd02d/0_0_4254_4278/994.jpg\" alt=\"Derek Jarman\u2019s Modern Nature is an account of building his famous garden on the beach in his final years.\" width=\"994\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Derek Jarman\u2019s Modern Nature is an account of building his famous garden, see below, on the beach in his final years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Krause, Johansen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sedgwick\u2019s essay arose out of a conversation in the mid-1980s with her friend Cindy Patton, an activist-historian of the Aids epidemic. At the time, there were rumours that Aids might have been deliberately engineered by the US military. Sedgwick was excited to hear what Patton thought and startled by her reply. \u201cSuppose \u2026 that the lives of Africans and African Americans are worthless in the eyes of the United States; that gay men and drug users are held cheap where they aren\u2019t actively hated; that the military deliberately researches ways to kill non-combatants whom it sees as enemies; that people in power look calmly on the likelihood of catastrophic environmental and population changes,\u201d she said. \u201cSupposing we were ever so sure of all those things \u2013 what would we know then that we don\u2019t already know?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"adef2942164cda507e8cfdcc6c3728ae35eac6c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adef2942164cda507e8cfdcc6c3728ae35eac6c3/0_251_5079_3047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jarman\u2019s cottage at Dungeness in Kent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jarman\u2019s cottage at Dungeness in Kent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Bird/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What Sedgwick took away from this \u201ccongenial pessimism\u201d, which strikes a definite echo with the present day, is that it isn\u2019t always necessary to track down every piece of information about a crisis in order to respond effectively to it. Patton\u2019s statement made her realise that there are other valid concerns for the artist, the activist, the citizen faced by emergency or disaster. At the very end of her essay, she briefly, tantalisingly floats another possible approach, which is more concerned with creativity and repair than the so-called hermeneutics of suspicion.</p> <p>A useful analogy for what Sedgwick terms the \u201creparative\u201d is to be fundamentally more invested in finding nourishment than identifying poison, a drive she locates in artists as diverse as the realist painter Jack Smith, artist Joseph Cornell, film-maker John Waters and <em>Nightwood</em> author Djuna Barnes. This is not the same thing as being naive or heedless, unaware of crisis or undamaged by oppression. Instead, it\u2019s about being driven to find or invent something new and vital out of inimical environments. \u201cWhat we can best learn from such practices,\u201d Sedgwick explains, \u201care the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture \u2013 even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them.\u201d</p> <p>Sedgwick\u2019s faith in art was hard-won, and derived in part from the crucial role it played during the plague years of the Aids crisis. In contrast to the rapid international public health response to coronavirus, the first cases of \u201cgay cancer\u201d in California and New York in 1981 were met with apathy and derision. In 1984, by which time 5,596 deaths had occurred in the US and it was estimated 300,000 people had been exposed to the virus, the Reagan press officer was still responding to questions about the epidemic by joking about the journalist\u2019s possible infection status. Reagan himself didn\u2019t say the word \u201cAids\u201d until 17 September 1985. By the end of that year, 12,529 people had died.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/29/fiction-to-look-out-for-in-2020\">Fiction to look out for in 2020</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In such a situation, visibility mattered. In 1987, a six-person collective of artists in New York created the \u201cSilence = Death\u201d graphic, which became the international logo of Aids activism. This stark phrase was emblazoned in white letters on a black background beneath a pink triangle, taken from the insignia homosexuals were made to wear in concentration camps. It served to brand the call to arms, a crisp refutation of stigmatisation and homophobia.</p> <p>If silence equalled death, then part of the work of resistance was to make the fact of enforced silencing visible, as well as conveying something of the damage it caused. In 1989, the American artist and Act Up activist David Wojnarowicz posed for a famous photograph. He gazes furiously at the camera, his lips sutured with five loose stitches. Three thin trickles of blood run down his chin. In this distressing image, hurt and repair are fused. The needle works through flesh, self-inflicted wounds announcing larger harm.</p> <p>In our own era, the act of lip-sewing has been adopted by refugees. I\u2019ve seen photographs of refugees with stitched lips made on the border between Greece and Macedonia, in an Australian immigration centre in Papua New Guinea, in Athens; all places where borders are closed to certain bodies and free passage is impeded. In these cases, the image possesses an uncanny power. It can travel where the body can\u2019t. It migrates and strays, taking up permanent residence in the mind, revealing what \u2013 who \u2013 has been forcibly excluded from sight.</p> <p>The desire to unveil hidden cruelty is also at work in a series of performances about rape carried out in the early 1970s by the Cuban-American artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/22/ana-mendieta-artist-work-foretold-death\" title=\"\">Ana Mendieta</a>, while she was still a student at the University of Iowa. In 1973, a nursing student was brutally raped and murdered in campus housing. It took months before there was an arrest, and during that frightening period, Mendieta took it upon herself to create work about the attack, conveying her own horror, as well as drawing attention to the invisible epidemic of violence against women. In the first of these performances, she invited her fellow students to her apartment. When they arrived, the door was ajar. Inside, there was lavish evidence that a horrible crime had been committed. Mendieta was tied to the table, half-naked, her underwear around her ankles. Blood dripped on the floor. The students stayed an hour and for the entire time she didn\u2019t move a muscle.</p> <p>Mendieta was working right at the beginning of second-wave feminism, when it was still possible to believe in the power of revelation, the shock tactics of re-enacting violence as a vaccination, a homeopathic cure. But by the 1990s, Sedgwick was already beginning to wonder whether there wasn\u2019t something weirdly naive about placing faith in this kind of unveiling, \u201cas though to make something visible as a problem were, if not a mere hop, skip, and jump away from getting it solved, at least self-evidently a step in that direction\u201d. As if violence is not titillating to certain appetites; as if the expression of pain cannot be consumed with relish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8876ba6367c42864b4eea6991ca47579a5b2eb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8876ba6367c42864b4eea6991ca47579a5b2eb1/0_69_1503_902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elisabeth Moss in the TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elisabeth Moss in the TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Kraychyk/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The faith in inoculation remains, of course. In 2017, the actor Elisabeth Moss announced her irritation with people who refused to watch the ultra-violent <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-handmaids-tale\" title=\"\">Handmaid\u2019s Tale</a></em>, a dystopic fantasy that felt closer by the day. \u201cReally?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the balls to watch a TV show? This is happening in your real life. Wake up, people. Wake up.\u201d But in the age of the internet, it\u2019s very hard to think that anyone needs more evidence of violence. We\u2019re already drenched in it, and its capacity to snap us out of numbness is grossly overstated. If anything, it does the opposite, glutting the viewer with despair.</p> <p>The night before Trump\u2019s inauguration, I saw the trans poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/16/eileen-myles-learn-to-write-poems\" title=\"\">Eileen Myles</a> read their own version of a presidential address at the London Review Bookshop. The vision they unfolded was the utopian inverse \u2013 painful! thrilling! \u2013 of what Trump would say the following day. Under Myles, the White House would be a homeless shelter, there\u2019d be 24-hour libraries, free trains, free education, free food, archery for everyone; sure, why not? It felt reparative, listening to that. It felt like my imaginative ability to frame utopias and then to move purposefully towards them might have been restored, at least for a minute.</p> <p>I had the same experience when I first read <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/mar/27/ursula-k-le-guins-electronica-album-music-and-poetry-of-the-kesh\" title=\"\">Always Coming Home</a></em>, Ursula Le Guin\u2019s 1985 collection of stories and anthropological fragments about a future civilisation, the Kesh, living in what is now California\u2019s Napa Valley in the wake of an apocalypse that is never quite described. It was a relief to encounter such a formidable thinker using her imaginative energy, her humour and her extensive knowledge to construct a better, fairer, more environmentally sane society \u2013 its architecture, sexual arrangements, metaphors, toys, songs, clothes, medical practices and stories \u2013 rather than simply magnifying all that is worst about our own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/17/best-books-new-beginnings-jenny-colgan\">The best books about new beginnings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s the thing about utopias, they keep you going, in a way that reading <em>The Road</em> or <em>The Death of Grass</em> does not. Le Guin was no less concerned about the oncoming ecological crisis than Cormac McCarthy, but her approach is calmer and more infused with hope. Hope has a bad press in our cynical age, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean being disengaged, a Pollyanna blind to the state things are in or uninterested in how they got that way. Hope is the precursor to change. Without it, no better world is possible.</p> <p>The same year that Wojnarowicz was photographed with his needle and thread, the film-maker Derek Jarman began the diary that would become <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/27/olivia-laing-derek-jarman-modern-nature\" title=\"\">Modern Nature</a></em>, an account of building his famous garden on the beach in Dungeness, Kent. Jarman was diagnosed HIV-positive in the winter of 1986, years before the invention of combination therapy made long-term survival a probability. In the face of his own oncoming death, he didn\u2019t give way to despair. Instead he elected to spend his time making this stony desert bloom.</p> <p>He planted irises and roses directly into the shingle, encouraging a riot of wallflowers and valerian, \u201call the dark humours blown away by the wind\u201d. This wild, unfenced arcadia sustained him through the political battles of his final years, and has now outlived him by more than quarter of a century. Last time I visited, in December, it was still humming with power.</p> <p>I have the same feeling when I look at photographs by Wolfgang Tillmans or read a novel by Ali Smith. I had it when I went to see my friend Rich\u2019s degree show at Goldsmiths and he\u2019d made dozens of ceramic razor clams and anemones, downed planes and nubbly coral reefs. It\u2019s a feeling of being inducted back into hope, a restoration of faith. It\u2019s easy to give into despair. There\u2019s so much that\u2019s frightening, so much that\u2019s wrong. But if this virus shows us anything, it\u2019s that we\u2019re interconnected, just as Dickens said. We have to keep each other afloat, even when we can\u2019t touch. Art is a place where that can happen, where ideas and people are made welcome. It\u2019s a zone of enchantment as well as resistance, and it\u2019s open even now .</p> <p><em>\u2022 Funny Weather: Art in an Emergency by Olivia Laing is published on 16 April by Picador (RRP \u00a320).

It can be a route to clarity, and it can be a force of resistance and repair, providing new registers, new languages in which to think. One of the problems with the internet as a source of information is that there is no end, no definitive conclusion to be reached. You travel link by link, pursuing digressions and counter-claims, interrupted by continuous breaking updates. The novel, by contrast, is a technology of orderly revelation, slowing and speeding time so as to trace connections and consequences down into hours, minutes, seconds, or out into decades, even centuries. Dickens is the master of this, and it strikes me that there can\u2019t be many better figurations for what information-gathering feels like on social media than Krook\u2019s Rag and Bottle shop in Bleak House. This \u201cgeneral emporium of much disregarded merchandise\u201d is overflowing with indeterminate objects, among them blacking bottles and pickling bottles, heaps of parchment scrolls, rags and hundreds of rusty keys. Buried somewhere in this maddening chaos is, or might be, a vital document, without which clarity and justice will never be achieved. There\u2019s a plague in Bleak House too, the hyper-contagious smallpox virus, which serves to underscore Dickens\u2019s larger argument about interconnection, his determined attempt to show that social classes are not inviolate or impermeable, and that no group of people, no matter how grand or rich, are truly separate from their neighbours, no matter how poor or abject. The fever doesn\u2019t respect titles or addresses, racing indiscriminately from the London slum of Tom-All-Alone to Bleak House itself. Esther catches it because she insists on helping the abject, homeless orphan Jo, shivering and stumbling from ditch to doorway, always being moved on. Realising she too is sick, she establishes herself in rigorous quarantine, knowing that by locking the door on her dear friend Ada, she is carrying out an act of love. \u201cAs she loved me and wished my mind to be at peace,\u201d she instructs, \u201ccome no nearer than the garden\u201d: the tender message of self-isolators everywhere. One of the pleasures of Bleak House is that it\u2019s a drama about the act of information-gathering itself, slowly and laboriously producing clarity and order out of lies, misinformation and occlusion. Back in the early 1990s, the critic and queer studies pioneer Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick wrote an illuminating essay about this vexed and essential process. Sedgwick was once described by Maggie Nelson as \u201cfat, freckled, prone to blushing, bedecked in textiles, generous, uncannily sweet, almost sadistically intelligent and, by the time I met her, terminally ill\u201d. She wrote \u201cParanoid Reading and Reparative Reading, or, You\u2019re So Paranoid, You Probably Think This Essay Is About You\u201d at the centre of the Aids crisis, at a time when many of her closest friends and colleagues were dying difficult and painful deaths, and she herself was undergoing treatment for the breast cancer that later killed her. Though it was written predominantly for an academic audience, \u201cParanoid Reading\u201d is about something that affects us all, which is how we approach knowledge and uncertainty, as we do constantly in the course of our daily lives, and particularly at times of disaster or rapid political change. Sedgwick begins by describing the paranoid approach, so common and widely practised that we sometimes forget there are alternatives to it. A paranoid reader is concerned with gathering information, tracing links and exposing secrets. They anticipate and are perennially defended against catastrophe and disappointment. They\u2019re always on the lookout for danger, about which they can never, ever know enough. Paranoia can be an appropriate mode in circumstances like those we\u2019re in now, when knowledge is crucial and swift reactions matter. As the poet Anne Boyer observes in a much-shared essay about coronavirus, \u201cfear educates our care for each other \u2013 we fear a sick person might be made sicker, or that a poor person\u2019s life might be made even more miserable, and we do whatever we can to protect them because we fear a version of human life in which everyone lives only for themselves. I am not the least bit afraid of this kind of fear, for fear is a vital and necessary part of love.\u201d The difficulty lies in gauging the level and amount of information it\u2019s useful to acquire. How much does the average citizen need to know about epidemiology or viral loads? Does the accumulated store of possible scenarios help a person to act safely or does it paralyse their capacity to act at all? Furthermore, how much of what is read is true, and how much is being used to convey a more sinister message, like Trump\u2019s constant harping on a \u201cforeign\u201d virus, his deployment of a disease to broadcast propaganda about closed borders? At their worst, Twitter, Facebook and the like can be a factory for manufacturing speculation and mistrust, in which material travels more rapidly the more frightening it is, providing comprehensive evidence for hopelessness and dread. Sedgwick\u2019s essay arose out of a conversation in the mid-1980s with her friend Cindy Patton, an activist-historian of the Aids epidemic. At the time, there were rumours that Aids might have been deliberately engineered by the US military. Sedgwick was excited to hear what Patton thought and startled by her reply. \u201cSuppose \u2026 that the lives of Africans and African Americans are worthless in the eyes of the United States; that gay men and drug users are held cheap where they aren\u2019t actively hated; that the military deliberately researches ways to kill non-combatants whom it sees as enemies; that people in power look calmly on the likelihood of catastrophic environmental and population changes,\u201d she said. \u201cSupposing we were ever so sure of all those things \u2013 what would we know then that we don\u2019t already know?\u201d What Sedgwick took away from this \u201ccongenial pessimism\u201d, which strikes a definite echo with the present day, is that it isn\u2019t always necessary to track down every piece of information about a crisis in order to respond effectively to it. Patton\u2019s statement made her realise that there are other valid concerns for the artist, the activist, the citizen faced by emergency or disaster. At the very end of her essay, she briefly, tantalisingly floats another possible approach, which is more concerned with creativity and repair than the so-called hermeneutics of suspicion. A useful analogy for what Sedgwick terms the \u201creparative\u201d is to be fundamentally more invested in finding nourishment than identifying poison, a drive she locates in artists as diverse as the realist painter Jack Smith, artist Joseph Cornell, film-maker John Waters and Nightwood author Djuna Barnes. This is not the same thing as being naive or heedless, unaware of crisis or undamaged by oppression. Instead, it\u2019s about being driven to find or invent something new and vital out of inimical environments. \u201cWhat we can best learn from such practices,\u201d Sedgwick explains, \u201care the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture \u2013 even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them.\u201d Sedgwick\u2019s faith in art was hard-won, and derived in part from the crucial role it played during the plague years of the Aids crisis. In contrast to the rapid international public health response to coronavirus, the first cases of \u201cgay cancer\u201d in California and New York in 1981 were met with apathy and derision. In 1984, by which time 5,596 deaths had occurred in the US and it was estimated 300,000 people had been exposed to the virus, the Reagan press officer was still responding to questions about the epidemic by joking about the journalist\u2019s possible infection status. Reagan himself didn\u2019t say the word \u201cAids\u201d until 17 September 1985. By the end of that year, 12,529 people had died. In such a situation, visibility mattered. In 1987, a six-person collective of artists in New York created the \u201cSilence = Death\u201d graphic, which became the international logo of Aids activism. This stark phrase was emblazoned in white letters on a black background beneath a pink triangle, taken from the insignia homosexuals were made to wear in concentration camps. It served to brand the call to arms, a crisp refutation of stigmatisation and homophobia. If silence equalled death, then part of the work of resistance was to make the fact of enforced silencing visible, as well as conveying something of the damage it caused. In 1989, the American artist and Act Up activist David Wojnarowicz posed for a famous photograph. He gazes furiously at the camera, his lips sutured with five loose stitches. Three thin trickles of blood run down his chin. In this distressing image, hurt and repair are fused. The needle works through flesh, self-inflicted wounds announcing larger harm. In our own era, the act of lip-sewing has been adopted by refugees. I\u2019ve seen photographs of refugees with stitched lips made on the border between Greece and Macedonia, in an Australian immigration centre in Papua New Guinea, in Athens; all places where borders are closed to certain bodies and free passage is impeded. In these cases, the image possesses an uncanny power. It can travel where the body can\u2019t. It migrates and strays, taking up permanent residence in the mind, revealing what \u2013 who \u2013 has been forcibly excluded from sight. The desire to unveil hidden cruelty is also at work in a series of performances about rape carried out in the early 1970s by the Cuban-American artist Ana Mendieta, while she was still a student at the University of Iowa. In 1973, a nursing student was brutally raped and murdered in campus housing. It took months before there was an arrest, and during that frightening period, Mendieta took it upon herself to create work about the attack, conveying her own horror, as well as drawing attention to the invisible epidemic of violence against women. In the first of these performances, she invited her fellow students to her apartment. When they arrived, the door was ajar. Inside, there was lavish evidence that a horrible crime had been committed. Mendieta was tied to the table, half-naked, her underwear around her ankles. Blood dripped on the floor. The students stayed an hour and for the entire time she didn\u2019t move a muscle. Mendieta was working right at the beginning of second-wave feminism, when it was still possible to believe in the power of revelation, the shock tactics of re-enacting violence as a vaccination, a homeopathic cure. But by the 1990s, Sedgwick was already beginning to wonder whether there wasn\u2019t something weirdly naive about placing faith in this kind of unveiling, \u201cas though to make something visible as a problem were, if not a mere hop, skip, and jump away from getting it solved, at least self-evidently a step in that direction\u201d. As if violence is not titillating to certain appetites; as if the expression of pain cannot be consumed with relish. The faith in inoculation remains, of course. In 2017, the actor Elisabeth Moss announced her irritation with people who refused to watch the ultra-violent Handmaid\u2019s Tale, a dystopic fantasy that felt closer by the day. \u201cReally?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the balls to watch a TV show? This is happening in your real life. Wake up, people. Wake up.\u201d But in the age of the internet, it\u2019s very hard to think that anyone needs more evidence of violence. We\u2019re already drenched in it, and its capacity to snap us out of numbness is grossly overstated. If anything, it does the opposite, glutting the viewer with despair. The night before Trump\u2019s inauguration, I saw the trans poet Eileen Myles read their own version of a presidential address at the London Review Bookshop. The vision they unfolded was the utopian inverse \u2013 painful! thrilling! \u2013 of what Trump would say the following day. Under Myles, the White House would be a homeless shelter, there\u2019d be 24-hour libraries, free trains, free education, free food, archery for everyone; sure, why not? It felt reparative, listening to that. It felt like my imaginative ability to frame utopias and then to move purposefully towards them might have been restored, at least for a minute. I had the same experience when I first read Always Coming Home, Ursula Le Guin\u2019s 1985 collection of stories and anthropological fragments about a future civilisation, the Kesh, living in what is now California\u2019s Napa Valley in the wake of an apocalypse that is never quite described. It was a relief to encounter such a formidable thinker using her imaginative energy, her humour and her extensive knowledge to construct a better, fairer, more environmentally sane society \u2013 its architecture, sexual arrangements, metaphors, toys, songs, clothes, medical practices and stories \u2013 rather than simply magnifying all that is worst about our own. That\u2019s the thing about utopias, they keep you going, in a way that reading The Road or The Death of Grass does not. Le Guin was no less concerned about the oncoming ecological crisis than Cormac McCarthy, but her approach is calmer and more infused with hope. Hope has a bad press in our cynical age, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean being disengaged, a Pollyanna blind to the state things are in or uninterested in how they got that way. Hope is the precursor to change. Without it, no better world is possible. The same year that Wojnarowicz was photographed with his needle and thread, the film-maker Derek Jarman began the diary that would become Modern Nature, an account of building his famous garden on the beach in Dungeness, Kent. Jarman was diagnosed HIV-positive in the winter of 1986, years before the invention of combination therapy made long-term survival a probability. In the face of his own oncoming death, he didn\u2019t give way to despair. Instead he elected to spend his time making this stony desert bloom. He planted irises and roses directly into the shingle, encouraging a riot of wallflowers and valerian, \u201call the dark humours blown away by the wind\u201d. This wild, unfenced arcadia sustained him through the political battles of his final years, and has now outlived him by more than quarter of a century. Last time I visited, in December, it was still humming with power. I have the same feeling when I look at photographs by Wolfgang Tillmans or read a novel by Ali Smith. I had it when I went to see my friend Rich\u2019s degree show at Goldsmiths and he\u2019d made dozens of ceramic razor clams and anemones, downed planes and nubbly coral reefs. It\u2019s a feeling of being inducted back into hope, a restoration of faith. It\u2019s easy to give into despair. There\u2019s so much that\u2019s frightening, so much that\u2019s wrong. But if this virus shows us anything, it\u2019s that we\u2019re interconnected, just as Dickens said. We have to keep each other afloat, even when we can\u2019t touch. Art is a place where that can happen, where ideas and people are made welcome. It\u2019s a zone of enchantment as well as resistance, and it\u2019s open even now . \u2022 Funny Weather: Art in an Emergency by Olivia Laing is published on 16 April by Picador (RRP \u00a320).

      "bodyText": "Amy Tan is preparing to burst into song with two fellow musicians on a deserted street in Acton, west London. \u201cWe\u2019ll do anything by Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald \u2013 the Rat Pack,\u201d she says. \u201cOr maybe they would like a song by Elton John or the Beatles?\u201d A watching couple wave from the balcony of their flat as Tan begins to sing. But she is not expecting to meet every audience, or even see their faces. What\u2019s important is that they are listening. The street has been selected by a local aid group as one where vulnerable people who are self-isolating during the coronavirus outbreak would benefit from the simple, life-affirming joy of hearing music. Tan has formed the Covid-19 Mutual Aid musicians\u2019 group to lift the spirits of those forced to cut themselves off. As a church pastor, she has encountered many, mainly elderly people fearfulof the emotional and mental strain of being isolated possibly for weeks, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the virus that kills, it\u2019s the loneliness,\u201d she says. So far about 30 musicians, including some who play in the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, have signed up. They will go out in small groups to perform \u2013 and the project aims to help them, too. \u201cThere are so many musicians out of pocket because of this epidemic. I wanted to help people find purpose again,\u201d says Tan. \u201cPeople are asking: \u2018Why am I a musician?\u2019 My answer is that, when the worst happens, you still have your music.\u201d As a response to the coronavirus outbreak and the mental health challenges of self-isolation, the wider Covid-19 Mutual Aid UK network is more evidence not just of crisis as a catalyst for altruism, but of the mutual benefits of helping others. There are now 900 groups across the UK, fast recruiting volunteers from all walks of life to assist with tasks from shopping to dog walking to being at the end of the phone line. In London, where the epidemic is spreading faster than elsewhere, the membership of these solidarity groups has soared. Tom Bird, a teacher, says hundreds of volunteers have joined the Ealing group he administers. \u201cPeople can relax more when they know they can do something tangible. This is one of the things that I have felt. People like to think; \u2018Here is a task that I can do.\u2019 We can achieve something together.\u201d One beneficiary of the local aid network is Joanna Dudzinska, who is undergoing chemotherapy, and enjoyed the performance in Acton with her partner Anthony Smith. \u201cIt was such a wonderful distraction. It made me not think about our problems for a while.\u201d They are currently sharing their home with her elderly mother, who has been stranded in the UK because of coronavirus. \u201cOf course, for the three of us this coronavirus is a disaster.

      "body": "<p>As the Trump administration and lawmakers in Washington debate cash payments to support Americans during the coronavirus crisis, the mayor of one California city that has experimented with universal basic income has advice.</p> <p>Early findings from Stockton, California, which launched a basic income experiment last year, may offer American policymakers some reassurance \u2013 and a few notes of caution.</p> <p>It\u2019s \u201cheartening\u201d to see a national focus on providing direct cash assistance, said Michael Tubbs, Stockon\u2019s 29-year-old mayor, who championed the city\u2019s basic income experiment. But some choices in the current Republican plan make little sense to him, Tubbs said. \u201cIf someone was struggling more than others before a crisis, why should they get less help during a crisis that is going to hit them harder? It defies logic,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Thursday, the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, proposed legislation to give middle-income Americans a single, $1,200 payout for each adult, plus $500 for each child in a family. The payments decrease for Americans who earn more than $75,000 a year, and individuals who make more than $99,000 will get nothing. The lowest-income Americans also get less: the plan includes a smaller, $600 payment to adults in some of America\u2019s poorest families. Democratic lawmakers are calling for Americans to receive larger, recurring cash payments, with at least one plan calling for <a href=\"https://khanna.house.gov/media/press-releases/release-reps-ryan-khanna-propose-cash-infusion-between-1000-6000-help-working\">a monthly check</a> of between $1,000 and $6,000.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have to make sure that the most marginalized, the most impacted, the folks who were struggling the most before this pandemic get help</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have to make sure that the most marginalized, the most impacted, the folks who were struggling the most before this global pandemic get help and relief,\u201d Tubbs said.</p> <p>Stockton launched its guaranteed income experiment, the first in modern US history, in 2019. Since that February, 125 local residents in the economically challenged city have received $500 a month to spend on whatever they choose.</p> <p>The idea of providing a universal basic income to citizens is not new, but it has found new supporters in recent years, as some tech industry leaders have embraced \u201cUBI\u201d as a possible response to rising inequality and a growing number of American jobs lost to automation. The Facebook co-founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/20/america-guaranteed-income-chris-hughes\">Chris Hughes</a> is among the proponents of the policy; the Economic Security Project, which he co-chairs, is helping fund basic income experiments in Stockton and elsewhere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/andrew-yang-coronavirus-universal-basic-income-interview\">'$1,000 per person should be the baseline': Andrew Yang on direct payments during coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Early data from the Stockton experiment is promising, according to the two researchers who are running the evaluation of the program.</p> <p>\u201cIf you give people free cash, how do they spend it? They\u2019re very rational about it, and they make great decisions,\u201d said Stacia Martin-West, an assistant professor at the University of Tennessee College of Social Work and one of the lead researchers.</p> <p>Direct cash payments are more flexible than a one-size-fits-all government program, and they allow people to adapt to changing needs and new crises. \u201cEveryone we talked to, there was a different way they would use $500, and they all made sense,\u201d Tubbs, the Stockton mayor, said. \u201cThere was no way, as a government official, I would be smart enough to think of all that.\u201d</p> <p>One participant used the money to pay for dentures, Tubbs said. Another was able to take time off work to interview for a better job that paid more and had shorter hours. Participants have talked about finally having the money to buy their kid a sports uniform or a prom dress, or to move to <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/156584/can-500-month-change-life\">a safer neighborhood.</a></p> <p>But the single largest category of spending among Stockton participants so far: food. Nearly 40% of tracked spending monthly went to feeding the recipients and their families.</p> <p>That number highlights the degree of basic \u201cfood insecurity\u201d that Americans have been living with since even before the current crisis, said Amy Castro Baker, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the other lead researcher on the project.</p> <p>The Stockton researchers also found that participants were using their additional cash to invest in healthier food choices for themselves and their kids, additional evidence that the barrier for lower-income Americans to eat healthier is not education about what they should and should not be eating, but access to affordable, high-quality food.</p> <p>Scaling a direct cash payment program nationwide during a pandemic could end up having broader public health benefits, beyond just preventing the spread of the virus, Baker said. It could give more Americans the resources to eat healthier meals. If lawmakers provide continuous payments, reducing residents\u2019 fears about being able to make it through the crisis, their lower levels of anxiety could also lead to better overall health outcomes.</p> <h2>\u2018As long as the crisis lasts\u2019</h2> <p>As policymakers in Washington debate which Americans to exclude from direct cash payments, and whether they should send just one check, or two or three, Tubbs, the Stockton mayor, encouraged them to think bigger.</p> <p>Direct cash payments should last \u201cas long as the crisis lasts, and even a little bit after\u201d, Tubbs said.</p> <p>Receiving $500 or $1,000 monthly isn\u2019t much during a global pandemic that has destroyed the economy, Tubbs said: \u201cIf they were working two or three jobs, this is not replacing what they made, this is enough to let them get by.\u201d</p> <p>Martin-West and Baker, the researchers evaluating the Stockton experiment, agreed that an effective program of national cash payments needed to match the scale and scope of the problem. That means payments should go out immediately, within 10 to 14 days; they need to recur throughout the crisis; and they need to reach Americans with as few bureaucratic hurdles as possible.</p> <p>Since the 2008 recession, \u201cthe average household has not recovered,\u201d Baker said. Banks got bailed out, the stock market boomed, but the government did not do enough to help most Americans.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we have now is an entire economy of people living paycheck to paycheck because they were left out,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe have been a house of cards for a really long time, and it wasn\u2019t going to take much to blow it over.\u201d</p> <p>A big, sustained program of direct cash payments was a chance for the American government to \u201ccourse-correct\u201d and make up for the failures of the 2009 bailout, she said.</p> <p>How big and how sustained? A good benchmark for the size of the checks the government should send to Americans now, Martin-West said, might be some common financial wisdom.</p> <p>\u201cThe advice that we\u2019ve all heard for how to be financially savvy is: you\u2019re supposed to have three months of income saved up. If we look at the median income for Americans, that would mean $7,500 in the bank,\u201d she said.</p> <p>That benchmark would mean supporting Americans with roughly $2,500 per month throughout the crisis. \u201cAt minimum, a year of those cash transfers would be ideal,\u201d Martin-West said.</p> <p>Lawmakers need to specify in the legislation that the coronavirus payments do not count as income that could later disqualify low-income families from receiving food stamps, or other continuing government assistance, the researchers said. If lawmakers fail to do that, families could lose their eligibility for other programs, hurting them more over the long run.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re in an unprecedented crisis, so we have to have big thinking. This is a New Deal type moment</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Tubbs</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While both Republican and Democratic plans call for reducing or even eliminating direct payments to higher-income Americans, Tubbs also said that he believes payments should be \u201ccloser to universal\u201d since \u201cthe crisis will impact everyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the difference between [an income cutoff of] $99,000 and $100,000 is, especially at at time when we\u2019re laying people off and shutting down industries,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The two researchers suggested that the federal government should channel money to Americans through multiple programs, to make sure they reach everyone in need. Why not increase the amounts of existing welfare and disability payments, as well as using tax records to send taxpayers cash?</p> <p>But even large direct cash payments aren\u2019t a substitute for other kinds of government action, they cautioned. Other solutions are needed during the coronavirus crisis, including paid sick leave and better healthcare.

      "bodyText": "As the Trump administration and lawmakers in Washington debate cash payments to support Americans during the coronavirus crisis, the mayor of one California city that has experimented with universal basic income has advice. Early findings from Stockton, California, which launched a basic income experiment last year, may offer American policymakers some reassurance \u2013 and a few notes of caution. It\u2019s \u201cheartening\u201d to see a national focus on providing direct cash assistance, said Michael Tubbs, Stockon\u2019s 29-year-old mayor, who championed the city\u2019s basic income experiment. But some choices in the current Republican plan make little sense to him, Tubbs said. \u201cIf someone was struggling more than others before a crisis, why should they get less help during a crisis that is going to hit them harder? It defies logic,\u201d he said. On Thursday, the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, proposed legislation to give middle-income Americans a single, $1,200 payout for each adult, plus $500 for each child in a family. The payments decrease for Americans who earn more than $75,000 a year, and individuals who make more than $99,000 will get nothing. The lowest-income Americans also get less: the plan includes a smaller, $600 payment to adults in some of America\u2019s poorest families. Democratic lawmakers are calling for Americans to receive larger, recurring cash payments, with at least one plan calling for a monthly check of between $1,000 and $6,000. \u201cWe have to make sure that the most marginalized, the most impacted, the folks who were struggling the most before this global pandemic get help and relief,\u201d Tubbs said. Stockton launched its guaranteed income experiment, the first in modern US history, in 2019. Since that February, 125 local residents in the economically challenged city have received $500 a month to spend on whatever they choose. The idea of providing a universal basic income to citizens is not new, but it has found new supporters in recent years, as some tech industry leaders have embraced \u201cUBI\u201d as a possible response to rising inequality and a growing number of American jobs lost to automation. The Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes is among the proponents of the policy; the Economic Security Project, which he co-chairs, is helping fund basic income experiments in Stockton and elsewhere. Early data from the Stockton experiment is promising, according to the two researchers who are running the evaluation of the program. \u201cIf you give people free cash, how do they spend it? They\u2019re very rational about it, and they make great decisions,\u201d said Stacia Martin-West, an assistant professor at the University of Tennessee College of Social Work and one of the lead researchers. Direct cash payments are more flexible than a one-size-fits-all government program, and they allow people to adapt to changing needs and new crises. \u201cEveryone we talked to, there was a different way they would use $500, and they all made sense,\u201d Tubbs, the Stockton mayor, said. \u201cThere was no way, as a government official, I would be smart enough to think of all that.\u201d One participant used the money to pay for dentures, Tubbs said. Another was able to take time off work to interview for a better job that paid more and had shorter hours. Participants have talked about finally having the money to buy their kid a sports uniform or a prom dress, or to move to a safer neighborhood. But the single largest category of spending among Stockton participants so far: food. Nearly 40% of tracked spending monthly went to feeding the recipients and their families. That number highlights the degree of basic \u201cfood insecurity\u201d that Americans have been living with since even before the current crisis, said Amy Castro Baker, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the other lead researcher on the project. The Stockton researchers also found that participants were using their additional cash to invest in healthier food choices for themselves and their kids, additional evidence that the barrier for lower-income Americans to eat healthier is not education about what they should and should not be eating, but access to affordable, high-quality food. Scaling a direct cash payment program nationwide during a pandemic could end up having broader public health benefits, beyond just preventing the spread of the virus, Baker said. It could give more Americans the resources to eat healthier meals. If lawmakers provide continuous payments, reducing residents\u2019 fears about being able to make it through the crisis, their lower levels of anxiety could also lead to better overall health outcomes. \u2018As long as the crisis lasts\u2019 As policymakers in Washington debate which Americans to exclude from direct cash payments, and whether they should send just one check, or two or three, Tubbs, the Stockton mayor, encouraged them to think bigger. Direct cash payments should last \u201cas long as the crisis lasts, and even a little bit after\u201d, Tubbs said. Receiving $500 or $1,000 monthly isn\u2019t much during a global pandemic that has destroyed the economy, Tubbs said: \u201cIf they were working two or three jobs, this is not replacing what they made, this is enough to let them get by.\u201d Martin-West and Baker, the researchers evaluating the Stockton experiment, agreed that an effective program of national cash payments needed to match the scale and scope of the problem. That means payments should go out immediately, within 10 to 14 days; they need to recur throughout the crisis; and they need to reach Americans with as few bureaucratic hurdles as possible. Since the 2008 recession, \u201cthe average household has not recovered,\u201d Baker said. Banks got bailed out, the stock market boomed, but the government did not do enough to help most Americans. \u201cWhat we have now is an entire economy of people living paycheck to paycheck because they were left out,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe have been a house of cards for a really long time, and it wasn\u2019t going to take much to blow it over.\u201d A big, sustained program of direct cash payments was a chance for the American government to \u201ccourse-correct\u201d and make up for the failures of the 2009 bailout, she said. How big and how sustained? A good benchmark for the size of the checks the government should send to Americans now, Martin-West said, might be some common financial wisdom. \u201cThe advice that we\u2019ve all heard for how to be financially savvy is: you\u2019re supposed to have three months of income saved up. If we look at the median income for Americans, that would mean $7,500 in the bank,\u201d she said. That benchmark would mean supporting Americans with roughly $2,500 per month throughout the crisis. \u201cAt minimum, a year of those cash transfers would be ideal,\u201d Martin-West said. Lawmakers need to specify in the legislation that the coronavirus payments do not count as income that could later disqualify low-income families from receiving food stamps, or other continuing government assistance, the researchers said. If lawmakers fail to do that, families could lose their eligibility for other programs, hurting them more over the long run. While both Republican and Democratic plans call for reducing or even eliminating direct payments to higher-income Americans, Tubbs also said that he believes payments should be \u201ccloser to universal\u201d since \u201cthe crisis will impact everyone.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what the difference between [an income cutoff of] $99,000 and $100,000 is, especially at at time when we\u2019re laying people off and shutting down industries,\u201d he said. The two researchers suggested that the federal government should channel money to Americans through multiple programs, to make sure they reach everyone in need. Why not increase the amounts of existing welfare and disability payments, as well as using tax records to send taxpayers cash? But even large direct cash payments aren\u2019t a substitute for other kinds of government action, they cautioned. Other solutions are needed during the coronavirus crisis, including paid sick leave and better healthcare. In Stockton, the guaranteed income pilot has made clear that more money is not enough to help residents deal with systemic problems, like California\u2019s lack of affordable housing. Baker also questioned why the McConnell legislation was benchmarked against Americans\u2019 2018 tax returns, when so many Americans, including freelancers and gig economy workers, see their incomes change dramatically over time. And the researchers worried about the part of McConnell\u2019s legislation that envisions a lower, $600 payout to Americans who do not reach certain income tax cutoffs. A single mom who spends most of her time caring for a child with a serious disability, for example, might not make the income cutoff for a full $1,200 check, even though she\u2019s \u201ccertainly going to be struggling in the middle of a public health crisis\u201d, Martin-West said. Not all lawmakers are onboard with even a single direct cash payment to Americans, and some key Senate Republicans expressed reservations about McConnell\u2019s plan on Thursday, including Lindsey Graham, an influential Trump ally. But merely focusing on increasing unemployment insurance, as Graham has suggested, Tubbs said, would leave out too many people who might not fit the criteria for unemployment, including women doing domestic and caregiving work, freelancers, barbers and hairdressers, and Lyft and Uber drivers. Americans needed both more unemployment insurance and direct payments, Tubbs said, not one or the other. \u201cWe\u2019re in an unprecedented crisis, so we have to have big thinking,\u201d Tubbs said \u201cThis is a New Deal type moment, in terms of the recession that\u2019s bound to come from this public health epidemic, which we haven\u2019t seen in at least a century.\u201d Tubbs said he was not surprised that direct cash payments were having a national political moment, and he said that work to make the idea mainstream has already been done, including by Andrew Yang, the entrepreneur and Democratic presidential primary candidate, who made UBI his central policy issue in his bid for the White House. \u201cI think folks like myself, and people like the Economic Security Project, people like Mr Yang, have taken the brunt of the criticism,\u201d Tubbs said. \u201cI think now it\u2019s really a safe space, particularly because we\u2019re in a crisis. \u201cThere were a lot of people who were living in an economic pandemic before the corona crisis,\u201d he added. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 March 2020 to correct a mistake that said White Policy instead of White House.",

      "bodyText": "Scared, vulnerable older people are being preyed on by criminals using a range of coronavirus scams to burgle, rob and potentially harm them, police and support groups have warned. The Metropolitan police have confirmed they are investigating one scam in Barnet where leaflets were posted through the doors of elderly people offering to decontaminate their houses. Terry, 74, a local resident who lives alone, received the leaflet through his door from a company called Corona Virus Decontamination Service and rang the mobile number. \u201cI spoke to a man who said that for \u00a340 a room he and his business partner would clean my house.\u201d Terry told his son, Edward, about the offer, who rang the man to ask more questions. \u201cI asked him how they could be sure they wouldn\u2019t bring the virus into the house with them and he was coming up with increasingly unlikely answers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I questioned his claim that they wear quarantine suits that they burn after every visit, he hung up on me.\u201d Edward reported the incident to the police, who are now investigating. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat would these men have done if my vulnerable dad had let them into his house? At best, I suspect they would have stolen stuff, but at worst he would have been in physical danger too.\u201d The concerns come as police warned all members of the public to be wary of coronavirus scammers after figures revealed \u00a3970,000 has been lost to fraudsters claiming to be from the World Health Organization or HMRC. Figures from the national police reporting centre Action Fraud on Friday revealed there have been 105 reported cases of fraud since 1 February and cases have grown more frequent in the past few days, with 38 reported from 14 to 18 March alone. The majority of cases relate to online shopping scams, after people reported that their orders of face masks, hand sanitisers and other products never arrived. In the Midlands this week, an elderly man was robbed of his savings after he left the bank after withdrawing money. \u201cIt may be that he was anxious about being stuck at home without cash, but he was watched as he withdrew his money and robbed of more than \u00a32,000 when he left,\u201d said Alison Beachim, the chief executive of Age UK Birmingham and Sandwell. \u201cWe\u2019ve also had a couple of incidents of tradesmen knocking on the doors of the elderly and asking for ridiculous sums to do work \u2013 in one case it was so serious that we have reported the matter to Action Fraud,\u201d she added. Jennifer Allott, from Age UK York, said \u201cWe have heard from elderly people who have received letters through the door and people selling shortage products on their doorsteps. There is huge potential for elderly people to be exploited. Our response is to seek to expand our existing services as rapidly as we can, particularly our home shopping service.\u201d In Manchester, police say fraudsters are specifically targeting older people who are self-isolating. \u201cThey knock on their doors and offer services such as a grocery shop or virus testing but then trick them into parting with their money,\u201d said DCI Helen Critchley of Greater Manchester police\u2019s economic crime and cyber unit. The consumer watchdog Which? said it has seen reports from across the country of \u201cparticularly nasty scams\u201d against older people. \u201cOne scam has the criminals offering to take their temperature \u2013 thus allowing them into the house, where residents can be robbed or worse,\u201d a spokesperson said. Joel Lewis from Age UK said: \u201cAnxiety in the older age group is particularly high and those older people without the internet are most vulnerable to becoming victims. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t want them not to seek help from the honest community volunteer groups that have sprung up around the country, we want to warn them to be cautious: don\u2019t let anyone into your home or hand over money to people offering to do shopping,\u201d he said. Age Concern in Lancashire has seen such an increase in scams targeting the elderly that it is redeploying its workforce and recruiting new volunteers to provide critical services the elderly may otherwise be scammed over. Suzanne Carr, the chief executive of Age Concern Lancashire, said: \u201cHundreds of community groups have sprung up to help those in self-isolation as the virus spreads across the country. Unfortunately, among this kindness there are still those that will prey on the vulnerable and those who are not properly equipped to provide home visits may be exposing older people to further unnecessary risk.\u201d A spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council said: \u201cIf people have doubts about those who are approaching them, and are concerned, we advise that they don\u2019t engage and report serious suspicious behaviour to police.

One \u2018trashy book club\u2019 with members scattered across the northeastern US is becoming more active as members seek relief from the daily slog of bad news. Their most recent read, It Takes Two to Tumble by Cat Sebastian, is basically a \u201crestrained English countryside gay Sound of Music,\u201d said club co-founder Jarrett Byrnes of Boston. </p> <p>He advises new trashy book clubs to have a rolling deadline for reading, share passages as they go and indulge in books they would otherwise never read.</p> <h2>3) Learn how to make cocktails </h2> <p>New York bartenders Jackie Summers and Daniella Veras are hosting a nightly <a href=\"https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUlc-mvqzsvQvTKc9TPQEa-MEbCgixAdw?fbclid=IwAR3DQ6mXAfsAkl6SLS_eNAOwG7hj1FClMcm0P8Rktr-zxzMsYP5891H91Yk\">\u2018Cocktails After Dark,\u2019</a> hangout on Zoom video conferencing, where now out-of-work bartenders teach viewers how to make drinks and earn tips.

      "bodyText": "As most people head into their first full weekend of self-quarantine, it can seem that the world\u2019s cultural horizons are shrinking. Don\u2019t let them. Here are 11 of the best cultural activities to try: 1) A private museum visit There\u2019s no jostling and you don\u2019t have to struggle to read the interpretive label despite the tourists pushing in front of you. Set aside an hour, turn off your phone and social media, make yourself a hot drink, and embark on one of these surprisingly enjoyable online tours: The Louvre and Musee d\u2019Orsay in Paris The British Museum in London The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam The Guggenheim in New York The Vatican and its Sistine Chapel in Rome Google Arts &amp; Culture also has content from more than 1,200 museums and archives, including 500 virtual tours. 2) Join a trashy book club The author Yiyun Li and publisher A Public Space are starting a virtual book club for readers to take on the 1,200-page War and Peace one day at a time. \u201cIt will take us about 30 minutes to read 12-15 pages a day, (much less than the time many Americans spend on social media), and we will finish the novel in three months \u2013 just in time for summer, and with our spirits restored,\u201d said Li. Goodreads has numerous book clubs on everything from YA to travel literature. Or you could start your own club for a book that is considerably less highbrow. One \u2018trashy book club\u2019 with members scattered across the northeastern US is becoming more active as members seek relief from the daily slog of bad news. Their most recent read, It Takes Two to Tumble by Cat Sebastian, is basically a \u201crestrained English countryside gay Sound of Music,\u201d said club co-founder Jarrett Byrnes of Boston. He advises new trashy book clubs to have a rolling deadline for reading, share passages as they go and indulge in books they would otherwise never read. 3) Learn how to make cocktails New York bartenders Jackie Summers and Daniella Veras are hosting a nightly \u2018Cocktails After Dark,\u2019 hangout on Zoom video conferencing, where now out-of-work bartenders teach viewers how to make drinks and earn tips. They go live at 6pm and 11pm ET, and the sessions are already drawing about 100 people. \u201cAnybody can drink at home \u2013 you go to the bar to hang out,\u201d Summers said. \u201cSo what we figured we\u2019d do is create something that solves two problems at once. We\u2019re going to create a space where people can hang out and we\u2019re going to give them a virtual bartender.\u201d 4) Live concerts in your living room The online music festival Sofa King Fest is a directory of streaming performances by an ever-revolving array of artists, including Willie Nelson, Lucinda Williams, Paul Simon and Big Freedia. \u201cWhat we want people to do is sit back and let us curate their weekend,\u201d said cofounder Travis Laurendine. WatchtheDJ.com has a directory of live and archived DJ sets. And some local venues are experimenting with virtual live sets too. 5) Find humor even in times like these The Magnet Theater in New York has gone all-digital for its regular comedy shows. The Maryland Improv Collective is acting out two-person scenes daily via Zoom and posting the scenes on Facebook and YouTube. \u201cIt\u2019s been really critical for us to continue working those improv muscles as well as giving people some light-hearted content to look at in all this doom and gloom,\u201d said the troupe\u2019s Heather Moyer. 6) Exercise or meditate Gyms and fitness studios \u2013 chains and local businesses \u2013 are offering virtual workouts, some for free and some for a fee. Gold\u2019s Gym, 24 Hour Fitness and CorePower Yoga have some free online classes through their websites or apps. Some local companies are trying to provide a more personal touch. Past Tense yoga studio in Washington DC has suspended monthly and yearly memberships and is offering digital classes for $25 a month or $200 a year. The meditation app Headspace offers free sessions as well. 7) Learn a new art or craft Bluprint offers classes in arts and crafts, from drawing and painting to cake decorating and woodworking. A two-week trial is free. Noted illustrators are posting free classes, although most are for kids. Dozens of museums and libraries are offering free downloads of coloring books. The Kennedy Center in Washington wants to help you learn how to doodle and create art at home. It is posting a new video each weekday of its quirky education artist-in-residence, Mo Willems, demonstrating creative projects. 8) Get \u2018outside\u2019 The Royal Parks in London and Central Park in New York both have online tours. The US National Park Service is largely keeping parks open and is temporarily waiving entrance fees. But it is also offering 32 virtual tours, including of the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Maine\u2019s Acadia National Park. 9) Stream a movie with friends A number of apps allow viewers in different locations to synchronize streaming films so they can watch them \u2018together\u2019. Netflix Party, for example, is a browser extension available on Google Chrome. In the US, a number of new films are being released to on-demand early. And Washington\u2019s canceled Environmental Film Festival is streaming dozens of films online until March 31, such as We Will Stay, which profiles a US island shrinking due to climate change and the residents determined not to leave. 10) Have a virtual dinner party Video chat with your friends while cooking the same recipe. Bon Appetit has curated 13 pasta recipes and 17 comfort food recipes with few ingredients. The Kitchn published a nutritionist\u2019s advice on what to buy and what to avoid when stocking up on groceries and etiquette for shopping trips. The New York Times has a list of easy recipes for the self-quarantined. 11) Opera and classical music The Metropolitan Opera is streaming past performances each night. They are available from 7.30pm to 3.30pm the following day. On the schedule for Saturday is Donizetti\u2019s Lucia di Lammermoor, and up Sunday is Tchaikovsky\u2019s Eugene Onegin. The Bavarian State Opera has live and free concerts. OperaVision also hosts streaming opera from all over Europe. The Berliner Philharmoniker has a free virtual concert hall with an archive of hundreds of concerts.",

      "body": "<p>Last Saturday night, Amber Valentine got dressed up to play a set, as she has nearly every weekend since she began DJing full time eight years ago. She put on her headphones as a smoke machine and lights filled the room \u2013 but this time, instead of walking on stage to perform, she walked into her living room.</p> <p>Valentine is one of an increasing number of performers moving their work online as nationwide lockdowns meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus force bars and other nightlife spaces to a close. Drag shows, DJ sets, and dance parties have been taking to live streams and chat rooms to keep people connected and pay out-of-work performers as more and more cities in the US go on lockdown.</p> <p>Valentine came up with the idea to stream her set on Instagram live for a virtual dance party when New York City bars and clubs closed last week , and she\u2019s planning another one this weekend now the New York governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/new-york-coronavirus-andrew-cuomo-non-essential-workers-businesses\">has ordered</a> most people to stay home. </p> <p>\u201cThe response was like nothing I could have expected,\u201d she said. Thousands of people tuned in and hundreds of her Instagram followers sent her videos of themselves dancing to her music in their living rooms. Many used the comment section to chat with one another as they might do in a club, and although she didn\u2019t ask for money she made several hundred dollars via donations through her Venmo account.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9z1ei6l8Me/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "Last Saturday night, Amber Valentine got dressed up to play a set, as she has nearly every weekend since she began DJing full time eight years ago. She put on her headphones as a smoke machine and lights filled the room \u2013 but this time, instead of walking on stage to perform, she walked into her living room. Valentine is one of an increasing number of performers moving their work online as nationwide lockdowns meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus force bars and other nightlife spaces to a close. Drag shows, DJ sets, and dance parties have been taking to live streams and chat rooms to keep people connected and pay out-of-work performers as more and more cities in the US go on lockdown. Valentine came up with the idea to stream her set on Instagram live for a virtual dance party when New York City bars and clubs closed last week , and she\u2019s planning another one this weekend now the New York governor has ordered most people to stay home. \u201cThe response was like nothing I could have expected,\u201d she said. Thousands of people tuned in and hundreds of her Instagram followers sent her videos of themselves dancing to her music in their living rooms. Many used the comment section to chat with one another as they might do in a club, and although she didn\u2019t ask for money she made several hundred dollars via donations through her Venmo account. \u201cPeople are trying to find happy spots and brightness because this is a super dark and uncertain time,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the role of nightlife in this pandemic is not unlike what it usually is, which is we can try to create spaces where people can come and hang out in community and have their spirits lifted for a little while.\u201d Events at Nowadays, a nightlife space and bar in Brooklyn, New York, migrated to online streams less than 24 hours after the city closed bars and nightclubs last week, said Justin Carter, a DJ and co-founder of the space.

In total, Tasmania has 10 cases, ACT has 9 and NT has 5.</li> \n   <li>Many of Sydney\u2019s most famous beaches will be closed on Sunday. The NSW government announced any beach with more than 500 should be closed. The development followed pictures of a packed Bondi beach. \u201cWhat happened at Bondi was unacceptable,\u201d federal health minister Greg Hunt said.</li> \n   <li>The Northern Territory announced that from 4pm on Tuesday, all entries to the state would have to go into quarantine for 14 days. There would be some exceptions. </li> \n   <li>There will be fallout from a decision by NSW to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/ruby-princess-logged-158-cases-of-illness-before-passengers-disembarked-without-coronavirus-testing\">allow the Ruby Princess cruise ship to dock and disembark in Sydney on Thursday</a>. New reports have revealed that 158 sick passengers had also disembarked the ship in Sydney on 8 March before it left for a short cruise, and that several had high temperatures.</li> \n   <li>The Victorian government announced a $1.7bn \u201ceconomic survival and jobs package\u201d.</li> \n   <li>South Australia announced 17 new positive cases of Covid-19, including 10 from one US tour group that was now in isolation at their accommodation in the Barossa Valley. There are 18 in the group. Four have tested negative, and four more are waiting for results. The entire group self-isolated when the first person became sick, the state\u2019s chief public health officer said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>So that\u2019s that.

Because the ship had only travelled between Sydney and New Zealand, it was deemed a low risk of people carrying the virus. People were allowed to disembark, but four people from the ship later tested positive for Covid-19, leaving NSW Health scrambling to alert the other 2,700 passengers onboard.<br><br>Sheppeard said the ship did not have Covid-19 testing capacity onboard but did have flu testing.

      "bodyText": "Closing up our live Australia coverage of coronavirus for the day, but you can keep on top of all the latest developments elsewhere with our global live blog. But before you go, here\u2019s the main developments from Australia today. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Australia went above 1000. NSW had 83 new cases, Victoria 51, Queensland 37, South Australia 17 and Western Australia 26. In total, Tasmania has 10 cases, ACT has 9 and NT has 5. Many of Sydney\u2019s most famous beaches will be closed on Sunday. The NSW government announced any beach with more than 500 should be closed. The development followed pictures of a packed Bondi beach. \u201cWhat happened at Bondi was unacceptable,\u201d federal health minister Greg Hunt said. The Northern Territory announced that from 4pm on Tuesday, all entries to the state would have to go into quarantine for 14 days. There would be some exceptions. There will be fallout from a decision by NSW to allow the Ruby Princess cruise ship to dock and disembark in Sydney on Thursday. New reports have revealed that 158 sick passengers had also disembarked the ship in Sydney on 8 March before it left for a short cruise, and that several had high temperatures. The Victorian government announced a $1.7bn \u201ceconomic survival and jobs package\u201d. South Australia announced 17 new positive cases of Covid-19, including 10 from one US tour group that was now in isolation at their accommodation in the Barossa Valley. There are 18 in the group. Four have tested negative, and four more are waiting for results. The entire group self-isolated when the first person became sick, the state\u2019s chief public health officer said. So that\u2019s that. Thanks for staying with us. Take care of yourself, take care of others, and remember the rules that will protect you and the rest of us. Writer, broadcaster and Guardian Australia contributor Geoff Lemon has caught coronavirus. He has some advice. Take care of yourself Geoff. Guardian reporter Ben Smee has more on the docking of the Ruby Princess cruise ship in Sydney. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard has told reporters that in hindsight, he would have waited for coronavirus test results first before letting passengers disembark. Queensland has released its coronavirus figures for Saturday 21 March, confirming 37 new cases, bringing the total number of cases to 221. There were 16 cases in the city\u2019s north and six in the south. The Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast had five new cases each. There were four cases in the Darling Downs, west of Brisbane, and one in the Wide Bay area to north, an area that includes the city of Bundaberg. The 37 new cases announced today is less than the 40 announced yesterday. The biggest single jump the state reported was on 19 March, when 50 cases were reported. All of Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs beaches will be closed on Sunday, including Bondi, Bronte and Coogee. Waverley Council and Randwick City Council said Maroubra, Coogee, Clovelly, Bronte, Bondi and Tamarama beaches would all close on Sunday. The NSW government announced that a 500-person cap would now apply to beaches to restrict the potential spread of Covid-19, after images from social media showed people tightly packed on Bondi beach. Sunny weather forecast for Sunday would likely see numbers break that 500-person cap, Randwick City Council said in a statement. Randwick mayor Danny Said, said in a statement: Throughout this pandemic, our priority has always been public health and safety and we are again prioritising this by taking this proactive decision. The safest approach for everybody is for us not to open the beaches. For everybody\u2019s own health, I urge people not to come to the beach on Sunday as you are potentially putting your health and the health of others at risk. News agency AAP has more on the tour group in South Australia\u2019s Barossa Valley, north of Adelaide. The agency reports there are 18 people in the US tour group. On a day when the state declared 17 new confirmed cases of Covid-19, it was revealed that 10 of the positive tests had come from the tour group. All 18 were in isolation in their accommodation and chief public health officer Prof Nicola Spurrier said none had needed hospital treatment. Spurrier said the group had immediately self-isolated as soon as one person became ill. \u201cI\u2019m actually quite calm about this because I know these people have done the right thing,\u201d Prof Spurrier said. \u201cThere is absolutely no reason for the people in the Barossa to panic.\u201d Because the group had been on an organised tour, Spurrier told reporters it was easier to track their recent movements using the tour\u2019s itinerary. Four other people in the group had also returned negative results while the remaining four are waiting for tests to be returned. Kenny Rogers has passed away from natural causes at the age of 81. A statement released by the music legend\u2019s management said: The family is planning a small private service at this time out of concern for the national COVID-19 emergency. They look forward to celebrating Kenny\u2019s life publicly with his friends and fans at a later date Rogers toured Australia seven times, according to a report in Rolling Stone from 2014. The Northern Territory government says anyone entering the state \u201cby road, rail, air and sea\u201d after 4pm on Tuesday 24 March will have to self-isolate for 14 days. There will be some exemptions to the quarantine period for health and emergency services, defence and policing, flight crews and freight \u201cwith strict guidelines in place to monitor and manage this\u201d. Chief minister Michael Gunner said any arrivals would have to show they met the essential arrival criteria to be granted an exemption. Exemptions may also be made \u201con compassionate grounds\u201d. A formal declaration by the chief health officer under the Public and Environmental Health Act would make the new rules possible. Gunner said: The government is announcing these new measures today to give Territorians as much confidence as possible that we are taking every step possible to keep you safe. This is an unprecedented action for the Northern Territory. But these are unprecedented times. The territory comes first. The health of Territorians always comes first. He said the delivery of essential goods and services, including food and freight, would not be impacted. He added: Our supermarkets and stores will be stocked. These are trying times for Territorians. The measures we are implementing are tough, but their purpose is clear: to save lives, and keep Territorians safe. That will always be our first priority. The Australian newspaper is reporting that the Ruby Princess cruise ship that docked in Sydney on Thursday with four confirmed cases of people with Covid-19 on board had \u201chad previously been sailing with 158 sick passengers on board\u201d. The newspaper reports those 158 passengers, of which 13 had high temperatures, had disembarked in Sydney on March 8 before the ship left for a short cruise around New Zealand. Although the government has banned cruise ship arrivals, an exception was made for the Ruby Princess which docked in Sydney on Thursday. On Friday, the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said everyone who had disembarked the ship \u2013 about 2700 passengers \u2013 should self-isolate for 14 days. Three of those who disembarked on Thursday were confirmed to have caught the virus. A fourth was a crew member who was being isolated on board the ship. Health authorities in South Australia are reporting an increase of 17 cases of Covid-19 since yesterday, bringing the total in the state to 67. One tourist group in the Barossa Valley have returned 10 positive tests. More to come on this. Afternoon. Graham Readfearn here, grabbing the blog duties from Melissa Davey for the rest of the day. My colleague Miles Martignoni has been in touch after looking at what mobile phone providers have been up to as people socially-isolate and start working away from offices. Many have announced changes to their plans, so you might find you have more data to play with. Most require you to register to receive the extra data, so check with your provider to see if you\u2019re eligible. Telstra mobile and mobile broadband post-paid customers get an extra 25GB of data to use in Australia, and pre-paid customers an extra 10GB. Optus has added 20GB for post-paid plans and 10gb for pre-paid plans for some customers. You can check eligibility here. Vodafone is offering 5GB for post-paid customers and 3GB for pre-paid customers. Thanks for following the latest Australian Covid-19 news with me, Melissa Davey. I\u2019m handing over to my excellent colleague Graham Readfearn now, who will bring you all the news here throughout the evening. Contact him on Twitter here. Still at the NSW press conference and health minister Brad Hazzard has handed it back over to NSW Health\u2019s Dr Vicky Sheppeard to face the tough questions from reporters about why passengers were allowed to disembark the Ruby Princess cruise ship. She said the department followed the national procedure for assessing cruise ships for Covid-19. Because the ship had only travelled between Sydney and New Zealand, it was deemed a low risk of people carrying the virus. People were allowed to disembark, but four people from the ship later tested positive for Covid-19, leaving NSW Health scrambling to alert the other 2,700 passengers onboard. Sheppeard said the ship did not have Covid-19 testing capacity onboard but did have flu testing. Before the ship docked, 13 passengers were swabbed for flu, she said. We decided even though we thought it was a low risk of Covid-19, we thought we\u2019d bring those [flu] swabs to the lab and test them for Covid-19. That\u2019s how the cases were identified. NSW had followed national guidelines in allowing passengers to disembark after performing the national risk assessment, she said. NSW Health\u2019s Dr Vicky Sheppeard is holding a press conference, speaking about the 436 confirmed cases in the state. Each day we are getting increased numbers of confirmed cases but the vast majority of those are people returning from overseas, particularly the United States and Europe ... There has been minimal exposure in the community. The other large number of cases are close contacts of confirmed cases. The health minister, Brad Hazzard is speaking about the large number of people still congregating at Bondi Beach despite social-distancing rules that prevent mass outdoor gatherings. Hazzard appears to be blaming much of that on young people, saying: I was bitterly disappointed when I was told there were large groups down at Bondi, that mecca for so many foreign tourists and also Australians to go to. Today there has been no real heeding of that [social distancing] message. The government has taken the steps needed to make sure people know this is [not acceptable]. Young people may feel this isn\u2019t going to hurt me so why worry. It can hurt you and it can hurt your family and friends. Have a look overseas and see what\u2019s happening in other countries. It\u2019s very, very bad overseas and if not for the work here we would have the same problem. But the problem is just over the horizon. Save yourself and save your family. No one wants to see enforcement, we want to see compliance. Just do it. Victorian police have conducted a number of spot checks to ensure people are self-isolating. In a statement, police said the checks were being done is response to requests from the Department of Health. Police said: For operational reasons, we will not disclose how these checks are being undertaken or how many have been conducted so far. At this stage, no one has been charged with refusing or failing to comply with direction. The mayor of Waverley, Paula Masselos, has been speaking at Bondi and she said they would clear \u201cthe whole of the water\u201d, including of surfers. Surf lifesavers were headed out to disperse across the beach to deliver the news to everyone. I asked if it would apply to Bondi Icebergs pool, which is at the south end of the beach, and the mayor said it was a private club but that they would be \u201cAsking all our organisations to comply as much as possible\u201d. There were some disgruntled locals listening on; one complained about infringement of civil liberties, and said the beach was \u201csacred\u201d. There are still people at the beach despite the closure. Masselos said: On behalf of everyone at Waverley Council, I strongly urge the public to observe health advice about social distancing when visiting our area, including our beaches. The public must at all times keep a minimum safe distance from each other in public places and if you don\u2019t need to be out in public, please consider staying at home. The number of coronavirus cases in Australia has exceeded 1,000, as states updated their figures today. In New South Wales, the health department announced 83 new cases, the largest daily increase for the state so far. NSW now has 436 cases, and the state\u2019s health minister, Brad Hazzard, is due to give an update at 3.30pm. The state has closed Bondi Beach temporarily after thousands of people ignored social distancing measures and flocked to the beach on Friday. Once it reopens, if lifesavers see more than 500 people on the beach at any one time, it will be closed. Meanwhile in Victoria, 51 new cases were reported overnight, bringing the state\u2019s total to 229. It is just ahead of Queensland, which has 221 cases. A Northern Territory couple have tested positive to coronavirus, bringing cases in that state to five, and both were passengers aboard the Ruby Princess cruise ship which docked in Sydney. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, today defended Australia\u2019s testing regime, saying about 115,000 tests had been carried out, a higher rate per person than in the US. But Victoria\u2019s health minister, Brett Sutton, said he would like to see more testing done. The shadow foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has urged the government to do more to help Australians stranded overseas as flights are cancelled and borders close. This morning the Victorian government has announced what it described as a $1.7bn \u201ceconomic survival and jobs package\u201d. Earlier, Hunt said Australians must start taking social distancing measures seriously: If you are breaking those rules you are putting, not just yourself, but you\u2019re putting other Australians at risk. What happened in Bondi was unacceptable and the local council must take steps to stop that occurring. We need to be our best selves and our most responsible selves, and the vast majority are doing the right thing. To those small few who are doing the wrong thing, think of others; and to those who have local responsibility, discharge those responsibilities. As my colleague Ben Doherty just posted, Australians have been stranded overseas as countries close their borders and people flock to book flights home. In a press conference earlier today, health minister Greg Hunt was asked what Australia was doing to support those who were stranded. He said: Around the world, Foreign Affairs and Trade is reaching out, doing surveys, finding who is out there. I do say this: the prime minister gave ample warning that there was the risk that flights and the capacity to return would not be possible \u2013 that\u2019s been occurring over the course of the last month. But nevertheless Foreign Affairs is reaching out, we\u2019re continuing to work with Qantas, and Qantas is continuing to fly from major hubs to Australia and we thank them for that. But shadow foreign affairs minister Penny Wong said that while she commended the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade\u2019s consular team, Australians were not able to access timely and comprehensive advice and assistance. She said in a statement: In Peru, which is in lockdown, Australians are being forced to fundraise to cover the costs of charter flights reported to be as high as $15,000 per person. And Australians stranded on cruise ships are unclear about what assistance is being provided for their ships to dock, and for them to disembark and return home once docked. We call on the Morrison government to work with Qantas, Virgin or other providers to help Australians return home and ensure the costs of returning home are not exorbitant or a barrier to travel; expedite the processing of visas for immediate family members of Australian citizens who are rushing to return home; properly resource our consular teams to meet the unprecedented demands to assist Australians overseas; and provide comprehensive timely information to Australians. The government needs to communicate a plan to help bring Australians home. Meanwhile in AFL news, a Collingwood staff member who was recently overseas has tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The club said in a statement: In accordance with government protocols, the staff member has been in isolation since returning to Australia. He is recovering at home and being monitored by the Department of Health and Human Services. Due to quarantine requirements, the staff member has at no point been in any contact with players or staff members at Collingwood since returning and has therefore presented no transmission risk to the club. Australians remain stranded in locked-down South American countries such as Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia and are scrambling to find ways home. A handful of commercial charter flights are available but for many the costs are unaffordable. Others, outside of major cities, are struggling to get official approval to take buses to airports. Ecuador\u2019s shutdown was sudden and extreme, and a complete shutdown of the capital Quito is being enforced by police, at times violently. Hotels have been ordered closed, shops are running low on food, and other essential services cancelled. Sydney couple Anne and Craig Dorrington have found accommodation at a Quito hostel called Secret Garden, whose owner has negotiated with the government to be able to stay open. Many of those staying there are backpackers and they have been able to negotiate lower rates in exchange for working at the hostel, helping with repairs and minor renovations. Guests are also trying to keep costs down by using cold rather than hot water. The Dorringtons have put out a call encouraging any Australian tourists evicted from shuttered hotels in Quito to seek accommodation at the Secret Garden. They have established a WhatsApp group for Australians stranded in Ecuador to co-ordinate repatriation efforts and support each other. Anne Dorrington is a mental health practitioner and has been running a mental care program in the hostel including yoga and meditation. She wrote: We need urgent help getting out of Ecuador as this country is in lockdown and it is not a safe place to be. The hotel has been told that they need to close down, so then we will have nowhere to go. There is nobody in the streets, the military are pushing people back in their homes. Shops are closed, there is no food, no street access. The Dorringtons\u2019 son John told the Guardian his parents had been frustrated by efforts to contact the Australian government and had not been able to register with the consulate or get assistance from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra. He said that given the severity of the Covid-19 crisis, the Australian government needed to mobilise flights to repatriate their citizens. My parents are doing their best, but everyone is pretty down. This was a big trip for my parents, now they just can\u2019t get home and can\u2019t see a window to get home. They feel they are being completely ignored by the Australian government. A Northern Territory couple have tested positive to coronavirus, bringing cases in that state to five. The couple were passengers on the Ruby Princess cruise ship that docked in Sydney. After disembarking, the couple flew to Darwin. It\u2019s getting harder and harder to keep an up-to-date tally of the virus in Australia as the day unfolds. The latest case numbers announced from the states and territories throughout the day means 1,049 cases of Covid-19 have now been confirmed in Australia, including seven deaths. NSW police minister David Elliot has announced the closure of Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach. He said: This is not something we are doing because we are the fun police. This is about saving lives. If the community does not comply with the regulations and the health warnings, well then this is going to become the new norm. We will be closing down the type of iconic activities that unfortunately we\u2019ve come ... to love and adore about our lifestyle. I\u2019ve spoken to the police commissioner today and in consultation with the police and surf lifesaving, we will now be seeing beaches across the state that fail to comply with public gathering regulations [prohibiting gatherings of more than 500 people in an outdoor space] are closed. Elliot said surf lifesavers would conduct head counts and, if they found more than 500 people, would close the beach and order people to move on. If people did not comply, police would be called. Of course with the social distancing regulations we are relying on the laws of common sense. The photos we saw this morning were a clear breach of faith when it comes to the implementation of these laws, and quite frankly they were a breach of public safety. In the event there is under 500 people ... then people can remain on the beach. What cost public safety? What cost the lives of the people of New South Wales? There are now 90 confirmed cases in Western Australia. From Tuesday, all category 3 elective surgeries will be cancelled. Category 3 surgery is considered non-urgent surgery for conditions causing pain, dysfunction or disability but that are unlikely to deteriorate quickly and do not have the potential to become an emergency. The health minister said: Now is the time to have all guns blazing on the Covid-19 virus. Travel restrictions for Lord Howe Island have been put in place, effective immediately. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard today made an order under the Public Health Act for access restrictions to and from the island, as well as quarantine requirements. Located 600km off the NSW coast, the island\u2019s geographic isolation placed it in a unique position in the pandemic, the island\u2019s tourism body said in a statement. It read: Lord Howe Island currently does not have any confirmed cases of Covid-19. The island has limited capacity to provide specialist medical care to patients with severe Covid-19 infections. In addition, the island has a number of vulnerable residents and would expect to welcome a significant number of older visitors over the coming months. We appreciate many visitors booked to visit Lord Howe Island in the coming weeks will be disappointed to have their travel plans change. We ask for our visitors\u2019 patience and understanding during these extraordinary times. March and April are among the best and busiest months to visit World Heritage-listed Lord Howe Island, when the waters are warm and the temperatures mild. For our small economy, which is based almost entirely on tourism, the operators\u2019 support for this order shows their commitment to the wellbeing of the community for the long term. We would like to ask visitors to consider rebooking for later in 2020 or 2021 rather than cancelling their bookings all together. NSW Health\u2019s Dr Vicky Sheppeard will give an update on cases of Covid-19 in that state at 3.30pm. Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Brett Sutton, said he wanted to do significant amounts of testing even though Australia was already doing \u201c10 times more testing than the US\u201d for its population size. He said there had been a significant increase in testing capacity in the past week, and that there was now a wider definition for testing. There are now 229 cases in Victoria, with 51 confirmed yesterday. Scott Morrison announced on Friday that, in addition to people who have returned from overseas with symptoms or been in close contact with confirmed cases and have symptoms, people in aged care with respiratory illness could now be tested regardless of travel. People with pneumonia and healthcare workers with symptoms can also get a test. Sutton said about 3,000 tests were being conducted in the state daily. \u201cI would like to see several thousand that we can do every day.\u201d Sutton was also asked to comment on the docking of the Ruby Princess cruise ship in Sydney; all passengers are now isolating after four people on board tested positive. He said: The lesson from Japan [the Diamond Princess cruise ship] was the crew continued to have cases and may well have brought it to others on that ship even though they were isolated. I\u2019m sure NSW have done the right thing. I\u2019m not here to judge NSW public health. They\u2019re acting to the protocols for cruise ships. Victoria\u2019s opposition leader Michael O\u2019Brien has responded to the premier\u2019s $1.7bn economic package for small businesses, describing it as \u201conly a start\u201d. He says: I was hoping to see land tax relief for tenanted residential properties, as tenants and their landlords need support. Questions also remain about exactly what support sole traders and micro businesses under the payroll tax threshold will receive. Small businesses and their staff are among the most vulnerable to the economic pressure created by the Covid-19 crisis. This announcement is a start, but it is only a start. More will need to be done to protect small businesses and save jobs. Hello to all of those just joining our Covid-19 liveblog. If you\u2019re just catching up for the day, there\u2019s a fair bit of news already been announced in Australia. Here\u2019s a breakdown: There are now 969 Covid-19 cases and seven deaths in Australia, and health minister Greg Hunt says about 115,000 tests have been carried out. NSW is set to announce Bondi Beach will close after photos emerged of people defying social distancing rules and gathering in thousands at the beach. That announcement is due at 2pm. Also in NSW, questions are being asked about why passengers were allowed to disembark from the Ruby Princess cruise liner in Sydney. The ship\u2019s 2,700 passengers have been told to self-isolate. Four people on the ship have now tested positive for the virus. Meanwhile, Victorian premier Daniel Andrews announced a $1.7bn \u201ceconomic survival and jobs package\u201d, which will provide full payroll tax refunds for the 2019-20 financial year to small and medium-sized businesses with payroll of less than $3m. Payments will start being made next week. A ban on non-citizens and non-residents entering Australia has taken effect. Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Brett Sutton, will be holding a press conference shortly. For those who have come here from our most recent app alert, we need to clarify that the NSW government has not yet announced the closure of Bondi Beach: it is expected to happen at 2pm today. But if any of our Sydney readers are at Bondi and can let us know if it\u2019s already closed off, feel free to get in contact. It still looked open about an hour ago, just after noon: Following discussions of the Coag Disability Reform Council, the minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), Stuart Robert, announced new measures being considered to support NDIS participants, workers and providers. NDIS plans will be extended by up to two years. He said: We have been consulting with NDIS, disability and health stakeholders to understand what actions we need to take to minimise the impact that Covid-19 may have on people with disability, their families and the network of providers and workers that support them. We have a concerted and responsive plan of action to ensure that people with disability can continue to receive the support they need, and that providers have what they need to continue delivering their essential services in these extraordinary circumstances. We have allowed NDIS plans to be extended by up to 24 months, ensuring continuity of support. Telephone meetings are being offered to all current and potential NDIS participants as a safer way to continue service delivery, including for new plans and plan reviews, during the current phase of the Covid-19 outbreak. There are 969 cases of Covid-19 in Australia, with six deaths in NSW and one in WA. The New South Wales government is set to announce it will close Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach. The announcement \u2013 to be made by NSW and emergency services police minister David Elliott at 2pm AEDT \u2013 comes after concerns were raised that large numbers of beachgoers were not abiding by public health advice. Images from Australia\u2019s most iconic beach in recent days have shown large crowds of people. Guardian Australia understands the closure will affect Bondi Beach alone at this stage, though the NSW government could extend the restriction to other beaches if they find more than 500 people gathered at any time. Queensland saw 37 news cases of the virus overnight. The state now has 221 cases. Chief health officer Jeannette Young is urging people who are unwell with a confirmed case to stay in isolation. Once you have the infection, if you get it, then you are in isolation. That is different to quarantine. Isolation means you cannot come into contact with anyone else. In your own home you cannot because you will give it to them. That is the riskiest environment to be, with people sharing a home so you absolutely need to be isolated. You cannot have visitors. You absolutely, under any circumstance, must not leave your home. We have support for you. We will not abandon anyone. Business Council chief executive Jennifer Westacott has responded to the $1.7bn economic survival and jobs package announced by Victorian premier Daniel Andrews earlier today. She says: We know this extraordinary health event will eventually end and the measures announced today will keep people in jobs, money in people\u2019s pockets and our essential services and major industries going. These are the cogs that keep the economy turning and we need to be in a strong position to drive the economic recovery when these unprecedented events pass.\u2019\u2019 Back overseas briefly and Guardian US reporter Ed Pilkington asks how New York will cope now that it is at the centre of the crisis there. He writes: Even with his dire warning ringing in their ears, New Yorkers were still stunned when the truth finally hit on Thursday. Within a single day, the number of confirmed cases in the city had more than tripled to 3,954 \u2013 almost a third of all coronavirus cases in the nation. Of those, almost one in five of the sickened individuals have needed hospital care, much higher than is typical, underlining the massive challenge to the city\u2019s health system. At least 26 have died. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing an explosion of cases here in New York City,\u201d Bill de Blasio, the mayor, said. That\u2019s just the start. \u201cThe latest figures reflect only the tip of an iceberg,\u201d said Theodora Hatziioannou, an associate professor in virology at the Rockefeller University in Manhattan. Read the full story here. AAP journalist Colin Brinsden reports that criminal law experts are recommending Australian governments release elderly, young and minor offenders from prisons and detention centres to avoid a Covid-19 outbreak. More than 370 legal experts have signed a letter coordinated by the Australian National University and the University of Technology Sydney, which calls for urgent reforms to protect the prison population from the global health pandemic. \u201cAustralian prisons and detention centres will become epicentres for the transmission of Covid-19 if governments don\u2019t act now,\u201d leader of the ANU criminology program Professor Lorana Bartels said in a statement. As my colleague Calla Wahlquist reported last week, there is concern Australian prisons could struggle to control an outbreak of coronavirus in a system that is already overcrowded and under-resourced. Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Professor Brett Sutton, will provide an update on coronavirus at 1.30pm AEDT. The premier of South Australia will provide an update on coronavirus cases later on Saturday, but there have been 50 cases reported in that state to date. AAP reports that South Australia expects the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic to hit late April or early May, though premier Steven Marshall says the modelling is changing constantly. He says work to put the extra beds in place will start on Monday but it\u2019s hoped the extra capacity is never needed if other measures are successful in reducing the extent of the outbreak across SA. \u201cWe need to do two critical things. One is to slow the spread of this disease and to reduce the peak, pushing it as far into the future as possible,\u201d Marshall said on Saturday. \u201cThe second is to increase the hospital capacity in South Australia.\u201d Meanwhile Tasmania has reported its 11th case of the virus, having now closed its borders to non-residents. The national total of positive coronavirus cases is 874 at last count, the health minister says. He adds that 115,000 tests have been carried out. Hunt said that following the prime minister\u2019s calls for people to stop stockpiling, supermarket sales had slowed. After it was revealed on Friday that 2,700 passengers who disembarked a cruise ship in Sydney had been told to self-isolate after three people who were onboard tested positive for Covid-19, the health minister Greg Hunt is being pressed on why passengers from the ship were allowed to disembark given bans on foreign cruise shops from docking in Australia. Hunt says: We made the decision to ban foreign cruise ships. Those returning to Australian ports are returning under strict conditions. We make no apologies for imposing tough restrictions. We have banned foreign cruise ships and we are bringing those home that otherwise would not have a dock. Our ban has meant that what we have allowed is for Australian-based ships to return and allow people to disembark straight into home isolation. We have made clear to New South Wales that the standards that apply in all other states apply in NSW, they are now making sure they apply those rules absolutely. He is asked how many Australians are stranded on cruise ships and overseas. Hunt doesn\u2019t have a number, saying the government is in the process of finding that out. He says: The prime minister gave ample warning that there was a risk flights and capacity to return would not be possible. Nevertheless foreign affairs is continuing to reach out and work with Qantas. As we mentioned in an earlier post, Hunt has also announced a $15.6m package for coronavirus testing and treatment research. The health minister Greg Hunt is giving a press conference in Victoria and said 99% of Covid-19 tests have come back negative. He\u2019s urged local councils to step in to ensure social isolation measures are being observed in public. The overwhelming majority of Australians are doing the right thing. If you are breaking those rules you are putting not only yourselves but others at risk. we need to be our best selves and our most responsible selves. To those small few who are doling the wrong thing, think of others. There are local options that are available and if local authorities are not doing that we will not hesitate either through the Commonwealth or the state to make sure these provisions are enforced. Dr John Boffa, the chief medical officer at the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress and a doctor working in Alice Springs, is concerned about testing availability. In the ACT, chief health officer Dr Kerryn Coleman has announced three more confirmed cases of Covid-19 there. The total number of confirmed cases in the ACT is now nine. In New South Wales shadow health minister Chris Bowen and shadow home affairs minister Kristina Keneally have held a press conference, with Bowen calling for more testing to be carried out across Australia. Countries have been grappling with a worldwide shortage of the swabs. Bowen says: I understand the constraints and limitations on testing but we need to do more. Today we say it must be the formal objective of government policy to have people tested if they are in contact with people who have suffered Covid-19 or have symptoms. People across the country are exhibiting symptoms, worryingly going for a test and being denied because they do not meet criteria. You can read more about Australia\u2019s criteria for testing here, and on Friday the government announced all aged care workers could be tested as well regardless of close contact with a case. Meanwhile Keneally said people in self-isolation who cannot access home delivery groceries are being directed to food banks, which she described as inappropriate. And that is an unacceptable way to address this gap. People who can shop at grocery stores should not be directed to food banks. A food bank is there for the most vulnerable in the community. It is a charity, it is a charity that is there to supply people who are most in need, with food. And the demands on food banks are extraordinary at this time. I spoke with senior officers at a food bank in the last 24-hours who told me that not only are their stocks running low but their supply of volunteers is drying up. This is not an appropriate response. A lot to take in from that press conference in Victoria with the premier Daniel Andrews and treasurer Tim Pallas. In summary: There are 51 new cases in Victoria taking cases in the state to 229. An economic survival package was announced for the state\u2019s businesses including payroll tax refunds and commercial renting relief, plus support for hospitality and tourism. Crown casino is no longer exempt from social distancing rules. And finally, on school closures, the premier had this to say: It remains the advice of both the chief health officer and every other health officer across the country, and the chief medical officer Brendan Murphy, that schools should remain open. That is the health advice. Again, I am in no way criticising parents for being concerned. Being anxious, that is a perfectly natural thing. I again make the point, the consistent and unanimous advice of chief health officers, the experts, is that schools should remain open. We have a week to go until we get to school holidays. I want to take this opportunity to thank you, to thank both as the premier and on behalf of my family, every teacher, every worker in our schools, they are doing a fantastic job. My kids are at school, the chief health officer\u2019s kids are at school, that is the medical advice, that is the advice of experts, that could change. If it does, you will be the first to know. It is unclear whether the revocation of its exemption from coronavirus rules means Melbourne\u2019s Crown casino will have to shut its doors today for the first time since it was forced to close for a few days during anti-World Economic Forum protests in 2000. The casino has been allowed to keep half of its poker machines operating under an exemption from social distancing rules granted by the Victorian chief health officer - a decision that enraged public health officials. Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton may provide more information when he faces the media later today. Closure would be a devastating blow to employment in Melbourne - the group employs at least 6,000 people at the casino, and some 18,500 people in total. Victoria\u2019s decision also puts pressure on the governments of Western Australia, where Crown also has a casino, and New South Wales, where rival Star operates, to follow suit. Crown shares have been in a trading halt since lunchtime on Friday, when the company said it was in \u201cdiscussions\u201d with Sutton over its trading conditions. But this was before prime minister Scott Morrison dramatically beefed up social distancing rules in the afternoon by limiting the number of people inside a venue to one every 4sq m. Crown has been contacted for comment. Reporters have asked the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, to comment on scenes from New South Wales of people congregating at beaches despite social-isolation messages. He responds that while from \u201ctime to time\u201d he has \u201cfallen to giving Sydney a hard time,\u201d he would refrain from doing so on this occasion. He says: Everyone plays their part, and that is not what was occurring on beaches yesterday and in probably lots of other locations in our state and other parts of the country. It is not about one state versus the other. It is one example of people perhaps not taking this as seriously as they should. If you are in any doubt how serious this is, turn your TV on and have a look at what is going on in other parts of the world. People are dying, we are going to get to a very, very bad place when it comes to public health in the weeks and months ahead. It is going to be very challenging. There is no getting around that. But each of us can make that a little easier if we do the right thing now and we keep doing the right thing as our civic duty to ourselves, our families and every single Victorian. Back to Victorian premier Daniel Andrews: This is not a tax cut... this is a refund, money back to businesses that has been paid. It is sitting in the government\u2019s bank account, I\u2019m going to put it in businesses bank accounts so they can have that extra support to make it more likely that they can support their staff and that in turn their staff can support their families. At the press conference this morning announcing Victoria\u2019s economic package detailed below, the state\u2019s treasurer Tim Pallas said it was \u201cthe biggest business support package in the history of this state\u201d. And it has to be, because we are facing t a public health crisis and a business crisis. What we hear from business, we have had many discussions with business leaders over the last couple of weeks, they have told us, particularly small businesses, the problem is around cash flow. What this package is very much aims to do is to make sure we get cash into businesses pockets as quickly as possible. This cash... will go to those 24,000 businesses that employ about 400,000 workers. And they are really at the front end of the economic crisis that is of course a manifestation of the public health crisis that we are attempting to deal with. In real terms this is the biggest support package of any of the states. This morning the Victorian government has announced what it described as a $1.7bn \u201ceconomic survival and jobs package\u201d, which has been developed following discussions at national cabinet. The state government will provide full payroll tax refunds for the 2019-20 financial year to small and medium-sized businesses with payroll of less than $3m. Payments will start being made next week and will save eligible business up to $113,975 a year, with businesses saving an average of $23,000. These businesses employ around 400,000 workers. In a statement the Victorian government said: This assistance is a refund, not a loan. The same businesses will also be able to defer any payroll tax for the first three months of the 2020/21 financial year until 1 January 2021, freeing up a further $83 million in cashflow. Commercial tenants in government buildings can apply for rent relief and 2020 land tax payments will be deferred for eligible small businesses. The government will also pay all outstanding supplier invoices within five business days \u2013 releasing up to $750m. The private sector is being urged to do the same where possible. The government will also waive liquor licensing fees for 2020 for affected venues and small businesses. A $500m Business Support Fund has also been established for hospitality, tourism, accommodation, arts and entertainment, and retail. The government will work with the Victorian Chamber, Australian Hotels Association and Ai Group to administer the fun. Meanwhile a $500m Working for Victoria Fund will be established in consultation with the Victorian Council of Social Services and Victorian Trades Hall Council. The fund will help workers who have lost their jobs find new opportunities, including work cleaning public infrastructure or delivering food. In Victoria the premier Daniel Andrews has announced \u201ca refund back in the accounts of businesses in just a few days time, cash that will be critical to them being able to support their workers and in turn those workers being able to support their families\u201d. He announced a package of three parts including $500m in payroll tax refunds for businesses. Eligible businesses will receive payroll tax for the year to date back, and the final three months of this financial year will be waived. So there will essentially be for those businesses, 24,000 of them, no payroll tax paid this year. That is, businesses up to a payroll of $3m. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern has asked New Zealanders to restrict their movements around the country, and cancel all non-essential domestic travel. Ardern also asked those aged 70 and over, or with a compromised immune system to stay home for the foreseeable future. Those who could work from home should now do so, Ardern said, but reassured Kiwis that essential services such as supermarkets and pharmacies would remain open. There are four alert levels in New Zealand, and the country was currently at stage two. Ardern took a warm and smiley demeanour for her address, in a bid to reassure New Zealanders in \u201cunprecedented times\u201d. Fourteen new cases of the virus were confirmed today, bringing the total number of cases to 53. Two of the cases show no link to overseas travel, meaning community transmission may now be under way. \u201cProtecting New Zealanders from the virus is our number one objective, and we must take decisive action to prevent the worst occurring here,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cNew Zealand is fighting an unprecedented global pandemic. We must fight by going hard and going early with new measures to slow the transmission of the virus.\u201d \u201cThese measures are being taken in the national interest. We know people, business, and sports events will be impacted, but these are short-term disruptions for the overall health of our people and country. \u201cI know many New Zealanders are anxious. The alert system is designed to offer certainty around future action and the ability for people to plan and prepare for any future eventuality. Please be strong, be kind, and unite against COVID-19,\u201d Ardern said. About 2,700 passengers who disembarked a cruise ship in Sydney have been told to self-isolate after three people who were onboard tested positive for Covid-19. Reporter Luke Henriques-Gomes writes: \u201cConfirming the news on Friday, the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said the doctor onboard had conducted 13 tests on the Ruby Princess, which had completed a relatively short cruise around the Pacific to New Zealand. Two passengers who have tested positive are being treated in a Sydney hospital and another who may have contracted the virus made it to Tasmania and is in hospital there. A crew member who tested positive remains on the ship, which is docked off the Australian east coast. Guidelines introduced by the government this week mean people who had arrived from overseas were already required to self-isolate for 14 days. But Hazzard said authorities were now concerned that others may also have contracted the virus and that passengers were unaware there were confirmed cases onboard.\u201d Last Sunday the Australian government banned international cruise ship arrivals for 30 days. Questions are now being asked about why tighter quarantine and screening controls weren\u2019t implemented before passengers disembarked. One passenger in serious condition in hospital. The state\u2019s chief medical officer, Kerry Chant, said on Friday passengers on the ship were considered \u201clow-risk\u201d since it had travelled between Sydney and New Zealand. Dr Gaetan Burgio from the John Curtin School of Medical research at the Australian National University said over 100 human clinical trials are underway against Covid-19. He says: It is possible that some drugs could possibly \u2018cure\u2019 coronavirus but it is too early to tell. We at least know which ones don\u2019t \u2018cure\u2019 coronavirus such as anti HIV drugs. Incoming weeks will give us a better idea of which drugs will be suitable to treat or cure the infection.\u201d Meanwhile, Associate Professor Adam Kamradt-Scott, an expert in the spread and control of infectious diseases at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, has addressed the question of why the mortality rate is apparently higher in Europe than in China. The short answer is that we don\u2019t know just at the moment, he says. What we do know is that there are multiple factors that can influence disease transmission, ranging from geographical considerations and population density to factors such as the extent of intergenerational families living in the same households, a history of being a smoker, etc. It is for this reason that we need to be very careful in extrapolating what we see happening in one country to apply it to our own. Australia\u2019s outbreak of Covid-19 has already been very different from what many other countries have experienced, and that will likely continue to be the case.\u201d Professor Julie Leask, from the University of Sydney and whose research focuses on infectious disease, has addressed the question of how the public should respond to the proliferation of data, graphs and information on the virus on social media. How can people tell what is accurate? She says: Government should give journalists and the public better access to evidence informing their decision making. This could occur with more detailed information about what is underpinning key decisions. Health departments are working hard to provide a great deal of information, so it is not about volume as much as about the kind of information being provided and its relevance. People are clearly crying out for detailed rationales. This is more important than ever as we are at a crucial stage of people starting to shape their views on how this should be managed. Putting the current evidence into that picture will help bring people along. It has been encouraging to see a little more transparency in the last few days. The AHPPC\u2019s online update became much more detailed. Social media gives many a voice. This is a two-edged sword because it democratises access to evidence but also brings confusion with so many apparently expert voices. We all need a bit of humility in recognising that the knowledge about COVID-19 is still emerging and what we think is right now may not be right next week. In any case this will change as government ramps-up the physical distancing measures.\u201d Thanks to the Australian Science Media Centre for compiling these responses. The Australian Medical Association\u2019s South Australia president, Dr Chris Moy, is speaking to ABC News. There has been so much debate as to whether Australia is doing enough to prevent virus spread, with people calling for total lockdowns of all schools, workplaces and venues. On Friday, the prime minister flagged that certain areas of the country that are current hotspots for the virus may be locked down, though those suburbs have not been announced yet. However, Moy said he believes Australia is preparing well, telling the ABC: I think we have done well in Australia, even compared to other countries. You may not feel that sometimes, because everyone is a little bit of frazzled and doctors are human too. You\u2019re sometimes getting different messages from doctors. I think we\u2019re going to have to deal with a society that\u2019s having to come to terms with the fact there\u2019s big changes... there\u2019s a slight mismatch of resources versus need. What I say to you, if the community can hang with us, all the doctors out there, all the nurses out there, trying to do our best, we\u2019re in a [good] position. And I hope very much we see a united front from doctors and nurses in confronting what is about to happen. He said while questions had been asked about whether enough tests were being carried out as the world faces a shortage of swabs, Australia was still carrying out more widespread testing than many other countries. Testing is one half of the equation and the community needs to do its part, including social distancing and good hygiene. That\u2019s what has broken the back of this in the countries that have succeeded in controlling Covid-19. Correction: this post previously incorrectly quoted Moy as saying South Australia has carried out more tests than the US. Australia as a whole has carried out more tests to date than the US. We have been duped. While lock-downs around the world have seen reports of cleaner water and air, and a return of birdlife and fish, some people have taken those reports to the extreme, with fake reports of elephants and dolphins returning spreading on social media. Natasha Daly has written this excellent report for National Geographic about what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not. My colleague Josh Taylor has written a handy summary of the latest developments in Australia over the past 24 hours or so. A ban on non-citizens and non-residents entering Australia began at 9pm on Friday night The restrictions on gatherings indoors were further tightened, so that in addition to having no more than 100 people, there now has to be four square metres around each person Due to the ongoing uncertainty, the federal budget will now be held in October, not in May as originally planned The government is saying people shouldn\u2019t travel domestically unless they absolutely need to. A 36-year-old Australian man with Covid-19 has died in Iceland. Read the full list here. My colleague Mick McGowan has spoken to teachers about how they are feeling as Australia shuts down around them while schools remain open. He writes: \u201cTeachers who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity this week say they are \u201cfrustrated, angry and anxious\u201d at what they feel is a lack of concern for their wellbeing as they continue to be asked to show up to work during an almost total shutdown of society in response to the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cBoth the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, argue school closures could exacerbate the spread of the virus because students would mix more widely in the community, as well as force frontline healthcare workers to stay home to care for their children.\u201d Meanwhile here is an explainer about why Australian schools are yet to close. Of course, this may change as the pandemic evolves. Some parents are students are trying hard to show their thanks to their teachers, with people reporting lovely messages such as these: US president Donald Trump has thrown another tantrum. In some happier news, here is a lovely story about how nature is returning to Venice, where strict rules of self-confinement have seen ducks return to the canals. The president of the Australian Medical Association\u2019s NSW branch, Dr Kean-Seng Lim, has issued a statement urging people in the state to stay at home... no doubt prompted by images such as this one: Lim said on Saturday morning: The novel coronavirus is something we need to take seriously but not panic or be complacent about. That said, we are at a stage now where we need to be doing everything we can to slow the transmission of this highly contagious virus. So, with that in mind, if you can stay home, please stay home. As doctors, it\u2019s distressing to still see people undertaking non-essential recreational activities. The time for that is passed \u2013 it\u2019s time to stay home. The more people who practise the physical distancing that has been requested, the slower the virus will spread, and there will be less overall risk for health workers like me, who have to go to work. This is especially important if you are in an at-risk group or have close contact with people in an at-risk group. If you\u2019re feeling sick, don\u2019t visit elderly relatives, for instance. If you have been asked to self-isolate or otherwise meet criteria for self-isolation because of risk of infection with COVID-19, then you definitely need to stay home.\u201d A couple of press conferences coming up in the next few hours in Australia, where cases have reached 877 including 7 deaths - one in Western Australia, and six in New South Wales. The federal health minister Greg Hunt will give an update in a couple of hours at 11.30am AEDT, following announcements that the government will invest more than $2.6m in diagnostics research at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity to tackle the novel coronavirus. The government has allocated $13m from the $2.4bn Coronavirus National Health Plan to fast-track treatment and vaccine research. Meanwhile the Victorian premier Daniel Andrews will make an announcement with the state\u2019s premier in just over an hour\u2019s time, at 10am. Victoria is the only Australian jurisdiction yet to announce a stimulus package, though last week Andrews, flagged \u201csurvival payments\u201d to come. Deaths due to Covid-19 have now exceeded 11,000 globally. A quick wrap up of the deaths and infections recently reported from around the world: At least 11 people have died from the coronavirus outbreak in Brazil, up from seven on Thursday. The death toll in Turkey due to the coronavirus has risen to nine, and two people have died in the United Arab Emirates. Israel has reported 705 cases of coronavirus, and also its first death. The number of confirmed cases in Costa Rica has reached 113, including two deaths. Coronavirus cases in Paris and its suburbs now account for about a quarter of the 11,000 cases across France, and has about 250 now in intensive care, up from just 50 five days ago. The death toll in all France as of Friday evening stood at 450. AAP photographer John Fotiadis went to Bondi yesterday. New South Wales is grappling with more cases of the virus than any other state or territory and has recorded six out of the seven Australian deaths. Hours after Australia\u2019s prime minister Scott Morrison announced venues would only be able to accommodate one person for every four square metres of floor space, and with restrictions already in place banning outdoor mass gatherings, images spread on social media on Friday night of Australians enjoying the beach and bars in Bondi. \u2018Bondi\u2019 began to trend on Twitter as users questioned the complacency of people some to the pandemic unfolding. People also crowded beaches at Manly, also in New South Wales. It makes you wonder how Australia would respond to lockdowns and closures of schools. Would kids actually stay home, or would it be too tough an ask longterm? The past few days should have been a wake-up call for those still going about life as normally as possible. At the beginning of last week, many Australians were still commuting and socialising at restaurants and bars while the country gradually shut down around them, bans on mass outdoor gatherings took effect and the prime minister ordered \u201cno more handshakes\u201d. By Friday it was clear life for the next few months would be drastically changed. Tasmania effectively closed its borders. Australians overseas rushed home and many were left stranded as travel restrictions tightened. As always with this virus, a lot has happened in just a short period of time. In the US, three states - California, New York and Illinois - ordered all residents to stay home except for essential activities. US president Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to speed up the production of medical supplies. He also lashed out at reporters. Asked by a reporter about what he had to say to Americans who are scared about the spread, Trump responded: \u201cI say that you\u2019re a terrible reporter\u201d. \u201cThe American people are looking for answers, and they\u2019re looking for hope,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s really bad reporting.\u201d The US-Mexico border is also closing to all non-essential travel. More than 200 people have died from the virus in the US. In the UK, prime minister Boris Johnston announced cafes, bars, and restaurants are to close as soon as possible and are not to open tomorrow. He said they can provide takeaway services. He also ordered nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres to close. There, deaths have reached 177. Italy has announced 627 more coronavirus deaths, the biggest day-to-day increase in the country\u2019s epidemic to date. More than a quarter of a million cases have been detected in 161 countries and territories around the world. New Zealand recorded its biggest single-day increase of Covid-19 cases, with 11 new positive tests, taking the country\u2019s total to 39. Meanwhile in Australia, national cabinet signed off on new restrictions for internal gatherings and remote communities, financial help for the aged care sector, and an order for Australians to reconsider all \u201cunnecessary travel\u201d. Meanwhile school teachers are expressing distress, saying social distancing measures are impossible in classrooms, many of them struggling to source sanitiser and tissues.

How we finance medical care, however, is also critical. On the most basic level, containing the coronavirus will require those infected to seek medical care, so that they can be diagnosed and isolated. Fear of devastating ER or hospital bills, however, could keep some home \u2013 or at work. As a Taiwan government spokeswoman, lauding her country\u2019s single-payer system for its successful containment of Covid-19, told <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/what-taiwan-can-teach-world-fighting-coronavirus-n1153826\">NBC News</a>, \u201cTaiwan\u2019s health insurance lets everyone not be afraid to go to the hospital.

It\u2019s hence inadequate, given the predicted looming surge in hospitalizations from Covid-19 pneumonia. After all, 30 million Americans are uninsured \u2013 a number that will surely grow as the economy tanks and millions or tens of millions of Americans lose their jobs. Even more are underinsured, and for these individuals, co-pays and deductibles will only become more unaffordable as disposable income falls and savings dwindle. For both groups, medical bills for an intensive care unit (ICU) stay for Covid-19 could be devastating. People, of course, will also not stop having heart attacks, cancer or traffic accidents during this outbreak \u2013 on the contrary, medical needs are likely to rise in the face of a recession, as unemployment and misery takes its toll on the nation\u2019s health. Financial ruin from medical costs \u2013 whether it stems from Covid-19 pneumonia or the looming Covid-19 recession \u2013 is financial ruin all the same, and will compound the harm of the epidemic.</p> <p>But there\u2019s more to it than that. We need single-payer not only to protect us from healthcare costs, but to transform our healthcare infrastructure. In recent weeks, you may have heard that the US, despite our high healthcare spending, has fewer hospital beds per capita than many other wealthy nations. You may have also heard in recent years about an epidemic of hospital closures in poorly served rural areas, or the <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/hahnemann-hospital-medicare-for-all/\">2019 closure</a> of a major academic safety-net hospital in Philadelphia.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson took the extraordinary step of ordering pubs, clubs and restaurants across the UK to close on Friday, and announced an unprecedented wage-support scheme to try to prevent a tsunami of job losses. Announcing the decision in the fight against the coronavirus, the prime minister said that he realised it went against what he called \u201cthe inalienable free-born right of people born in England to go to the pub\u201d. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, revealed that the taxpayer would meet 80% of the wage costs of workers \u201cfurloughed\u201d, or temporarily sent home, by firms hit by the crisis. Johnson had come under increasing pressure to take more stringent action as social distancing measures announced on Monday \u2013 including the recommendation to avoid all unnecessary social contact \u2013 were being flouted. The decision to order the nationwide shutdown was only finally decided at an afternoon meeting of Cobra, the government\u2019s crisis committee, which ended shortly before the prime minister made his dramatic announcement. One issue thrashed out at the meeting was when it should come into place, with several voices \u2013 including that of the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and others \u2013 urging that it should come in on Friday evening and not the following day. Earlier on Friday, the government had decided that venues in London should be ordered to close. By early afternoon, emerging scientific evidence made crisis planners believe it had to be a nationwide shutdown. Johnson said that with the agreement of the three devolved governments, \u201cwe are telling \u2013 telling \u2013 cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants to close tonight, as soon as they reasonably can, and not open tomorrow\u201d. They would be allowed to sell takeaway food and drink, he added. The same instruction was being given to nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres, Johnson added. The new social distancing measures would be reviewed every month to see if any could be relaxed. The announcement came at 5pm, just as hundreds of thousands of people were enjoying post-work pints. Some pubs said they would close \u2013 but others showed no signs of heeding the instruction. Police who may have been expected to enforce a ban backed by law, merely said there would remind any businesses staying open of what the government had wanted. A spokesperson for National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, representing all forces in England and Wales, said: \u201cWe expect business owners will want to support the measures designed keep us all safe. \u201cWe will police as normal. If officers see specified businesses open, they will remind them of the government advice.\u201d The government is not planning to take specific action to enforce the closures initially, believing a direct instruction from the prime minister should be enough to convince almost all venues to shut their doors. But ministers are prepared to take more action next week through a crackdown on licensing conditions, if necessary. Johnson said the scientific advice suggested a 75% compliance rate with the social distancing measures was necessary to achieve the desired effect. He praised everyone who had heeded the government\u2019s advice but conceded not enough people had done so thus far. The UK death toll from coronavirus rose on Friday to 177, from 144 the previous day, with nearly 4,000 people testing positive. Johnson, addressing the daily Downing Street press conference, was flanked by Sunak, who said funds would be available to pay 80% of workers\u2019 wages up to a value of \u00a32,500 a month, and thereby prevent firms from having to make staff redundant. Since Monday\u2019s announcement, even many Conservative MPs, including the former business secretary Greg Clark, had complained that many companies had little choice but to lay off thousands of staff as their business dried up overnight. On Tuesday, Sunak announced a big-ticket package of loans and other business support measures, including \u00a3330m of taxpayer-backed loans, but Clark and others complained that they gave little disincentive for firms to lay off workers. Friday\u2019s announcement, which was negotiated with business groups and trades unions, and included increases in universal credit and other benefits, marked the third multibillion-pound financial commitment the chancellor has made in 10 days. The pubs closure appeared to be the latest example of the government scrambling to catch up with events. A ban on mass gatherings was announced last Friday after scores of fixtures and concerts had been cancelled; and nationwide schools closures were confirmed on Wednesday, after thousands of teachers and students had already taken the decision to remain at home. The shutdown of social venues had been expected to cover only London, and the fear of a \u201clockdown\u201d appears to have been fuelling panic-buying of food and other commodities in the capital. But Johnson said he had consulted with the devolved nations, and the measures would be imposed nationwide.

I hope it\u2019s proved a decent distraction from the general horrors of existence. A win for Melbourne City in the W-League grand final brings that season to an end, while the Demons, Dockers and Kangaroos progressed to the second week of finals in the AFLW. The men\u2019s competitions ticked on with their competitions, how long they\u2019ll continue, we don\u2019t know, but for now the general assumption from competition organisers seems to be that the seasons will play out. </p> <p>Stay safe everyone, keep washing your hands, stay in your houses and hopefully we all get through this together (while obviously staying very separate).</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e75f34a8f08e0999e6b795f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-21T11:03:49.595Z\">11.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">AFL: GWS beat Geelong 17.3 (105) to 11.17 (73)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A much higher scoring match than the Port and Suns game, but equally dominated by one side. The Cats put up a bit of a fight at times throughout the game, but the Giants remained in control and punished any mistakes the Cats made. Toby Greene and Harry Perryman picked up four goals each, while Jacob Hopper was everywhere with 22 disposals and seven marks to his name. An impressive start to the season from the Giants, looking to make up for the disappointment of the 2019 grand final.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AFL/status/1241317162469322754\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Career goals = 4\ufe0f\u20e3<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AFLGIANTSCats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AFLGIANTSCats</a> goals = 4\ufe0f\u20e3<br><br>In the blink of an eye, Harry Perryman has doubled his career goal tally \ud83d\ude4c <a href=\"https://t.co/1NTzWW3ZW8\">pic.twitter.com/1NTzWW3ZW8</a></p>&mdash; AFL (@AFL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AFL/status/1241317162469322754?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 21, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e75f13c8f08e0999e6b7959\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-21T10:57:42.786Z\">10.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">AFL: Port Adelaide beat Gold Coast 10.16 (76) to 4.5 (29)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This one looked like a fait accompli by the end of the first quarter and things kept on tracking that way throughout. Port played a grinding style of match that wore their opponents down and didn\u2019t ease up the pressure at any point. It wasn\u2019t high scoring, but they kept possession and they scored when they needed to to ensure the pressure never came back on them. Todd Marshall and Mitchell Georgiades both finished with two goals for the match and Tom Rockliff was much more a rock than a cliff, dominant with 26 disposals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AFL/status/1241317770383331328\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">FT: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PAFC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@PAFC</a> 10.16 (76) defeats <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GoldCoastSUNS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GoldCoastSUNS</a> 4.5 (29).<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AFLSunsPower?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AFLSunsPower</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/JO6MpAKMfu\">pic.twitter.com/JO6MpAKMfu</a></p>&mdash; AFL (@AFL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AFL/status/1241317770383331328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 21, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e75eec98f08e0999e6b7947\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-21T10:47:58.961Z\">10.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>AFLW: </strong>While we\u2019re waiting for these last couple of games to end that seem pretty much like a done deal (wait for that to come back and bite me it might be a good time to read this story from Kasey Symons on the shortened AFLW season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/17/aflw-community-rallies-in-face-of-coronavirus-impacted-season\">AFLW community rallies in face of coronavirus-impacted season | Kasey Symons</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e75ec758f08a08573fbedb6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-21T10:33:53.184Z\">10.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>AFL: GWS lead Geelong 13.3 (81) to 8.7 (55)</strong></p> <p>The Giants extended their lead this quarter, building on their lead from half-time.

Port are doing a good job playing the possession game, just starving the Suns of the ball and keeping their own score ticking along.

It is believed players are expected to be told to avoid venues where they can come into contact with the public like pubs, restaurants and shopping centres.</p> <p>\u201cOur coaches are completely respectful of the requirements and directives to keep the game moving and our coaches are keen to continue to lead and support with other key leaders in clubs,\u201d Rugby League Coaches Association CEO Kelly Egan said in a statement on Saturday.<br></p> <p>However, Bennett admitted he was not sure how the measures on players could be policed. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure about the self-isolation, in terms of we have to go shopping, we have to go to shops ... it\u2019s probably not the right word to use, isolation,\u201d Bennett said after the Rabbitohs\u2019 22-18 round two loss to Brisbane. \u201cIf I\u2019ve got to go to the shops tomorrow and buy something I\u2019m going to go, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. They are young men, and if they (meet up with) a mate or something they might think that\u2019s not too bad but I\u2019m not going to be the policeman on it. They\u2019ve been told what the ramifications are. I don\u2019t know if sitting home all weekend, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll do that, I couldn\u2019t guarantee you that.\u201d</p> <p>However, Parramatta coach Brad Arthur was confident players would do the right thing in order to keep the NRL running for as long as they can amid the pandemic.<br></p> <p>\u201cThey (players) know how important it is to the game, we commend the NRL for the stance they have taken,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have to play our part which is just not on the field but it is also doing as much as we can to isolate ourselves for the safety of everyone but also to continue for the game to run.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand the importance of not only what we can do on the field but taking it (pandemic threat) serious to keep everyone rolling along. At the end of the day we get the opportunity to still continue to do what we love.

      "bodyText": "Well that ends our strange night of sport. I hope it\u2019s proved a decent distraction from the general horrors of existence. A win for Melbourne City in the W-League grand final brings that season to an end, while the Demons, Dockers and Kangaroos progressed to the second week of finals in the AFLW. The men\u2019s competitions ticked on with their competitions, how long they\u2019ll continue, we don\u2019t know, but for now the general assumption from competition organisers seems to be that the seasons will play out. Stay safe everyone, keep washing your hands, stay in your houses and hopefully we all get through this together (while obviously staying very separate). A much higher scoring match than the Port and Suns game, but equally dominated by one side. The Cats put up a bit of a fight at times throughout the game, but the Giants remained in control and punished any mistakes the Cats made. Toby Greene and Harry Perryman picked up four goals each, while Jacob Hopper was everywhere with 22 disposals and seven marks to his name. An impressive start to the season from the Giants, looking to make up for the disappointment of the 2019 grand final. This one looked like a fait accompli by the end of the first quarter and things kept on tracking that way throughout. Port played a grinding style of match that wore their opponents down and didn\u2019t ease up the pressure at any point. It wasn\u2019t high scoring, but they kept possession and they scored when they needed to to ensure the pressure never came back on them. Todd Marshall and Mitchell Georgiades both finished with two goals for the match and Tom Rockliff was much more a rock than a cliff, dominant with 26 disposals. AFLW: While we\u2019re waiting for these last couple of games to end that seem pretty much like a done deal (wait for that to come back and bite me it might be a good time to read this story from Kasey Symons on the shortened AFLW season. AFL: GWS lead Geelong 13.3 (81) to 8.7 (55) The Giants extended their lead this quarter, building on their lead from half-time. The Cats were able to step up the pressure mid-way through the quarter, but a late goal from Jeremy Cameron took the wind out their sails and the Giants headed into the break with the momentum. Harry Perryman managed his third goal for the game, he has looked very strong in front of the posts. AFL: Port Adelaide lead Gold Coast 9.9 (63) 4.5 (29) at three-quarter time The Suns have managed to make a tiny dent in this deficit, but they aren\u2019t getting nearly close enough. Port are doing a good job playing the possession game, just starving the Suns of the ball and keeping their own score ticking along. Plenty of scoring opportunities across the board for Port, sharing the duties around between plenty of players and making it tough for the Suns to work out who to shut down. Plenty of fans showing their love for the team from afar as well. A late goal from Kwame Yeboah saved the Wanderers from a loss in the Sydney derby. A fairly easy goal for Yeboah, who caught a deflection from a Simon Cox kick that sailed past the keeper for a goal. The Wanderers had a slight edge in possession, but it was pretty even all over the park, a draw seems like the right result for a match that was so tight. Finally a try was scored in the 59th minute - Cronulla\u2019s Billy Magoulias was the one to break the drought, reading a kick through the line to run on to score. But then Melbourne hit back through Tui Kamikamica just two minutes later to lock the scores up again. Cameron Smith nailed a penalty goal with three minutes to play, after Cam Munster was stripped of the ball in a two on one tackle and that was enough to secure the win for the Storm. Women\u2019s sport: A good piece from Madeleine Pape during the week on how the pandemic puts a halt to the momentum of the women\u2019s sport movement across the world. If you\u2019re looking for a bit more sport to fill the void with so much cancelled, English cricket commentator Mark Church is re-enacting some commentary from classic cricket matches with his family members - some more enthusiastic participants than others. This one with his young daughter Isabelle on the famous Gatting ball is a classic. AFL: GWS leads Geelong 9.1 (55) to 6.6 (42) at half-time A solid quarter from the Giants, who didn\u2019t let themselves panic when the Cats closed the gap late in the first quarter. They pulled their lead back out and continued to put the pressure on in defence and attack to ensure the Cats had to work hard for every possession. Stephen Coniglio, Daniel Lloyd and Harry Perryman each have two for the Giants, who remain very accurate on goal. AFL: Port Adelaide lead Gold Coast 9.6 (60) to 3.2 (20) at half-time Port have kept on building on their lead in this quarter and the poor old Suns haven\u2019t been in the match for some time. Todd Marshall and Steven Motlop each managed a second goal, as Port were able to score freely all quarter. Touk Miller is working hard for the Suns, with 14 disposals for the half, but there\u2019s not enough pressure being applied to slow this Port side down at the moment. Cricket: Some strong and sensible messaging from Usman Khawaja today on Twitter - urging people to take Covid-19 seriously. Cricket Australia have led from the front, as they often do in difficult situations, immediately cancelling their competitions and urging community cricket to follow suit. NRL: Cronulla lead Melbourne 4-2 at half-time Another low scoring game in the NRL, with only three penalty goals to trouble the scorers in the first half. It was scrappy and defence-heavy with both teams denying the other chances at the line. Cronulla struggled to put their attack together, with plenty of opportunities going to ground. A-League: Wanderers 0-1 Sydney FC at half-time A good first half from the Sky Blue, who found the net through Adam Le Fondre in the 35th minute. It was set up through a great pass from Milos Ninkovic, who split the defence for a shot from Kosta Barbarouses that rebounded to Le Fondre for the goal. AFL: GWS lead Geelong 5.0 (30) to 4.2 (26) Kind of the opposite pattern going on in this one, the Giants looked like they\u2019d blow this one out early, then the Cats came back late in the quarter to bring the scores closer together. Sensational kicking from GWS, who have been right on target with all five of their goals. Daniel Lloyd has two for the orange and grey, while the Cats have shared their four goals around. Lachie Whitfield is also looking in good form for the Giants, with 10 disposals for the quarter. AFL: Port Adelaide lead Gold Coast 4.2 (26) to 1.1 (7) at quarter time This was looking like a fairly close one up on the Gold Coast, but Port stamped their dominance on the match in the last few minutes of the quarter. Mitchell Georgiades, Steven Motlop, Brad Ebert and Todd Marshall have the goals for Port, while Ben King snagged one for the Suns. AFL: Another great read from during the week, this time from Scott Heinrich on the struggles the AFL faces in this season like no other. The sport of Australian football...will survive Covid-19. But the road to liberation will be a rocky one littered with disruption, insecurity and financial hardship. The 2020 season will forever have an accompanying asterisk in the annals of the game.\u201d A-League: Well the Sydney FC v Wanderers game is underway (still 0-0 for now) and as we\u2019ve already discussed, it\u2019s been a strange old week in Australian sport and the A-League is no exception. David Squires sums it up in his usual style, reflecting on playing football amidst a pandemic. Well I wasn\u2019t far wrong in my prediction that we might see the first crowdless golden point game! The match stayed neck and neck throughout, with a penalty goal from Reuben Garrick sending the Eagles ahead in the 63rd minute, before the Roosters were also given a penalty goal in the 67th minute. If the referees were asking \u2018How\u2019s Trent?\u2019 tonight they would have been told that he was feeling quite even tempered. Daly Cherry-Evans broke the deadlock in the 76th minute with a field goal and Sea Eagles were able to hold out from there. A sensational effort from prop Addin Fonua-Blake with 27 tackles and 194 metres gained for the match. Although the scoreline didn\u2019t show a huge win, for the most part it looked convincing from the Swans and they will be happy to walk away with the points to start the season. A late goal from the Crows made things very interesting with just over a minute remaining, but a good opportunity from Taylor Walker to go ahead drifted to the right for a behind and Sydney held on for the win. Isaac Heeney almost bagged his fifth goal for the match, but only managed a behind in the last quarter - still a sensational effort from the midfielder. The Swans song sounds quite haunting echoing around the empty ground as the players go back to their \u2018social distancing\u2019 measures of elbow bumping after spending all game falling all over each other. AFL: A good summary from Jonathan Howcroft during the week on the opening round of the AFL - a very different opening round to usual. NRL: Meanwhile, while people all over Australia and the world are losing their jobs, their freedom of movement and their lives, Wayne Bennett comes out with the frankly baffling claim that he won\u2019t be policing the isolation policy that the NRL has put in place. AAP has more. Bennett won\u2019t police NRL isolation policy While NRL coaches have put on a united front backing a self-isolation policy for players amid the coronavirus pandemic, South Sydney mentor Wayne Bennett says he can\u2019t guarantee his players will follow the measures. Coaches have thrown their support behind introducing radical safety measures that are still being finalised by the NRL and union officials in a bid to protect the players and keep the competition running. It is believed players are expected to be told to avoid venues where they can come into contact with the public like pubs, restaurants and shopping centres. \u201cOur coaches are completely respectful of the requirements and directives to keep the game moving and our coaches are keen to continue to lead and support with other key leaders in clubs,\u201d Rugby League Coaches Association CEO Kelly Egan said in a statement on Saturday. However, Bennett admitted he was not sure how the measures on players could be policed. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure about the self-isolation, in terms of we have to go shopping, we have to go to shops ... it\u2019s probably not the right word to use, isolation,\u201d Bennett said after the Rabbitohs\u2019 22-18 round two loss to Brisbane. \u201cIf I\u2019ve got to go to the shops tomorrow and buy something I\u2019m going to go, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. They are young men, and if they (meet up with) a mate or something they might think that\u2019s not too bad but I\u2019m not going to be the policeman on it. They\u2019ve been told what the ramifications are. I don\u2019t know if sitting home all weekend, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll do that, I couldn\u2019t guarantee you that.\u201d However, Parramatta coach Brad Arthur was confident players would do the right thing in order to keep the NRL running for as long as they can amid the pandemic. \u201cThey (players) know how important it is to the game, we commend the NRL for the stance they have taken,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have to play our part which is just not on the field but it is also doing as much as we can to isolate ourselves for the safety of everyone but also to continue for the game to run. \u201cWe understand the importance of not only what we can do on the field but taking it (pandemic threat) serious to keep everyone rolling along. At the end of the day we get the opportunity to still continue to do what we love. For a lot of people that has been taken away - we are the lucky ones.\u201d AFL: Sydney leads Adelaide 11.4 (70) to 9.2 (56) at three-quarter time Not much time left in this one in Adelaide - the Swans are looking in control for now. Issac Heeney has been on fire for Sydney, with four goals in the first three quarters. Adelaide are struggling to keep the pressure on at the moment, with the Swans allowed a bit too much space to do as they please. They will need to tighten up considerably in the fourth quarter to have a chance at taking this match. NRL: Roosters 6-6 Sea Eagles at half time This game is being played at Leichhardt Oval for some reason, which is quite convenient for the people who live in the surrounding houses and can avoid the lockout by just watching over their back fences. The Roosters started off the scoring with a penalty goal, the Eagles quickly reciprocated, then each team scored an unconverted try. Could they be heading for the first no-crowd golden point match? Is that a useful thing to be first at? So many questions. NRL: In the first NRL game of the day, the Raiders and Warriors battled it out for some time to see who could play worse and the Warriors were ultimately the winners of that contest. Unfortunately it seems the NRL gives the points to the team that\u2019s the least terrible and in that regard, the Raiders were the technical \u2018winners of the game\u2019 with a 20-6 victory. Things are tough for the Warriors at the moment, with Australia and New Zealand\u2019s borders now closed, they must remain in Australia for the duration of the competition or the border closure. How long it continues, we can\u2019t predict, but for now most players are away from their families and presumably doing it pretty tough. AFL: A close one also in the first AFL game of the day, with Essendon beating Fremantle 9.9 (63) to 8.9 (57). Jacob Townsend scored three goals for the Bombers, while Dylan Shiel did a power of work to finish with 35 disposals and five marks. Time to run through some results from earlier today! There has been plenty happening, between the AFLW finals, AFL round one, NRL round two and some A-League to come later tonight. First to the other AFLW semis, they were two very tight matches that came down to the final minutes of the games. Collingwood fought hard and stayed close all game, but ultimately couldn\u2019t overcome the Kangaroos, who held on for a two point win, 5.4 (34) to 5.2 (32). In the other game, the Giants were in control all match, but Melbourne defied the odds with a couple of sensational late goals to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. They triumphed 4.5 (26) to 3.8 (26). After a couple of close games in the AFLW semis today, this one felt a bit flat, an easy 70 point win to the Dockers, who have been the form side of the competition so far. Sabreena Duffy was in the points, with three goals for the match, while Kiara Bowers with 14 tackles and 22 disposals to her name was one of the Dockers\u2019 hardest working. A strange grand final, but one Melbourne City were happy to celebrate regardless. Just the one goal was scored in the match - during the first half - but it was enough to secure the win for the home team. You can re-live the match through Richard Parkin\u2019s live blog, or enjoy Ella Reilly\u2019s match report. Or do both, I won\u2019t stop you! On a weekend when Australian sport tries to pretend that social distancing only counts before and after the whistle blows, here is Sportwatch. While the rest of the world discovers AFL and NRL and gets really into the A-League and W-League, we keep on pretending that things are semi-normal and watch a whole bunch of sport in a whole bunch of empty stadiums. So, let\u2019s go!",

The virus\u2019s spread was then accelerated by shortages of medicines and equipment, wrought at least in part by US sanctions.</p> <p>By Thursday, a health official announced that one Iranian was dying of the virus <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavirus-iran-health-minister-death-toll-rises-covid-19\">every </a><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavirus-iran-health-minister-death-toll-rises-covid-19\">10 minutes</a>. Social media platforms reverberated with images of outdoor funerals, black-clad mourners standing in calibrated distances apart.</p> <p>The crisis has touched most corners of the country, but it is most severely impacting the poor and working class. While it is older men who are dying in highest numbers, the economic impact especially hurts women, who are most liable to lose work, and shoulder increased duties, looking after sick relatives and children staying home from school. Iranians\u2019 purchasing power has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-48119109\">plummeted in the past two years</a>, as the mismanaged economy shuddered through Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/may/08/iran-nuclear-deal-donald-trump-latest-live-updates\">withdrawal from the nuclear deal</a> and the reimposition of US sanctions. As Nahid, a women\u2019s rights activist, put it: \u201cWhen people met this virus, their nutrition was already poorer, their immune systems were weakened, many were already unable to afford health care.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-middle-iran-denies-cover-up-qom-refugees\">Qom is where the coronavirus first spread</a>. The city\u2019s MP warned in late February that a virus was killing people in his city, but officials publicly downplayed its gravity. For several fraught days, the government\u2019s position appeared muddled and uncertain, but as senior politicians fell ill, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addressed the nation on national television, thanking frontline medical workers for their efforts in fighting the coronavirus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"027f3016d207577458da2b4876360958031690d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/027f3016d207577458da2b4876360958031690d7/0_174_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grand bazar, Tehran\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Stores across the country still heave with goods; this self-sufficiency, borne of years of isolation, now works to Iran\u2019s advantage.\u2019 Grand bazar, Tehran</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wana News Agency/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since then, the government\u2019s response has shifted palpably, somewhat easing the panic and mistrust. Outspoken local officials provide regular numbers on the dead and infected, and most have set up roadblocks to prevent heedless holiday travellers from entering their cities. Airlines have cut most domestic flights. Despite these interruptions, stores across the country heave with goods; the vast majority of products Iranians consume are domestically produced. This self-sufficiency, borne of years of isolation, now works to Iran\u2019s advantage.</p> <p>In Qom itself, a movement of grassroots mobilisation is now in full swing. The city\u2019s itinerant population of seminarians and traders has left, and the citizens of Qom remain, banding together with a resigned solidarity. Several volunteer aid groups have emerged, and now organise under a central hub; together they disinfect streets in crowded areas, distribute food to poorer or sick families, and offer relief shifts to hospital cleaners and mortuaries. \u201cBasically people saw that what the government warned \u2013 that if you come out of your home, you\u2019ll die \u2013 is coming to pass,\u201d said Seyed Ali Pourtabatabai, a journalist based in Qom. \u201cThe fear of death, the fear of being next or being responsible for others death by doing nothing, this has made people think they better help.\u201d</p> <p>Recent days have also seen a surge of grassroots efforts by women\u2019s activists, who are channelling their networks and organising experience to offer health advice, especially to rural areas. Setareh, a women\u2019s rights activist from Tehran who moved back to her provincial town last year, spends hours visiting shopkeepers to brief them on hygiene practices, distributing tongs and plastic gloves. \u201cThey\u2019re so thankful when we explain things to them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The harm inflicted on especially poor pockets of south Tehran, where drug addiction is rampant and many women are heads of households, has been devastating. In these areas, families occupy cramped informal dwellings, and just barely survive by peddling goods on the metro \u2013 work that is now banished to stop contagion. Men tend to work as day labourers, pulling trolleys of goods to the bazaar, and are now out of work, as trade is curtailed. Mary, a women\u2019s rights activist whose organisation delivers food and medicine to these families door-to-door, says the mood is bleak. Many have sick relatives at home and cannot leave to buy the food they cannot afford. \u201cThese people we serve, they faced a multitude of problems before, but now it is a hundred times worse. It\u2019s no longer a matter of going hungry; now those who are poor, they will die.\u201d</p> <p>Well-heeled Iranians, like their counterparts globally, can more or less afford to protect themselves. Banks in north Tehran dole out hand sanitiser at the door and caution customers to maintain a metre\u2019s distance. With intensive care wards full, the affluent buy oxygen tanks for their homes. Sohrab, an environmental activist, recounts visiting a luxury mall in north Tehran, where health workers took temperatures at the door, and turned away anyone who looked working class, without explanation.</p> <p>Medical charities that aid other groups are struggling. Charities and private sector groups are banding together to raise funds to build clinics and purchase equipment and supplies from China. But the sanctions are making even this hard. \u201cCharities are having a hard time moving money,\u201d says Sharif Nezam-Mafi, who heads the <a href=\"http://iransuisse.com/\">Iran</a><a href=\"http://iransuisse.com/\"> Swiss Chamber of Commerce</a> and is involved with one such effort, <a href=\"http://www.nafas.org/\">Nafas</a>. \u201cEverything that is getting into Iran is finding its way through loopholes, not the formal humanitarian channels. It\u2019s as though they are going out of their way to make it harder.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/uk-presses-us-to-ease-iran-sanctions-to-help-fight-coronavirus\">Suspending sanctions</a> during this pandemic should not be seen as a troubling or even monumental thing to do. Proponents of sanctions in the US administration insist that only extreme pressure will bring about changes in Iranian policy \u2013 but we are in different times now. Controlling the virus would not be a favour to the Iranian government, but to Iranians themselves \u2013 and indeed, to the rest of the world.</p> <p>\u2022 Azadeh Moaveni directs the Gender and Conflict Project at the <a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/\">International Crisis Group</a>.

While it is older men who are dying in highest numbers, the economic impact especially hurts women, who are most liable to lose work, and shoulder increased duties, looking after sick relatives and children staying home from school. Iranians\u2019 purchasing power has plummeted in the past two years, as the mismanaged economy shuddered through Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the nuclear deal and the reimposition of US sanctions. As Nahid, a women\u2019s rights activist, put it: \u201cWhen people met this virus, their nutrition was already poorer, their immune systems were weakened, many were already unable to afford health care.\u201d Qom is where the coronavirus first spread. The city\u2019s MP warned in late February that a virus was killing people in his city, but officials publicly downplayed its gravity. For several fraught days, the government\u2019s position appeared muddled and uncertain, but as senior politicians fell ill, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addressed the nation on national television, thanking frontline medical workers for their efforts in fighting the coronavirus. Since then, the government\u2019s response has shifted palpably, somewhat easing the panic and mistrust. Outspoken local officials provide regular numbers on the dead and infected, and most have set up roadblocks to prevent heedless holiday travellers from entering their cities. Airlines have cut most domestic flights. Despite these interruptions, stores across the country heave with goods; the vast majority of products Iranians consume are domestically produced. This self-sufficiency, borne of years of isolation, now works to Iran\u2019s advantage. In Qom itself, a movement of grassroots mobilisation is now in full swing. The city\u2019s itinerant population of seminarians and traders has left, and the citizens of Qom remain, banding together with a resigned solidarity. Several volunteer aid groups have emerged, and now organise under a central hub; together they disinfect streets in crowded areas, distribute food to poorer or sick families, and offer relief shifts to hospital cleaners and mortuaries. \u201cBasically people saw that what the government warned \u2013 that if you come out of your home, you\u2019ll die \u2013 is coming to pass,\u201d said Seyed Ali Pourtabatabai, a journalist based in Qom. \u201cThe fear of death, the fear of being next or being responsible for others death by doing nothing, this has made people think they better help.\u201d Recent days have also seen a surge of grassroots efforts by women\u2019s activists, who are channelling their networks and organising experience to offer health advice, especially to rural areas. Setareh, a women\u2019s rights activist from Tehran who moved back to her provincial town last year, spends hours visiting shopkeepers to brief them on hygiene practices, distributing tongs and plastic gloves. \u201cThey\u2019re so thankful when we explain things to them,\u201d she said. The harm inflicted on especially poor pockets of south Tehran, where drug addiction is rampant and many women are heads of households, has been devastating. In these areas, families occupy cramped informal dwellings, and just barely survive by peddling goods on the metro \u2013 work that is now banished to stop contagion. Men tend to work as day labourers, pulling trolleys of goods to the bazaar, and are now out of work, as trade is curtailed. Mary, a women\u2019s rights activist whose organisation delivers food and medicine to these families door-to-door, says the mood is bleak. Many have sick relatives at home and cannot leave to buy the food they cannot afford. \u201cThese people we serve, they faced a multitude of problems before, but now it is a hundred times worse. It\u2019s no longer a matter of going hungry; now those who are poor, they will die.\u201d Well-heeled Iranians, like their counterparts globally, can more or less afford to protect themselves. Banks in north Tehran dole out hand sanitiser at the door and caution customers to maintain a metre\u2019s distance. With intensive care wards full, the affluent buy oxygen tanks for their homes. Sohrab, an environmental activist, recounts visiting a luxury mall in north Tehran, where health workers took temperatures at the door, and turned away anyone who looked working class, without explanation. Medical charities that aid other groups are struggling. Charities and private sector groups are banding together to raise funds to build clinics and purchase equipment and supplies from China. But the sanctions are making even this hard. \u201cCharities are having a hard time moving money,\u201d says Sharif Nezam-Mafi, who heads the Iran Swiss Chamber of Commerce and is involved with one such effort, Nafas. \u201cEverything that is getting into Iran is finding its way through loopholes, not the formal humanitarian channels. It\u2019s as though they are going out of their way to make it harder.\u201d Suspending sanctions during this pandemic should not be seen as a troubling or even monumental thing to do. Proponents of sanctions in the US administration insist that only extreme pressure will bring about changes in Iranian policy \u2013 but we are in different times now. Controlling the virus would not be a favour to the Iranian government, but to Iranians themselves \u2013 and indeed, to the rest of the world. \u2022 Azadeh Moaveni directs the Gender and Conflict Project at the International Crisis Group.

Morrisons is taking on 500 charity shop workers to help vulnerable shoppers. Iceland is temporarily limiting online orders to customers who are over state pension age, self-isolating and other vulnerable people such as disabled people. From Sunday, Tesco is introducing a special hour in stores for NHS staff, which will continue every Sunday until further notice. Waitrose has written to all its customers asking them to contact it via its website or email address in order to keep phone lines free for vulnerable customers to order food. The letter from MPs, drafted by the Labour MP Anna McMorrin and addressed to Tory MP Alok Sharma, the business secretary, says: \u201cA crisis of this magnitude calls on all of us to do whatever it takes to ensure no one is left behind. As members of parliament, we call on you to show leadership and urgently resolve this matter, whether that involves ringfencing supplies or shopping time for essential workers.\u201d The issue was brought to the attention of millions of people on Friday when a video of a nurse, Dawn Bilbrough, went viral. She filmed herself in her car, exhausted and crying, having just come out of a supermarket where she had been unable to buy any fresh fruit or vegetables. \u201cI\u2019m a critical care nurse and I\u2019ve just finished 48 hours of work and I just wanted to get some stuff in for the next 48 hours,\u201d she said. \u201cThose people who are just stripping the shelves of basic foods you just need to stop it because it\u2019s people like me that are going to be looking after you when you are at your lowest and just stop it, please.\u201d However, so far this seems to have had little effect. Before 6am on Saturday hundreds of shoppers were filmed by a drone queueing round the block at supermarkets including all the way round the car park at a Tesco in New Malden. Other images posted on social media continued to show shelves stripped bare of essential goods and supplies such as milk, eggs, meat, toilet rolls and pasta. Steve Livington, 58, who lives alone in Peacehaven, is in a wheelchair. He has a form of muscular dystrophy and always shops online. \u201cLast week I went to order my Tesco delivery and there was nothing for three weeks, and then the same for Sainsbury\u2019s and similarly for Asda,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any local friends or family who can help and so I\u2019m now starting to be really worried.\u201d Hannah Graham, a local group coordinator for the single-parent family charity Gingerbread, is self-isolating with her two children, six and nine, in Northwich. \u201cI am still managing to get some food delivered online but all the own-brand goods I usually get because I am on a limited budget are now being substituted for premium brands,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m now less worried about the virus in the weeks ahead and more worried about being able to provide all the food and essentials my children and I need.\u201d Alexander Trautrims, an expert in logistics and supply chains at Nottingham University business school said it was understandable people were stockpiling in times of uncertainty but that there was no chance of the country running out of food. \u201cThere is enough supply in the system but the demand patterns have changed so much there may be local shortages while retailers react to these,\u201d he said. He said there needed to be stronger assurances from government to get this message across and that supermarket actions, instead of being reassuring, created panic as they were suggestive of a shortage. \u201cWhat would reassure people would be to see food parcels delivered to a neighbour\u2019s door, for example,\u201d Trautrims said. \u201cWhen the time is right this [food parcel delivery infrastructure] needs to be established and controlled by the government.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are in regular contact with the food industry to ensure it is well prepared to deal with a range of scenarios. Retailers are continuing to monitor their supply chains and taking all the necessary steps to ensure consumers have the food and supplies they need.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Our ability to collect and record information in a digital form has exploded as has our adoption of AI systems, which use data to make decisions. But data isn\u2019t neutral, and sexism, racism and other forms of discrimination are showing up in our data products. Catherine D\u2019Ignazio, an assistant professor of urban science and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), argues we need to do better. Along with Lauren Klein, who directs the Digital Humanities Lab at Emory University, she is the co-author of the new book <em><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-feminism\">Data Feminism</a></em>, which charts a course for a more equitable data science. D\u2019Ignazio also directs MIT\u2019s new Data and Feminism lab, which seeks to use data and computation to counter oppression<em>.</em></p> <p><strong>What is data feminism and why do we need it?<br></strong>It is data science with an intersectional feminist lens. It takes all inequality into account at every stage of the data processing pipeline, including gender discrimination but also other forms of intersecting discrimination like racism, classism and ableism. And the reason we need it is to stop producing harmful racist and sexist data products.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We shouldn\u2019t be surprised about the sexist results coming out of these algorithms with the flawed data we are feeding in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>When you look at data and AI this way, what kind of problems do you find?<br></strong>We find some people are winning and some people are losing. The benefits and harms are not being equally distributed. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/13/ai-programs-exhibit-racist-and-sexist-biases-research-reveals\">those who are losing</a> are disproportionately women, people of colour, and other marginalised groups. One way they are losing is that data most of us would think is important isn\u2019t being collected. We have detailed datasets on things like the length of guinea pig teeth and items lost on the New York City subway. But, in the US, missing data includes maternal mortality data, which has only started being collected recently, and sexual harassment data. And so much of our health and medical understanding is based on research that has been done exclusively on the male body.</p> <p><strong>How do people with less privilege show up in datasets?<br></strong>We\u2019ve had facial analysis software that is much less accurate for dark-skinned women and algorithms that disadvantage female applicants. We\u2019ve also had child abuse prediction software that over-targets poor families and predictive policing software like PredPol that disproportionately targets neighbourhoods of colour. The former pulls data from state health and welfare services, which poor people are more likely to access, while the latter is based on historical crime data; only US policing practices have always disproportionately surveilled and patrolled neighbourhoods of colour. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised about the racist and sexist results coming out of these algorithms with the deeply flawed data we are feeding in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/25/healthcare-algorithm-racial-biases-optum\">Healthcare algorithm used across America has dramatic racial biases</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>If our data and algorithms are all so flawed, how do we change things to make them better?<br></strong>First we need to be tuning in to the ways that oppressive forces might be insidiously inserting themselves into the data pipeline. More understanding is particularly needed among the technical folks who are making these systems. It is rarely the case that the discrimination in products is intentional; it\u2019s just that nobody has ever taught them that it is a problem or emphasised that it is important. University data-science courses should include more than just a single ethics class.</p> <p>Then we have to actually use data and computation to challenge inequality. We have to collect counter-data. Take for example the comprehensive dataset on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/mexico-femicide-amlo-protests-strategy\">Mexico\u2019s femicides</a> \u2013 gender-related killings of women and girls \u2013 that has been compiled for the past five years from media reports by <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/how-one-woman-is-mapping-femicides-in-mexico/\">Mar\u00eda Salguero</a>, a citizen activist in that country. She is filling a vacuum because the Mexican government is not collecting the data. Now of course data alone is never enough. But if the data is used in concert with organising, lobbying and building political will, it can be very effective. In the US, we do have organisations working to call out injustice and produce their own counter-data, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/data4blacklives?lang=en\">Data for Black Lives</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.ajlunited.org/\">Algorithmic Justice League</a> and <a href=\"https://themarkup.org/\">The Markup</a>. We need to fund more of this kind of work.</p> <p><strong>Is there </strong><strong>such thing as neutral data?<br></strong>There is a naive assumption that if you see numbers in a spreadsheet, they are real somehow. But data is never this raw, truthful input, and it is never neutral. It is information that has been collected in certain ways by certain actors and institutions for certain reasons. For example, there is a comprehensive database at the US federal level of sexual assaults on college campuses \u2013 colleges are required to report it. But whether students come forward to make those reports will depend on whether the college has a climate that will support survivors. Most colleges are not doing enough, and so we have vast underreporting of those crimes. It is not that data is evil or never useful, but the numbers should never be allowed to \u201cspeak for themselves\u201d because they don\u2019t tell the whole story when there are power imbalances in the collection environment.</p> <p><strong>Would data science\u2019s bias problems be solved if there were simply more data scientists, coders and computer programmers who were women or from minority backgrounds?<br></strong>More diversity is an important part of the solution. As a group, data scientists are more likely to be male, white and highly educated. They have never experienced sexism, racism or classism so it is hard for them to see it. We call this \u201cthe privilege hazard\u201d in the book and diversity can mitigate it.</p> <p>But only including more women or people of colour is not going to solve everything. We need to put communities who will be impacted by the information systems into the process of making them. Because inevitably designers and programmers are going to be building systems for life experiences that they haven\u2019t had. If everyone that builds a welfare application needs to have lived on welfare, that would be a high bar. Because I am a woman doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to understand how to build an application for domestic workers. But there are participation strategies from other fields like urban planning and how we incorporate those in data science is an area ripe for exploration.</p> <p><strong>In the book you talk about \u201cBig Dick Data\u201d. What is it and should we just reject it outright?<br></strong>We coined it to denote big data projects that are characterised by masculine fantasies of world domination. Big Dick Data projects fetishise large size and prioritise it, along with speed, over quality, ignore context and inflate their technical capabilities. They also tend to have little consideration for inequalities or inclusion in the process. Mark Zuckerberg aiming to supersede human senses with AI might be considered one such project, along with software company Palantir\u2019s claims about massive-scale datasets. Big Dick Data projects aren\u2019t necessarily wholly invalid, but they suck up resources that could be given smaller, more inclusive projects.</p> <p><strong>What would you most like people to think about or ask themselves when they encounter data or a graph in the media?<br></strong>A good general strategy and feminist practice is to ask what we call \u201cwho\u201d questions. Who made this? Who collected the data? Whose lives are embodied in the data? Who is it serving? Who is harmed potentially? Asking these questions allows us to start to see how privilege is baked in.</p> <p><strong>How is privilege being baked into the coronavirus data we are collecting?<br></strong>The US government\u2019s response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> has been a case of missing data. There has been community spread, but the numbers are completely unreliable because kits are in short supply and people are having a hard time getting tests. And then poor people, which include many from immigrant backgrounds, will be less likely to seek tests because of lack of insurance, lack of ability to afford insurance co-pays and lack of paid sick time if they test positive.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Data Feminism </em>by Catherine D\u2019Ignazio and Lauren F Klein is published by <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-feminism\">MIT</a> (\u00a325)</p>",

However, for people experiencing domestic violence, social distancing means being trapped inside with an abuser. As more cities go under lockdown, activists are worried that attempts to curb the coronavirus will inadvertently lead to an increase in domestic violence.</p> <p>Domestic violence is already a deadly epidemic. One in three women around the world experience physical or sexual violence, mostly from an intimate partner, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/violence-against-women\">according to the World Health Organi</a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/violence-against-women\">zation</a> (WHO). As the WHO notes: \u201cThis makes it the most widespread, but among the least reported human rights abuses.\u201d Gender-based violence tends to increase during humanitarian emergencies and conflicts; \u201cwomen\u2019s bodies too often become battlefields\u201d.</p> <p>Reports from China suggest the coronavirus has already caused a significant spike in domestic violence. Local police stations saw a threefold increase in cases reported in February compared with the previous year, according to Wan Fei, the founder of an anti-domestic violence not-forprofit. \u201cAccording to our statistics, 90% of the causes of violence are related to the Covid-19 epidemic,\u201d Wan <a href=\"https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005253/domestic-violence-cases-surge-during-covid-19-epidemic\">told Sixth Tone</a>, an English-language magazine based in China.</p> <p>A similar story is playing out in America. A <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2020/03/calls-to-oregons-domestic-violence-crisis-lines-spike-amid-coronavirus-crisis.html\">domestic violence hotline in Portland, Oregon</a>, says calls doubled last week. And the national domestic violence hotline is hearing from a growing number of callers whose abusers are using Covid-19 to further control and isolate them. \u201cPerpetrators are threatening to throw their victims out on the street so they get sick,\u201d the hotline\u2019s CEO <a href=\"https://time.com/5803887/coronavirus-domestic-violence-victims/\">told Time</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard of some withholding financial resources or medical assistance.\u201d</p> <p>With all attention focused on curbing a public health crisis, the problem of private violence risks being overlooked or deprioritized by authorities. In the UK, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/key-worker-official-list-of-uk-personnel-who-can-still-send-children-to-school\">schools are now closed</a> to everyone except for the children of key workers performing essential services. Domestic violence professionals have been left off this list; apparently preventing abuse at home isn\u2019t an essential service. Dawn Butler, Labour\u2019s women and equalities spokeswoman, has asked the prime minister to \u201curgently reconsider\u201d this classification and consider implementing emergency funding to help people in danger escape domestic abuse during the crisis. \u201c[T]wo women are killed every week by a partner or former partner,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DawnButlerBrent/status/1240997135073652736?s=20\">Butler tweeted</a>. \u201cIf the Govt fails to prepare and plan more people will die.\u201d</p> <p>Now more than ever we need to look out for the most vulnerable in our society; activists are <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-fears-of-domestic-violence-child-abuse-rise/a-52847759\">calling on neighbors</a> to be extra aware and vigilant of possible cases of domestic violence.

      "bodyText": "New York is preparing to ration its ventilators for sick coronavirus patients as a major disaster was declared in the city as it struggles to cope with the deadly outbreak. The disaster declaration comes as New York prepares guidance on how to deploy vital ventilators amid a widespread shortage of key equipment that also includes masks and surgical gloves, and medical supplies such as blood. The draft guidance on ventilators, prepared by a state taskforce in 2015 for a possible influenza pandemic, has reportedly been updated for the coronavirus crisis, though new guidelines have not been finalized. According to Sam Gorovitz, a professor of philosophy at Syracuse University and member of the taskforce, the revisions to the ventilator allocation guidelines include the formation of designated triage committees to determine which critically ill patients will or will not receive life-supporting respiration. Gorovitz told the Guardian he is \u201c100% certain\u201d that New York health administrators will face ethical decision-making in the near future about whom to ventilate \u2013 just as it is now making decisions about the allocation of masks and protective equipment. \u201cConsider a patient, 85 years old, on a ventilator, out of hospice care. Along comes a 45-year-old, with a family, and in fundamentally good health and a good prospect of full recovery from coronavirus if treated with the best available treatment. \u201cIs it not only acceptable but ethically necessary to take grandpa off the ventilator and switch him to palliative care, wipe away the tears, and switch the ventilator to the younger patient?\u201d he said. \u201cThese decisions are already being faced with regard to protective equipment that are inadequately supplied,\u201d Gorovitz said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the same as ventilator allocations, but everyone knows it\u2019s coming and those decisions are likely being made right now.\u201d At a press conference on Saturday New York state governor Andrew Cuomo said that his administration was \u201cliterally scouring the globe looking for medical supplies\u201d. Cuomo added that New York is doing more tests than China or South Korea, calling the 45,000 tests to date a \u201cgreat accomplishment.\u201d The announcement came as New York state recorded 10,000 infections. Forty to 80% of New Yorkers, or 7.8 million to 15 million people, would likely be affected by the virus in the end, Cuomo said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to wait til the end of the movie to know what happens,\u201d he said, saying that the measures being taken would ease pressure on medical facilities and allow the authorities to cope with the influx of the infected. The Trump administration late Friday issued a major disaster declaration for New York, the center of the US coronavirus outbreak, as infections spike across New York City to 5,000 as one person an hour dies from the coronavirus. The emergency declaration was issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to allow the state to access billions of dollars in aid from the disaster relief fund, as the number of confirmed New York cases soar. \u201cWith no time to waste, the administration heeded the call and approved the nation\u2019s first major disaster declaration in response to the coronavirus, right here in New York,\u201d Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. \u201cWith more and more cases confirmed here each day, it\u2019s imperative that the federal government does everything within its power to stem the spread of the deadly coronavirus.\u201d The disaster declaration allows for the US military to be called in, and the US Army Corps of Engineers may take over hotels, sports arenas, college dormitories and other buildings as needed. Under the declaration, Fema will be authorized to send its personnel and resources to set up mobile coronavirus testing centers, disinfect public facilities, and provide the state with medical supplies that are in high demand such as masks, gloves and surgical gowns. The vast Jacob Javits convention center on the west side of Manhattan could be used as a makeshift hospital, state officials have said. New Yorkers are already living under shutdown conditions that from Sunday night will see all residents, except for certain vital professions, expected to stay at home. Only a few vital businesses \u2013 like supermarkets and pharmacies \u2013 will remain open and citizens will be asked to only venture outside on vital tasks and not in groups. On Friday, New York mayor Bill de Blasio said: \u2018We constitute 30 percent of the cases in the US and 70 per cent of the cases in New York State. Whether we like it or not, we are the epicenter.\u2019 New York certainly needs help: it has become the main focus of the epidemic in the US, outstripping the original \u201chot zone\u201d of Washington state. New York state has about 6,000 intensive care unit ventilators, and state health officials fear the pandemic will overwhelm the roughly 3,000 ICU beds available. With cases of coronavirus in the state spiking from around 800 to 8,000 in a week, Andrew Cuomo, New York\u2019s governor, has estimated that the state may require 30,000 ventilators to meet demand. \u201cIt\u2019s ventilators, ventilators, ventilators. That is the greatest need,\u201d Cuomo told reporters on Friday after ordering a statewide shutdown of non-essential businesses. He also directed health facilities to turn over any non-essential ventilators to the department of health. \u201cWe will purchase it from you if you could lend it to us. But we need ventilators, and anyone who has them now please call the New York state department of health,\u201d he said. Warnings of a ventilator shortage comes two days after Trump invoked wartime powers to harness private business to slow the spread of coronavirus to a manageable infection curve. But in New York and other major metropolitan areas, a shortage of basic masks and scrubs is threatening the effort even as testing ramps up. In Los Angeles, health officials are instructing doctors to only test sick people if a diagnosis would change how they would be treated, according to the LA Times. The LA Times reports that the county health department sent a letter to doctors this week saying they should only administer tests if \u201ca diagnostic result will change clinical management or inform public health response\u201d. The decision is part of a shift \u201cfrom a strategy of case containment to slowing disease transmission and averting excess morbidity and mortality,\u201d according to the paper.",

      "body": "<p>Hotels and offices will be converted into emergency safe spaces under a national action plan drawn up by Tony Blair\u2019s former homelessness expert, to protect rough sleepers from coronavirus.</p> <p>Louise Casey, hired by Boris Johnson last month over the issue of homelessness, was scheduled to start her role after Easter but deepening disquiet that the government was \u201csleepwalking\u201d on homeless people\u2019s vulnerability to Covid-19 led to her being drafted in to spearhead its response.</p> <p>The strategy to safeguard the homeless will be announced on Monday and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-california-more-than-half-gavin-newsom\">follows the lead of California</a> in allowing vacant hotels to be requisitioned into homes for rough sleepers and those vulnerable to the virus.</p> <p>In practical terms, protecting the UK\u2019s population of homeless people and rough sleepers by offering safe space to self-isolate means that up to 45,000 \u201cself-contained accommodation spaces\u201d need to be urgently found.</p> <p>Empty hotels have been pinpointed as a ready-made solution because they have separate cleaning facilities and rooms, and can be leased by the government using funding allocated to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Modelling by University College London found that placing vulnerable groups in hotels was also significantly more cost effective than treating individuals in hospital.</p> <p>Whitehall sources believe the government response to the effect of Covid-19 upon the UK homeless population may have been too slow.</p> <p>Homeless people are among the most vulnerable to coronavirus, with individuals three times more likely to have a severe respiratory problem, which underlines the need for a rapid response.</p> <p>Matthew Downie, the director of policy and external affairs for charity <a href=\"https://www.crisis.org.uk/\">Crisis</a>, welcomed Casey\u2019s input. He said: \u201cThe response has not been as fast as we needed it to be. The government\u2019s own guidance on protecting yourself is just impossible if you are homeless. We\u2019re now in a race against time because particularly in the night shelter population, where people are sleeping on floors next to each other in rows, that\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Already there have been reports that night shelters have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-case-homeless-shelter-guests-street-glasgow-city-mission\">had to be shut</a> as a result of suspected cases.</p> <p>Data from the charity sector indicates there are 40,000 people in hostels, night shelters and shared homeless accommodation, with another 5,000 people on the streets.</p> <p>Downie said: \u201cAll of them need to be tested before and during their time in self-contained accommodation.\u201d</p> <p>Along with hotels, disused office blocks and student accommodation have also been identified as possible solutions.</p> <p>Downie said: \u201cIf we converted office blocks we\u2019d need to be really careful they\u2019re actually suitable. We can\u2019t have people just thrown into disused buildings. In many ways hotels are perfect.\u201d</p> <p>Exacerbating the situation is the fact that many of the volunteers at homeless hostels are elderly people, the cohort of the population most at risk, who have been told by the government to self-isolate. Downie said it was vital that outreach teams had sufficient personal and protective equipment.</p> <p>Last month, Johnson appointed Casey to lead a review into the causes of rough sleeping, providing an extra \u00a3236m to help get people off the streets, offering accommodation for up to 6,000 rough sleepers.</p> <p>The capacity for housing homeless people in hotels certainly exists: London alone is reported to have almost 160,000 hotel rooms, with another 8,000 in 65 new hotels projected to open this year, although that total is likely to fall.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the ex-footballer Gary Neville announced that two hotels he co-owns with his former Manchester United teammate Ryan Giggs would close to the public and be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-gary-neville-says-nhs-staff-will-stay-at-his-hotels-for-free-video\">made available to NHS staff free of charge</a>.</p> <p>On Friday night the first hotel rooms for homeless people were secured when 300 beds at the Intercontinental Hotels Group were block-booked for the next three months so rough sleepers can self-isolate. IHG owns the Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express and Crowne Plaza brands.</p> <p>The development, which involved the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the government, is designed to halt the spread of coronavirus and will mean two London hotels are given over to rough sleepers. Individuals will be moved into the rooms during the weekend. However the rooms have not been offered for free, with a statement explaining they have instead been given at a \u201csubstantially discounted rate\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Hotels and offices will be converted into emergency safe spaces under a national action plan drawn up by Tony Blair\u2019s former homelessness expert, to protect rough sleepers from coronavirus. Louise Casey, hired by Boris Johnson last month over the issue of homelessness, was scheduled to start her role after Easter but deepening disquiet that the government was \u201csleepwalking\u201d on homeless people\u2019s vulnerability to Covid-19 led to her being drafted in to spearhead its response. The strategy to safeguard the homeless will be announced on Monday and follows the lead of California in allowing vacant hotels to be requisitioned into homes for rough sleepers and those vulnerable to the virus. In practical terms, protecting the UK\u2019s population of homeless people and rough sleepers by offering safe space to self-isolate means that up to 45,000 \u201cself-contained accommodation spaces\u201d need to be urgently found. Empty hotels have been pinpointed as a ready-made solution because they have separate cleaning facilities and rooms, and can be leased by the government using funding allocated to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. Modelling by University College London found that placing vulnerable groups in hotels was also significantly more cost effective than treating individuals in hospital. Whitehall sources believe the government response to the effect of Covid-19 upon the UK homeless population may have been too slow. Homeless people are among the most vulnerable to coronavirus, with individuals three times more likely to have a severe respiratory problem, which underlines the need for a rapid response. Matthew Downie, the director of policy and external affairs for charity Crisis, welcomed Casey\u2019s input. He said: \u201cThe response has not been as fast as we needed it to be. The government\u2019s own guidance on protecting yourself is just impossible if you are homeless. We\u2019re now in a race against time because particularly in the night shelter population, where people are sleeping on floors next to each other in rows, that\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d Already there have been reports that night shelters have had to be shut as a result of suspected cases. Data from the charity sector indicates there are 40,000 people in hostels, night shelters and shared homeless accommodation, with another 5,000 people on the streets. Downie said: \u201cAll of them need to be tested before and during their time in self-contained accommodation.\u201d Along with hotels, disused office blocks and student accommodation have also been identified as possible solutions. Downie said: \u201cIf we converted office blocks we\u2019d need to be really careful they\u2019re actually suitable. We can\u2019t have people just thrown into disused buildings. In many ways hotels are perfect.\u201d Exacerbating the situation is the fact that many of the volunteers at homeless hostels are elderly people, the cohort of the population most at risk, who have been told by the government to self-isolate. Downie said it was vital that outreach teams had sufficient personal and protective equipment. Last month, Johnson appointed Casey to lead a review into the causes of rough sleeping, providing an extra \u00a3236m to help get people off the streets, offering accommodation for up to 6,000 rough sleepers. The capacity for housing homeless people in hotels certainly exists: London alone is reported to have almost 160,000 hotel rooms, with another 8,000 in 65 new hotels projected to open this year, although that total is likely to fall. On Wednesday, the ex-footballer Gary Neville announced that two hotels he co-owns with his former Manchester United teammate Ryan Giggs would close to the public and be made available to NHS staff free of charge. On Friday night the first hotel rooms for homeless people were secured when 300 beds at the Intercontinental Hotels Group were block-booked for the next three months so rough sleepers can self-isolate. IHG owns the Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express and Crowne Plaza brands. The development, which involved the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the government, is designed to halt the spread of coronavirus and will mean two London hotels are given over to rough sleepers. Individuals will be moved into the rooms during the weekend. However the rooms have not been offered for free, with a statement explaining they have instead been given at a \u201csubstantially discounted rate\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "New Jersey on Saturday ordered its citizens to stay at home meaning that almost one in four Americans are now under orders to only leave their residences to run essential errands and maintain a six-foot separation from others. New Jersey joins New York, Connecticut, Illinois and California as states who have now asked residents to stay at their places of residence, representing about 85 million people out of a total US population of about 327 million. It is an unprecedented closure of vast parts of the country as the US seeks to get a grip on the rapidly expanding coronavirus outbreak and is dealing a devastating blow to the largest economy in the world by threatening millions of Americans with unemployment. It is also wreaking havoc on social and cultural life. Americans have shut themselves indoors and businesses, restaurants and cultural institutions like cinemas, theaters and sports events have come to a shuddering halt. New Jersey governor Phil Murphy signed an executive order for New Jerseyans to stay indoors. Murphy also ordered all gatherings to be canceled and that all non-essential retail businesses must indefinitely close their physical locations from tonight. \u201cLife in New Jersey does not have to come to a complete standstill. We want people to stay healthy, both physically and mentally,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIf you head outside to take a walk or go for a run or go to the grocery store, please continue practicing social distancing.\u201d The directives come as an increasing number of states issue disaster declarations that allow for military to be called in and to gain access to more than $50bn in federal relief funds. Under the declarations, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) will be authorized to send its personnel and resources to set up mobile coronavirus testing centers, disinfect public facilities, and distribute medical supplies including face masks, gloves and surgical gowns. House-quarantining, or stay-at-home orders, are scheduled to take effect on Sunday evening in New York. The Army Corps of Engineers has said it plans to take over hotels, sports arenas, college dorms and other buildings to cope with the growing number or residents requiring medical care. Growing alarm over the fast spread of the virus in US population centers comes as the American Red Cross announced it is facing a shortage of blood donations drop by 150,000 as centers close across the US. The warning comes as researchers at Columbia University said even if the US cuts its rate of transmission in half, 650,000 people might become infected in the next two months. The study is based on a New York Times database of known infections to model how coronavirus transmission could develop. Health authorities, meanwhile, have announced a worsening shortage of masks and gowns need by health workers as thousands flood hospitals and testing stations. Panic buying at supermarkets is accompanied by other efforts to stock up: gun shops in upstate New York and elsewhere have been flood with customers. In Illinois, Governor Jay Pritzker announced on Friday asked all 12 million residents to leave the house only when necessary, starting Saturday. The Connecticut order came on Friday also. Other orders have been issued at the city level. New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell issued a similar order, asking the city\u2019s 390,000 residents to go out for \u201ccritical needs only.\u201d Wall Street ended its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis with the Dow below where it stood on the day before Donald Trump was inaugurated. The S&amp;P 500, which fell more than 4%, is not far from that mark as well. The president has trumpeted the so-called \u201cTrump bump\u201d throughout his presidency as evidence of his success.",

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s something deeply disturbing about seeing someone profit from a disaster, and we\u2019ve already seen a few examples in the present crisis. First it was the guys who bought up <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/technology/coronavirus-purell-wipes-amazon-sellers.html\">over 17,000 bottles of hand sanitizer</a> in the hopes of selling them at a high markup. (After Amazon put a stop to their sales, the pair of hoarders <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/matt-colvin-hand-sanitizer-resale-donation-tennesee-attorney-general-investigation/\">donated the sanitizer</a>.) Now we have reports that multiple US senators may have acted on inside information about the coronavirus pandemic, selling stocks in anticipation of a crash, even as they failed to warn the public about the danger posed by the virus. These allegations, if they are indeed true, show that even in a time of crisis, our elected officials are looking out for themselves rather than the public.</p> <p>ProPublica <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/senator-dumped-up-to-1-7-million-of-stock-after-reassuring-public-about-coronavirus-preparedness\">reports</a> that North Carolina Republican Richard Burr, who was receiving daily coronavirus briefings as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, \u201csold off a significant percentage of his stocks, unloading between $628,000 and $1.72m of his holdings,\u201d a week before the stock market tanked. And while in public he was insisting that the government was capable of handling the virus, to well-connected constituents at the Capitol Hill Club he was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818192535/burr-recording-sparks-questions-about-private-comments-on-covid-19\">warning</a> that the virus was \u201cmuch more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history.\u201d Then <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/sen-kelly-loeffler-dumped-millions-in-stock-after-coronavirus-briefing\">there was</a> Georgia Republican Kelly Loeffler, who according to the Daily Beast also sold a substantial amount of stock in the leadup to the crash, as well as buying shares in the teleworking company Citrix. <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/03/20/senators-deny-theyre-corrupt-after-dumping-stocks-before-coronavirus-crash/\">Other senators</a> also sold stock around the same time, though the evidence of insider trading is less clear in the other cases.</p> <p>Burr, Loeffler, and the others have denied wrongdoing, though have not offered especially convincing alternate explanations for the sales. If they did trade on insider information, what they did was probably illegal\u2014under the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/112/plaws/publ105/PLAW-112publ105.htm\">Stock Act</a>, which Burr voted against, lawmakers are prohibited from trading on \u201cnonpublic\u201d information, though the definition of nonpublic is not always clear and Burr says he relied solely on public news reports.</p> <p>But even if that was true, the fact that Burr had reason to suspect that the disaster would be worse than he was publicly letting on is a deep betrayal of his constituents. He should entirely lose the confidence of the public, because it\u2019s clear that he chose to make money at a time when he should have been offering Americans the truth. That\u2019s why even figures like <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/20/coronavirus-tucker-carlson-burr/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_medium=social\">Tucker Carlson</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/1240844081644761090\">Ben Shapiro</a> have been outraged by the alleged behavior, with Carlson saying there is \u201cno greater moral crime\u201d than choosing yourself over your country at a time of crisis.</p> <p>Elected officials whose first response to a pandemic is to cash in are indeed monstrous. But it\u2019s not especially surprising in the Trump Era, when the pathological pursuit of financial self-interest is widely seen as unobjectionable. Burr and Loeffler were just doing what they learned in Economics 101: rationally maximize your returns, regardless of the consequences for other people. It\u2019s a little surprising to see Shapiro condemning this behavior instead of defending it as an example of the glorious free market at work. After all, you frequently see <a href=\"https://reason.com/2020/03/16/price-gouging-laws-will-do-more-harm-than-good-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/\">defenses</a> of <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/price-gouging-after-a-disaster-is-good-for-the-public-1507071457\">price-gouging</a> among free market types, which is no less sociopathic of a behavior during a time of need. It\u2019s strange to see those who are generally fine with those who profit off human misery \u2013 like, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183271/insured-cost-coronavirus-treatment-pneumonia-testing\">health insurance companies</a> \u2013 get so worked up about insider trading.</p> <p>The alleged behavior of Burr and Loeffler is indeed despicable, and there is a reasonable discussion to be had about whether senators <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/20/21188144/senators-dumping-stock-as-market-tanks\">ought to own stock in the first place</a>. Can we trust people to make laws neutrally if they are significantly financially invested in the outcome of those laws? But we should also make sure not to over-focus on insider trading and corruption as being what\u2019s wrong with our politics. They are one part of what is wrong, to be sure, but more important than self-enrichment is the fact that US senators are allowing people to suffer and die needlessly by failing to push through <a href=\"https://lbo-news.com/2020/03/20/a-few-ambitious-points-on-fighting-the-crisis/?fbclid=IwAR3Ok3KnuGkefJQ1FcfCbMGMHJE6_CV6Sy_2ZC6hMapkgiNd41M4C8pQqg8\">the measures needed to deal with the coronavirus crisis</a>.</p> <p>Unethical and selfish behavior becomes especially disgusting in a time of a deadly pandemic, but we must keep our focus on giving people the healthcare and economic relief they will need to get through this.

In the case of Covid-19, we currently have no way of accurately measuring how we\u2019re doing, because we\u2019re not able to do enough testing of the population.

How else will we know \u2013 other than by counting the number of desperate cases who show up needing intensive care \u2013 whether that curve is being flattened or not?</p> <p>We need a magic bullet. And, miraculously, we seem to have one. It\u2019s called a smartphone. Almost everybody has one nowadays. And \u2013 as security agencies, internet companies and mobile network owners know \u2013 these devices track your every movement, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. They\u2019re a bit like those electronic tags we put on some criminals to make sure they stick to the terms of their parole conditions. Except that the phones are smarter than tags. We can run apps on them that make them serve our public health purposes.</p> <p>Interestingly, we were doing this in the UK way back in 2011 \u2013 in the <a href=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/fluphone-disease-tracking-by-app\" title=\"\">\u201cFluPhone\u201d project</a>, run by Prof Jon Crowcroft and Dr Eiko Yoneki of the Cambridge Computer Laboratory.

Not surprisingly, the Covid-19 crisis has led people in a number of countries to develop similar tools.

      "body": "<p>Anyone who has continued to play video games beyond childhood is used to the name-calling. Yes, in 2020, millions of thoughtful, otherwise usefully employed people enjoy video games (as well as a fair few thoughtless wastrels too, if Twitter is anything to go by). But away from the golf course or bridge club, adult play is still viewed, culturally speaking, with suspicion, pity or disdain. As a reporter for the <em>Washington Post</em> tweeted in 2017, in reference to the American chatshow host Jimmy Fallon, a keen fan of the medium: \u201cAt the heart of any banality is an adult male who plays video games.\u201d</p> <p>Still, personally speaking, it took a pandemic to appreciate that the video game reviewer is truly the cockroach of arts and entertainment criticism. As cinemas, theatres, restaurants and concert venues close, and their remaining staff begin the sorrowful work of disinfection and grant application, writers who cover their industries are forced to glumly twirl their pens, waiting. The video game critic (and, breathe easy, the literary critic), by contrast, suddenly finds a near-captive audience that is, once Netflix has been plundered at least, just maybe willing to give video games a try.</p> <p>For the next who-knows-how-long, this monthly look at the medium will move to a weekly slot. For those readers who consider games to be at the \u201cheart of any banality\u201d (yikes), I can only apologise. But, for those with an open mind, there are worthwhile jewels in the sphere of interactive play.

      "bodyText": "Anyone who has continued to play video games beyond childhood is used to the name-calling. Yes, in 2020, millions of thoughtful, otherwise usefully employed people enjoy video games (as well as a fair few thoughtless wastrels too, if Twitter is anything to go by). But away from the golf course or bridge club, adult play is still viewed, culturally speaking, with suspicion, pity or disdain. As a reporter for the Washington Post tweeted in 2017, in reference to the American chatshow host Jimmy Fallon, a keen fan of the medium: \u201cAt the heart of any banality is an adult male who plays video games.\u201d Still, personally speaking, it took a pandemic to appreciate that the video game reviewer is truly the cockroach of arts and entertainment criticism. As cinemas, theatres, restaurants and concert venues close, and their remaining staff begin the sorrowful work of disinfection and grant application, writers who cover their industries are forced to glumly twirl their pens, waiting. The video game critic (and, breathe easy, the literary critic), by contrast, suddenly finds a near-captive audience that is, once Netflix has been plundered at least, just maybe willing to give video games a try. For the next who-knows-how-long, this monthly look at the medium will move to a weekly slot. For those readers who consider games to be at the \u201cheart of any banality\u201d (yikes), I can only apologise. But, for those with an open mind, there are worthwhile jewels in the sphere of interactive play.

      "body": "<p>The UK government has joined forces with retailers to make a coordinated appeal to shoppers to stop stockpiling food and to think of others as panic-buying continues in response to the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n<p>The environment secretary, George Eustice, who stood in for Boris Johnson on Saturday at the government\u2019s daily briefing, said that when people took more than they needed it made things difficult for frontline workers, such as NHS staff.</p> \n<p>He asked people to think of those finishing their late shifts and going to a supermarket only to find empty shelves.</p> \n<p>Eustice was flanked at the briefing by Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, and Steven Powis, the national medical director of NHS England.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cWe recognise that this is a challenging time and there are many things the government is asking the nation to do differently as we work together to fight this pandemic. \u201cBe responsible when you shop and think of others. Buying more than you need means others may be left without.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/uk-map\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He stressed the message that \u201cthere is enough food available\u201d and ruled out government rationing, saying supermarket limits were already in place.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary for the government to intervene further to say what an appropriate limit is.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dickinson said there was now \u00a31bn worth of food in people\u2019s houses that had not yet been used.</p> \n<p>Powis appealed to people to consider NHS frontline staff as many had been faced with empty shelves by the time they finished their shifts.</p> \n<p>He referred to a video of a nurse, Dawn Bilbrough, that took off on social media on Friday. She filmed herself in her car, exhausted and crying, having just come out of a supermarket where she was unable to buy any fresh fruit or vegetables.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a critical care nurse and I\u2019ve just finished 48 hours of work and I just wanted to get some stuff in for the next 48 hours,\u201d she said. \u201cThose people who are just stripping the shelves of basic foods, you just need to stop it because it\u2019s people like me that are going to be looking after you when you are at your lowest and just stop it, please.\u201d</p> \n<p>Powis said: \u201cWe should all be ashamed that this [the video] had to happen. It\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked about possible government intervention to restrict food purchases, Eustice said: \u201cThe reality is that most of the supermarkets are already, of their own accord, putting limits on certain items so I don\u2019t think it is necessary or appropriate for the government to dictate this.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said people needed to \u201ccalm down\u201d and \u201conly buy what they need\u201d, and that it was for retailers to agree what the appropriate limit was on goods such as toilet paper.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll of the major retailers are working together and exercising their own judgment on where it\u2019s appropriate to put limits \u2013 item limits \u2013 on certain issues,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cToilet roll is one, where, for reasons that are not really known, there was a spike early on, despite the fact that toilet roll is made in this country and they are able to expand production very quickly.\u201d</p> \n<p>The press conference followed a meeting between Johnson and supermarket bosses about panic buying on Saturday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>There have been growing calls from MPs, academics, charities and those who work with vulnerable people to ensure food and other essentials are reaching those most in need.</p> \n<p>This weekend, 150 cross-party MPs and peers wrote to the government asking it to \u201cshow the direction and leadership necessary\u201d to ensure food supplies were available for all NHS, emergency and essential workers.</p> \n<p>Charities working with more vulnerable groups told the Observer they were becoming increasingly concerned that many people were facing real food shortages because they had no access to stores, and online shopping slots were booked weeks in advance. Many of those who could access food were struggling to pay for the few things that were available because the cheaper options were often the ones that had disappeared from shelves.</p> \n<p>The Salvation Army\u2019s leader in the UK and Ireland, Commissioner Anthony Cotterill, said: \u201cWe urge the government to bring all the major retailers together to develop a coordinated approach. Measures are urgently needed, in both urban and rural areas, to help older people and key workers access the groceries they need to remain healthy.\u201d</p> \n<p>Age UK expressed similar concerns, saying it was \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d that the problem of stockpiling was not going away despite the measures supermarkets have taken to try to address the issues, such as introducing pensioner-only hours in stores.</p> \n<p>The stockpiling showed no sign of abating this weekend. Before 6am on Saturday, hundreds of shoppers were filmed queueing round the block at major stores, including all the way around the car park at a Tesco in New Malden, south London.</p> \n<p>Steve Livington, 58, who lives alone in Peacehaven, West Sussex, is a wheelchair user and said he always shopped online.</p> \n<p>\u201cLast week I went to order my Tesco delivery and there was nothing for three weeks, and then the same for Sainsbury\u2019s and similarly for Asda,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Asked what he thought of the government\u2019s call for greater responsibility, he said: \u201cWords like those I sadly feel will do little to calm the irrational fears driving most of those panic buyers. Akin to the old adage \u2018show don\u2019t tell\u2019, what\u2019s needed is action not words.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Alexander Trautrims, an expert in logistics and supply chains at Nottingham University Business School said: \u201cRelaxing the restrictions on retail logistics are well overdue. Making it easier for supermarkets and the food sector to share resources and knowledge by waiving competition rules temporarily is another logical step. It is hard to believe that such measures were not part of a response plan prepared a long time ago sitting, ready to be implemented, in a government drawer.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK government has joined forces with retailers to make a coordinated appeal to shoppers to stop stockpiling food and to think of others as panic-buying continues in response to the coronavirus crisis. The environment secretary, George Eustice, who stood in for Boris Johnson on Saturday at the government\u2019s daily briefing, said that when people took more than they needed it made things difficult for frontline workers, such as NHS staff. He asked people to think of those finishing their late shifts and going to a supermarket only to find empty shelves. Eustice was flanked at the briefing by Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, and Steven Powis, the national medical director of NHS England. He said: \u201cWe recognise that this is a challenging time and there are many things the government is asking the nation to do differently as we work together to fight this pandemic. \u201cBe responsible when you shop and think of others. Buying more than you need means others may be left without.\u201d He stressed the message that \u201cthere is enough food available\u201d and ruled out government rationing, saying supermarket limits were already in place. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary for the government to intervene further to say what an appropriate limit is.\u201d Dickinson said there was now \u00a31bn worth of food in people\u2019s houses that had not yet been used. Powis appealed to people to consider NHS frontline staff as many had been faced with empty shelves by the time they finished their shifts. He referred to a video of a nurse, Dawn Bilbrough, that took off on social media on Friday. She filmed herself in her car, exhausted and crying, having just come out of a supermarket where she was unable to buy any fresh fruit or vegetables. \u201cI\u2019m a critical care nurse and I\u2019ve just finished 48 hours of work and I just wanted to get some stuff in for the next 48 hours,\u201d she said. \u201cThose people who are just stripping the shelves of basic foods, you just need to stop it because it\u2019s people like me that are going to be looking after you when you are at your lowest and just stop it, please.\u201d Powis said: \u201cWe should all be ashamed that this [the video] had to happen. It\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d Asked about possible government intervention to restrict food purchases, Eustice said: \u201cThe reality is that most of the supermarkets are already, of their own accord, putting limits on certain items so I don\u2019t think it is necessary or appropriate for the government to dictate this.\u201d He said people needed to \u201ccalm down\u201d and \u201conly buy what they need\u201d, and that it was for retailers to agree what the appropriate limit was on goods such as toilet paper. \u201cAll of the major retailers are working together and exercising their own judgment on where it\u2019s appropriate to put limits \u2013 item limits \u2013 on certain issues,\u201d he said. \u201cToilet roll is one, where, for reasons that are not really known, there was a spike early on, despite the fact that toilet roll is made in this country and they are able to expand production very quickly.\u201d The press conference followed a meeting between Johnson and supermarket bosses about panic buying on Saturday. There have been growing calls from MPs, academics, charities and those who work with vulnerable people to ensure food and other essentials are reaching those most in need. This weekend, 150 cross-party MPs and peers wrote to the government asking it to \u201cshow the direction and leadership necessary\u201d to ensure food supplies were available for all NHS, emergency and essential workers. Charities working with more vulnerable groups told the Observer they were becoming increasingly concerned that many people were facing real food shortages because they had no access to stores, and online shopping slots were booked weeks in advance. Many of those who could access food were struggling to pay for the few things that were available because the cheaper options were often the ones that had disappeared from shelves. The Salvation Army\u2019s leader in the UK and Ireland, Commissioner Anthony Cotterill, said: \u201cWe urge the government to bring all the major retailers together to develop a coordinated approach. Measures are urgently needed, in both urban and rural areas, to help older people and key workers access the groceries they need to remain healthy.\u201d Age UK expressed similar concerns, saying it was \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d that the problem of stockpiling was not going away despite the measures supermarkets have taken to try to address the issues, such as introducing pensioner-only hours in stores. The stockpiling showed no sign of abating this weekend. Before 6am on Saturday, hundreds of shoppers were filmed queueing round the block at major stores, including all the way around the car park at a Tesco in New Malden, south London. Steve Livington, 58, who lives alone in Peacehaven, West Sussex, is a wheelchair user and said he always shopped online. \u201cLast week I went to order my Tesco delivery and there was nothing for three weeks, and then the same for Sainsbury\u2019s and similarly for Asda,\u201d he said. Asked what he thought of the government\u2019s call for greater responsibility, he said: \u201cWords like those I sadly feel will do little to calm the irrational fears driving most of those panic buyers. Akin to the old adage \u2018show don\u2019t tell\u2019, what\u2019s needed is action not words.\u201d Dr Alexander Trautrims, an expert in logistics and supply chains at Nottingham University Business School said: \u201cRelaxing the restrictions on retail logistics are well overdue. Making it easier for supermarkets and the food sector to share resources and knowledge by waiving competition rules temporarily is another logical step. It is hard to believe that such measures were not part of a response plan prepared a long time ago sitting, ready to be implemented, in a government drawer.\u201d",

In Albert Camus\u2019s 1947 novel, <em>La Peste</em> (The Plague), the initially unbelievable spread of a lethal disease in a small town serves as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/05/albert-camus-the-plague-fascist-death-ed-vulliamy\" title=\"\">allegory for human suffering</a> in the fascist era. \u201cWe find it hard to believe in a pestilence when it descends upon us,\u201d he wrote. Camus continued: \u201cThere have been as many plagues in the world as there have been wars, yet plagues and wars always find people equally unprepared. When war breaks out, people say: \u2018It won\u2019t last long, it\u2019s too stupid.\u2019 And war is certainly too stupid, but that doesn\u2019t prevent it from lasting. Stupidity always carries doggedly on.\u201d</p> \n<p>War is not only stupid. It is by its nature divisive. And divisions spawned by Covid-19 are everywhere: in last week\u2019s ugly blame game between the US and China; in the closing of Europe\u2019s and America\u2019s borders to \u201cforeigners\u201d; in the failure, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-crisis-leaders-failing-gordon-brown\" title=\"\">as Gordon Brown says</a>, of the international community to join forces effectively.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/21/home-office-releases-300-from-detention-centres-amid-covid-19-pandemic\">Home Office releases 300 from detention centres amid Covid-19 pandemic</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The language of war divides communities.

In rural France, signs warn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/thank-you-parisians-dont-bring-the-virus-plea-from-rural-france\" title=\"\">fleeing Parisians</a> to go elsewhere \u2013 a disturbing echo of actual events during the Nazi occupation.</p> \n<p>The familiar, often unjustified democratic compromises that accompany real wars are already evident in the fight against Covid-19. Governments around the world <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-latam/military-roadblocks-curfews-latin-america-tightens-coronavirus-controls-idUSKBN2133BY\" title=\"\">assumed emergency powers</a> last week, limiting human rights such as freedom of movement and in some cases, freedom of speech. From Peru to Italy, troops took to the streets.</p> \n<p>Claiming to be bolstering safety yet feeding fear, politicians cite a vast threat from an \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d. As in an actual war, they deem collateral damage to be unfortunate but inevitable. All victims of coronavirus are innocent \u2013 yet some, like those thrown out of work or left penniless by arbitrary government decrees, are more innocent than others.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cf9f636e-383a-486a-bf64-2c0280ed2f22\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-v1xduw1mQE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Wartime democracy may be further compromised by the prospective suspension of parliaments and courts, and the postponement of elections. Local polls in France and Britain have been put off, as was last week\u2019s Democratic primary in Ohio. A question mark hovers over November\u2019s US presidential election. Having dismissed the virus as a hoax, Trump now wants to bribe voters with <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/coronavirus-trump-wants-payments-of-1000-for-adults-500-for-kids.html\" title=\"\">cash handouts</a>.</p> \n<p>Other institutional casualties in this new world of strife include the western churches, which have closed their doors to worshippers, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/saudi-arabia-bans-prayers-holy-mosques-coronavirus-fears-200320063001931.html\" title=\"\">as have mosques</a> in Islamic countries. If there is a strong message of faith to be found in the anxiety, misery and death attendant on the pandemic, it has yet to be widely heard. This is a secular war, waged in temporal time.</p> \n<p>As in past global conflicts, rivalrous allies are competing for postwar advantage. Western critics accuse China of trying to weaponise apparently successful suppression policies in Hubei to <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/19/china-us-eu-coronavirus-great-power-competition/\" title=\"\">showcase the advantages</a> of centralised, authoritarian governance over less organised democratic models.</p> \n<p>Europe and Trump\u2019s America are at odds on several fronts. Winning the battle with the virus is important. But for some, winning the wider geopolitical and moral argument may be more so.</p> \n<p>In this epic global confrontation \u2013 some even call it the third world war \u2013 symbolism matters. That\u2019s why Japan and sporting bodies are desperate that the Tokyo Olympics <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/51924635\" title=\"\">do not succumb</a>. The Games have become the Covid-19 Stalingrad equivalent. \u201cNot a step back\u201d is their borrowed, desperate motto.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>It\u2019s too soon to start naming war heroes. But Chris Whitty, Britain\u2019s chief medical adviser \u2013 the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51924796\" title=\"\">man with our lives in his hands</a>\u201d, as the BBC calls him \u2013 and the Imperial College epidemiologist, Neil Ferguson, have shown bravery under fire.</p> \n<p>When countries take up arms, an abiding question for those required to make sacrifices concerns the sort of society they want when it\u2019s all over. The war of Covid-19 has already produced some startling shifts, such as increased political and business support for universal basic income, state controls and environmentally friendly home working.</p> \n<p>Radical social upheaval may be the welcome price of eventual victory. It\u2019s often said, after a major conflict, that things will never be the same again. Nor should they be. Historically, war often leads to revolution.

In Albert Camus\u2019s 1947 novel, La Peste (The Plague), the initially unbelievable spread of a lethal disease in a small town serves as an allegory for human suffering in the fascist era. \u201cWe find it hard to believe in a pestilence when it descends upon us,\u201d he wrote. Camus continued: \u201cThere have been as many plagues in the world as there have been wars, yet plagues and wars always find people equally unprepared. When war breaks out, people say: \u2018It won\u2019t last long, it\u2019s too stupid.\u2019 And war is certainly too stupid, but that doesn\u2019t prevent it from lasting. Stupidity always carries doggedly on.\u201d War is not only stupid. It is by its nature divisive. And divisions spawned by Covid-19 are everywhere: in last week\u2019s ugly blame game between the US and China; in the closing of Europe\u2019s and America\u2019s borders to \u201cforeigners\u201d; in the failure, as Gordon Brown says, of the international community to join forces effectively. The language of war divides communities. For each volunteer supplying food to the elderly, there are legions of panicked shoppers stripping supermarkets in a particularly stupid bid to pre-empt \u201cwartime\u201d rationing. In rural France, signs warn fleeing Parisians to go elsewhere \u2013 a disturbing echo of actual events during the Nazi occupation. The familiar, often unjustified democratic compromises that accompany real wars are already evident in the fight against Covid-19. Governments around the world assumed emergency powers last week, limiting human rights such as freedom of movement and in some cases, freedom of speech. From Peru to Italy, troops took to the streets. Claiming to be bolstering safety yet feeding fear, politicians cite a vast threat from an \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d. As in an actual war, they deem collateral damage to be unfortunate but inevitable. All victims of coronavirus are innocent \u2013 yet some, like those thrown out of work or left penniless by arbitrary government decrees, are more innocent than others. Wartime democracy may be further compromised by the prospective suspension of parliaments and courts, and the postponement of elections. Local polls in France and Britain have been put off, as was last week\u2019s Democratic primary in Ohio. A question mark hovers over November\u2019s US presidential election. Having dismissed the virus as a hoax, Trump now wants to bribe voters with cash handouts. Other institutional casualties in this new world of strife include the western churches, which have closed their doors to worshippers, as have mosques in Islamic countries. If there is a strong message of faith to be found in the anxiety, misery and death attendant on the pandemic, it has yet to be widely heard. This is a secular war, waged in temporal time. As in past global conflicts, rivalrous allies are competing for postwar advantage. Western critics accuse China of trying to weaponise apparently successful suppression policies in Hubei to showcase the advantages of centralised, authoritarian governance over less organised democratic models. Europe and Trump\u2019s America are at odds on several fronts. Winning the battle with the virus is important. But for some, winning the wider geopolitical and moral argument may be more so. In this epic global confrontation \u2013 some even call it the third world war \u2013 symbolism matters. That\u2019s why Japan and sporting bodies are desperate that the Tokyo Olympics do not succumb. The Games have become the Covid-19 Stalingrad equivalent. \u201cNot a step back\u201d is their borrowed, desperate motto. It\u2019s too soon to start naming war heroes. But Chris Whitty, Britain\u2019s chief medical adviser \u2013 the \u201cman with our lives in his hands\u201d, as the BBC calls him \u2013 and the Imperial College epidemiologist, Neil Ferguson, have shown bravery under fire. When countries take up arms, an abiding question for those required to make sacrifices concerns the sort of society they want when it\u2019s all over. The war of Covid-19 has already produced some startling shifts, such as increased political and business support for universal basic income, state controls and environmentally friendly home working. Radical social upheaval may be the welcome price of eventual victory. It\u2019s often said, after a major conflict, that things will never be the same again. Nor should they be. Historically, war often leads to revolution. Armchair generals Trump and Johnson please note. \u2022 Simon Tisdall is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>September 2019. Was there ever a better time to be a professional cricketer in England? The game was buzzing after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over\">the country\u2019s World Cup victory</a>, another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/25/australia-ashes-england-third-test-ben-stokes-sensational\">preposterous win at Headingley</a> against Australia and a massive television deal done and dusted (even though some of us were wary of the contents).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/20/ecb-no-cricket-may-battles-save-season\">No cricket until 28 May as ECB battles to save season and keep Tests alive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The players were overrun with options as their agents flitted from one T20 franchise to another to secure more lucrative deals. The Hundred offered English cricketers \u2013 and quite a few Kolpaks \u2013 an irresistible windfall. Famous coaches were hired from afar with no expense spared. By the standards of the past, the game was awash with money and a player could plot his own unique career path, which need not be so dependent on the old county system.</p> <p>But now the corridors are packed with uncertainty. Pay cuts are on the horizon, as has been the case <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/20/premiership-rugby-clubs-players-pay-cut-coronavirus\">among Premiership rugby union clubs</a>, and the T20 gigs are in doubt. So too are the international matches that have always been the lifeblood of the game.</p> <p>Cricketers, we discover, are not key workers. In fact there has been an interesting recalibration of what constitutes a key worker. For some reason this does not extend to hedge fund managers, Premier League footballers, estate agents or even sports journalists.</p> <p>For the moment our cricketers are in limbo, at least until 28 May, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/20/ecb-no-cricket-may-battles-save-season\">Friday\u2019s England and Wales Cricket Board announcement</a>. The ECB must try to salvage something from the 2020 season, although it is a task way beyond its control. Yet the sport\u2019s governing body is attempting to outline a variety of options that are dependent upon when the playing of cricket becomes a safe and acceptable activity again.</p> <p>One option is to play county games \u2013 and Test matches, which are so much more important in terms of income \u2013 behind closed doors. This is not the time for wisecracks along the lines of: \u201cDon\u2019t they do that already?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3fa4463c28c98400675c58cc85702995fce8e3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3fa4463c28c98400675c58cc85702995fce8e3f/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Essex Eagles lift the T20 Blast trophy last year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Essex Eagles celebrate winning last year\u2019s T20 Blast, a competition that generates significant income for counties.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The situation is too grave and in any case that cliche of sparse crowds is not universally true. Going behind closed doors is a horrible option but in these times that does not necessarily mean it should be ruled out immediately.</p> <p>How many people would have to be in the ground to allow such a match to proceed? At least 100 perhaps, even if we expel the annoying camera operator whose job is to follow the dismissed batsman off the field at close quarters? Would that figure be acceptable to the experts \u2013 or the players?</p> <p>There may well be no red-ball cricket this summer at domestic level, such is the understandable eagerness to satisfy the TV companies. The grounds could be empty for months.

      "bodyText": "September 2019. Was there ever a better time to be a professional cricketer in England? The game was buzzing after the country\u2019s World Cup victory, another preposterous win at Headingley against Australia and a massive television deal done and dusted (even though some of us were wary of the contents). The players were overrun with options as their agents flitted from one T20 franchise to another to secure more lucrative deals. The Hundred offered English cricketers \u2013 and quite a few Kolpaks \u2013 an irresistible windfall. Famous coaches were hired from afar with no expense spared. By the standards of the past, the game was awash with money and a player could plot his own unique career path, which need not be so dependent on the old county system. But now the corridors are packed with uncertainty. Pay cuts are on the horizon, as has been the case among Premiership rugby union clubs, and the T20 gigs are in doubt. So too are the international matches that have always been the lifeblood of the game. Cricketers, we discover, are not key workers. In fact there has been an interesting recalibration of what constitutes a key worker. For some reason this does not extend to hedge fund managers, Premier League footballers, estate agents or even sports journalists. For the moment our cricketers are in limbo, at least until 28 May, after Friday\u2019s England and Wales Cricket Board announcement. The ECB must try to salvage something from the 2020 season, although it is a task way beyond its control. Yet the sport\u2019s governing body is attempting to outline a variety of options that are dependent upon when the playing of cricket becomes a safe and acceptable activity again. One option is to play county games \u2013 and Test matches, which are so much more important in terms of income \u2013 behind closed doors. This is not the time for wisecracks along the lines of: \u201cDon\u2019t they do that already?\u201d The situation is too grave and in any case that cliche of sparse crowds is not universally true. Going behind closed doors is a horrible option but in these times that does not necessarily mean it should be ruled out immediately. How many people would have to be in the ground to allow such a match to proceed? At least 100 perhaps, even if we expel the annoying camera operator whose job is to follow the dismissed batsman off the field at close quarters? Would that figure be acceptable to the experts \u2013 or the players? There may well be no red-ball cricket this summer at domestic level, such is the understandable eagerness to satisfy the TV companies. The grounds could be empty for months. Even if no cricket is permitted, might it be possible in our towns and cities for the open spaces of some of our grounds to be available as exercise areas, provided a safe distance is kept? In fine weather could the big screens be used to provide open-air cinemas? It will be important for the clubs to remain relevant by engaging with their local communities. And they will want to generate some income. For the counties the T20 Blast fills this function better than anything else and there is surely every chance this competition will be switched to the later part of the season. If there is no red-ball cricket it may be possible to experiment \u2013 or revert to \u2013 a knockout 50-over competition that would give county members something more substantial to watch. And then, of course, there isthe Hundred. As the overseas players become more hesitant or just more unavailable \u2013 the withdrawal of David Warner from Southern Brave (the team based in Southampton) may not be the last absentee among the Australians \u2013 there may be a case to postpone it until 2021, though some may prefer a permanent abandonment. A postponement will not happen unless the virus demolishes the entire season. The ECB has invested so much in this competition, which helps to explain why its reserves to deal with unforeseen events have slumped from \u00a370m to around \u00a310m, that it will be determined to proceed with it come what may.

He was distracted in an editorial meeting earlier this week because his mother was repeatedly phoning him with questions about coronavirus. His mother has underlying health conditions and cares for his uncle, who has Down syndrome.</p> <p>That was when Rob realised that telling his family\u2019s story was an opportunity to help others across the country struggling to understand the rapidly changing information coming out of government. In the resulting video, which has had more than 135,000 views on Twitter, Rob talks to his mum about the difference between social distancing and self-isolation, and explains why he can\u2019t come near her at the moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Video: social distancing\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Confused about the difference between self-isolation and social distancing - and who should do it? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Watch this as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/robosborneitv?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@robosborneitv&lt;/a&gt; explains, with the help of his mum, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ckkhaira?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ckkhaira&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/SNzpDRFxsz&quot;&gt;https://t.co/SNzpDRFxsz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/covid19?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#covid19&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/wC6ezmAqRC&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/wC6ezmAqRC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; ITV Wales News (@ITVWales) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ITVWales/status/1241068501076410376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 20, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere is an absolutely desperate need for clarity and information. \u2018Hold their hand\u2019 is the phrase they [senior editors] are using. We have a moral duty to explain this. This may well be the biggest story we ever cover and the public are turning to us for information.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that the virus is likely to impact the country for weeks or months to come means it is important that journalists do not burn out. This is a marathon. We\u2019re in this for the long haul,\u201d said Osborne.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been able to separate the story from my own feelings. I\u2019ve covered some horrific stories. But with this, it\u2019s the personal element. For me yesterday it was that my uncle doesn\u2019t understand why he can\u2019t go out because he has Down syndrome. It\u2019s normally me who takes him out but I can\u2019t do it. That\u2019s when I took a deep breath.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough. We\u2019re professionals, but this is going to affect us all. And I think the public appreciate that. The human touch is appreciated.\u201d</p> <p>Job security is also another issue affecting the mental health of journalists, many of whom are freelancers and not entitled to statutory sick pay. Whilst the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the government would cover 80% of workers\u2019 salaries to keep them on the payroll, there is currently no protection for the self-employed. The National Union of Journalists says its freelance office has been inundated with enquiries from members who are already suffering.</p> <p>One said: \u201cI am a sport journalist left with no work at all as a result of the near-blanket cancellation of all sport. As a husband and father, I still have considerable monthly outgoings \u2013 just limited funds with which to meet my responsibilities.\u201d</p> <p>Another sport journalist who has lost most of his work said: \u201cI have a mortgage and children. My children finish school and nursery on Friday, yet we have been told we will still be charged the monthly fee for the nursery. Thank god my wife is still working, but her own job could be in jeopardy despite her boss reassuring her she is OK for now.\u201d</p> <p>Hannah Storm, director of the Ethical Journalism Network, who has been working for the past decade in journalism safety, wrote: \u201cNews organisations have had to reinvent decades of working practices in days. Large numbers of journalists are self-isolating or quarantined, travel has been reduced between countries and within countries. As Covid-19 spreads, so do the levels of anxiety around what we know and don\u2019t know, who and what to trust, and how to stay safe \u2013 physically and mentally \u2013 as journalists working in uncertain times.\u201d</p> <p>The BBC told the Guardian: \u201cCovid-19 is a harrowing story for everyone, including our staff. The BBC takes seriously its responsibility to support employees during this time and there are support structures in place to ensure we do this effectively. We are determined to carry on covering the story for the public and will continue to do so for as long as it takes.\u201d</p>",

Journalists delivering public service broadcasting have been identified as key workers along with health workers and those providing essential public services, meaning they can still send their children to school whilst they go to work. Many feel under enormous pressure to make sure that the public are getting the right information about the outbreak. For Rob Osborne, the National Correspondent for ITV Wales, looking after his family while continuing to report on the virus is putting him, like many journalists and others in frontline professions, under pressure. He was distracted in an editorial meeting earlier this week because his mother was repeatedly phoning him with questions about coronavirus. His mother has underlying health conditions and cares for his uncle, who has Down syndrome. That was when Rob realised that telling his family\u2019s story was an opportunity to help others across the country struggling to understand the rapidly changing information coming out of government. In the resulting video, which has had more than 135,000 views on Twitter, Rob talks to his mum about the difference between social distancing and self-isolation, and explains why he can\u2019t come near her at the moment. \u201cThere is an absolutely desperate need for clarity and information. \u2018Hold their hand\u2019 is the phrase they [senior editors] are using. We have a moral duty to explain this. This may well be the biggest story we ever cover and the public are turning to us for information. \u201cThe fact that the virus is likely to impact the country for weeks or months to come means it is important that journalists do not burn out. This is a marathon. We\u2019re in this for the long haul,\u201d said Osborne. \u201cI\u2019ve always been able to separate the story from my own feelings. I\u2019ve covered some horrific stories. But with this, it\u2019s the personal element. For me yesterday it was that my uncle doesn\u2019t understand why he can\u2019t go out because he has Down syndrome. It\u2019s normally me who takes him out but I can\u2019t do it. That\u2019s when I took a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough. We\u2019re professionals, but this is going to affect us all. And I think the public appreciate that. The human touch is appreciated.\u201d Job security is also another issue affecting the mental health of journalists, many of whom are freelancers and not entitled to statutory sick pay. Whilst the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the government would cover 80% of workers\u2019 salaries to keep them on the payroll, there is currently no protection for the self-employed. The National Union of Journalists says its freelance office has been inundated with enquiries from members who are already suffering. One said: \u201cI am a sport journalist left with no work at all as a result of the near-blanket cancellation of all sport. As a husband and father, I still have considerable monthly outgoings \u2013 just limited funds with which to meet my responsibilities.\u201d Another sport journalist who has lost most of his work said: \u201cI have a mortgage and children. My children finish school and nursery on Friday, yet we have been told we will still be charged the monthly fee for the nursery. Thank god my wife is still working, but her own job could be in jeopardy despite her boss reassuring her she is OK for now.\u201d Hannah Storm, director of the Ethical Journalism Network, who has been working for the past decade in journalism safety, wrote: \u201cNews organisations have had to reinvent decades of working practices in days. Large numbers of journalists are self-isolating or quarantined, travel has been reduced between countries and within countries. As Covid-19 spreads, so do the levels of anxiety around what we know and don\u2019t know, who and what to trust, and how to stay safe \u2013 physically and mentally \u2013 as journalists working in uncertain times.\u201d The BBC told the Guardian: \u201cCovid-19 is a harrowing story for everyone, including our staff. The BBC takes seriously its responsibility to support employees during this time and there are support structures in place to ensure we do this effectively. We are determined to carry on covering the story for the public and will continue to do so for as long as it takes.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government will on Sunday unveil a $66.4bn stimulus package, including cash payments and a new loan guarantee scheme for small to medium enterprises, and income support for workers and businesses hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Sunday\u2019s package of measures will bring the total value of the economic stimulus to $189bn, which is equivalent to more than 9% of Australia\u2019s GDP \u2013 and the prime minister is expected to telegraph a third stimulus package over the coming months in an effort to cushion the significant economic shock associated with the pandemic. The new cash payments to be unveiled on Sunday will be open both to businesses with turnovers of $50m or less, and eligible not-for-profit charities. The $25.2bn measure will give around 720,000 small enterprises cash payments equivalent to the tax employers withhold from their employees salary and wages. Eligible enterprises will get a payment equal to 100% of the amount tax withheld, up to a maximum payment of $100,000, which can be used as a wage subsidy. The government will also create a new loan guarantee scheme for small and medium enterprises. Under the proposal, the commonwealth will guarantee 50% of an eligible loan through participating banks to firms disrupted by the coronavirus. The guarantee will support lending worth $40bn to enterprises with turnovers of less than $50m. The loans can be unsecured, and used for working capital, and will have to be granted within six months starting 1 April 2020. Lenders will not be charged a fee for accessing the guarantee scheme. Loans will be repayment free for six months. The maximum that can be borrowed under the guarantee facility will be $250,000 on terms up to three years. Sunday\u2019s package will also include additional income support measures for both workers and businesses, building on the first stimulus package, worth $17.6bn. Australia\u2019s central bank and the government have also agreed to pump $105bn into the financial system to keep credit flowing to businesses on the frontline of the economic shock created by the pandemic. Last Friday the retail banks also agreed to give small businesses a six-month break from making repayments on their loans under a coronavirus relief package. Sunday\u2019s second stimulus package, to be unveiled by the prime minister and the treasurer in Canberra ahead of a scaled-back parliamentary sitting to legislate the measures, comes as the number of coronavirus cases in Australia has now exceeded 1,000. On Saturday, New South Wales confirmed 83 new cases, the largest daily increase for the state so far, with Victoria reporting another 51. NSW Health has faced significant criticism after allowing thousands of passengers to disembark from the Ruby Princess cruise ship and disperse into the community. Four passengers subsequently positive for Covid-19. With people continuing to circulate in the community, authorities were forced to amplify social distancing messages. Bondi beach in Sydney was shut on Saturday after a crowd gathered in breach of current bans on non-essential outdoor gatherings of more than 500 people. The health minister, Greg Hunt, warned Australians to think of people being put at risk by a failure to observe social distancing. \u201cIf you are breaking those rules you are putting, not just yourself, but you\u2019re putting other Australians at risk.\u201d \u201cWhat happened in Bondi was unacceptable and the local council must take steps to stop that occurring,\u201d he said. After the bans on mass gatherings of more than 500 people outdoors and 100 people indoors, new limits were set on Friday for smaller indoor gatherings of fewer than 100 people. The government also flagged down locking down neighbourhoods in the event there were clusters of infections. Ahead of Sunday\u2019s stimulus announcement, Morrison said in a statement the next few months would be a \u201cdifficult journey\u201d and things would get worse before they get better. \u201cThere is a lot of pain coming but we\u2019re going to cushion the blow as best we can,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cIn the event that someone does regrettably lose their job because of the coronavirus it\u2019s very important that business give their workers the confidence that this is just temporary, and that when they reopen their doors and get back to business that they will want to get them back on the payroll as soon as possible\u201d. Since the pandemic hit, Qantas has stood down without pay 20,000 of its 30,000 workers, Virgin has made staff take leave without pay, Flight Centre has closed 100 stores, and Australian-listed retailers with overseas operations have shut outlets across Europe and North America. Australia\u2019s border is expected to be closed to overseas visitors for six months or more. A number of market economists are predicting Australia will endure a recession.

What should we think about before we make a decision to share information on social media, go out and mix with others or make purchases at stores?</p> <p>\u201cIn some ways this is a perfect scenario for misinformation to thrive \u2013 it\u2019s fast moving, it threatens everyone and there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty,\u201d says Dr Will Grant, of the Australian National Centre for the Public Awareness of Science.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not quite a wicked problem like climate change in that Covid 19 is really pretty visible, linear and with strong historical parallels, but this is definitely an environment where information and misinformation will spread rapidly.\u201d</p> <h2>1. Consider the source</h2> <p>New information is coming at us in charts, graphs, modelling results, social media posts, news articles, podcasts, TV bulletins and from friends and people we meet.</p> <p>Few of us are epidemiologists, statisticians or healthcare experts, and fewer still are likely to have a good enough grasp on all the information that\u2019s out there.</p> <p>One unifying theme is that we should all be considering the advice of experts. But what is an expert?</p> <p>Lyndal Byford, of the Australian Science Media Centre, says: \u201cThe main thing to consider is who is making the claim. Ask yourself what is the source of the information. Is the post from a reputable organisation such as the World Health Organization or is it based on a post by an individual who heard something that someone else told them.</p> <p>\u201cMisinformation can often read like a rumour. It is also worth thinking about who funds that organisation. Do they stand to make a profit from the information they are sharing?\u201d</p> <p>Grant says everyone should \u201cslow down\u201d before they decide to share information.</p> <p>\u201cBut more importantly, listen to key sources of authority \u2013 for example, chief medical officers \u2013 before changing any behaviour based on something you read online. If the chief medical officer says something is dangerous but something you read online says it\u2019s fine, go with the chief medical officer.\u201d</p> <p>Ben Newell, professor of cognitive psychology at the University of New South Wales, says we should always check the sources of information, \u201cand check the intention of the person that puts it there\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe should stop and wonder why we have been sent something, and the impact of sending that information on to others.\u201d</p> <p>Newell said Australians rightly had a \u201chealthy scepticism\u201d for people in authority, and events like the sports rorts scandal were likely to have eroded trust.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard for people to now recalibrate and say to themselves, this is now a situation where I should listen to the people who are in positions of authority,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we should, and for good reason.\u201d</p> <p>Public health authorities, the World Health Organization and national science academies are reliable sources of information. Advice from your hairdresser probably isn\u2019t.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mckinnon_a/status/1240475633219538947\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">my partner&#39;s hairdresser sent out an email blast with some &quot;tips&quot; on how to avoid COVID-19. they are ... not good <a href=\"https://t.co/TeSsqN4HPs\">pic.twitter.com/TeSsqN4HPs</a></p>&mdash; Alex McKinnon (@mckinnon_a) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mckinnon_a/status/1240475633219538947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 19, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>2.

      "bodyText": "How do we deal with new information about Covid-19 at a time when the science, the advice and the consequences of the pandemic are all changing rapidly? People are being bombarded with new information at a time of heightened stress and it\u2019s playing damaging games with our decision making. So how do we decide what\u2019s good information and what isn\u2019t? What should we think about before we make a decision to share information on social media, go out and mix with others or make purchases at stores? \u201cIn some ways this is a perfect scenario for misinformation to thrive \u2013 it\u2019s fast moving, it threatens everyone and there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty,\u201d says Dr Will Grant, of the Australian National Centre for the Public Awareness of Science. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite a wicked problem like climate change in that Covid 19 is really pretty visible, linear and with strong historical parallels, but this is definitely an environment where information and misinformation will spread rapidly.\u201d 1. Consider the source New information is coming at us in charts, graphs, modelling results, social media posts, news articles, podcasts, TV bulletins and from friends and people we meet. Few of us are epidemiologists, statisticians or healthcare experts, and fewer still are likely to have a good enough grasp on all the information that\u2019s out there. One unifying theme is that we should all be considering the advice of experts. But what is an expert? Lyndal Byford, of the Australian Science Media Centre, says: \u201cThe main thing to consider is who is making the claim. Ask yourself what is the source of the information. Is the post from a reputable organisation such as the World Health Organization or is it based on a post by an individual who heard something that someone else told them. \u201cMisinformation can often read like a rumour. It is also worth thinking about who funds that organisation. Do they stand to make a profit from the information they are sharing?\u201d Grant says everyone should \u201cslow down\u201d before they decide to share information. \u201cBut more importantly, listen to key sources of authority \u2013 for example, chief medical officers \u2013 before changing any behaviour based on something you read online. If the chief medical officer says something is dangerous but something you read online says it\u2019s fine, go with the chief medical officer.\u201d Ben Newell, professor of cognitive psychology at the University of New South Wales, says we should always check the sources of information, \u201cand check the intention of the person that puts it there\u201d. \u201cWe should stop and wonder why we have been sent something, and the impact of sending that information on to others.\u201d Newell said Australians rightly had a \u201chealthy scepticism\u201d for people in authority, and events like the sports rorts scandal were likely to have eroded trust. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for people to now recalibrate and say to themselves, this is now a situation where I should listen to the people who are in positions of authority,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we should, and for good reason.\u201d Public health authorities, the World Health Organization and national science academies are reliable sources of information. Advice from your hairdresser probably isn\u2019t. 2. Be wary of preliminary scientific findings Under normal circumstances, new findings in science come at us through a long process of research, peer review and academic publishing that can take years to develop. The Sars-CoV-2 virus was only defined in January and, while some assumptions can be made about how its close relatives have behaved, what\u2019s known about the virus and the illness is still a work in progress. Byford says scientists are sharing information with each other as quickly as they can. \u201cThis is vital to ensure there are no delays in moving towards treatments or vaccines. But it also means that lots of the information reaching the public hasn\u2019t been through the usual science \u2018quality check\u2019 that is peer review.\u201d Findings from research that\u2019s made public without being checked by other experts could \u201cchange dramatically\u201d after peer review has been carried out, Byford says, and she would \u201cdiscourage the public from sharing this sort of information\u201d. \u201cIf you do want to share it, perhaps include a note that it is preliminary work and has not been reviewed and scrutinised by independent experts.\u201d All of this also means that what may have been good information a few days or weeks ago may become out of date. 3. Remember that stress affects decision making We\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic \u2013 a situation few of us have experienced \u2013 and our screens are filled with frightening content. Newell says when we have \u201cadditional cognitive load\u201d, this creates inconsistency in our decision making. \u201cThat means we should push that pause button and then ask ourselves about the basis for the decision we are about to make.\u201d Prof Mike Kyrios, director of \u00d3rama Institute of Mental Health, Wellbeing and Neuroscience at Flinders University, says it\u2019s very important for people to \u201cswitch off\u201d from the \u201coverwhelming emotional content\u201d of the crisis each day.

      "body": "<p>The news rolls in like waves. One unfathomably huge development crashing on another. President Donald Trump has shut US borders. Now Australia is closed to foreigners too. Scott Morrison is spending billions. The surplus is history, a recession now inevitable. The graph of confirmed cases soars. The death count climbs. The job losses rise. We were allowed to attend the football, then only smaller gatherings, now we have to measure the space between us and other human beings, soon there may be localised lock downs. Daily life is shutting down, closing in, to makeshift home offices and socially distant outings to supermarkets where there\u2019s not much to buy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/what-a-difference-a-week-makes-how-coronavirus-changed-australia\">And that\u2019s just in the last week.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-the-guardians-promise-to-our-readers\">Coronavirus: the Guardian's promise to our readers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m thinking carefully about how Guardian Australia reports on the biggest event of our lives. How do we track these daily convulsions and make sense of how society is shattering and how or when it will recover. Reporting the coronavirus pandemic is a defining challenge and responsibility for the news media. It demands deep consideration.</p> <p>Above all else \u2013 as our global editor in chief, Katharine Viner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-the-guardians-promise-to-our-readers\">promised readers this week</a> \u2013 we must provide reliable, factual, trustworthy information that holds firm against the conspiracy theories and misinformation swirling through social media. Being part of a global news organisation dedicated to deep factual reporting of this global crisis gives us strength and depth. We will track the best information on the disease and its treatment, question how authorities are handling the crisis, consider how decisions affect everyone, including the vulnerable, and try to understand the social and economic impacts as they strike.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Given the stakes are quite literally life and death, we must also be able to question those decisions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But those commitments raise so many more questions.</p> <p>How, for example, should we balance legitimate questioning of government decisions with the danger of further undermining public faith in expert advice and institutions? Of course we condemn shock jock Alan Jones for asserting that concerns about Covid-19 amount to \u201chysteria and alarmism \u2026 the health version of global warming\u201d, especially irresponsible considering the age demographic of his audience.

      "bodyText": "The news rolls in like waves. One unfathomably huge development crashing on another. President Donald Trump has shut US borders. Now Australia is closed to foreigners too. Scott Morrison is spending billions. The surplus is history, a recession now inevitable. The graph of confirmed cases soars. The death count climbs. The job losses rise. We were allowed to attend the football, then only smaller gatherings, now we have to measure the space between us and other human beings, soon there may be localised lock downs. Daily life is shutting down, closing in, to makeshift home offices and socially distant outings to supermarkets where there\u2019s not much to buy. And that\u2019s just in the last week. I\u2019m thinking carefully about how Guardian Australia reports on the biggest event of our lives. How do we track these daily convulsions and make sense of how society is shattering and how or when it will recover. Reporting the coronavirus pandemic is a defining challenge and responsibility for the news media. It demands deep consideration. Above all else \u2013 as our global editor in chief, Katharine Viner, promised readers this week \u2013 we must provide reliable, factual, trustworthy information that holds firm against the conspiracy theories and misinformation swirling through social media. Being part of a global news organisation dedicated to deep factual reporting of this global crisis gives us strength and depth. We will track the best information on the disease and its treatment, question how authorities are handling the crisis, consider how decisions affect everyone, including the vulnerable, and try to understand the social and economic impacts as they strike. But those commitments raise so many more questions. How, for example, should we balance legitimate questioning of government decisions with the danger of further undermining public faith in expert advice and institutions? Of course we condemn shock jock Alan Jones for asserting that concerns about Covid-19 amount to \u201chysteria and alarmism \u2026 the health version of global warming\u201d, especially irresponsible considering the age demographic of his audience. But what about much more informed criticism of the Australian government, and its advice from the chief medical officer, from respected ABC presenter Norman Swan or health adviser Bill Bowtell, or the analysis of the various \u201cendgame options\u201d from the Grattan Institute that Guardian Australia published this weekend. The official advice did seem chaotic in the early days, it did swing wildly in the course of a day and decisions were insufficiently explained. The government is making huge and difficult decisions in a rapidly changing environment. We have to take that into account. Given the stakes are quite literally life and death, we must also be able to question those decisions. But we have to consider the implications of those questions at a time when faith in public institutions is already shaky. A deeply polarised country needs to trust and stick with a plan. Yes, politicians may have done much to breed that lack of trust, but there are consequences for everyone if contempt for government undermines the need for a unified and urgent response to public health measures. When does legitimate scrutiny cross the line to become counterproductive? These difficult judgments must be made on a daily basis. This story is, by definition, terrifying and bewildering, but can the facts be presented in a way that makes them less so? Should we be doing more to precis, summarise and contextualise? Are we at risk of overloading readers with more information than they can possibly process?

Everything seemed possible. And then on Friday morning: \u201cLevel 3: reconsider your need to travel.\u201d In less than an hour everything had changed. We booked the first flights that would get us home.</p> <p>I\u2019d heard correctly: the entire country was closing, doors slamming like a wave behind us as we drove to Malaga airport. Waiting nervously for check-in, we reviewed the news. A flight on its way to Spain was turned back. The Spanish passengers on that flight were now, presumably, stranded in London. We huddled in a corner, hands in pockets, focusing on the cancellations listed on the departure board.</p> <p>In the queue, a toddler was licking a metal pole. His father glanced down and chuckled affectionately. To a person, we all shuffled away, averting our eyes, disconnecting. It\u2019s uncomfortable, moving through the world like this. On board another toddler \u2013 this one with a mother travelling alone \u2013 turned on his seat to sing, inviting praise. Normally I\u2019d engage, offer the parent a moment\u2019s pause. But mindful now of everyone\u2019s risk, I kept my eyes on my book.</p> <p>The air stewards, at work since dawn, remained calm. Everyone was buckled up, ready \u2013 we hoped\u2013 for take-off, when a new group of passengers boarded, flustered, without boarding passes. Trying to keep our sticky breath to ourselves, we waited, everything strangely quiet. A series of historical events played in my mind, moments when everything changed rapidly. I wondered if now would be a good time to re-establish my old belief in interventionist prayer.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been on many delayed flights with angry passengers demanding that the flight move, that people take action, dammit. This time someone shouted thank you to the crew, and it echoed along the seats like a song. The pilot emerged from the cockpit.</p> <p>\u201cFolks, we are doing our best to get you home. In Paris this morning we didn\u2019t think we would get here. But we\u2019re here now and we\u2019ll get you to London as soon as we can.\u201d Applause rippled through the cabin. Against the stories of antisocial hoarding, the quiet courtesy of my fellow travellers gave me hope.</p> <p>Two days of moving in a contained bubble, avoiding contact, standing away from people, was unnatural, impossible. Social distancing will never be my key strength. At dinner in the Gatwick airport hotel, desperate for connection, we struck up a safe-distance conversation with Jade and Liz, smart, energetic women about to holiday in Egypt. Richard cleared his throat: \u201cFlights may be grounded.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou might get stuck overseas like we nearly did,\u201d I added. The women insisted. They\u2019d got the kids sorted, meals in the freezer. A bit of sun, just what the doctor ordered. I was terrified for them and told them so, but they were going. When Liz, in a natural moment of connection, put her hand on my wrist, I recoiled and reached for my hand sanitiser.</p> <p>In the morning a pilot stepped into the lift with us. We asked him how his company was doing. \u201cAll our flights are grounded,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just off to rescue some passengers.\u201d I thought of Liz and Jade and asked where he was due to fly. \u201cEgypt,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>It\u2019s true everything has changed, more rapidly than we could have imagined. But these things do remain: resilience, imagination, hope. The things we\u2019ve always called on to find solutions to the impossible.</p> <p>We arrived home to a kitchen full of groceries left by a dear friend, a series of text messages from neighbours, doorstep gifts of eggs and chocolate. In the end, we are each other. Not individuals, travelling through the world in isolated bubbles, but community.</p> <p>This is how we will make it through these next months and years: together. Courteously, calmly, at a slightly greater physical distance, but with continuing gratitude and, whenever we can, with applause.</p> <ul> <li><p>Kathryn Heyman is a Sydney author</p></li> </ul>",

In Paris this morning we didn\u2019t think we would get here. But we\u2019re here now and we\u2019ll get you to London as soon as we can.\u201d Applause rippled through the cabin. Against the stories of antisocial hoarding, the quiet courtesy of my fellow travellers gave me hope. Two days of moving in a contained bubble, avoiding contact, standing away from people, was unnatural, impossible. Social distancing will never be my key strength. At dinner in the Gatwick airport hotel, desperate for connection, we struck up a safe-distance conversation with Jade and Liz, smart, energetic women about to holiday in Egypt. Richard cleared his throat: \u201cFlights may be grounded.\u201d \u201cYou might get stuck overseas like we nearly did,\u201d I added. The women insisted. They\u2019d got the kids sorted, meals in the freezer. A bit of sun, just what the doctor ordered. I was terrified for them and told them so, but they were going. When Liz, in a natural moment of connection, put her hand on my wrist, I recoiled and reached for my hand sanitiser. In the morning a pilot stepped into the lift with us. We asked him how his company was doing. \u201cAll our flights are grounded,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just off to rescue some passengers.\u201d I thought of Liz and Jade and asked where he was due to fly. \u201cEgypt,\u201d he replied. It\u2019s true everything has changed, more rapidly than we could have imagined. But these things do remain: resilience, imagination, hope. The things we\u2019ve always called on to find solutions to the impossible. We arrived home to a kitchen full of groceries left by a dear friend, a series of text messages from neighbours, doorstep gifts of eggs and chocolate. In the end, we are each other. Not individuals, travelling through the world in isolated bubbles, but community. This is how we will make it through these next months and years: together. Courteously, calmly, at a slightly greater physical distance, but with continuing gratitude and, whenever we can, with applause. Kathryn Heyman is a Sydney author",

The self-employed would benefit from measures such as the deferral of self-assessment tax requirements, the holidays for mortgage payers and the strengthening of the welfare \u201csafety net\u201d, he said. \u201cWe are looking at operationally what we can roll out to people,\u201d he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \u201cThe main thing we have done is two-fold: it is to support the economy as a whole, because the best thing for people who are self-employed as for all people is to sustain the economy and ensure that we can return with those viable businesses, and alongside that, strengthen the safety net. \u201cSo we have increased the allowance on universal credit, we have made it available from day one, we have removed the minimum income floor so if people who are self-employed are working less than 35 hours in a week they are not penalised within the benefits system.\u201d Pressed on whether the government would come forward with measures specifically for the self-employed, he said: \u201cI come back to this underlying point about operationally what is difficult to do and what can be delivered to the timescales we are working to.\u201d",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He told the BBC he believed the \u201cgreat NHS\u201d would have saved her had she been treated by the hospital local to the family\u2019s home in the UK.</p> \n<p>\u201cMyself and my four children are absolutely devastated to lose the most beautiful wife and mother,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s so generous, she\u2019s so full of life, she\u2019s so powerful, courageous, supportive of all of us.

In Wuhan, the Chinese city where Covid-19 emerged three months ago, more than 800 prisoners were reportedly infected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Last Friday the prison population of England and Wales stood at 83,500, the highest in western Europe. So far, two people in UK prisons have tested positive for the virus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/first-uk-prisoner-with-covid-19-confirmed-at-strangeways-manchester\" title=\"\">one at Strangeways in Manchester and another at HMP High Down, Surrey</a>.</p> <p>This weekend David Gauke, a former justice secretary, called for the suspension of short sentences and the early release of some prisoners to avoid coronavirus spreading through prisons.</p> <p>\u201cThe advantage of not sending people inside for short sentences is that it reduces the churn,\u201d Gauke said. \u201cThat is really important. There is a lot of churn in prisons, with people coming in and out. That creates a risk.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a strong case for releasing some of those coming towards the end of their sentence a few months earlier. One should not overstate how significant that could be in reducing risks.\u201d</p> <p>The UK government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-prisons-and-other-prescribed-places-of-detention-guidance/covid-19-prisons-and-other-prescribed-places-of-detention-guidance\" title=\"\">advice for prisons</a> last Wednesday recommended \u201cprotective isolation\u201d for inmates displaying symptoms. However, this has been updated following discussions with Public Health England to introduce \u201crobust contingency plans\u201d.</p> <p>Andrew Hayward, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at UCL, said: \u201cIsolating suspected cases is important but because some people spread infection before they develop symptoms. Outbreaks can still start easily and spread rapidly through overcrowded prisons.</p> <p>\u201cMoving the most vulnerable prisoners to less-crowded parts of the prison system, where outbreaks are easier to prevent and contain, and reducing mixing with other prisoners could save many lives.\u201d</p> <p>Hayward, who is also on a government national advisory committee for tackling coronavirus, added: \u201cOne of my main concerns is that we\u2019ve not really got to grips with the likelihood of big outbreaks in institutional settings.\u201d</p> <p>Those fears follow the first indications of an outbreak at a UK prison with around <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-51966387\" title=\"\">75 officers at HMP Berwyn in Wales </a>currently thought to be either off work sick or self-isolating, and 22 prisoners showing symptoms, who have been isolated.</p> <p>Chantal Edge, of the UCL\u2019s department of epidemiology, added: \u201cWe are advocating that to save lives we need to cocoon our vulnerable population.\u201d</p> <p>Edge said many prisoners had more than one illness or disease, and this meant the death rate could be significantly steeper than in the wider population.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people in prison are from deprived backgrounds, have a history of drug use, and may have smoked things that are even more damaging to their lungs than tobacco.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Davies, programme director of the Institute for Government, warned that prisons also have an ageing population. The disease appears to affect older patients more severely, especially those over 70. \u201cThe number of prisoners aged 60 and over has grown dramatically \u2013 by two-thirds \u2013in the past decade. That group already has higher levels of illness.\u201d</p> <p>A ministry of justice spokesperson said: \u201cThe government\u2019s absolute priority is to protect life and we have robust and flexible plans in place keep prisoners, staff and visitors safe based on the latest advice from Public Health England.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 March 2020 to include a statement from the ministry of justice that was received after publication.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Failure to protect the most vulnerable inmates in the UK prison system from coronavirus could result in more than 800 avoidable deaths, experts have warned. Provisional estimates from epidemiologists at University College London suggest that uncontrolled outbreaks of infection could lead to the deaths of up to 1% of the prison population but that this could be substantially reduced if steps are taken to protect elderly prisoners and those with chronic illnesses. Prisons have been a flashpoint in many countries\u2019 battles against the virus, with several, including Spain, the US and Iran, ordering the release of many inmates to lessen the risk of transmission among detainees and jail staff. In Wuhan, the Chinese city where Covid-19 emerged three months ago, more than 800 prisoners were reportedly infected. Last Friday the prison population of England and Wales stood at 83,500, the highest in western Europe. So far, two people in UK prisons have tested positive for the virus, one at Strangeways in Manchester and another at HMP High Down, Surrey. This weekend David Gauke, a former justice secretary, called for the suspension of short sentences and the early release of some prisoners to avoid coronavirus spreading through prisons. \u201cThe advantage of not sending people inside for short sentences is that it reduces the churn,\u201d Gauke said. \u201cThat is really important. There is a lot of churn in prisons, with people coming in and out. That creates a risk. \u201cThere is a strong case for releasing some of those coming towards the end of their sentence a few months earlier. One should not overstate how significant that could be in reducing risks.\u201d The UK government\u2019s advice for prisons last Wednesday recommended \u201cprotective isolation\u201d for inmates displaying symptoms. However, this has been updated following discussions with Public Health England to introduce \u201crobust contingency plans\u201d. Andrew Hayward, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at UCL, said: \u201cIsolating suspected cases is important but because some people spread infection before they develop symptoms. Outbreaks can still start easily and spread rapidly through overcrowded prisons. \u201cMoving the most vulnerable prisoners to less-crowded parts of the prison system, where outbreaks are easier to prevent and contain, and reducing mixing with other prisoners could save many lives.\u201d Hayward, who is also on a government national advisory committee for tackling coronavirus, added: \u201cOne of my main concerns is that we\u2019ve not really got to grips with the likelihood of big outbreaks in institutional settings.\u201d Those fears follow the first indications of an outbreak at a UK prison with around 75 officers at HMP Berwyn in Wales currently thought to be either off work sick or self-isolating, and 22 prisoners showing symptoms, who have been isolated. Chantal Edge, of the UCL\u2019s department of epidemiology, added: \u201cWe are advocating that to save lives we need to cocoon our vulnerable population.\u201d Edge said many prisoners had more than one illness or disease, and this meant the death rate could be significantly steeper than in the wider population. \u201cA lot of people in prison are from deprived backgrounds, have a history of drug use, and may have smoked things that are even more damaging to their lungs than tobacco.\u201d Nick Davies, programme director of the Institute for Government, warned that prisons also have an ageing population. The disease appears to affect older patients more severely, especially those over 70. \u201cThe number of prisoners aged 60 and over has grown dramatically \u2013 by two-thirds \u2013in the past decade. That group already has higher levels of illness.\u201d A ministry of justice spokesperson said: \u201cThe government\u2019s absolute priority is to protect life and we have robust and flexible plans in place keep prisoners, staff and visitors safe based on the latest advice from Public Health England.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 21 March 2020 to include a statement from the ministry of justice that was received after publication.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a summary of the latest events: Trump dismisses report on early coronavirus warnings as \u2018inaccurate\u2019. The US president dismissed a Washington Post story that stated his administration was informed back in January that coronavirus was likely to become a pandemic, calling it a disgrace\u201d at today\u2019s coronavirus task force press briefing. Disaster declared in New York as fears grow over lack of ventilators. New York state governor Andrew Cuomo said the state is \u201cscouring the globe\u201d in search of medical supplies after the state has emerged as the center of the US coronavirus outbreak. White House economic response package could reach $2tn. Trump administrations officials are proposing a government financial response to the coronavirus crisis that could be worth as much as $2tn in an effort to stimulate the staggering US economy. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says lawmakers expect terms to be finalized late Saturday night and intends to hold a vote on Monday. New Hampshire\u2019s largest hospital is taking an intrepid approach toward the personal protective equipment shortage that has dominated the headlines in the early days of the coronavirus crisis. Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center is encouraging volunteers to sew face masks for patients, visitors and staff using pre-prepared kits with fabric and elastic for pickup. The hospital has set up a website that includes instructions on how to sew the mask using CDC guidelines. A hospital spokesperson says the masks will be sanitized and distributed throughout the Dartmouth-Hitchcock health system in New Hampshire and Vermont. Kristin Roth, the DHMC\u2019s director of volunteer services, says the response has been robust \u201cWe were being inundated with questions about: How can I help?\u201d she says. A devastating story out of New Orleans today could offer a corrective to the misconception that coronavirus only kills the old and immunocompromised. Natasha Ott, 39, felt the beginnings of a cold coming on 11 days ago. On Monday, she was tested for coronavirus and failing to shake symptoms consistent with the new strain. On Friday, she was found dead in her kitchen before the results were returned. Ott\u2019s partner says the dearth of available tests \u201cshows how ill-equipped New Orleans is to handle a pandemic that has already claimed 16 lives and infected nearly 600 people across the state\u201d. As the Senate scrambled to settle by Saturday night on the terms of a bipartisan agreement on a more than $1tn bill aimed at getting Americans through the coronavirus crisis, a feeding frenzy has broken out among lobbyists representing airlines, hotels, cruise lines, casinos and other powerful interests who want a taste of the action. Our Peter Stone checks in from Washington: The Republican bill provides passenger airlines and air cargo carriers up to $58bn in loans, while a mix of hotels, cruise ships, shopping malls and other sectors were given $150bn to help weather the economic downturn. Hours before the Republican measure was released, Trump said he expected the package would provide help for the airlines, cruise lines and \u201cprobably hotels\u201d. On Tuesday, Trump met with hotel industry executives who reportedly asked for $150bn in help and another $100bn for their suppliers. Watchdog groups are raising red flags about the $50bn loan package for America\u2019s big passenger airlines which in recent years have drawn growing consumer complaints, while spending tens of billions on stock buybacks. And the $150bn in the Republican bill for the well-connected hotel industry \u2013 which Trump\u2019s family business is heavily engaged in \u2013 and other industries have also generated criticism. \u201cAn emergency like this highlights the inequities of a system where well-connected industries can lobby directly for specific carve-outs and potentially cushion wealthy executives,\u201d said Robert Maguire, research director at the watchdog Crew. Here\u2019s our David Smith\u2019s report from the White House today on Donald Trump\u2019s response to the Washington Post report that he ignored early warnings from US intelligence agencies about the threat posed by the coronavirus outbreak in China. As the novel coronavirus makes its way into America\u2019s heartland, the Kansas City Star warns that many towns are woefully under-resourced for what\u2019s ahead. Eleven of Kansas\u2019 105 counties have no hospital at all, according to a data analysis published on Friday by Kaiser Health News. More than a third of the state\u2019s 114 counties are without one. Mankato is the county seat of Jewell County, which has the highest percentage of elderly residents in Kansas: Nearly 30 percent of its 2,850 residents are age 65 or older. The median age is 53, compared to 38 in Johnson County. Coronavirus affects the elderly particularly hard. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 80% of Americans who have died from Covid-19 have been age 65 or older. Though isolated from large urban areas \u2013 the nearest city of any size, Hastings, Nebraska (population about 25,000) is more than an hour\u2019s drive to the north \u2013 Jewell County residents are taking the threat seriously. Locals understand the challenge that they\u2019re facing. With 25 beds, Jewell County Hospital is preparing for the worst. But it will be hobbled in the fight. Only six of its 25 beds are available for treating acute patients at any one time. The rest are occupied by people in need of long-term care. There are no doctors on staff day to day. They both commute regularly from a town 30 minutes away. And there is only one ventilator, a recent cast-off from the emergency services agency that hospital staff are only now learning how to use. \u201cWe definitely have limited resources,\u201d nurse practitioner Dawn Steinman said. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to be very proactive.\u201d White House officials are proposing a government financial response to the coronavirus crisis that could be worth as much as $2tn in an effort to stimulate the staggering US economy. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have been working behind closed doors on the prospective Senate bill, which would coordinate with the US Federal Reserve to help individuals, small businesses and industries that have been devastated by the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re getting closer and closer to an agreement, and all the discussions have been in good faith,\u201d said Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who intends to hold a vote on Monday. \u201cI think we\u2019re clearly going to get there.\u201d The lawmakers have discussed a number of provisions for the bill, including the issuing for $1,000 checks to some Americans and more than $350bn in aid to small businesses through federally guaranteed loans. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about half the workers in America,\u201d Florida senator Marco Rubio said. \u201cWe\u2019d like to help even more people.\u201d The Federal Aviation Administration lifted a temporary halt of all flights to New York City airports due to coronavirus-related staffing issues after about 30 minutes. The directive, which initially warned it could last several hours, advised air traffic controllers to \u201cstop all departures\u201d to Kennedy, LaGuardia, Newark airports as well as Philadelphia International Airport, citing problems at the FAA enroute center in Ronkonkoma, New York. The air-traffic controllers at JFK have been working at an alternate location on the property this week after it was revealed an FAA technician assigned to the control tower tested positive for Covid-19. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the Javits Center on the west side of Manhattan is one of four venues under consideration as a potential site for an emergency \u201cfield hospital\u201d as the state frantically attempts to boost its hospital capacity from around 50,000 beds to 75,000. Cuomo said the state has already hospitalized 1,600 people and the massive 1.8m sq ft of convention space along the Hudson River could house 1,000 more beds. Other proposed sites include the State University of New York campuses at Stony Brook and Westbury on Long Island and the Westchester Convention Center. \u201cThat would give us a regional distribution and a real capacity if we can get them up quickly enough,\u201d Cuomo said. Trump jumps in on one final question before handing over to Pence and departing the briefing room: \u201cWe inherited an obsolete, broken system and when you hear the number of tests that we\u2019ll be providing, and are now, it\u2019s incredible,\u201d the president says. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of governors say the same thing. We took over an obsolete, broken testing system that wouldn\u2019t have worked for even a small problem, let alone one of the biggest pandemics in history, and what [the members of the coronavirus task force] have done is incredible.\u201d At today\u2019s briefing Trump claimed: \u201cIf you remember, I was the one who closed this country down. You don\u2019t write that, or you don\u2019t say it too much, certainly on CNN.\u201d Fact check: Trump played down the threat and did little beyond restricting travel from China. It was the NBA and other sporting organizations, theatres and theme parks, state governors and city mayors who took the lead on local measures. Many have complained about a lack of federal leadership. Trump is (finally) asked about the Washington Post intel story which reports that his administration was informed back in January that coronavirus was likely to become a pandemic. \u201cI saw the story,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it was a disgrace.\u201d He continues to say it was a \u201cvery inaccurate story\u201d, though declines to rebut any specific claims. Trump is asked how the one of the richest countries in the world could be facing such a shortfall of masks and other personal protective equipment. As he\u2019s done before, he points to inherited circumstances: \u201cMany administrations preceded me. For the most part, they did very little in terms of what you\u2019re talking about. This is unprecedented.\u201d He then adds his administration has gotten \u201ctremendous reviews\u201d for its response. While fielding questions from the press corps, Trump is asked what he would tell people who have lost their jobs during a week the US economy came to a standstill. \u201cKeep receiving their paychecks,\u201d he says. \u201cHopefully their companies are going to be in a very strong position. We want to keep everything together.\u201d Asked whether he\u2019s spoken to speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi about the proposed stimulus package, Trump declines but says he\u2019s spoken to a number of congressional leaders \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d. When asked about the uncertain supply of N95 masks, he defers to Fema administrator Peter Gaynor, who says: \u201cOn masks, we\u2019re trying to match supply and demand. There\u2019s a range of requests across the country and we\u2019ll try to match the supply and demand every day.\u201d New Jersey governor Phil Murphy has just announced a statewide stay-at-home order including the closure of all non-essential businesses during a briefing in the state capital. \u201cI don\u2019t take this action lightly but my goal is to make sure you can gather safely with family and friends later,\u201d he says. The order allows for certain exceptions for people to leave their homes, such as seeking medical attention, obtaining essential goods or services, reporting to work or visiting family. Dr Anthony Fauci speaks about the two dynamic forces at play: the natural course of the outbreak and the mitigation strategies that are being deployed. \u201cWe often get asked, how do you know you\u2019re having an effect?\u201d he says. \u201cI can tell you for sure: we know we are clearly having an effect, but we can\u2019t quantitate it for you accurately now.\u201d He adds: \u201cI think we\u2019re getting to a solution everyone in the country is looking for, but not every single person in the US needs to get tested.\u201d Pence confirms that an aide in his office tested positive for the novel coronavirus. \u201cThe White House doctor has indicated he has no reason to believe that I was exposed and no need to be tested,\u201d he says. \u201cGiven the unique position I have as vice president and as the leader of the White House coronavirus task force, both I and my wife will be tested for the coronavirus later this afternoon.\u201d He adds: \u201cNeither the president or I had direct contact\u201d with the staffer. Vice president Mike Pence, the coronavirus task force leader, says more than 195,000 people who have been symptomatic have been tested. That doesn\u2019t include county hospitals or health-care labs around the nation. He then notes that only 19,343 have returned positive tests for Covid-19. Trump opens the briefing recounting the actions he\u2019s taken this week, including the moving of tax day to 15 June and last night\u2019s major declaration of disaster in New York state. He says he believes Congress is \u201cvery close\u201d to a resolution on coronavirus legislation and is confident that leaders from both parties are acting in good faith. He urges Americans to \u201cstay at home and save lives\u201d, adding that it\u2019s time for \u201cshared national sacrifice\u201d. President Trump has taken the dais as the press briefing with the coronavirus gets under way. He\u2019s flanked by task force members including vice-president Mike Pence, Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Ben Carson. The president says the virus has spread to 148 countries: \u201cYou talk about a spread. You talk about a violent spread. ... Not even believable.\u201d The White House press briefing with members of the coronavirus task force has been pushed back again to 12.45pm local time. The update will come as Italy and Spain have both reported their biggest single-day death tolls from the outbreak. As Europe\u2019s governments ramp up already draconian restrictions to curb the coronavirus, authorities in Rome on Friday announced 5,986 new cases and a record 627 new deaths, raising the totals to 47,021 infections and 4,032 fatalities. In Spain, the death toll rose to 1,002, a highest-ever increase of 235 in 24 hours. The latest statistics showed 19,980 confirmed cases across the country, more than a third in Madrid. Army specialists are to help disinfect care homes after the virus claimed more than 50 lives at elderly care facilities across the region. USA Track and Field, the national governing body for athletics in the US, has joined the call to postpone the Tokyo Olympics amid the coronavirus outbreak, calling for the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee \u201cto use its voice and speak up for the athletes\u201d. On Friday, the head of USA Swimming urged the USOPC to push for a 12-month postponement of the Tokyo Games, signaling the first fissure between powerful American factions attempting to maneuver the US team through the mounting crisis. New York state governor Andrew Cuomo says the state is \u201cscouring the globe\u201d in search of medical supplies after the state has emerged as the center of the US coronavirus outbreak. The Trump administration issued a major disaster declaration for New York as infections spike across New York City to 5,000, roughly one-third of the total amount of cases nationwide. New York is preparing to ration its ventilators for sick coronavirus patients as a major disaster was declared in the city as it struggles to cope with the deadly outbreak. The disaster declaration comes as New York prepares guidance on how to deploy vital ventilators amid a widespread shortage of key equipment that also includes masks and surgical gloves, and medical supplies such as blood. The draft guidance on ventilators, prepared by a state taskforce in 2015 for a possible influenza pandemic, has reportedly been updated for the coronavirus crisis, according to the Wall Street Journal. According to Sam Gorovitz, a professor of philosophy at Syracuse University and member of the taskforce, the revisions to the ventilator allocation guidelines include the formation of designated triage committees to determine which critically ill patients will or will not receive life-supporting respiration. Gorovitz told the Journal that doctors will be required to make \u201ctragic\u201d decisions on \u201cwho will have access or for patients whose prospects are essentially hopeless, will be have to be removed to make room for somebody whose prospects are very much better\u201d. US intelligence reports indicated the severity of a potential coronavirus global pandemic in January and February, all the while the Trump administration was downplaying the potential effects of the virus, the Washington Post reported this morning. While the reports didn\u2019t specify exactly when the illness would have come to America nor did it have any recommendations for public health officials, the reports detailed how Chinese officials appeared to be downplaying the severity of the outbreak, the Post reports. Yet during that time, Donald Trump and his administration were largely minimizing the potential impacts of an outbreak. Trump during a rally in South Carolina in late February said that coronavirus was the Democrats\u2019 \u201cnew hoax\u201d meant to be a vehicle to criticize his administration. \u201cDonald Trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were \u2013 they just couldn\u2019t get him to do anything about it,\u201d one intelligence official told the Post. \u201cThe system was blinking red.\u201d Happy Saturday, live blog readers! The White House\u2019s coronavirus task force is set to give a press conference at noon today, though it\u2019s unclear if Donald Trump will be in attendance. The number of Covid-19 cases and related deaths are soaring in the US, closing in on 20,000 cases today and 260 deaths. At this point, one in five Americans from coast to coast have been told to stay at home in an effort to stop the rapid spread of the virus. Coupled with the spread of the virus is a crisis in the American healthcare systems, where the number of hospitals running out of necessary supplies likes masks and ventilators.",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of Britons stranded in Peru due to the coronavirus pandemic could be flown home early next week, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has said. More than 400 British and Irish citizens are believed to be in the Andean nation and have been unable to leave following a 15-day government lockdown imposed since Monday. But the FCO said on Saturday that the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, had secured permission for a UK-organised flight to leave Peru for \u201cearly next week\u201d following a call with his Peruvian counterpart. Raab tweeted: \u201cI had a good conversation this afternoon with my opposite number in Peru, Gustavo Meza-Cuadra. \u201cAmidst all the challenges of tackling coronavirus, we committed to working together in the coming days to enable UK nationals in Peru and Peruvian nationals in the UK to return home.\u201d Shortly before, the UK ambassador to Peru, Kate Harrisson, said in a Twitter post that the \u201cUK government is working to make flights available from next week for British people who wish to leave Peru\u201d. The intervention comes after an avalanche of criticism from marooned travellers on a dream trip to the Andes heritage site Machu Picchu. Almost 30,000 concerned parents, grandparents and family members had signed a petition begging for the UK to organise rescue flights to airlift more than 400 Britons stranded in the south American country. \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see if the flight turns up,\u201d said Sheila Johnston, 67, who was in a hostel in the Peruvian capital Lima. She and other tourists received a letter from the FCO on Saturday informing them of the possibility and asking for a \u00a3250 (GBP) contribution. \u201cIt\u2019s not very much compared to the exorbitant amounts demanded for the other flights,\u201d she added. Many had complained about the lack of clear communication about plans by the British embassy in Lima with fury on Thursday over a message advising Britons of a Colombian airline Avianca flight leaving this weekend costing \u00a33,000 per person. Fred Fransis, 71, a traveller with a heart condition who was stuck in Cusco, welcomed the news, but said he and other tourists had been \u201cunder house arrest for 10 days\u201d and had lost money from trip cancellations and missed flights. \u201cIf the Foreign Office was as organised as our pressure group, we\u2019d all have been home a long time ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are happy about this development,\u201d said Luke Martin, also grounded in Cusco, but stressed that it was still \u201ctentative as all other options haven\u2019t materialised so far\u201d. Alarm had been growing in Peru among British nationals on Saturday after reports in local media that the airports would be closing on Sunday. \u201cThe situation appears to be escalating in Peru as stricter travel restrictions were announced today,\u201d said Marcus Edgar, a PR consultant working in Huanchaco. Anwen Greenaway, from Oxford said: \u201cThe government squandered their window of opportunity with inaction.\u201d On Friday, it emerged that Air France was also putting on flights to Paris, but priority was given to those already booked with the French airline, and passengers complained that they were being quoted \u00a34,000 for a ticket. On Saturday the UK embassy tweeted that Iberia was flying, but it could not guarantee onward flights from Madrid to the UK. Duncan Sharples, from Nottinghamshire, whose 22-year-old son is in the Andean city of Cusco with four friends, has been infuriated with what he says is a lack of clear information to the British stranded in Peru. \u201cThe British embassy in Peru seems to be acting like a poor man\u2019s travel agent. They are putting out messages saying, \u2018Here\u2019s a rescue flight to Paris, or Madrid\u2019, but they can\u2019t guarantee connecting flights to the UK.\u201d He said it was \u201cwonderful\u201d that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was offering to pay people forced out of work by the virus \u00a32,500 a month, but said they should subsidise rescue flights too. \u201cIf they said, \u2018We will subsidise everyone \u00a32,500,\u2019 it would work, because I\u2019m sure people could somehow drum up \u00a31,000, but not \u00a33,000 or \u00a34,000,\u201d he said. Rebecca Aldridge contacted the Guardian to say: \u201cMany other nationalities have been and are being repatriated whilst we despair at the lack of response from our government. We are 400-plus in Peru, lots with medical difficulties, some with children, the youngest being 12 months old, and we feel totally stranded for a very uncertain period of time.\u201d Some on a WhatsApp group have spoken of heart conditions and asthma, and one mother told of her 12-month-old baby being hospitalised on her trip with pneumonia. Caia Daly, 37, flew to Lima with her husband, Carlos Abisrror, who is originally from Peru, and two young children, one of them 12 months old, in February for a four-week holiday and to see family. Daly, who is originally from Dublin, said: \u201cIf things get really bad here, I\u2019m worried for my children\u2019s health.\u201d The official Twitter account of Hugh Bonneville, the actor who starred in the last two films about Paddington Bear, the fictional children\u2019s character from \u201cdarkest Peru\u201d, voiced support for the stranded Britons, saying \u201cPaddington Bear has everything crossed for a swift resolution.\u201d",
